"(CNN)At least 23 people have died this week in the United States due to winter weather, CNN has confirmed. A majority of the deaths --18 -- occurred in Tennessee. Three of those people died in a fire in Knox County, Tennessee emergency management officials said. Family members said a man, woman and their adult son died in the fire, according to CNN affiliate WATE. Firefighters said they had difficulty reaching them because the second level of the house collapsed onto the lower level, WATE reported. Other people in Tennessee died from hypothermia and in auto accidents, WATE said, and a dialysis patient died after he was unable to get treatment because of weather. More than 2,700 people are without power as more severe cold, freezing rain and snow are predicted for the next few days, Tennessee officials said. Dangerously cold conditions continue to grip a large part of the Eastern United States, CNN meteorologists said, with more than 125 million Americans under a wind chill warning or advisory. Wind chills will go as low as 40 below zero in some places. Snow, sleet, and freezing rain will spread over the mid-South and into the mid-Atlantic over the next couple of days. Ice storm warnings are in effect for Nashville, where heavy ice accumulation could again cause widespread power outages. Winter storm warnings again cover much of Kentucky, which saw as much as 15 inches from the last storm. More heavy snow is predicted for Louisville and Cincinnati. The storm will spread up the East Coast this weekend. CNN's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","18 people died in Tennessee, emergency management officials say .

"(CNN)Seventy years ago, on February 23, two American flags were planted on the peak of Mount Suribachi, located on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima. Coming five days into one of the most ferocious battles of World War II, the first flag-raising, by a group of United States Marines, was emotional, and a Marine photographer captured it. But a U.S. commander thought the flag was too small to be seen at a distance. And so, a few hours later, five more Marines and one Navy medical corpsman carried out orders to haul a much larger flag up to the top. Again photos were shot, along with a film. No one thought to record this bit of everyday war business in the daily log. How did this second flag-raising, and not the other, come to stand not only for the heroism shown during the Battle of Iwo Jima, but the core values of the Marines, and indeed of all American combatants in World War II? The answer is found in the power of certain images, in this case a photograph taken by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal, to capture a moment but also transcend it. It might be hard today to comprehend how a single image can become iconic, exposed as we are to streams of photographs and videos every day from our news and social media feeds. But Rosenthal's image resonated with all who saw it and was swiftly reproduced on U.S. government stamps and posters, in sandstone (on Iwo Jima, by the Seabee Waldron T. Rich) and most famously in bronze, as the Marine Corps War Memorial in Washington. The photograph won a Pulitzer Prize in 1945 and is considered one of the most famous images of all time. News: The inside story of the famous Iwo Jima photo . Why this photograph, and not the one of the arguably more meaningful first flag placement, which was taken by Staff Sgt. Louis R. Lowery? Its dynamic and masterful composition is part of the secret. The flag structures the picture, its diagonal back-leaning position contrasting with the forward motion of the soldiers. They seem to rise out of the ash and other detritus of the battlefield, and there is already something sculptural in their massed bodies, in their muscular legs and arms that strain to hoist up the heavy pole. The leg of the lead bearer crosses the flagpole, adding a further sense of solidity. There is something deeply reassuring about this photograph in its display of strength and teamwork -- even the last man, who can no longer touch the flagpole, ""has the back"" of his comrades -- and its communication of a push forward to victory. The fact we cannot see their faces also works to lift the image out of its original context, lending it a universal quality. In Lowery's photograph, instead, the eye goes to the face of the wary sentinel, who guards the men who have almost completed their installation. The flag flies free and proud, and all of the soldiers are engaged intently in their task, but they are scattered around the frame. There is no one visual ""sweet spot"" in this image; it would certainly be harder to reproduce as sculpture. The gun pointed outward reminds the viewer that this is a very dangerous mission. This photo does not reassure us, but rather makes us watchful. Ironically, this picture of a historic moment of planting an American flag on Japanese soil conveys the everyday jobs of war -- guarding, standing around -- while Rosenthal's, of a routine flag substitution, communicates an exceptional and heroic moment. In truth, both images are necessary to convey the experience of Iwo Jima, which stands today as a notable case of daring strategies of amphibious assault (U.S.) and static defense (Japanese), examples of tenacity and teamwork, as well as failures of intelligence and devastating losses (on both sides). What made Iwo Jima such a terrible battleground, even within the context of the many tough campaigns of the Pacific Theater? Its primary strategic importance for the United States was as an airbase and staging area for assaults on Tokyo, while the 8.5-square-mile island took on symbolic as well as strategic meaning for the Japanese as the first national soil to face foreign invasion. The violence of this battle reflected the high motivation of most combatants, but also the particular circumstances of the island. Under the leadership of Lt. Gen. Tadamichi Kuribayashi, the Japanese prepared an extraordinary underground network of tunnels and caves in the semisoft sandstone, from which they would wage their war. When the Americans landed, Kuribayashi allowed them to advance onto the beach, then opened fire; then, as the Japanese were firebombed out of their hiding places, the beach and environs became a dense killing field,, with hand-to-hand combat not uncommon. The intensity of battle on Iwo Jima epitomized what author John Dower called ""the kill or be killed nature of combat in the Pacific."" For over a month, both sides endured, and saw, terrible things hourly, and yet their resolve only strengthened. The Japanese endured inhuman conditions underground, without food, water, and medical supplies, and their no-surrender policy created more unburied corpses in the tunnels as the war went on. The Americans endured their own hell above ground, and the chaos of combat in a constrained space made friendly fire casualties higher than usual. Of approximately 20,000 Japanese soldiers, only about 2,000 survived the battle, while the Americans had over 20,000 casualties and 7,000 dead out of a total mobilized force of 70,000. Iwo Jima took an especially large toll on the Marines. One-third of the 19,000 who died during World War II perished on the island. It is the very brutality of Iwo Jima that made Rosenthal's polished photograph so necessary and appealing. There is something Olympian about the image on top of the mountain, as opposed to the Japanese in their caves and the Americans their targets on the beach. The subsequent death of three of the flag-raisers in battle only made the photo more compelling as a representation of heroism on the island and as an abstract homage to camaraderie, strength, and determination in battle in general. It is this perfection that contributed to the unfounded suspicion that Rosenthal's picture had been staged, and a campaign to restore Lowery's photo and the first flag-raisers to greater prominence. By then, the picture had been enshrined in the image bank relating to Iwo Jima and had taken on a life of its own, reproduced in sand, ice, and even Legos. On this anniversary, we might remember both photos, for together they remind us that war is also waged, and won, in the small moments of mundane labor, in obscure airstrips and staging areas as well as major battlegrounds, and in the steady gaze and aim of the single sentinel. The two flags of Iwo Jima offer a lesson for today about the power of the media to shape our notions of what, and who, deserves to be remembered about war.","Photos were taken of two flag-raisings on Iwo Jima .

"(CNN) -- Academy-Award winning actress Patricia Neal, whose off-screen life was one of dramatic triumph over adversity, died Sunday at her home in Edgartown, Massachusetts. She was 84. Neal died of complications from lung cancer, according to the Patricia Neal Rehabilitation Center. ""The theatre and movie world has lost a great talent but, at the Patricia Neal Rehabilitation Center, we have also lost a friend,"" said a statement from the Knoxville, Tennessee, center that bears the actress' name and assists people in recovering from strokes and brain injuries. Neal suffered several strokes and kept acting. Neal is best known for her role as Alma in ""Hud,"" where she played a housekeeper who did not fall for cowboy Paul Newman's charms. She won an Academy Award for the role. Soon after her Oscar win, Neal suffered back-to-back strokes -- three in all. For a while, she lost her ability to speak and walk. But she returned to the screen -- and to another Oscar nomination -- for the movie ""The Subject Was Roses."" ""Ms. Neal took great joy in meeting patients and their caregivers every time she visited Knoxville,"" said a statement from the Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center where the Neal rehabilitation center is located. ""We will always remember her elegance and sincerity. She will be greatly missed."" Neal also won a Golden Globe award for her performance as Olivia Walton in 1971's ""The Homecoming: A Christmas Story,"" the television movie that served as the pilot episode for the TV series ""The Waltons."" Concerns over Neal's health and her ability to handle the difficulties of a weekly television series led the producers to offer the role to Michael Learned when the show when into production.","NEW: Neal died of complications from lung cancer .

"(CNN)For much of the U.S., stepping into a walk-in freezer will be a lot more comfortable than going outside. From Minnesota to Texas, another blast of frigid weather is walloping the country. Here's what to expect: . Wind chills will plunge to about  minus 40 Sunday in parts of North Dakota and Minnesota as another Arctic blast barrels through, CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam said. As the work week starts, other cities will endure the mind-numbing freeze. Chicago's wind chill will be 20 below zero on Monday. And on Tuesday morning, Boston will suffer a wind chill of  minus 20, while New York and Philadelphia will grapple with wind chills of  minus 4. You know it's bad when parts of Texas will be covered with ice. Up to 2 inches of sleet will fall in the Dallas-Fort Worth area Sunday and Monday, the National Weather Service office in Fort Worth said. In Kentucky, the massive weight of snow on the roof of a Walmart may have been enough to crack the walls. The store in South Williamson was evacuated and closed indefinitely after store employees detected the cracks, apparently caused by the load of snow on the roof, Walmart spokeswoman Tricia Moriarty said Saturday. And the roof slid off the top of a home in Concord, New Hampshire, CNN affiliate WMUR reported, leaving nothing to protect the family from relentless snow. It's not clear exactly what caused the roof to slide off, WMUR said, but state officials are warning about the dangers of roof collapses amid heavy snowfall. At least 26 people have already died from weather-related incidents in the U.S. and Canada over the past week. The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency reported 21 deaths, including 11 from hypothermia and several from vehicle accidents. A dialysis patient who was unable to get treatment also died. In Boston, a man died after suffering a heart attack while shoveling snow, Mayor Martin Walsh said. In North Carolina, a 19-year-old woman died in a weather-related traffic crash, the governor said. In New Hampshire, a woman died apparently from exposure to the cold in an area known for hiking , state officials said. And in Toronto, police said 3-year-old Elijah Marsh died after wandering out of an apartment on his own wearing only a T-shirt and boots. Thousands of air travelers will be grounded across the country Sunday. More than 600 flights into, out of or within the U.S. have been canceled, according to flightaware.com. Airports in Denver, Philadelphia and New York are the most affected. While the Northeast will stay frigid the next few days, the snow and freezing rain will ease up by midday Monday. And the massive snowfall in the Denver area could be a boon for outdoor athletes, CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera said.

"(CNN)At least 49 people, including 10 children and five women, were killed this week by Syrian government forces in a village north of Aleppo, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Saturday. The opposition monitoring group said the deaths in the village of Retian on Tuesday included 13 rebels with their families -- most killed in their homes without resistance. The forces were identified by the group as fighters backed by Hezbollah and non-Syrian fighters. In addition, at least four people  -- including two women and two soldiers -- were killed and others injured in an explosion in the city of al-Qardaha in Lattakia province, the birthplace of President Bashar al-Assad, the London-based monitoring group said Saturday. Syrian state television reported the blast was caused by a car bomb in the parking lot of al-Qardaha hospital. The explosion was the first in al-Assad's hometown in the four-year conflict. The monitoring group said Saturday that it documented more than 30,000 civilians deaths and injuries in the past year. The Observatory has demanded that all parties in the conflict refrain from attacking civilian and densely-populated areas. The Observatory said it has documented the deaths of 5,812 civilians, including 1,733 children and 969 women, during aerial and barrel bomb assaults. Activists have blamed government forces for most of the aerial assaults and casualties. The activist group also said 1,102 civilians, including 234 children and 133 women, were killed from mortar and tank shells, rockets, explosive propane gas cylinders and cannon shells launched by the Nusra Front, Jund al- Aqsa Organization, rebel and Islamic fighters in several Syrian provinces. The Observatory said it is seeking the involvement of the United Nations Security Council and requesting a U.N. resolution that would allow for war crimes and other international criminal court charges in connection with the civilian deaths. Syria's civil war has been raging since 2011, when a government crackdown on protests in the city of Daraa spiraled into a full-blown armed conflict. Few areas have been spared by gunfire, bombing, airstrikes, even reported chemical attacks. The violence comes not just from troops loyal to al-Assad -- who has been criticized and isolated by much of the world -- but a number of rebel groups, some of them considered moderates and others extremists, such as the al Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front, and ISIS. The impact on civilians has been horrific. Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, reported in January that some 220,000 people had been killed and 1 million wounded. Some 7.6 million have been displaced because of the fighting, with the return of polio, typhoid and measles to Syria symptomatic of the health crisis there. The war has also produced 3.3 million refugees, most of whom ended up in camps in Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan.

"Washington (CNN)Want the state of 2016 play in New Hampshire? The Chris Christie comeback strategy? How the White House will handle the Netanyahu visit? Take our Sunday trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table: . It's no secret the White House is miffed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted an invitation to address Congress and make his case about the Iranian nuclear negotiations. Less clear, though, is how the White House will react -- or not -- during the Prime Minister's stay in Washington next month. Julie Pace of The Associated Press took us inside the West Wing deliberations: . ""On the one hand, they don't want to just cede this space to Netanyahu. He's got the speech to Congress and a big speech to AIPAC,"" said Pace, referring to the American Israel Political Action Committee. ""On the other hand, they don't want to get into this public tit and tat, where you've got Netanyahu speaking and Obama responding."" So basically expect the cold shoulder approach, explained Pace. ""No meetings with Netanyahu, no big speeches by the President,"" she added. ""But there is certainly some pressure from certain corners of this administration to be more aggressive, be more vocal (and) don't just sit back."" Hillary Clinton has kept a very low profile so far this year, by design. She has no serious competition as yet for the Democratic presidential nomination and has been out of the public eye working on her team and strategy. She's been so quiet, in fact, that Republicans almost daily complain she is hiding and ducking big public policy debates. Well, hiding isn't going to work in the week ahead. Lisa Lerer of Bloomberg Politics offered her reporting on an upcoming series of Clinton events: . ""In 2008, Hillary Clinton ran on her resume and her experience, not this idea of her being the first woman president,"" explained Lerer, adding that the result of that strategy ended up with Obama becoming the candidate of hope and change and Clinton becoming the candidate of the past. But according to Lerer, Clinton's advisers have resolved to do it differently this time, starting with a preview of that new message on Tuesday, when she will address a conference of women in technology. ""I think it will be fascinating to watch how she talks about gender, leadership and family issues that have become a major tenet of the Democratic Party -- and it will certainly give us a preview of campaign themes to come."" Dan Balz of The Washington Post was in New Hampshire last week to accept the first David Broder Award from the Rudman Center at the University of New Hampshire. David and Dan were friends and colleagues -- and there is no one more deserving of the award honoring the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and columnist who died in 2011. And, of course, in true Broder-Balz style, Dan took advantage of the trip to do some reporting on the current state of 2016 play in the first-in-the-nation primary state: . "" I don't think we've ever seen a race in New Hampshire as wide open as this,"" Balz said enthusiastically. ""Somebody said you can throw a blanket over this field and they're all below 16 or 17%,"" he added, referring to potential GOP presidential candidates. ""No frontrunner. Wide open. A wild race ahead."" This was not a good week for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in national political circles or newspapers. Much of the buzz was about how Christie was being outhustled by potential rivals Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, and both The Washington Post and The New York Times ran front-page stories on Friday suggesting the New Jersey governor was having a hard time gearing up for a 2016 presidential run. (The Post story was written by ""Inside Politics"" regular Robert Costa.) It is worth noting that the buzz in New Hampshire was more favorable; several sources there told me Christie's recent trip there was well received. But the national conversation isn't so great, and Costa reports that Team Christie believes the best way to change the conversation and get back on offense is for the governor to go back to his day job and make an impression. ""He has a big budget speech in Trenton on Tuesday.  And then he's going to try to go on a town hall, his first since last year, and really get back to the extemporaneous Christie, the gregarious Christie that made him such a popular figure within the Republican Party,"" said Costa. Most of those exploring running for president need to make the official decision in the next month or three -- and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida has one of the more interesting calculations to make. First there is the Jeb factor: Former Gov. Jeb Bush is the more senior Republican player from the state they both call home, and some Rubio allies worry that Bush will be able to soak up most of the fund-raising take available in the state. And then there is the current Scott Walker boomlet. The Wisconsin governor is up in the polls of late and occupying the space in the race that Rubio covets -- the next-generation candidate who is acceptable to the GOP's tea party base AND its more corporate establishment. So yea or nay for Rubio? He is visiting the first four nominating-contest states this month to assess things firsthand. And he continues to add to his fund-raising and political teams so that he is prepared to run if he ultimately decides to take the plunge. Will he? One adviser involved in the deliberations put the odds at ""60-40 in favor of running."" Rubio has said he will decide by the spring. Because the other candidates are so active, there is some internal pressure to make his intentions clear soon -- perhaps by the end of March.","Netanyahu plans trip to Washington, but questions linger over whether Obama will meet with him .

"(CNN)The danger in Syria has gotten so bad that even ancient remains -- and the Turkish soldiers who guard them -- had to be removed. About 40 Turkish soldiers watching over the Tomb of Suleyman Shah in northern Syria have been evacuated amid the continuing security crisis, Turkish officials said. ""The ongoing conflict and state of chaos in Syria posed serious risks to safety and security of the tomb, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement. One soldier was killed in an accident, a Turkish government official said. No other details were released. The tomb is 37 kilometers (23 miles) from Turkey, near the Euphrates River. Even though the tomb is in Syria, it is considered a Turkish exclave. Shah, the grandfather of the founder of the Ottoman Empire, reportedly died near the Euphrates River in the 13 century. As part of the Treaty of Ankara in 1921, Turkey was allowed to keep the tomb in Syria, raise a Turkish flag over it and place guards at the white marble mausoleum. Last March, when ISIS began to take villages and towns surrounding the tomb, Turkey deployed special forces soldiers to guard it. But on Saturday night, even they had to leave -- along with Shah's coffin. The tomb and the sarcophagus were temporarily moved to a new site within Syria close to the Turkish borders, the Foreign Ministry said. It said the new site has the same acreage as the previous one. ""The temporary relocation of the tomb, conducted on the basis of security assessments, does not constitute any change on the status of the tomb and its annex stated by the agreements,"" it said.","The 700-year-old remains of Suleyman Shah are moved from a tomb in northern Syria .

""Now I'm going to get the training I need to be a certified therapy dog so I can visit more kids in schools and hospitals, and even the elderly in the nursing homes,"" reads a post on his Facebook page.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)Hundreds of thousands of supporters of Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi filled the streets of seven Yemeni provinces on Sunday, one day after Hadi escaped house arrest in the capital, Sanaa. Hadi had been under house arrest for a month after he resigned under pressure from Houthi rebels. But he escaped and released a statement saying he is still president, calling all political decisions made since September illegal and invalid. A nephew of the president was kidnapped Sunday by Houthi rebels, two security officials in Ibb province told CNN. The nephew, Nasser Ahmed Mansour Hadi, was heading to the seaport province of Aden, where the President fled after escaping from house arrest in the capital, Sanaa. Protesters called for Hadi to stand against the Houthi coup. Sanaa saw the largest demonstrations urging Hadi to end militant occupation of Sanaa. ""The Houthis thought they could not be stopped, and it only took hours for them to fall in the eyes of the people. Yemen has a president and the people will stand with him to uproot the Houthi militants from Sanaa,"" Ali Al-Saedi, a protest organizer in Sanaa, told CNN. In Taiz, tens of thousands took to the streets to show support for the legitimacy of the president and condemn the continued Houthi takeover of the capital. They carried placards reading ""Out to militant rule, return of government institutions."" Last month, Houthis attacked the presidential palace and ministerial Cabinet, forcing both the president and prime minister to resign. Houthi militants then put Hadi under house arrest. Since then, Houthis have failed to form a government or reach a deal with other political factions for the formation of a presidential council. The militants tightened their grip on power over the last month, but the House of Representatives has not met to accept Hadi's resignation. Hours after Hadi fled Sanaa on Saturday, Houthi officials tried to force parliamentarians to meet immediately to accept his resignation, but their efforts failed. The ruling General People's Congress party, headed by Yemen's former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, which holds a majority of seats in parliament, said it will not push for a parliament vote to accept the resignation of Hadi. ""Hadi is the President of Yemen, since his resignation has yet to officially reach parliament. Yemen is still led by a constitutional elected president,"" said Abdul Aziz Jubari, the secretary general of the independent Justice and Building Party. Houthis are Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni Muslim country. They had been at war with the central government for more than a decade, but their entry into Sanaa in September brought things to a head, sparking battles that left than 300 people dead before a ceasefire was agreed to that month. Houthis then pressured Hadi to step down last month after he refused to agree to certain political demands. The Houthis' takeover of Sanaa stunned governments of Western nations, which pulled out diplomatic staff this month. As part of an investigation into Hadi's escape, Houthis on Saturday arrested dozens of their own security personnel who were responsible for watching him, a senior Houthi official said. Houthis arrested two people connected to Hadi -- his media secretary Yahya Al Arassi and his private physician -- after his escape, one of Hadi's advisers said. A senior official with a Sunni political party opposed to the Houthi takeover said that he backs Hadi's claim to the presidency. ""Hadi's withdrawal (of his resignation) would save the country and end the Houthi oppression of the Yemeni people,"" said Mohammed Al-Sabri, senior official of the Nasserite party. There already had been resistance to the Houthis' attempted takeover of national government institutions from different groups in Yemen, particularly in the South, where there's a long-running secessionist movement. Also opposed to the Houthis is the Sunni terror group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which exerts influence over many rural areas across the country. AQAP vowed to attack Houthi loyalists nationwide last year. Yemen's political turmoil could have an impact on the United States' fight against AQAP. The United States has long had a relationship with Yemen's leaders, working with them to target AQAP militants. It's not clear what the Houthis' takeover of Sanaa means for U.S. anti-terrorism efforts, but the drone program there still appears to be active. A U.S. drone strike killed senior AQAP cleric Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhari and three other people in Shabwa province on January 31. CNN's Jason Hanna, Ed Payne, Ben Brumfield and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","President's nephew kidnapped by Houthi rebels, officials say .

"(CNN)Julianne Moore won an Academy Award for her heart-wrenching performance in ""Still Alice,"" in which she plays a linguistics professor with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Much has been written about her characterization of a woman struggling with the disease. But there's another reason the performance hits home for millions of Americans, whether they are grappling with Alzheimer's or not. The late Richard Glatzer, who co-directed the film with Wash Westmoreland, named it: ""Still Alice,"" he said, is actually a film about ""the real unsung heroes: caregivers."" As the audience journeys with Alice and her family from diagnosis to acceptance and adaptation, we watch her husband and three children struggle to make sense of the changes in Alice. They each adjust in their own way, testing and transforming elements of their relationships. And we see what happens when care becomes -- or doesn't become -- a central feature of these relationships. The changes in these relationships -- between husband and wife, and mother and child -- yield some of the most provocative, brutal and poignant moments of the film. The caregiving relationship is never simple, but the ""presence of being"" it requires always offers an opportunity for raw honesty and transformation -- both for the individuals involved and the relationship itself. And, in the film, family members grow to become a crucial, if imperfect, circle of care. This story is familiar to more and more Americans, young and old. Like so many families, Alice's did not have a plan to address such an unexpected diagnosis and must scramble to create makeshift solutions while navigating their own in-the-moment reactions. I recognize their confusion and pain all too well. After my grandfather's vision deteriorated and his health failed in other ways, my father was unable to find him appropriate home-care support. He had to place him in a nearby nursing home, against my grandfather's wishes. There he slept in a dark room with half a dozen other people, some completely still, others wailing with pain and suffering. It smelled of mold and illness. He didn't sleep or eat for days, and passed away just three months later. Even now, the memory of my visits with him sends a chill down my spine. In my new book, ""The Age of Dignity,"" I explore the experiences of my family, families like Alice's, and the millions of people across our nation who are called to care for loved ones in response to chronic illnesses, disabilities or the natural effects of aging. Most families don't have a care plan in place, and more importantly, we as a nation don't have a plan either.  As a result, so many of us are struggling: we are overwhelmed family caregivers, we often cannot afford the long-term care option we need -- if we can even find it -- let alone enjoy the time we have together. And we feel alone in this struggle. But we are not. In reality, 4 in 10 adults in America now care for loved ones, and by 2050, 27 million Americans will need long-term care or assistance, many as a result of a demographic shift I call ""the elder boom."" As the baby boom generation ages, and health-care and scientific advances extend our life expectancy by nearly 20 years, the very nature of growing older is shifting. And polls show that more than 90% of older Americans want to live out their elder years at home. The key to addressing this cultural shift is to bravely confront, embrace and place a new value on the caregiving relationship. Family caregivers such as  Alice's family members and professional caregivers like Elena, who joins Alice's care circle later in the film, are critical to our ability to live and age the way we desire, connected to our families and communities until the end. In his moving 2013 commencement speech to Syracuse University graduates, author George Saunders reflected on the evolution of the human experience. ""Your 'self' will diminish and you will grow in love,"" Saunders said. ""You will gradually be replaced by Love."" With subtlety and realistic grace, the characters of ""Still Alice"" reveal how the caregiving relationship, while never easy, enhances and amplifies this universally attainable goal. And that in the end, we should all strive to be replaced by love, and surrounded by care.","Ai-jen Poo: ""Still Alice"" shows a scenario familiar to many Americans: An ailing family member and no plan for care .

"(CNN) -- A month after the Sewol ferry sank, leaving 284 people dead and 20 missing, the incident set off a bout of national soul searching in South Korea over what went wrong. Much of the blame has fallen on the ferry's crew, who scrambled to safety while the passengers were told repeatedly to stay put. Four of them have been charged with murder, prosecutors told CNN Thursday. The company's CEO has also been charged with ""causing death by negligence, as well as causing the capsizing of the ship in the line of duty."" Beyond the ferry's owners and crew, the sinking has spurred a debate about governmental oversight and what preventive measures could've been taken. The South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, said in a speech on April 21: ""This accident is highlighting many problems. First, the ship's introduction (how it came into the country), inspections, operational permits must be examined."" The reckoning over the accident has been a bitter one. Here is a look at some of the suspected factors behind the tragedy: . 1. South Korean investigators: Sewol was overloaded . The passenger ferry was carrying more than double the ship's limit when it capsized, according to South Korean investigators. Since Chonghaejin Marine Company started the Incheon to Jeju route in March 2013, 57% of its trips carried excess cargo (139 times out of 241 trips), according to the prosecutors. The company profited from overloading the ferry, earning an extra profit of $2.9 million since March 2013, investigators say. Too much cargo contributed to sinking, police say . 2. Prosecutors: Cargo on the ferry was not properly secured . Investigators have been probing the possibility the ship overturned because of a sharp turn that may have shifted the cargo, knocking the vessel off balance. Witnesses have described how several containers fell over and made booming sounds as they tumbled off balance. Loosely tied goods contributed to the Sewol's sinking, because the cargo hadn't been tied properly, senior prosecutor Yang Joong-jin said earlier this month. ""The lashing devices that should have held cargo goods steady were loose, and some of the crew members did not even know"" how to use them correctly, Yang said. 3. Crew insisted passengers stay put . ""Please do not move from your location,"" the ferry's loudspeakers blared at those on board. ""Absolutely do not move."" This type of warning was heard repeatedly as the Sewol began its descent into the water. Hundreds of passengers, unable to tell what was happening, complied. The instruction to remain in place, instead of getting on lifeboats, has been described as ""terribly, tragically wrong,"" by one CNN analyst. It's unclear why the crew made this determination, which remains one of the most haunting and perplexing questions surrounding the incident. A transcript of the communication between Sewol and the local authority shows that the decision was made fairly early. At 9:00 a.m., the Jeju Vessel Traffic Services Center told an unidentified crew member: ""Please put on the life vests and get ready as people may have to abandon ship."" The Sewol crew member immediately replied: ""It is hard for people to move."" During communications with the local traffic services center that lasted until 9:38 a.m., the unidentified crew member repeatedly asserted that passengers could not reach life rafts or rescue boats because ""they can't move... the vessel has listed.""(From transcript) 4. The captain abandoned ship, while passengers were told not to move. Capt. Lee Joon-seok of the Sewol has come under heavy criticism for abandoning the ship while hundreds of passengers remained on board. Pictures of the captain in what looks like his underwear hopping into the arms of the rescuer infuriated the nation. President Park Geun-hye described the crew's actions as being ""like murder."" Lee is now facing murder charges. He initially defended the decision saying that he had everyone ""stand by and wait for the rescue boat to arrive."" ""The tidal current was strong and water temperature was cold, and there was no rescue boat,"" he told reporters last month. ""So I had everyone stand by and wait for the rescue boat to arrive."" 5. Inexperienced crew member steered the ship. Authorities have questioned why an inexperienced third mate was guiding the ship at the time of the accident. That third mate is also facing charges of not abiding by emergency safety law, negligence which led to the ship sinking and causing injuries leading to deaths. The captain was not at helm at the time of the accident. There is no law requiring the captain to be on the bridge when the third mate is steering, but that an inexperienced member of the crew was navigating in one of the most treacherous stretches of the trip has raised questions. The third mate denied making a sharp turn a few days after the accident and said, ""The steering turned much more than usual. There are aspects where I made mistakes but for some reason the steering turned so much faster than usual."" 6. Delays on notifying proper authorities of the accident . The first distress call came not from the ship's crew, but instead from a boy on board who used a cell phone to contact emergency services at 8:52 a.m. His call to emergency services gave rescuers a few extra minutes to get to the stricken Sewol as it is listed dangerously before capsizing. Three minutes later, the ship's crew made a distress to authorities in Jeju -- which was the ship's destination rather than near its accident site. The miscommunication may have caused delays. 7. Ship's modifications raise questions . The Sewol had been renovated in 2013 to expand the top floor to make room for more passengers. The 20-year-old ship was originally used in Japan, until Chonghaejin Marine Co. purchased the ferry in 2012 and refurbished it. Chonghaejin added extra passenger cabins on the third, fourth and fifth decks, raising passenger capacity and altering the weight and balance of the vessel. Investigators want to know if the renovations may have made the ferry more likely to capsize or raised the ship's center of gravity. The South Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries announced in late April that it would ask lawmakers to consider legislation prohibiting modifications to ships to increase passenger capacity. The government plans to take away the company's licenses for all its routes, including the one on which the Sewol sank, according to an official at the ministry. CNN's Kyung Lah, KJ Kwon, Judy Kwon, Paula Hancocks, Jung-eun Kim, Frances Cha and Stella Kim contributed to this report.","284 have died on Sewol ferry, since accident on April 16, a month ago .

"(CNN)It's clearly a chilling message. But after a video from terror group Al-Shabaab calling for attacks on shopping malls in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, how worried should shoppers be? Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told CNN Sunday that there's ""no credible or specific evidence"" suggesting a U.S. mall attack is in the works. But he warned Americans to watch out. ""If anyone is planning to go to the Mall of America today,"" he said, ""they've got to be particularly careful."" The Minnesota mall is among those mentioned in the video the Somalia-based terror group apparently posted on Saturday. The video talks about Al-Shabaab's September 2013 attack at an upscale mall in Nairobi, Kenya, calling for similar attacks in the three Western countries. More than 60 people were killed in the Kenyan mall siege, which lasted four days. CNN is only naming the malls that have responded publicly to the terror group's video threat. Mall of America said it's aware that the video lists it as a potential target. ""We take any potential threat seriously and respond appropriately,"" the Minnesota mall said in a statement. ""We have implemented extra security precautions; some may be noticeable to guests, and others won't be."" The FBI and Homeland Security issued a joint written statement saying local law enforcement and first responders have been told the agencies are not ""aware of any specific, credible plot against the Mall of America or any other domestic commercial shopping center."" The police department in Bloomington, Minnesota, which regularly patrols the mall, also said there was no credible threat against it, describing the mall as a ""very safe place."" ""Enhanced security measures to include additional personnel have been implemented and all information is being monitored,"" police said in a statement Sunday. Stressing that there is no known credible threat to any mall, Johnson also cautioned, ""I won't know about when the next bad actor is going to strike."" Another U.S. law enforcement official familiar with the situation also told CNN that there is no actual working threat against any mall in the country and added that no one should avoid going to a mall because of the online threat. A top Canadian official condemned the video, saying authorities there are monitoring threats and will take ""the appropriate actions"" to protect public safety. ""Canada will not be intimidated by threats from any terrorist organization,"" Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney said. A joint intelligence bulletin from the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI states there is no indication of an ongoing plot from Al-Shabaab in the United States, according to two law enforcement officials who have seen it. The bulletin, sent to law enforcement around the country, urges vigilance against a lone wolf-type attack that the group's latest video message could inspire. The intelligence assessment, the bulletin says, is that there is no credible specific threat to malls in the United States. The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI believe the video was an attempt by Al-Shabaab to compete for attention and recruits with other terrorist groups, one official said. Al-Shabaab's strength is compromised, a U.S. law enforcement official told CNN, and while the group has the desire to see a mall attack in the United States, it likely doesn't have the capability to do so. ""There will be enhanced security (at malls),"" Johnson said, ""but public vigilance, public awareness and public caution in situations like this is particularly important, and it's the environment we're in, frankly."" A short time later, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tanya Bradsher told CNN that Johnson ""didn't say that they should not go to the mall. He told shoppers to be extra vigilant and that security was increased."" Matt Swenson, a spokesman for Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, said the governor is ""monitoring this situation, and will continue to consult the guidance of federal, state and local law enforcement officials, who are working together to assure the safety of all Minnesotans."" Security concerns didn't stop shoppers from packing the Mall of America on Sunday, CNN affiliate WCCO reported. Some shoppers were taking the situation in stride. Others said they were concerned about the threat. ""I'm scared, because I have kids,"" Brittany Segler told WCCO. The West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, Canada, which was also listed in the Al-Shabaab video, said it has implemented extra security and is working with federal and local law enforcement agencies. Edmonton police said there was ""no imminent threat"" to the city, Canadian broadcaster CBC reported. ""This was a very general comment ... it wasn't a specific threat,"" Brian Simpson, deputy chief of the Edmonton Police Service, told CBC. ""However, we as a policing agency (are) absolutely paying attention to this."" In the United Kingdom, Metropolitan Police Counter Terror Command said it is aware of the Al-Shabaab video. The FBI has a program to work with various malls around the country to improve security, the law enforcement official also told CNN. After the 2013 Nairobi attack, the bureau worked with some malls last year to test the readiness of SWAT teams by staging fake attacks during hours when malls were closed, the official said. Although Al-Shabaab has also targeted youth in Canada, Finland and the UK for recruitment, its past attacks have been limited to East Africa. But the Somalia-based militants have heavily recruited in Minneapolis, where young men have been slipping away to join the terror group. The city is home to the largest Somali population in the United States. In addition to Kenya and Somalia, Al-Shabaab has also struck in Uganda, where it killed more than 70 people gathered to watch a World Cup soccer match in Kampala five years ago. Kenya and Uganda have sent their forces to neighboring Somalia to battle the extremists. As the attacks get more daring, the international community has rallied to fight the militants. Last year, the U.S. launched an airstrike in Somalia that killed the Al-Shabaab leader. The terror group later replaced him and vowed to avenge his death. Al-Shabaab started off with a goal of waging a war against the Somali government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia. It has since shifted focus to terrorist attacks in Somalia and beyond. CNN's Evan Perez, Jim Sciutto, Mary Kay Mallonee, Janet DiGiacomo, Max Foster, Joe Sutton, Shimon Prokupecz, Vivian Kuo and Andy Rose contributed to this report.","Despite security concerns, shoppers pack Mall of America, CNN affiliate reports .

"(CNN)I spent time in France earlier this week, and it's clear to me that the French tech scene is at an inflection point. The time to invest in France's future is now. And with more startups than any other European country at the Consumer Electronics Show this year, and a strong infrastructure in place, France is primed to embrace the latest technology transition: digitization of everything. Digitization, which harnesses the power of what we call the Internet of Everything at Cisco -- the connection of people, process, data and things -- will change everything from the way we work to how we serve citizens, and teach our young people. I believe that France will lead in this new era of country digitization. The French government truly understands the economic and societal benefits digitization will bring. This week, I met with Prime Minister Manuel Valls, and together we announced an ambitious partnership, pledging to transform France into a digital republic. By creating a connected ecosystem, there is tremendous opportunity to fuel economic growth, create jobs, foster innovation -- even improve energy use. Cisco will power this initiative through the network. France has a strong traditional infrastructure in place -- roads, water lines, buildings, even parking spaces -- and the country is now committing to build out their digital infrastructure, which will help increase productivity, create jobs, and improve the lives of citizens. Cybersecurity will also be enhanced for the country and its businesses and citizens, and the results for France could be dramatic. With our Networking Academy program, Cisco plans to train an incremental 200,000 students and create 1,500 additional academies over the next three years, so French entrepreneurs have the necessary skills to drive the digitization process. A key ingredient to France's success will also be the entrepreneurial spirit and technical talent needed for digitization. Our first step is to ensure the proper training initiatives are in place to achieve this - providing a $100 million investment that will include training and infrastructure support to transform France into a digital republic. Digitization has the potential to revolutionize France as we know it today. This transformation will contribute to France's overall global competitiveness by supporting job growth, education, cybersecurity, innovation and entrepreneurial initiatives in France. It's also expected to lead to a boost in France's Gross Domestic Product by 1-2 percent. This is a chance for France to innovate based on French values -- egalitarian peer-to peer Internet architecture -- one that creates new digital freedoms and significant socio-economic growth. If countries get ahead of this technology transition, like France, it could change the global agenda. This new phase of the Internet will bring many opportunities to revolutionize the world as we know it, as long as leaders are ready to embrace it. Cisco is excited to help France lead.","John Chambers: Digitization has potential to revolutionize France .

"(CNN)Emma Watson took to Twitter on Sunday to quell rumors that she and Prince Harry are dating, reminding the world that marrying a prince is ""not a prerequisite for being a Princess."" The speculation stemmed from a report last week in an Australian tabloid that the pair ""are having secret dates"" and ""getting to know each other quite well."" The report brought despairing cries from admirers of the red-haired royal and the actor-turned-activist. The world finally heard from Watson on Sunday, when she tweeted a strong indication that the rumors were not to be believed. ""WORLD ... Remember that little talk we had about not believing everything written in the media?!"" she said. She came back later in the day with a retort to tabloid fodder suggesting that Watson was angling to become the next princess, saying that ""marrying a Prince (is) not a prerequisite for being a Princess."" The tweet included a link to a clip from director Alfonso Cuaron's big screen adaptation of the novel ""A Little Princess,"" which includes this famous line: ""I am a princess.

"(CNN)Kenji Goto had every reason to stay home in Japan. A successful career. An adoring mother. A loving wife. A pair of young daughters, one of them just 3-weeks old. Yet, in his mind, he had to go into war-torn Syria. The experienced journalist explained why in a video shot in October from southern Turkey. He felt compelled to tell the stories of war in all its trauma, complexity and humanity. ""Syrian people (have been) suffering for three years and a half. It's enough,"" the 47-year-old Goto explained. ""So I would like to get the story of what ISIS wants to do."" So Goto crossed the border into Syria and headed toward the Islamist extremist group's de facto capital of Raqaa, despite the advice of friend, Alaaeddin Al Zaim, who'd been with him previously in that nation. Al Zaim recalled telling Goto, ""It's not safe for you."" The journalist replied that he didn't feel he was in danger. After all, his native Japan -- unlike the Iraqi government and the international coalition supporting it -- wasn't involved in the military fight against the terrorist group that's branded itself as the Islamic State. ""I am not American. I am not British. I am Japanese,"" Goto said, according to Al Zaim, ""I can go."" It appears to have been a mistake. A new ISIS video released Saturday appeared to show the decapitated body of Goto. While the authenticity of the video could not immediately be established by CNN, Japanese officials did not challenge news of his apparent death. ""We are deeply saddened by this despicable and horrendous act of terrorism and we denounce it in the strongest terms,"" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in Tokyo. Goto covered big news stories for years, hoping that by telling them he could make a difference in the world. His work was featured by numerous Japanese organizations, including broadcaster NHK. And he wasn't afraid to put himself in harm's way to tell a story. One need just look to his previous trip to Syria, where a bloody, complicated civil war has gone on for four years. The United Nations estimated in August that nearly 200,000 had been killed, more than 3 million Syrians had become refugees and at least 6.5 million were displaced inside the country. While there, Goto came to know another Japanese man, a 42-year-old aspiring security contractor Haruna Yukawa. According to Yukawa's friend Nobuo Kimoto, Goto passed along insights on how to survive in Syria and introduced him to rebel fighters, who are distinct from ISIS though both are fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces. The fact the two Japanese men's paths had crossed again became public January 20 in an ISIS video posted to social media. It shows Goto and Yukawa dressed in orange, kneeling in front of a masked, black-clad man. In it, the ISIS militant gives the Japanese government a choice to pay $200 million -- the same amount of money Prime Minister Shinzo Abe recently pledged for those ""contending"" with ISIS -- to free the Japanese men within 72 hours. Days later, a new message was posted by known ISIS supporters featuring the voice of someone claiming to be Goto. Yukawa apparently was dead. And so soon would Goto, the new message claimed -- unless Jordan's government freed its longtime prisoner, Sajida al-Rishawi, a convicted terrorist. On Saturday, the latest ISIS video showed the masked man blaming Japan's humanitarian support of coalition efforts in Iraq and Syria for Goto's apparent beheading. Japan's government insisted it did everything within reason that it could to bring Goto home safely. The fate of Moath al-Kasasbeh, a Jordanian pilot recently captured by ISIS while on a military mission targeting the Islamist extremist group, is unclear. He was not shown or mentioned in the video. Speaking out for the first time Thursday, Goto's wife, Rinko, said her husband ""was taken from me October 25"" although she didn't know it until a December 2 message from his captors landed in her inbox. Now, after working ""tirelessly behind the scenes,"" she went public to ""beg the Jordanian and Japanese governments to understand that the fates of both (Goto and  al-Kaseasbeh) are in their hands."" Her statement comes after she got another email Wednesday with the hostage takers' ""final demand."" ""Our baby girl was only 3 weeks old when Kenji left. I hope our oldest daughter, who is just 2, will get to see her father again,"" Rinko said on Thursday. ""I want them both to grow up knowing their father."" As to why Goto left in the first place, his wife said, ""My husband is a good and honest man who went to Syria to show the plight of those who suffer. I believe that Kenji may have also been trying to find out about Haruna Yukawa's situation. ... I know all too well what (Yukawa's relatives) are going through."" The Japanese captive's mother, Junko Ishido, had spoken out previously trying to save a man she insists ""is not the enemy of ISIS."" While Goto's decision to go to Syria surprised his mother, his rationale did not. Ishido said, ""Kenji always has been a kind person, ever since he was little. He was always saying, 'I want to save the lives of children in war zones.'"" And now Goto has become a victim in a war, a fact that's tearing Ishido apart. ""I'm shedding tears of sorrow, I just can't think of any words to say but I don't want this sorrow to create a chain of hatred,"" she said Saturday. ""Kenji worked for children who suffered from conflicts and poverty, and his goal was to create a society without war. I want to pass on his thoughts to people around the world."" Who is Jordanian pilot Moath al-Kasasbeh, captured by ISIS?","Kenji Goto's mother says she doesn't want her tears to spawn a ""chain of hatred""

"Damascus, Syria (CNN) -- Syria's embattled government allowed about 200 activists and intellectuals, including some it had previously jailed, to hold a conference on democratic reform Monday at a Damascus hotel. ""We must change this tyrannical regime to a democratic, civilian one,"" Louay Hussein, a writer and one-time political prisoner, said. ""How that transition happens is a question this conference is trying to address."" Hussein said the conference would ""not necessarily"" find an answer to that question, ""But that is the big question in this country now."" About 200 Syrian dissidents gathered in the hotel ballroom, including several signatories of a 2005 declaration that called for a democratic transition. But some of those who have been risking arrest or bodily harm as President Bashar al-Assad tries to suppress a wave of anti-government protests say the people in the hotel don't necessarily speak for them. ""The big question regarding this conference is, where are the young people?"" asked Wissam Tarif, a pro-democracy activist based outside Syria. ""Where are the people who are on the streets? Where are the voices of the people who are from Daraa, or from Douma, or from Jisr al-Shugur, or from Idlib? I think those are the voices that have been missed so far."" Tarif is executive director of the Spain-based human rights group Insan, which says more than 630 people have been killed and 8,000 jailed in the clampdown. Other human rights activists have put the death toll at more than 1,100. For its part, a Syrian military spokesman said Sunday that more than 400 police officers and government troops and police have been killed battling ""armed gangs."" CNN cannot independently verify either claim. But Maan Abdul Salam, one of the activists who gathered in Damascus, said, ""I think it's time for us to say our political statement. ""There is the statement coming from the street, there is the statement coming from the authorities and there is the statement coming from everywhere outside the country,"" he said. ""It's time for this group to say what they think and find solutions."" And Hussein said the street protests are needed to ""put pressure on the state to stop its dominance over society."" If that doesn't happen, he said, ""Then we are definitely at risk of going back to jail -- and for a very long time."" In Washington, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday's conference was ""a worthwhile step,"" but told reporters that ""the violence has to stop."" ""For it to be truly significant, it has to be part of a cessation of violence against the Syrian people. It has to be part of an embrace of the idea that they need to have a national dialogue about their future, and that that transition needs to take place with the regime leading it or getting out of the way."" The al-Assad family has ruled Syria since 1971, with Bashar al-Assad taking power after his father's death in 2000. He held out a promise of reforms and a ""national dialogue"" in a speech last week that was met with widespread skepticism. Hussein said he expected the government to try to exploit Monday's conference and hold out those who attended as ""the reasonable ones."" But he added, ""We will always try to defend the street, because it is also a reasonable, right and peaceful street that always protests peacefully."" CNN's Hala Gorani and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.","Dissidents meet unmolested in Damascus hotel amid clampdown .

"(CNN)As goal celebrations go it was almost certainly unique but Roma captain Francesco Totti had plenty to celebrate. His title challenging side was trailing 2-0 to arch city rival Lazio in the Rome derby before the veteran striker worked his magic in the second half. Totti cut the arrears with a fine angled strike in the 48th minute of the clash in the Olympic Stadium. He then claimed his second and the vital equalizer as connected with Jose Holebas's curling delivery for an acrobatic finish. In frenzied celebrations, Totti promptly grabbed a mobile telephone from one of the Roma coaching staff and took a 'selfie' picture of himself. The shot was later posted on the club's official Facebook page and has gone viral on social media. It was the 38-year-old's 239th goal in Serie A in his 22nd season with Roma. Neither side could add to its tally in a frantic finale to a fine match. Totti needs another 35 to match Silvio Piola's all-time Serie A record of 274, and temporarily drew Rudi Garcia's team level at the top with Juventus. However, the title holders beat Napoli 3-1 away later Sunday to go three points clear -- their victory down to a pair of stunning strikes from Paul Pogba and Arturo Vidal and a rare goal from Martin Caceres. The earlier draw was a blow to Lazio's slim title hopes, left nine points adrift in third place . Man Utd stunned . In the English Premier League, Manchester United's title challenge also suffered a massive setback, losing 1-0 at Old Trafford to Southampton. In a lackluster affair, Dusan Tadic's second-half goal gave the visitors a vital three points to leapfrog United into third in the standings. Juan Mata wasted two fine chances to level for Louis van Gaal's side, which was seeing its 11-match unbeaten run ended. Earlier, Alexis Sanchez scored twice for Arsenal who beat Stoke 3-0 at the Emirates to move into fifth spot in the battle for Champions League places. Messi stars for Barca . Lionel Messi set up goals for Neymar and Luis Suarez and scored the clinching third as Barcelona grabbed a crucial 3-1 win over La Liga champions Atletico Madrid. Messi, the subject of speculation about his future at the Nou Camp, also conceded the penalty which gave Atletico hope when he was adjudged to have brought down Jesus Gamez. Mario Mandzukic scored from the spot to cut Barca's lead to 2-1, but Messi scored from close range to seal three points for his team which leaves them a point behind leaders Real Madrid.

"(CNN)Oscar-nominated filmmaker Bruce Sinofsky, whose series on the ""West Memphis Three"" cast doubt on the murder convictions of three Arkansas teenagers, catalyzing a movement that led to their release, died Saturday, longtime collaborator Joe Berlinger said. The Emmy-award winning documentary director died in his sleep of complications from diabetes, Berlinger said. He was 58. ""Bruce's humanity is on every frame of the films that he leaves behind, and words can't express how graced I feel my life has been by having the extraordinary opportunity of being able to say we were partners and, more importantly, best friends,"" said Berlinger. The duo collaborated on Sinofsky's debut, the critically acclaimed ""Brother's Keeper,"" before turning to the ""Paradise Lost"" trilogy, a series of films that drew attention to the case of three teen boys convicted in 1994 of killing three Cub Scouts in West Memphis, Arkansas. The films, released in 1996, 2004 and 2011, raised questions about the evidence, drawing attention from musicians including Eddie Vedder, Tom Waits and Henry Rollins, who pushed for a review of the case. After spending 18 years in prison, Jessie Misskelley, Damien Echols and Jason Baldwin were released pursuant to a complicated plea agreement in September 2011, one month before the final installment, ""Purgatory,"" was released. The film was nominated for an Academy Award. As the case wended though the courts, Sinokfsky and Berlinger turned their attention to metal band Metallica, whose music was featured in the first two installments of ""Paradise Lost."" The result was 2004's ""Metallica: Some Kind of Monster."" Sinofsky also directed PBS' ""Good Rockin' Tonight: The Legacy of Sun Records,"" an installment of The History Channel's ""10 Days that Unexpectedly Changed America"" and episodes of the Sundance Channel's ""Iconoclasts"" series. He won multiple Emmys, a Peabody and an Independent Spirit Award for his work. Berlinger recalled Sinofsky's dedication to his first film ""Brother's Keeper,"" despite a lack of of financial backing or equipment. ""Bruce encouraged both of us to throw caution into the wind to start capturing what would become 'Brother's Keeper' in 1991 with no money in our pockets, in the pre-video 16mm age of documentary-making, when making a no-budget film took a little more ingenuity to get in the can,"" he said in a statement. ""His unique combination of courage and empathy made that possible, as well as everything that came after for us. The extraordinary adventures we had on the road and the deeply stimulating experiences we had in the editing room were life-changing for all of us who knew him thanks to his wisdom and fervor to change the world.

"(CNN)A new winter storm slammed the East Coast on Saturday, putting Washington, D.C. and Baltimore into the deep freeze. In Washington, 4-6 inches of snow and sleet were expected to accumulate by Sunday morning, the National Weather Service reported. In Baltimore, the prediction was even worse, with 6-10 inches expected. The storm snarled roads, forcing the closure of I-95 southbound in Baltimore and leaving so many disabled vehicles that emergency vehicles couldn't get through, CNN affiliate WBFF reported. A sheet of ice covered part of Madison Avenue NW in Washington because a water main broke on Friday, CNN affiliate WJLA reported, trapping about half a dozen cars. ""I can't even move the car,"" A.J. Kumar told WJLA. ""It's right up to the bumper."" People are having to stay put all over the East Coast. At 9:30 p.m. ET Saturday, at least 1,546 fights had been canceled in the United States, many in the Washington and Baltimore areas, according to FlightAware.com. The weather agency calls for accumulations of 3-6 inches in New York City, 4-6 inches in Philadelphia and 2-5 inches in Boston by Sunday morning. Up to 12 inches were forecast for West Virginia, CNN meteorologists said. In Tennessee, 50,000 customers in 12 counties have lost power, many in the Cumberland Plateau area in the eastern part of the state, said the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. The governor elevated the state to a higher level state of emergency, meaning citizens may be eligible for state and federal assistance. So far, no more fatalities have been reported. The state said on Friday that 18 people had died from weather-related causes. In Kentucky, a 24-hour Walmart in South Williamson was evacuated and closed indefinitely after store employees detected cracks in the walls, apparently caused by the heavy snow load on the roof, Walmart spokeswoman Tricia Moriarty said. The department store will stay closed until the building is fully inspected and determined to be fully safe, Moriarty said. Roofs also collapsed in Harlan and Jackson, but no injuries were reported. To make matters worse, a brand new arctic blast is pushing cold air into the lower 48 states, creating dangerously low temps Sunday in the Northern Plains, CNN meteorologists said. Wind chills may reach minus 30 or minus 40 degrees, . Monday and Tuesday are shaping up to be very cold days in the East and Midwest. The National Weather predicted Monday high temperatures of 22 in Philadelphia, 17 in New York City, 10 in Chicago, 4 in Cleveland and 25 in Washington. A storm was heading toward the Rocky Mountains, too, creating a chance of snow from Montana down through Colorado and into northeastern New Mexico, CNN meteorologists said. In Denver, 8-10 inches of snow could fall. CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","2-6 inches of snow, rain and sleet expected in New York City, Philadelphia and Boston .

"Atlanta (CNN)As Bobbi Kristina Brown fights for her life at an Atlanta hospital, the public spat between her boyfriend and her family goes on. In social media posts, Nick Gordon said he's been prevented from visiting Brown, the daughter of music legend Whitney Houston. ""Let me in the hospital to see my girl and let her hear my voice,"" he tweeted Saturday. ""If she hears my voice, let me massage her, play her favorite music I believe it will help."" But Brown's father slammed the accusation, saying Gordon was offered a chance to visit her. ""Let me be very clear, Mr. Gordon was offered an opportunity to potentially visit Bobbi Kristina and he declined to meet the terms of any possible visit,"" R&B singer Bobby Brown said in a statement through his lawyers. ""Obviously Mr. Gordon is not as desperate to visit Bobbi Kristina as he wants the world to believe."" The statement did not specify what the terms were. Without specifying the details of those terms, Gordon's lawyers said they advised him against meeting them, ""particularly in light of Mr. Brown's inability to guarantee access."" ""In an effort to do all he can to visit, Nick has repeatedly offered to meet with Mr. Brown privately to discuss his request in person, rather than through lawyers,"" lawyers Randall M. Kessler and Joe S. Habachy said in a statement. ""Those offers have also been rejected. We hope Mr. Brown has a change of heart."" Bobby Brown's attorney responded with another statement, saying Gordon has yet to tell Brown in writing what happened to his daughter. ""Due to Mr. Gordon's failure to place in tangible form his understanding of the events that lead to the hospitalization of Bobbi Kristina,  there is no reason for any additional discussion with him,"" attorney Christopher Brown said in a statement. ""Mr. Gordon has every right to remain silent and not share his version of the events with Bobby Brown. We are only concerned with individuals that can help Bobbi Kristina and bring resolution to this investigation."" Bobbi Kristina Brown, 21, remains in a medically induced coma at Emory University three weeks after she was found unresponsive in a bathtub. Doctors are attempting to slowly lift her coma, according to sources close to the family.  Her breathing tube has been removed, and she will now be ventilated through a hole in her throat. Police have said they're treating her case as a criminal investigation after she was found on January 31 at her home in Roswell, Georgia. The extent of her injuries is not known. Her mother, who died in 2012, was similarly found in a bathtub.  A coroner ruled Houston's death an accidental drowning, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors. Brown is her only child. CNN's Carolyn Sung, Dana Ford and MaryLynn Ryan contributed to this report.","Bobby Brown's attorney: Nick Gordon won't put in writing what happened to Bobbi Kristina .

"(CNN) -- The United States has formally dropped criminal charges against former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who was killed in a U.S. military raid in Pakistan last month. In federal court in Manhattan on Friday, prosecutors disposed of a 1998 indictment that charged bin Laden with murder and conspiracy to kill Americans for his role in attacking U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998. The indictment also alleged that bin Laden tried to attack U.S. defense assets. The bombing of U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killed 224 people. A raid by U.S. special operations forces killed bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, on May 2. Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, asked for the change, a request that Judge Lewis Kaplan granted in a brief order. The action came after a thorough analysis confirmed that bin Laden did indeed die after Navy SEALs raided his compound, according to an affidavit from a top U.S. government official that was included in the filing. The officials noted that facial recognition and photograph analysis confirmed the identity, along with DNA testing of the body. ""The possibility of a mistaken identification is approximately one in 11.8 quadrillion,"" the official said. Much of the details regarding proof of his death have been previously reported. The original indictment, filed in secret June 8, 1998, accused bin Laden of murder and conspiracy to kill Americans, among other charges, after the cab bombings that year at the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He was the only one originally charged, but other terror leaders were added to that indictment. Typically, court indictments are dismissed when the defendant dies or is convicted on other unrelated cases. Such requests to drop charges are procedural and routine. Pending federal criminal indictments remain against other top al Qaeda officials and their associates. Those include open charges against Ayman al-Zawahiri, who was reported this week to have succeeded bin Laden as leader of al Qaeda. Other pending criminal indictments will probably be amended in coming weeks or months to remove bin Laden's name, including his self-admitted role as mastermind of the terrorist attacks on Washington and New York on September 11, 2001. A number of other civil lawsuits have been filed by surviving victims and family members of the 9/11 attacks, seeking to hold bin Laden and his terror network financially responsible for causing the worst terror attacks ever on U.S. soil. The disposition of those cases remains unclear. CNN's Bill Mears contributed to this report.","NEW: Facial recognition and DNA tests confirmed bin Laden's death, affidavit says .

"(CNN)A technology executive and five other people are feared dead after a suspicious fire destroyed a mansion in Annapolis, Maryland. The house belonged to technology executive Don Pyle, the chief operating officer for ScienceLogic, company spokesman Antonio Piraino said. Pyle had not been heard from on Monday, and his colleagues at ScienceLogic were ""hoping for a miracle,"" CNN affiliate WJLA reported. Pyle was believed to have been at home with his wife and four grandchildren. When the first firefighters arrived on the scene, they received conflicting reports about whether the family may have been out of town. But after interviews with relatives, ""it has been determined that six members of the family are not accounted for,"" the Anne Arundel County Fire Department said. Fire officials said they were alerted about 3:30 a.m. Monday to the fire in the 16,000-square-foot house. About 80 firefighters responded. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is assisting the local fire department, and an ATF national response team is being assembled because the fire was deemed suspicious, a law enforcement official said. The burned-out home is being treated as a crime scene until investigators figure out the cause, the official said. The Anne Arundel County Fire Department said fire crews had difficulty knocking down the blaze because the house is secluded, apparently with no fire hydrants on the scene. Photos the fire department posted on Twitter showed hoses stretched for long distances. Davies said it took several hours for fire department tanker trucks and a fire boat on an adjacent creek to bring the fire under control, he said. ATF Special Agent Dave Cheplak said no one has searched for possible victims yet because of the size and heat of the fire.

"In 2010 alone, there were roughly 1,100 attacks on U.S. fuel convoys. This has cost the men and women of our armed forces dearly. Military officials recently reported  that more than 3,000 uniformed soldiers and contractors died while protecting such missions in Iraq from 2003 to 2007.  But new Pentagon initiatives could dramatically reduce our battlefield fuel demand through the use of new clean energy technologies, helping save lives and stretch ever-scarce defense dollars. The U.S. Department of Defense is one of the world's largest institutional energy consumers. Using more than 300,000 barrels of oil daily, the U.S. military consumes more petroleum products than three-quarters of the countries in the world. In fiscal year 2008, energy cost the department about $17.9 billion. Leaders in the Pentagon, though, are up to the challenge. The Defense Department played a key role in the development of the Internet, semiconductors and modern satellite-based navigation, used by virtually anyone with a smartphone. Now, as detailed in a recent report by the Pew Charitable Trusts, its efforts to improve vehicle efficiency and use advanced biofuels could similarly lead the way for countless U.S. businesses seeking a foothold in the burgeoning global clean energy economy. Building on the work of an expert panel convened by the Defense Science Board, the Pentagon has called for a new technology development strategy aimed at reducing risk to soldiers and enhancing our nation's overall long-term energy security. The department considers this one of its top strategic imperatives. In keeping with this plan, the military has set a target of obtaining 25% of its energy from renewable sources by 2025, with 450 renewable energy projects already functioning. For example, the Navy will soon test a hybrid electric drive system for the USS Truxtun, a guided missile destroyer, which will save 8,500 barrels of fuel annually. The Air Force made history last year with the first flight of a biomass-powered aircraft, the A-10C Thunderbolt II. And the Army has insulated roughly 9 million square feet of bases in Iraq and Afghanistan, reducing energy consumption by 77,000 gallons per day. With more than 500,000 buildings and structures at major installations around the world, the Defense Department manages three times the square footage operated by Walmart. Since 1985, it has reduced its facility energy consumption by more than 30%. The Army's ""Net Zero"" program offers another case in point. The project aims to have select installations each produce as much as they consume in energy, water or waste by 2020. Fort Carson and Fort Bliss, to name just two, will become Net Zero in all three areas. Combined, these efforts could have a huge impact on U.S. operational security. On average, each deployed soldier requires 22 gallons of fuel per day. In fact, in Afghanistan alone, tens of millions of gallons of fuel must be delivered each month. Yet, according to the U.S. Army, there is roughly one casualty for every 46 ground resupply convoys in Afghanistan. So reducing our reliance on oil could keep countless troops out of harm's way. This Pentagon initiative could also act as a catalyst for our nation's growing clean energy economy. According to Pew's report, the military's sizable purchasing power could provide a crucial difference in helping technologies make the transition from the labs to the marketplace. In the process, badly needed jobs and manufacturing opportunities in the private sector also could be created across the nation. The past decade has presented great challenges to our armed forces. They have responded with creativity, tenacity and courage. The Pentagon has been charged with managing two wars, helping establish more robust homeland security measures and responding to worldwide humanitarian emergencies. Throughout these trying times, however, the military also has looked inside its own operations and developed a sound strategy to enhance America's security and lessen our dependence on foreign fuels. Congress and the White House should match that effort and aid this endeavor to save American lives, money and energy.","Phyllis Cuttino: Thousands of soldiers in Iraq were killed protecting fuel convoys .

"Not too long ago, there were just as many news reports about Beirut's fancy nightclubs and the Lebanese capital's embrace of modern living as there were stories about violence. Lebanon had maintained relative stability despite the full-tilt civil war that has torn apart its largest neighbor and former military occupier, Syria, for more than a year and a half. The war has triggered some sectarian conflicts inside Lebanon, and that raised concerns -- but no alarm bells -- about a broader conflict. Now, that may have changed. The trigger came Friday, when a car bomb exploded in central Beirut, killing Lebanon's top intelligence official, Brig. Gen Wissam al-Hassan. He publicly opposed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Many in Lebanon immediately suspected al-Assad's regime in the assassination. Pockets of sporadic fighting have erupted across the country.  Lebanon's army made an unprecedented move by issuing a statement demanding that politicians order their supporters to calm down. ""The country's fate is at risk,"" the statement said. ""Tension in some areas is increasing to unprecedented levels."" Lawmakers who are most opposed to Syria's influence inside Lebanon -- mostly through its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah -- are now calling for the government's resignation. Lebanon is a country on the brink.  And many observers believe that the longer Syria's conflict goes on, the more destabilizing it will be for Lebanon. Here's an overview of where things stand and how they got to this point: . Why was Lebanon's intelligence chief assassinated last week?  What does that have to do with Syria? On Friday, the man who once led investigations into the targeted killings of high-profile Lebanese officials was killed himself in a massive car bomb in  Ashrafiyeh, the typically peaceful and cosmopolitan district of East Beirut that he called home. Lebanese officials said there was no doubt al-Hassan was the target of the attack. Al-Hassan:  A polarizing figure . Speculation immediately fell to Syria, even though Damascus and its ally, Hezbollah, both condemned the attack. Lebanon vowed to hunt down the perpetrators, and the United States dispatched FBI agents to help in the investigation. Al-Hassan may have been targeted because he was leading an investigation into a Lebanese politician, Michel Samaha, who is accused of working with two Syrian officials to plan attacks inside Lebanon. How much control does Syria have inside Lebanon? Syria ended its military occupation of Lebanon in 2005, bowing to international pressure after the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Yet the country maintains influence through Hezbollah, a powerful Shiite political party that has links with the al-Assad government and currently dominates Lebanon's government. Hezbollah is also an Iran-backed paramilitary group deemed a terrorist organization by the United States, whose agents inside Lebanon were indicted by the United Nations for Hariri's assassination. Elements of Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati's alliance are firm, if quiet, supporters of the al-Assad regime. But the government is more interested in keeping Lebanon from getting dragged into the conflict, says Middle East expert Chris Phillips of Queen Mary, University of London. ""They're aware they're a weak government, and they're not keen on Lebanon becoming a staging point for the rebels to launch attacks on Syria,"" Phillips said. ""But there hasn't been a major drive to push the Free Syrian Army out of the country because the government knows a large segment of the Lebanese population supports the rebels."" Why do Lebanese support Hezbollah, which is considered a terrorist group by the U.S.? Hezbollah, experts say, is popular inside Lebanon because it has managed to do what the Lebanese government at large has failed to pull off: efficiently provide cradle-to-grave services. To the West, Hezbollah is an enemy. The United States has long designated it a terrorist organization, blaming it for a series of kidnappings and for setting off truck bombs in 1983 that killed more than 200 U.S. Marines in Beirut. Hezbollah was also behind the hijacking of a TWA flight in 1985, which produced infamous footage of a pilot leaning out of the cockpit with a gun to his head. Hezbollah was created in 1982 to oppose Israel's occupation of Lebanon. Throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s, it waged violence against its chief target, Israel, sparking violence between those nations and, by proxy, fanning the tension among their allies. But inside Lebanon, it runs hospitals and schools, provides college counseling and employs traffic cops. The group reinforces its message on its own al-Manar satellite television channel and broadcast station. That has not stopped it from amassing substantial political power inside Lebanon, according to author and journalist Thanassis Cambanis. ""They provide in a fair and efficient way, but Hezbollah is also authoritarian, power-hungry and militaristic,"" said Cambanis, who has reported extensively in the region for the Boston Globe and the New York Times. ""They believe in a religious and pious society that embraces a fundamentalist Shia Islam. They believe in self sufficiency through war."" Iran and Syria support Hezbollah's ideology. Both countries have provided the group, which has a military wing, with financial backing and weapons for years.  Hezbollah also makes millions through illegal businesses around the world, including global drug trafficking, the U.S. has charged. Have there been widespread protests in Lebanon?  Against what? Protests have been more isolated. After al-Hassan's funeral Sunday, angry protesters clashed with security forces and rushed toward Mikati's office in central Beirut, calling for his dismissal. The mob hurled sticks, stones and flags.  A smaller, peaceful demonstration continued later Sunday as government figures called for calm. Most of the protesters are allied with Sunni coalitions that have long been sharply critical of the Lebanese government's perceived closeness with the Syrian regime, blaming Mitaki for not preventing Friday's deadly car bomb. Why could Syria's problems become Lebanon's? They're two different countries, after all. The major concern for Lebanon is that Syria's troubles will reopen the wounds of Lebanon's 15-year-long civil war, which ended in 1990. Lebanon has always struggled to maintain a balance among its religious and ethnic sects, and the current tensions mirror those in Syria: In both countries, the Shiite and Alawite Muslim sects (al-Assad is an Alawite) tend to support the Syrian regime, while support is growing among Sunni Muslims for Syrian rebels. The country also has a large Christian population, and both Sunni and Shiite groups have lobbied for Christian support during past conflicts. Sunnis are in the majority in northern Lebanon, where they have clashed with a small but strong enclave of pro-al-Assad Alawites. The core of the Syrian president's support in Lebanon is in the southern part of the country. The good news is that the war exhaustion factor is very high in Lebanon, Phillips explained. Beirut is still recovering from Israel's shelling of the city in 2006 during a 34-day conflict sparked by Hezbollah's kidnapping of Israeli troops near the Lebanese border, and many other wounds from the 1975-90 civil war have yet to heal. ""There's been an assumption for several years that the Lebanese people are fed up and exhausted with civil war,"" Phillips said. ""The civil war there ended not because of any resolution but simply because people lost the will to keep fighting.""","Lebanon has maintained relative stability despite the civil war raging next door .
Last week's assassination of a top intel official may have changed that .
Syria still plays a major role in Lebanon, despite pulling out its troops in 2005 ."
"(CNN)Police officers are among the two dead and 15 wounded after an explosion during a peaceful protest in the eastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's Interior Ministry said Sunday. Four people belonging to a group that received training in Belgorod, Russia, have been arrested, Secretary Oleksandr Turchynov of Ukraine's National Defense and Security Council said on his website. A gun was also confiscated. Though there were reports that someone threw an explosive device from a vehicle, the blast appeared to be caused by a remote-controlled device, Turchynov's statement said. Footage from the rally shows an estimated 500 people marching through a Kharkiv street, many hoisting Ukrainian flags, when the explosion sends rally participants and onlookers scurrying for cover. Police and others rush to treat three people -- two men, one in camouflage fatigues and another who appears to be in civilian dress, lying motionless on the ground and a third man in camouflage who seems to have suffered shrapnel injuries to his legs. Turchynov's statement and media outlets reported a casualty toll lower than the one provided by the Interior Ministry. The Interior Ministry and Turchynov agreed that one policeman was among the dead and five officers were among the wounded. One eyewitness told the Kiev Post that the blast could have been deadlier. ""The march was delayed by 10 minutes, then just as people started to move, we saw the explosion go off just 100 meters away, to our left and on the road side. It seemed like the device was hidden in the snow near a tree,"" Dmitriy Komaykov told the newspaper. ""Luckily a truck was maneuvering there, and it took most of the shrapnel. I saw two dead, lying in blood, just next to the truck, which was completely torn apart by metal shards. Can you imagine if it had been later? My wife and I went to the march with our baby daughter and our older son."" The explosion is a suspected terrorist act, said Anatoly Dmitriev, head of the Kharkiv region of Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs. Kharkiv has been placed under the highest level of terror alert as a counterterrorism operation is under way, Turchynov said. Sunday's rally marked the first anniversary of the bloodiest day of protests in Kiev's Maidan, or Independence Square, against the country's then-Russian-leaning leader and in favor of closer ties to Europe. Some 49 people died on February 20, 2014, and close to 100 more suffered gunshot wounds when, according to protesters, government snipers opened fire on them. Two days later, President Viktor Yanukovych fled the country, prompting Ukrainians to declare ""victory in the Maidan"" and promise a new day for a country long torn between its neighbors, Europe to the west and Russia to the east. Kharkiv has been the target of numerous attacks in recent months. According to a Foreign Policy report, the Interior Ministry has declared that 700 separatists have been detained in the city, and several attacks have struck Ukraine's second-largest city since October. Among them: a grenade attack on military warehouses on October 19; a November explosion at a pub popular with local volunteers and activists; a Christmas bombing at a furniture store; a January bombing at a courthouse that injured 14; and a February bombing of a notary's office. In response to the attacks, police have begun guarding Kharkiv's ""strategic infrastructure"" and have upped security at supermarkets, Foreign Policy reported Friday. Sunday's attack came a day after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, appearing in London, blasted Russia for its ""land-grabbing in Ukraine"" and threatened additional sanctions. ""We are confident that over the next few days we are going to make it clear that we are not going to play this game, not going to sit here and be part of this extraordinarily craven behavior at the expense of the sovereignty and integrity of a nation,"" he said. Moscow has repeatedly denied that it is arming separatists and sending its own troops over the border, but Kerry said satellites and other technology show it's ""no secret"" what is happening in Ukraine. ""We know to a certainty what Russia has been providing to the separatists, how Russia is involved with the separatists,"" he said. A ceasefire that went into effect February 15 remains in doubt, as a separatist offensive to take the key strategic town of Debaltseve ended only Wednesday when rebels took over the town. Shelling also picked up last week in the city of Donetsk and clashes have been reported around the southern port city of Mariupol. Ukraine's National Defense and Security Council said Friday there had been 300 instances in which the latest truce was violated, and the news agency Ukrinform published a map Saturday showing how the eastern portion of the country is still racked by violence. The ceasefire agreement -- signed February 12 in Minsk, Belarus, among the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany -- aimed to curb this violence. It is supposed to be followed by the withdrawal of heavy weaponry to create a buffer zone, the release of prisoners and steps toward new elections. Journalist Victoria Butenko in Kiev and CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Lindsay Isaac contributed to this report.","Video from scene shows police, onlookers tending to 3 men, two of them in fatigues .

"As security forces ran out, militants overran Iraq's second-largest city on Tuesday -- a stunning collapse that heightened questions about Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's ability to hold onto not only Mosul, but his entire country. Militants seized Mosul's airport, TV stations, the governor's office and other parts, if not all, of the northern Iraqi city. ""I only ... saw armed people, but not Iraqi military,"" said resident Firas al-Maslawi of his drive through Mosul on Tuesday. ""There was no presence of any government forces on the streets, the majority of their posts destroyed and manned by (Islamist militants)."" Other witnesses painted similar scenes, of buildings and boulevards manned not by Iraqi soldiers or police but rather by men they say are members of the extremist group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, an al Qaeda splinter group also known by its acronym ISIS. Mosul wasn't the only place in the country beset by violence Tuesday, including some focused closer to the capital of Baghdad. Still, what's happening in this northern Iraqi city is the most serious, given its size, the bloodshed's scope and the brewing humanitarian situation tied to it. The numerous reports of police and soldiers running from their posts in Mosul raised the prospect that the Iraqi government did not either have the will or resources to win this and other fights. In perhaps a sign of just how serious the threat is, al-Maliki took to the airwaves to urge all men to volunteer to fight, promising to provide weapons and equipment. The Prime Minister also urged parliament to declare a state of emergency as part of an effort "" to confront this ferocious attack that harms all Iraqis."" ""We will not allow for the remainder of the ... province and the city to fall,"" he said in a live speech broadcast on Iraqi state TV. Already, hundreds in Mosul have been killed since the fighting began five days ago. Tens of thousands more have fled in vehicles and on foot, some of them carrying only what they could in plastic bags. This rush has contributed to bottlenecks at checkpoints as people tried to get to safety in nearby Erbil. Within Mosul, militants managed to take control of security checkpoints, military bases and a prison, where they freed up to 1,000 prisoners, authorities said. They did so after apparently overrunning Iraqi security forces, whose bodies -- some of them mutilated -- littered the streets, a Reuters journalist on the ground in Mosul reported. Some police took off their uniforms, dropped their weapons and ran, according to the journalist. A journalist with Agence France-Presse, who was fleeing the city with his family, reported security forces had abandoned vehicles and a police station was set on fire. ""We can't beat them. We can't. They are well-trained in street fighting, and we're not,"" one officer, whose identity was withheld, told Reuters. ""We need a whole army to drive them out of Mosul."" Fighting elsewhere around Iraq . Political and sectarian violence have wracked Iraq for months, often pitting minority Sunnis against majority Shiite Muslims, who came to dominate the government after Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was overthrown in 2003. Tensions are fueled by widespread discontent among the Sunnis, who say they are marginalized by the Shiite-led government and unfairly targeted by heavy-handed security tactics. Militants also believed to be from ISIS have also taken control of two villages in Kirkuk province and one in Salaheddin province, Iraqi police officials told CNN on Tuesday. The move into Salaheddin province -- the capital of which, Tikrit, was Saddam's hometown -- shows how close the major fighting is getting to Baghdad. Video posted on YouTube purportedly shows all jail cells in a police station in Beiji in the province abandoned, though CNN could confirm the authenticity of the footage. On Tuesday night, Iraqi security forces were clashing with dozens of gunmen attempting to storm the Baiji oil refinery about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the capital, police officials in Tikrit said. Closer to Baghdad, at least 31 people were killed and 28 others injured in a series of roadside bombs detonated at a cemetery on the outskirts of the central city of Baquba, according to police officials. Two residents of Falluja, which is in Sunni-dominated Anbar province and controlled by militants, say a majority of government forces have pulled back from that city to focus on securing Baghdad's perimeter. This violence is significant but hardly new in Iraq, which has been beset by instability for years. That includes bloodshed in the years immediately after Saddam's capture over a decade ago. Still, one difference between then and now is the Iraqi government had help from U.S.-led forces at that time. Now, after a brief lull, the unrest has picked up. The United Nations has said 2013 was the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008, with more than 8,800 people killed -- most of them civilians. Nearly 500,000 people are estimated to have been displaced this year in fighting, primarily in Anbar province. Radical Islamists on the move . While sectarian strife is largely to blame, there's no doubt that radical Islamists increasingly flexed their muscles and expanded their reach in recent months. Formost among them is ISIS, which has wrested control of Iraqi cities like Falluja and parts of Ramadi as well as of Syrian towns just over the border. It has done so by exploiting the weakness of Iraq's central Shiite-dominated government, says CNN's Nic Robertson, as it has done in Mosul. ""It is considered too radical even for al Qaeda and, in the past months, has withstood and emerged from a jihadist backlash from its erstwhile radical Islamist allies in Syria's civil war,"" Robertson said. ""Mosul ... has made them the single most dangerous, destabilizing radical group in the region, something al-Maliki's government seems ill-equipped to deal with."" The fall of Mosul -- a predominantly Sunni city with a population of about 1.6 million -- would be a blow to the central government, which is already struggling to contain an insurgency in central Anbar province. Mosul, about 560 kilometers (350 miles) northwest of Baghdad, was once called the last stronghold of al Qaeda in Iraq by the U.S. military, and at the height of the Iraq war, it was considered one of the main entry points for foreign fighters coming into the country by way of Syria. The security forces, particularly police, have not always been trusted in Mosul. In 2004, thousands of police officers fled their posts amid the Sunni insurgency, leaving U.S. and Kurdish forces to fight to keep control of the city. This time around, Jala Abdulrahman saw no sign of government authorities in his Mosul neighborhood, prompting him to flee along with his wife, three children and other family members. ""Gunmen are everywhere in my neighborhood,"" he told CNN by telephone. ""...Where are the Iraqi army and police? Where are the politicians that we trusted and voted for?"" By late Tuesday, Abdulrahman and his family were among hundreds waiting at a checkpoint on the road between Mosul and the Erbil, the capital of Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region. Um Ahmed decided to drive out of Mosul at dawn with her three daughters and two sons. She wasn't taking any chances, especially knowing how gunmen killed her husband outside of a mosque in Mosul a few years ago. ""I left everything behind, and I don't know how long it will take to return back to our home,"" she said. Al-Maslawi, the Mosul resident, said that while government forces were absent, ISIS fighters seemed to be in control. Members of the group even urged mobs trying to flee toward Kurdistan to go back home, he said. ""'We will not hurt anyone,'"" al-Maslawi said of what ISIS members were saying. ""'We have liberated the city of Mosul from al-Maliki forces ... We are running this city, and tomorrow all (businesses) need to be reopened.' Grisly scene in Iraq: 'See these children?' Speaker points finger at security forces . Turkey has become part of the story in Mosul as well, with the Turkish Foreign Ministry reporting fighting near its consulate in the city and noting reports that militants abducted 28 Turkish truck drivers hauling fuel. The drivers were en route from Iskenderun, Turkey, to an electrical plant outside of Mosul. According to the Turkish Foreign Ministry, when the drivers arrived at the plant, ISIS fighters grabbed them. Earlier, the speaker of Iraq's parliament said that a ""foreign invasion"" of the country was under way by ""terrorist groups"" and that the northern province of Nineveh, of which Mosul is the capital, was under ""total occupation."" Speaking at a news conference in Baghdad, Osama al-Nujaifi appeared to point the finger at the central government, accusing security forces of abandoning Mosul when the fighting began. Al-Nujaifi said security forces ""abandoned their weapons, their tanks and their bases and left them to terrorist groups, even Mosul airport."" He also said gunmen had taken over ammunition storage facilities. The speaker, whose brother Atheel al-Nujaifi is the governor of Nineveh province, said the central government had been warned over the past few weeks that militant groups were gathering but had taken no preventive action. ""It will not stop at the borders of Nineveh but will reach all of Iraq,"" he said. Also criticizing the central government was Nechirvan Barzani, the prime minister of Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region, who blamed security forces for allowing militants to take control of portions of Mosul. ""Over the last two days, we tried extremely hard to establish cooperation with the Iraqi security forces in order to protect the city of Mosul.

"(CNN)Juergen Todenhoefer's journey was a tough one: dangerous, but also eye-opening. The author traveled deep into ISIS territory -- the area they now call their ""caliphate"" -- visiting Raqqa and Deir Ezzor in Syria, as well as Mosul in Iraq. Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, was taken by ISIS in a Blitzkrieg-like sweep in June. Todenhoefer managed to visit the mosque there where the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Bagdadi, gave his only public address. And he saw the realities of daily life under ISIS, with all shops having to close for prayers in the middle of the day. ""There is an awful sense of normalcy in Mosul,"" Todenhoefer said in an exclusive interview with CNN. ""130,000 Christians have been evicted from the city, the Shia have fled, many people have been murdered and yet the city is functioning and people actually like the stability that the Islamic State has brought them."" Nonetheless, he says, there is an air of fear among residents: ""Of course many of the them are quite scared, because the punishment for breaking the Islamic State's strict rules is very severe."" According to ISIS's leadership, the group's fighters managed to take Mosul with only about 300 men, even though more than 20,000 Iraqi army soldiers were stationed there when the attack was launched. Todenhoefer spoke with several ISIS fighters who took part in the operation. ""It took us about four days to take Mosul,"" a young fighter told him. ""So you were only about 300 men and you defeated 20,000 troops in four days?"" Todenhoefer asked. ""Well, we didn't attack them all at once, we hit their front lines hard, also using suicide attacks. Then the others fled very quickly,"" the fighter explained. ""We fight for Allah, they fight for money and other things that they do not really believe in."" Glow in their eyes . Todenhoefer told CNN the enthusiasm the ISIS militants showed was one thing that stood out. ""When we stayed at their recruitment house, there were 50 new fighters who came every day,"" Todenhoefer said. ""And I just could not believe the glow in their eyes. They felt like they were coming to a promised land, like they were fighting for the right thing. ""These are not stupid people. One of the people we met had just finished his law degree, he had great job offers, but he turned them down to go and fight ... We met fighters from Europe and the United States. One of them was from New Jersey. Can you imagine a man from New Jersey traveling to fight for the Islamic State?"" He went on to say that one of ISIS's main points of strength is their fighters' willingness -- even their will -- to die on the battlefield. Todenhoefer met one somewhat overweight recruit in a ""safe house"" who said he wears a suicide belt to every battle because he is too chubby to run away if he is cornered and would choose to blow himself up, rather than be captured. ISIS also has a track record of abusing, torturing and executing prisoners of war. Todenhoefer was briefly able to speak to a Kurdish captive while in Mosul. The captive claimed he had not been tortured, but Todenhoefer said he found that hard to believe. ""This was a broken man,"" Todenhoefer said. ""It was very sad to see a person in this state. He was just very weak and very afraid of his captors."" Todenhoefer conducted the interview with the prisoner while several ISIS fighters stood guard. He asked the man whether he knew what would happen to him. ""I do not know,"" the captive told him. ""My family does not even know I am still alive. I hope that maybe there will be some sort of prisoner exchange."" Child ISIS fighters . Todenhoefer was also taken to see child soldiers outfitted with Islamic State gear and brandishing AK-47s. One of the boys seemed very young but claimed he had already gone to battle for ISIS. ""How old are you?"" Todenhoefer asked. ""I am 13 years old,"" the boy replied -- though he looked even younger than that. One of the most remarkable episodes of Todenhoefer's trip to the ISIS-controlled region came when he was able to conduct an interview with a German fighter who spoke on behalf of ISIS's leadership. The man -- clearly unapologetic about the group's transgressions -- vowed there was more to come; he also issued a warning to Europe and the United States. ""So you also want to come to Europe?"" Todenhoefer asked him. ""No, we will conquer Europe one day,"" the man said. ""It is not a question of if we will conquer Europe, just a matter of when that will happen. But it is certain ... For us, there is no such thing as borders. There are only front lines. ""Our expansion will be perpetual ... And the Europeans need to know that when we come, it will not be in a nice way. It will be with our weapons. And those who do not convert to Islam or pay the Islamic tax will be killed."" Todenhoefer asked the fighter about their treatment of other religions, especially Shia Muslims. ""What about the 150 million Shia, what if they refuse to convert?"" Todenhoefer asked. ""150 million, 200 million or 500 million, it does not matter to us,"" the fighter answered. ""We will kill them all."" Beheadings . The interview became testy when they reached the topic of beheadings and enslavement, especially of female captives. ""So do you seriously think that beheadings and enslavement actually signal progress for humanity?"" Todenhoefer asked. ""Slavery absolutely signals progress,"" the man said. ""Only ignorant people believe that there is no slavery among the Christians and the Jews. Of course there are woman who are forced into prostitution under the worst circumstances. ""I would say that slavery is a great help to us and we will continue to have slavery and beheadings, it is part of our religion ... many slaves have converted to Islam and have then been freed."" The ISIS spokesman blamed the beheading of captured Western journalists and aid workers on the policies of the United States. ""People should really think about the case of James Foley,"" he said. ""He did not get killed because we started the battle. He got killed because of the ignorance of his government that did not give him any help."" Even with recent gains by Kurdish forces against ISIS in northern Iraq, Todenhoefer sees the extremist group as entrenched, building state institutions, and that it shows no sign of losing its grip in the main areas it controls in Iraq and Syria. ""I think the Islamic State is a lot more dangerous than Western leaders realize,"" he said. ""They believe in what they are fighting for and are preparing the largest religious cleansing campaign the world has ever seen.""READ MORE: Fighting for Kobani -- from a distance .

"(CNN) -- June 12  Presidential elections are held following a campaign that saw huge rallies held in support of both incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and main opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi, suggesting the race would be closely fought. Incumbent Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad casts his vote in Tehran last week. June 13  Moussavi calls for vote counting to stop, saying there are ""blatant violations."" The government says Ahmadinejad won the ballot with 62.63 percent of the vote, while Moussavi received 33.75 percent of the vote.  Following the announcement, angry crowds in Iran's capital break into shops, tear down signs and start fires as they protest the re-election of Ahmadinejad.  June 14 Ahmadinejad gives victory speech, declines to guarantee the safety of Moussavi. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei gives his blessing to the outcome of the election. Authorities close Arabic network Al-Arabiya's Tehran bureau for a week without offering a reason.   Protests continue by Moussavi supporters, triggering a counterreaction from supporters of Ahmadinejad, tens of thousands of whom rallied in central Tehran. Men on motorcycles -- reportedly Ahmadinejad backers -- chase demonstrators and beat them with clubs, metal batons and baseball bats.  June 15 Khamenei agrees to an investigation into the disputed presidential election and asks opposition leader Moussavi to pursue his allegation of ballot fraud through legal means.   Moussavi supporters take to the streets in the largest protest since the 1979 revolution. Moussavi makes his first public appearance since the vote. At least 8 people are reported dead -- one at the end of the protest, the others after allegedly attacking a military post.   Mohammad Ali Abtahi -- a former vice president who backed pro-reform presidential candidate, Mehdi Karrubi -- is arrested.  Media rights group Reporters Without Borders urges nations not to recognize the results of the election, citing censorship and a crackdown on journalists.  June 16 Iran's Guardian Council election authority, a body of senior clerics and judges, agrees to recount some votes. Ahmadinejad leaves for Russia to meet with President Dmitry Medvedev. He is welcomed as the ""newly re-elected president of Iran."" Ahmadinejad returns to Iran later the same day. Moussavi rejects the recount, saying it will be misused add more credence to a fraudulent ballot. He calls for fresh elections. With rival rallies planned by backers of both Moussavi and Ahmadinejad in the center of Tehran, Moussavi urges his supporters to stay away, fearing further violence. Iran's Ministry of Culture issues a ban on foreign media reporting from the streets of Tehran, meaning international news crews including CNN were not allowed to leave their hotels and offices. Thousands of people take to the streets in support of both sides in the disputed election. Iran's all-powerful leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, appeals to the country's people to stand behind the Islamic republic. June 17 Iran's Revolutionary Guard, a powerful military force that enforces strict Islamic codes, threatens legal actions against Web sites it says are inciting violence. It also accuses U.S. and Canadian companies, including American intelligence agencies, for financially and technically supporting the Web sites. Moussavi's supporters take to streets of Tehran in a fifth day of demonstrations, staging what is billed as a ""silent protest,"" with some marchers wearing tape over their mouths. Rally passes without violence. Rights group Amnesty International says other protests are staged in other cities across Iran. Iran's national football team wears green arm and wrist bands during a World Cup qualifying match in South Korea, a symbol taken by many to indicate solidarity with Moussavi's supporters. June 18 Thousands of supporters of Mir Hossein Moussavi protest for a sixth consecutive day, many trading their green clothes for black garments in honor of at least eight protesters killed Monday. Meanwhile, in a televised speech, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad claims remarks he made on Sunday were taken out of context. After claiming victory in the elections, Ahmadinejad compared the putative losers to fans of a losing soccer team. ""I was addressing those who started riots and set up fires and attacked people,"" he told the state-run news agency IRINN. Press TV reports that Iran's Intelligence Ministry said it had arrested a number of ""main agents"" behind vandalism during the daily demonstrations. June 19 In his first public appearance since the elections, supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei endorses Ahmadinejad's win, insisting the margin of victory -- some 11 million votes -- was too large to have been manipulated. Khamenei expresses his support for Ahmadinejad and calls for an end to the protests, which he accused foreign powers including Britain, Israel and the United States of helping foment. He urged critics of the electoral process to seek redress through legal channels and warned that perpetrators of violent unrest would be punished.","President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad wins ballot with 62.63 percent of the vote .

"The rapid sweep of Islamic militants from Syria into northern Iraq has sent the Middle East into crisis, caused alarm in capitals from Tehran to Washington and forced about half a million people to flee their homes. The flood of Iraqis trying to escape ISIS fighters doubled the country's displaced population almost overnight. More than 1.1 million people -- nearly one out of 30 -- in Iraq are now displaced.

"A 51-year-old woman shown in a video being repeatedly punched by a California Highway Patrol officer has reached a $1.5 million settlement with the law enforcement agency, its media relations office said. The beating suffered by Marlene Pinnock, a great-grandmother, took place in July along the Santa Monica Freeway and was caught on tape by a passing motorist. Her family then vowed to bring a civil case against the agency. As a result of the settlement, the officer involved, Daniel L. Andrew, has agreed to resign, the CHP media relations office said. ""When this incident occurred, I promised that I would look into it and vowed a swift resolution. Today, we have worked constructively to reach a settlement agreement that is satisfactory to all parties involved,"" said California Highway Patrol Commissioner Joe Farrow in a statement. The bulk of the settlement will be used to set up a special needs trust for Pinnock ""to provide a mechanism for her long term care,"" he said. A police report released a few days after the incident said Pinnock posed a danger to herself and other drivers because she was ""walking within traffic lanes"" at times and when asked to stop she became ""physically combative."" She was placed in a hospital under an involuntary psychiatric hold.","An officer was caught on videotape beating Marlene Pinnock, a great-grandmother .

"""I wanted to build a good future for my family, but I failed,"" a weak Issam Abdallah Mohammed said in a videotaped statement. The refugee from the Darfur region of Sudan was trying to illegally cross the border from Egypt to Israel when he was discovered and shot by Egyptian border guards. Less than an hour after taping the statement, Issam was dead, succumbing to the wounds inflicted by the gunshots. Every year, thousands of refugees, mostly from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan, attempt the dangerous journey from their war-torn countries to Israel in search of economic prosperity and stability. Very few make it, and the results of the failed migration can be seen in the morgue of the central hospital in the Egyptian port town of El Arish. When a CNN crew visited there recently, all the refrigeration units were broken, leaving a biting stench of decaying corpses in the air, which staff members attempted in vain to cover up with chlorine-based cleaner and incense. On any given day, the morgue will be packed with the bodies of African refugees who died trying to make it to Israel. Hamdy Al-Azazy spends a lot of time here as head of the New Generation Foundation for Human Rights, which tries to help African refugees in Egypt. Every week, Al-Azazy combs the desert, searching for corpses, ensuring that they get a dignified burial. He has spent the past seven years helping the refugees. Many are enslaved and tortured and the women raped by the Bedouin tribes of the Sinai if they are unable to come up with large sums of money the Bedouin try to extort from them and their families, to smuggle the refugees across the border into Israel. As a result, many remain imprisoned in camps on the Sinai Peninsula. ""They are chained and kept in camps in the open with no bathrooms and little water and food and treated worse than animals,"" Al-Azazy said. ""Some of them are taken to Libya, but 80% of them are smuggled to Israel. Those who escape are shot by the Bedouins, and others who make it to the border are sometimes shot by the Egyptian authorities and transferred to hospitals before spending a year in different prisons in Sinai and deported back home."" The CNN crew found two victims in the hospital in El Arish, handcuffed to their beds and awaiting their transfer to an Egyptian detention center and eventual deportation. One of them, Mahary Taklay Abraham of Eritrea, says he hit his head falling off a rock while trying to cross the border and was caught by Egyptian border guards. But before making it to the border, Mahary says, he spent about two months with the Bedouins. ""They beat and tortured me continuously and demanded money from my family,"" Mahary said. Al-Azazy says this is a common scheme. The refugees will pay Bedouin tribes in the border area between Sudan and Egypt around $2,000 to be smuggled out. The smugglers then sell the refugees to the Sinai Bedouin, who blackmail the refugees and their families back home. Ibrahim Yehia of Eritrea says he fell prey to the Bedouin. ""When we arrived to Sinai, the Bedouins tied me up with metal chains in the desert. They tortured us. Many of us died,"" he said, displaying his wounds, including scars that he says came from electroshock torture. ""They wanted me to pay $12,000 and forced us to call our families to transfer the money. My family sold all their lands and even their donkey to collect the money. They transferred $6,000 to the Bedouins."" After his family paid, Yehia says, the Bedouin finally let him go. ""I spent three months tied up in the camp close to the Israeli border. After I paid, the Bedouins drove me to the border crossing and set me free. I was then shot by plainclothes men close to the wired fence at the Israeli-Egyptian border. The military took me to the hospital."" Some of the refugees are forced into slave labor, often working marijuana fields that flourish all over Northern Sinai, Hamdy Al-Azazy says. Refugees who made it across the border into Israel have told harrowing accounts of rape, torture and slave labor. Women are especially vulnerable. CNN spoke to one victim who made it to Israel and spoke on condition of anonymity. She said she was raped almost daily on a journey that took several months to get to Tel Aviv. ""Every night, they took me separately, and they did whatever they wanted to my body,"" the Eritrean said. Al-Azazy hears stories like this all the time. ""The women and men are kept in open areas. These Bedouins don't have any morals or conscience. One girl told me that three Bedouins had raped 14 girls in one night,"" he said. When CNN confronted a leader of the Sawarka Bedouin tribe, one of the largest in Sinai, the chief said he was aware that people trafficking is going on in Sinai and that in some cases African refugees are held in bonded labor, tortured and women raped. The Sawarka chief, who did not want to be named for this report, said that only rogue elements of the tribe are involved in people trafficking. This same chief took CNN to a secret location and allowed them to speak to five African refugees who were hoping to make it to Israel, in an apparent bid to show us that the refugees were being well treated. But interviews with refugees who have escaped the camps or been released suggest that mistreatment and even murder are commonplace in the Bedouin camps. One Bedouin leader willing to go on record is called Salem, a powerful chief of the Tarabine tribe. He acknowledges that people trafficking exists among members of the Tarabine and Sawarka tribes, but he says that it is only a fraction of the members who are involved in the trade and that they are ruthless. ""You can't label the whole tribe or implicate it in this trade. The Bedouins in Sinai are over 150,000. Those working in this business will not exceed more than 50 people."" During an interview by the Red Sea, Salem said he loathes those involved in people trafficking, torture, rape and murder. But he acknowledges that Bedouin leaders are doing little to stop the illicit business out of fear of stoking tribal infighting. ""These guys are evil. They do not care where to get money. They deal with a middleman in Africa to get those men. These Africans spend months here, sometimes up to six months in Sinai, before crossing -- if they cross."" Egypt's government and armed forces seem powerless to stop the Bedouin smugglers. Police units have been forced out of most areas in North Sinai after the revolution that swept longtime leader Hosni Mubarak from power. A military operation aimed at combating Islamist extremists in the area has done little to stop people trafficking in this lawless region that runs mostly on criminal activity, such as smuggling of goods into Gaza and drug trafficking. Meanwhile, more bodies turn up in the Sinai desert. In a matter of weeks, several more were buried by Hamdy Al-Azazy close to the grave of Issam Abdallah Mohammed, the refugee from Darfur who recorded a video shortly before his death. While the bodies of those who can be identified are buried in cemeteries in El Arish, the many corpses that remain nameless -- because they carry no identity cards or have decomposed beyond recognition -- are laid to rest outside the cemetery walls in an anonymous mass grave under heaps of trash from an adjacent slum.","Every year, thousands attempt dangerous journey from African countries to Israel .

"(CNN)ISIS has released a new propaganda video showing what appears to be Kurdish Peshmerga fighters paraded down Iraqi streets in cages. The video features a man saying the Peshmerga soldiers were captured by ISIS. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video. But it shows at least 21 men in orange outfits hauled in the cages atop the beds of pickup trucks. A man with a microphone bearing the ISIS logo interviews some of the captives, who say they are Peshmerga soldiers. Most of those interviewed say they are from Kirkuk. The prisoners, under duress, call on their fellow Peshmerga soldiers to give up their fight against ISIS. The video also features superimposed bios for each prisoner. One captive is described as an officer for the Iraqi army. The heavily edited footage also includes flashing clips of the recent beheadings of Christian Egyptians in Libya. It's not clear what happened to those in the video. The last scene shows them alive. But a man in the video gives an ominous warning. ""We say to the Peshmerga: Leave your jobs, or your fate will be like these, either the cage, or under the ground,"" he says in Kurdish. The Peshmerga are armed forces protecting Kurdistan, a semiautonomous region in northern Iraq. The fighters opposed Saddam Hussein's regime and supported the United States in Operation Iraqi Freedom. In recent months, the Peshmerga have been battling ISIS as the terror group tries to establish a radical Islamic state across parts of Iraq and Syria. Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the video released by ISIS. While the video shows that the caged prisoners are threatened with execution, they are shown alive at the end of the video. CNN's Ben Wedeman and Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.","It's not clear what happened to the Peshmerga fighters in the video .

"Washington (CNN) -- Top U.S. and European leaders called Thursday for Syria's president to step down, significantly ratcheting up international pressure against a regime that has been criticized for its harsh crackdown against anti-government protesters. ""The future of Syria must be determined by its people, but President Bashar al-Assad is standing in their way,"" President Barack Obama said in a written statement. ""We have consistently said that President Assad must lead a democratic transition or get out of the way. He has not led. For the sake of the Syrian people, the time has come for President Assad to step aside."" The leaders of Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the European Union echoed Obama's demand. ""Our three countries believe that President Assad, who is resorting to brutal military force against his own people and who is responsible for the situation, has lost all legitimacy and can no longer claim to lead the country,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a joint statement. ""We call on him to face the reality of the complete rejection of his regime by the Syrian people and to step aside in the best interests of Syria and the unity of its people."" U.S. officials, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, have said they expect similar calls for al-Assad to step down in coming days from other leaders. American authorities also imposed new economic sanctions against Damascus Thursday, freezing Syrian government assets in the United States, barring Americans from making new investments in that country and prohibiting any U.S. transactions relating to Syrian petroleum products, among other things. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States ""will take steps to mitigate any unintended effects of the (new) sanctions on the Syrian people."" ""These actions strike at the heart of the regime,"" Clinton said, noting that the United States expects other countries ""will amplify the steps we are taking."" Syrian president claims military operations have stopped . Within the United States, some opposition Republicans were quick to back Obama's decision. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, called Syria ""a proxy for Iran, a supporter of terror, and a threat to United States interests and our allies in the region. "" Other Republicans, however, argued Obama waited too long to call for al-Assad's removal. ""America must show leadership on the world stage and work to move these developing nations toward modernity,"" said former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a leading GOP presidential contender. ""This means using the bullhorn of the presidency and not remaining silent for too long while voices of freedom and dissent are under attack."" The White House previously said al-Assad had ""lost legitimacy,"" but resisted calling explicitly for his ouster. Senior administration officials stressed in a conference call with reporters Thursday that they wanted to ensure international coordination and properly prepare a new round of sanctions before moving ahead with a call for al-Assad's removal. The new U.S. sanctions ""are very strong measures,"" said Andrew J. Tabler, Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ""These are also unprecedented. We've never targeted Syria energy before. It is the regime's Achilles' heel."" Tabler -- author of ""In the Lion's Den: An Eyewitness Account of Washington's Battle with Syria"" -- said no one expects al-Assad ""to tip over tomorrow,"" but ""these are devastating blows."" He said 90% of Syria's oil sales go to European Union countries, and noted that the EU is meeting Friday to do the same thing that the United States has done. Oil and gas make up about a quarter of Syria's economy, according to the International Monetary Fund. Senior U.S. officials, diplomats and members of the Syrian opposition have argued that the next several weeks will be critical in terms of isolating al-Assad, strengthening sanctions against the regime, and bolstering domestic opponents of the regime. U.S. strategy on Syria from Libya playbook . The campaign against Syria's leadership, involving intense diplomatic outreach by both Clinton and Obama, has been based on the one the United States used in Libya, where the U.S. administration built international consensus for the NATO mission to protect civilians. But U.S. and European authorities remain opposed to any military intervention in Syria -- a sharp contrast to their response to regime-sponsored violence in Libya. ""I don't think anybody believes that is the desired course of action on Syria,"" one senior administration official said Thursday. Jordan, Turkey join calls for Syria to end violence . Several Middle Eastern countries with traditionally close ties to Syria, including Turkey and Saudi Arabia, have been consulted in recent weeks, according to senior administration officials. U.N. panel: Possible crimes against humanity in Syria . Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council will hold consultations on Syria on Thursday, when council members are scheduled to be briefed by the organization's high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay. Officials said Pillay is expected to give a sober assessment of the situation, despite al-Assad's insistence to the U.N. Wednesday that military and police operations against anti-government protesters had stopped. A U.N. fact-finding mission announced Thursday it has found Syria guilty of multiple human rights violations, and indicated it may be time for the International Criminal Court to become involved. ""The mission found a pattern of human rights violations that constitutes widespread or systematic attacks against the civilian population, which may amount to crimes against humanity,"" investigation staffers concluded in their report. France and other European countries are continuing to push for a Security Council resolution condemning the al-Assad regime, but they are still facing stiff resistance from Russia, China, Brazil, India and South Africa. The United States is pushing for special session on Syria at the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland, as early as next week. Diplomats say they hope Pillay's briefing Thursday will generate momentum for further action, including additional calls for al-Assad to step down over the coming days. ""We're certain that Assad is on the way out,"" one senior U.S. administration official said Thursday. ""That is our assessment. ... (His) time in power is limited and his days are numbered."" CNN's Elise Labott, Alan Silverleib and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","President Obama says Bashar al-Assad is standing in the way of Syria's future .

"Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was re-elected in the country's first presidential vote since its civil war broke out three years ago, state-run television reported Wednesday. Al-Assad received 88.7% of Tuesday's vote, the state media outlet said, in an election that took place only in areas controlled by the government. Rebels hold significant parts of the north and east of the country. Opposition groups and many Western countries have said the voting was rigged and that al-Assad's two little-known challengers -- Hassan al-Nouri, a businessman and former government minister, and Maher Hajjar, a lawmaker -- were just window dressing to give the undertaking a veneer of democracy. But the Syrian government has dismissed any criticism of the process. Al-Nouri received 4.3% of the vote, and Hajjar received 3.2%, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported, citing Parliament Speaker Mohammad Jihad al-Laham. The voting comes as war continues to rage in Syria. The United Nations estimates more than 100,000 people have been killed in the Middle Eastern nation since an uprising began in March 2011. That includes more fighting on Wednesday. The Local Coordination Committees in Syria, a network of opposition activists, reports on its Facebook page that at least 24 people were killed in violence nationwide, including eight in Aleppo province and six in and around Damascus. In a nod to this ongoing warfare, al-Assad urged people not to fire guns into the air as an ""expression of our joy and enthusiasm"" -- saying doing so threatens citizens' lives and dishonors Syrian troops on the frontlines. In a posting on the presidency's Facebook page, cited by SANA, al-Assad told citizens to voice their feelings about the vote ""in a way that reflects our high morals and civilization as Syrians."" Yet not everyone believed the election was worth celebrating -- or that it should have been held at all. The office of U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon had urged the Syrian government not to hold the election, warning it would ""damage the political process and hamper the prospects for a political solution"" to the civil war. The Islamic Front, one of the largest armed rebel groups, claimed the al-Assad government was blackmailing people to vote in what it called a fake election. The British Foreign Office said the vote would ""be a grotesque parody of democracy,"" and the U.S. State Department said the al-Assad government took steps ""to make it difficult if not impossible to have a fair and free election in Syria."" The Syrian government said election monitors from the United States, the European Union or the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe wouldn't be present, but observers from some other countries would be. Syria isn't renowned for holding free and fair elections. When al-Assad came to power 14 years ago, he ran unopposed, securing more than 99% of the vote, according to state media. Seven years later, he won again with a similarly mountainous share of the vote. His father, Hafez al-Assad, ruled Syria with an iron fist for 29 years before he died in 2000.

"(CNN)Is it ISIL, ISIS or Islamic State? Whatever you call the jihadist group known for killing dozens of people at a time, carrying out public executions, beheadings, crucifixions and other brutal acts, there is no denying they have captured the world's attention. On the eve of President Barack Obama's speech outlining Washington's strategy against the group, in which he will likely refer to it as ISIL, we ask: What's in a name? It all started in 2004 when the late Abu Musab al-Zarqawi formed an al Qaeda splinter group in Iraq. Within two years, al-Zarqawi's al Qaeda in Iraq was trying to fuel a sectarian war against the majority Shiite community. In June 2006, al-Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. strike. Abu Ayyub al-Masri, his successor, several months later announced the creation of the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI). In April 2013, Islamic State in Iraq absorbed the al Qaeda-backed militant group in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as the al-Nusra Front. Its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi said his group will now be known as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. Since then, the English-speaking world seems to have had a hard time settling on a name for them. ISIL . President Obama, the United Nations and some news organizations refer to the jihadist group by the acronym ISIL, which stands for Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. CNN Global Affairs Correspondent Elise Labott said the U.S. has stuck with ISIL because the group appears to have to set it sights beyond Iraq and Syria. And also because Washington doesn't want to recognize their plans for a caliphate. CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen believes ISIL is a more accurate translation of the group's name. The 'L' stands for Levant which is a translation of ""al-Sham"" -- the word the group uses to refer to itself, Bergen said. ""But the Levant is a relatively obscure word in English -- in English, we refer to Syria. Of course, the Levant is larger than Syria,"" Bergen said. ""We believe this is the most accurate translation of the group's name and reflects its aspirations to rule over a broad swath of the Middle East,"" said John Daniszewski, vice president and senior managing editor for international news for The Associated Press, according to an AP blog post. Al-Sham is a reference to a region that stretches from Turkey through Syria to Egypt and includes the Palestinian territories, Jordan and Lebanon, according to Rashid Khalidi, a Columbia University professor and expert on Syrian history. Part of the confusion stems from the fact that al-Sham has many meanings in Arabic. Khalidi said: ""How you translate 'al-Sham' determines whether you have an 'L' or an 'S' in English. It's the same word in Arabic. How you translate the term into English determines if you're of the 'ISIL' camp or the 'ISIS' camp. The Levant, which can extend from northern Egypt to Greece, is not as precise."" On the United States government's use of ISIL, Khalidi surmised: ""Maybe because you don't want to give the dignity of the name that they give themselves."" Nawaf Obaid, a visiting fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University, said via email that ISIL is preferable in English ""to make it clear to a Western audience."" Levant denotes Syria and Lebanon in Arabic, ""so better to stick to ISIL and clarify that it's the same as ISIS, but a more accurate translation from the Arabic,"" he said. ISIS . ISIS is an English translation of  the acronym in Arabic for Al-Dawla Al-Islamiya fi al-Iraq wa al-Sham, or the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham. The organization has said its goal is to form an Islamic state, or caliphate, over the entire region, stretching from Turkey through Syria to Egypt and including the Palestinian territories, Jordan and Lebanon. Some think ISIS flows better as a word in English. It also happens to be the name of one of a goddess of ancient Egypt. CNN has been referring to the organization as ISIS, shorthand for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Arabic speakers say al-Sham can be translated to mean the Levant, Syria, greater Syria, and even Damascus. Islamic State . The jihadists like to refer to themselves simply as the Islamic State, a term more accurately reflecting the organization's aspirations of creating a caliphate across national borders. They prefer to be known either as the Islamic State -- al-Dawla al-Islamiya in Arabic -- or just the State, al-Dawla. That is what they call themselves in online videos. DAIISH . Finally, a lesser-known acronym to Western readers: DAIISH. It is the straight Arabic shorthand for the group known as: al-Dawla al-Islamiya fi Iraq wa al-Sham, commonly used in the Arab world and among many Arab media outlets and politicians. When people in the Arab world, use the term DAIISH, it's derogatory, according to Columbia's Khalidi. ""Those who disagree with them, call them DAIISH,"" Khalidi said, adding that the jihadists have objected to the name.","ISIS is translation of the acronym in Arabic for the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham .

"Washington (CNN) -- A year after a Washington, D.C., subway crash killed nine people and injured dozens, federal accident investigators on Tuesday blamed faulty track circuits for the wreck, but also criticized the numerous local and federal entities entrusted with keeping passengers safe. The National Transportation Safety Board said the June 22, 2009, accident was preventable. Its report said the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) failed to ensure that a verification test developed after an earlier incident was used system-wide. The test would have identified the faulty track circuit before the accident, the NTSB said. The accident near the Fort Totten Station on the system's Red Line occurred when one train struck the rear car of a stopped train. Automated systems should have prevented the two trains from occupying the same stretch of track at the same time. ""The layers of safety deficiencies uncovered during the course of this investigation are troubling and reveal a systemic breakdown of safety management at all levels,"" NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said. Hersman said the safety board hopes the accident will be a catalyst for change at WMATA and lead to greater federal oversight and improved safety standards for rail transit systems nationwide. The board said a ""lack of a safety culture"" within WMATA contributed to the accident, as did ineffective oversight by WMATA's board of directors and the Tri-State Oversight Committee, a little-known organization responsible for overseeing Metro safety. The safety board also said the Federal Transit Administration's ""lack of statutory authority"" contributed to the situation. A federal law passed in 1965 prohibits the federal transit authorities from setting standards for local subway systems. Following the Metro accident, the Obama administration proposed changing the law to allow the federal government to set standards and increase oversight of local subway systems. Earlier this year, the NTSB added improved subway car design to its list of ""most wanted"" transportation safety improvements. The safety board is recommending that the government set standards for the ability of transit cars to withstand crashes, as well as the ability of passengers to get out of damaged cars.","A federal report criticizes the safety record of Washington's subway system .

"To the outside world, they're a force of ruthless yet mysterious insurgents bent on terrorizing civilians and expanding Islamist rule. But as one former ISIS fighter tells CNN, the mentality goes much deeper. ""The main and principal goal of the Islamic State that they tell their new members is to establish an Islamic state that will encompass the Arab world,"" the man said in Turkey. ""And after that, we go to other countries."" Just two weeks ago, the man was in Raqqa, the ISIS stronghold in northern Syria. Like many cities across Syria and Iraq, Raqqa has been overrun by ISIS militants who show no mercy for those who don't follow their hard line. Crucifixions and public executions take place virtually every day. Women not fully covered in niqabs are lashed with alarming frequency. Even store owners who leave their shops open during times of prayer can get beaten or sent to prison. The former insurgent, in his 20s, left ISIS two weeks ago because he said the group is ""spreading injustice in the name of justice."" But he still agrees with the ideology of the group that is forcing its beliefs on everyday life, including in education. ""Philosophy is prohibited; they canceled it as a kind of blasphemy,"" he said. ""Many subjects have been canceled, like music and even sometimes sports. All of them have been canceled from the school curriculum."" Perhaps the only thing as disturbing as ISIS' terror rampage is the growing number of foreigners joining its ranks. Thousands of foreign fighters are estimated to have joined ISIS. And the ex-ISIS militant said these foreigners could carry out attacks when they go home, but security measures in those countries could make it difficult -- at least for now. ""Since Western fighters joined ISIS, they consider their home country as infidels,"" he said. ""If they have a chance, they will carry out attacks."" The United Kingdom is already on high alert, raising its terror threat level from ""substantial"" to ""severe"" on Friday. Prime Minister David Cameron has proposed a radical new measure to ban Britons from coming home once they join jihadi ranks abroad. And the United States got a harsh reminder of ISIS' reach when Douglas McAuthur McCain, a 33-year-old from the Midwest, became the first known American to be killed while fighting for ISIS. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has called ISIS ""beyond just a terrorist group."" ""They marry ideology, a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess,"" he said last week. ""This is beyond anything we have seen, and we must prepare for everything."" ISIS may have wanted to show off its global reach by having a militant with a British accent front the videos of the beheadings of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. And that kind of tactic could also inspire more foreigners, the former ISIS fighter told CNN. ""It is possible that the goal was to project the image that a European, or a Western person, executed an American so that they can showcase their Western members and appeal to others outside Syria and make them feel that they belong to the same cause.""

"The companies that make 3-D printers want a spot in your home. They're just not sure exactly why you need one of their futuristic devices yet. The 3-D printing industry is taking aim at entry-level customers with cheaper, easier-to-use hardware and online marketplaces filled with predesigned files. At the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the 3-D printing section was larger and busier than in previous years and had an increased focus on consumer-friendly products. The technology is trying hard to become mainstream, but first it needs to figure out what average people will really want to create. What is a 3-D printer for? Entry-level 3-D printers are popular with makers and crafters, people who want to get their hands dirty and create prototypes, figurines and small toys. People are constantly experimenting with the devices, trying out unconventional uses like printing guns, fashion accessories and fine art. These hobbyists are a fairly minor market when compared to the lofty aspirations of the consumer 3-D printing industry, which imagines a 3-D printer in every home, like paper printers were before people realized printing on paper was passé. ""There's no killer app yet,"" said Trevor Townsend, co-owner of Matterform, a 3-D scanner company. The people selling printers, files and scanners aren't discouraged by the lack of an obvious use case. They seem confident that it will come in the next few years as more people get their hands on the devices and start experimenting, and as the technology becomes more advanced and takes on a wider range of materials. Plastic is the most commonly used material, but it is just the beginning. 3DSystems demonstrated its ChefJet 3-D food printer at CES, which creates complex shapes out of edible materials such as sugar and chocolate and will cost less than $5,000. The company also is working on a product that prints ceramics. The CeraJet concept device would take pottery to another level with complex designs that can be glazed and fired. Even at this early stage, the demand for 3-D printers is rising. Shipments of 3-D printers will grow 75% in 2014, according to market research firm Gartner. It expects the consumer 3-D printing market to hit $133 million this year, which is still far less than the $536 million companies will spend on the product. New crop of consumer products . At CES, the printer companies were focusing on a more immediate problem: 3-D printing is too complicated for the average person. Designing a model and creating a workable file takes skill, and the machines themselves can require technical know-how and adjustments like leveling to get a decent final product. The newest hardware is trying to make 3-D printing simple. MakerBot announced a new one-button 3-D printer called the MakerBot Mini. Files can be sent directly to the compact printer from a mobile phone or tablet over WiFi. One push of a button and the Mini will start creating the object in PLA plastic. A big barrier to mass adoption of 3-D printers is price, and hardware costs are falling every year. When it comes out in May, the Mini will cost $1,375. That is around $1,500 less than the company's flagship product, the MakerBot Replicator. There are a number of less expensive 3-D printer options already on the market, some as cheap as $200. To make 3-D printing completely hassle free, there are companies that handle the actual dirty work of printing. Services like Sculpteo create small batches of 3-D printed objects and let the designer control the process online. UPS and Staples are testing in-store 3-D printer services. A number of companies are trying to make the design process easier, too; 3-D scanners can take precise photographs of existing objects from every angle to create a printable 3-D file. Matterform showed off its consumer-friendly 3-D scanner at CES. The $579 scanner looks like a portable record player and can scan objects up to 9.8-inches tall. MakerBot also recently released an entry level scanner called the MakerBot Digitizer. Another twist on scanning comes from 3DSystems, which demonstrated a 3-D photo booth. The 3DMe booth scans a person's face and then prints it on an existing figurine body such as a ""Star Trek"" crew member. MakerBot is betting that many people will pay to use existing 3-D files instead of having to create their own. The company announced its new MakerBot Digital Store at CES, a sort of iTunes for 3-D content. Prices start at 99 cents, and the first designs are focused on kids and families. There are cars, characters, animals and other cute 3-D models, all original content created by MakerBot. The future might break the law . The MakerBot Digital Store doesn't carry replicas of existing products or commercial characters. That's because without licensing deals, it could step into the murky world of 3-D intellectual property law. While it's still a couple years off, the threat of litigation will become a major issue in 3-D printing down the line. One of the more practical future uses for a 3-D printer includes replacing broken parts, say a cracked plastic base to an Oster blender. The part costs a few dollars online, but in the future it could be easier, faster and cheaper to simply print out a replacement at home. But unless you buy the file from Oster, are you stealing it? If companies decide to crack down on user-created files, 3-D objects could be pirated like movies and music. Whatever the legal, technical and practical challenges, 3-D printing has its eyes on the future. It's still a long way from being an in-home ""Star Trek"" style replicator, but the industry is confident it will have enough uses to warrant a spot in your home office or kitchen.","3-D printers are aiming at consumers with cheaper, easier-to-use devices .

"In some of the most gruesome images yet to emerge from the latest mass violence in Syria, videos show militants raising their victims' severed heads on poles. The amateur videos emerged as a Syrian human rights group reported 1,600 deaths in just 10 days this month. The latest images come from an area taken over by the militant terrorist group the Islamic State, which recently changed its name from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. The group is known for killing dozens of people at a time and beheading some. At least three videos posted on YouTube by different people show the grisly scene at a roundabout in the city of Reqqa, where Islamic State militants have been carrying out public executions, crucifixions and other acts decided by its Sharia, or Islamic law, court. A narrator in one of the videos says the bodies are of Syrian soldiers who were killed by Islamic State fighters. The videos surfaced online along with news that Islamic State took over the Syrian army's 17th Division headquarters, which was considered the Syrian regime's last remaining military base in Reqqa. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has tabulated casualties in the country's civil war, reported on Islamic State's seizure of the military base in late May. While fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza has gotten far more attention in recent days, the death toll in Syria has been higher. Between July 16 and July 25, 1,600 people were killed, the observatory said. And the bloodshed has continued at that pace. On Sunday, 180 people were killed, the group said. The observatory counts more than 115,000 people killed since the beginning of the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime in March 2011.","Videos show severed heads on poles .

"London, England (CNN) -- With competition still fierce in the jobs market, some people might be tempted to beef up their resume by buying a fake degree. The problem of fake degrees is nothing new, but the Internet has made it easier than ever to obtain a bogus qualification. George Gollin, a board member of the U.S.-based Council for Higher Education Accreditation, told CNN he estimates that more than 100,000 fake degrees are sold each year in the U.S. alone. Of those, around one third are postgraduate degrees. He added that a bogus degree will typically cost $1,000. By trade, Gollin is a physics professor at the University of Illinois. He first became interested in degree mills after being spammed with offers of fake college degrees. According to a story in Wired Magazine, his interest turned to outrage after he stumbled upon news of a forensic psychologist who had purchased her degree. ""Here's this person who's untrained doing therapeutic interventions,"" he told Wired. ""I thought, 'Jesus, this is really bad.'"" The institutions that sell these fake qualifications are known as either diploma mills or degree mills. Diploma mills issue fraudulent diplomas supposedly granted by real universities, while degree mills pose as real universities. According to Gollin, setting up a degree mill is simply a matter of creating a Web site that looks like it belongs to a genuine university. The Web site includes a way for customers to pay for their qualifications online and a place for prospective employers to contact to verify the degree is genuine. Some degree mills award degrees on the basis of the buyer's supposed ""life experience,"" while others require a small amount of coursework. One degree mill required about a week's worth of coursework to earn a masters degree. Gollin said this token coursework is largely for the customers' benefit -- to help them convince themselves they have earned their qualification. While some people might be duped into believing they are obtaining a legitimate qualification, Gollin said that almost everyone buying from a degree mill knows they are getting a fake. ""Anyone who's had any contact with a real college curriculum knows how hard you have to work,"" Gollin told CNN. ""If you can get a whole PhD over the course of one week and you don't know that's not legitimate, then you're just dumb."" But for some, knowingly buying a fake degree is an easy way of improving their job prospects. ""Generally, fake degrees are usually bought for economic advantage for people who are seeking promotion or seeking to get jobs where the employer wants them to have a degree,"" Gollin told CNN. Those people come from all walks of life. Gollin gave the example of one American who bought a Bachelor's degree in nuclear engineering, and who's now working in the control room of a nuclear power plant. He also cited a U.S. degree mill that sells fake PhDs to real medical doctors for $10,000, and added that unqualified doctors have been jailed in the U.S. after attempting to practice medicine with a medical degree bought online. According to the story in Wired, Gollin was instrumental in the case brought against a degree mill which operated various bogus universities, including Saint Regis University.   The ""Saint Regis"" degree mill was estimated to have made $7 million from selling fake qualifications to more than some 9,600 customers in 131 countries, according to Wired.   In 2008, the couple behind the Saint Regis degree mill were each jailed for three years. In the U.S., and other countries, it is illegal to issue what purports to be a university degree without the approval of a government agency. But degree mills are often set up in such a way that makes it very hard to track down the people running the operation. Gollin warned that degree mills are becoming increasingly sophisticated, often carrying official-seeming accreditation that makes them appear to be genuine universities. The catch is that the accreditation is supplied by bogus organizations -- ""accreditation mills."" If it's difficult for the authorities to keep tabs on the degree mills, it can be even harder for employers to spot if a potential employee has fake qualifications, but Gollin said there are steps that employers can take to guard against fraudsters. Many countries have government-run web sites where you can easily check if a university is officially accredited. But because diploma mills offer fake degrees from real universities, it is essential that employers also check with someone at the university that the degree was actually issued. If someone claims to have an advanced degree for which they should have written a thesis, they should be able to produce a copy of that thesis. If they can't provide contact details for their graduate studies advisor, be suspicious. But separating the real from the fake becomes even more complicated if a job candidate has a qualification obtained overseas. Not only can it be hard to verify that a foreign university is genuine, Gollin said there have been cases of professors at real universities in West Africa selling degrees on the side. He added that some legitimate U.S. universities are unwittingly partnering with degree mills that operate abroad. Gollin said, ""This is a very sophisticated problem and I think it will continue to be a concern as international education becomes more significant.""","Degree mills sell bogus qualifications online, often without requiring any study .
An expert says at least 100,000 fake degrees are sold in the U.S. each year .

"(CNN)After the death of King Abdullah, Saudi Arabia quickly announced that one of his younger brothers, Crown Prince Salman, was succeeding him. The man taking control of the world's top oil exporter is well established in the Gulf kingdom's corridors of power. Salman, 79, is ""a stalwart of the royal family"" who is ""viewed as a pragmatic and cautious reformer, much like his predecessor,"" says CNN's Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi. He has served as defense minister and deputy prime minister of Saudi Arabia, a vital U.S. ally in the Middle East, for years. Like Abdullah, he's one of the dozens of sons of Saudi Arabia's founder, King Abdulaziz. Here are some of the key points about the new ruler. Salman was governor of the Saudi capital, Riyadh, for nearly five decades during a period of significant change. ""When he became governor in 1963, Riyadh had 200,000 inhabitants — today it has more than seven million,"" Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center for Middle East Policy, said in a commentary. ""Salman presided over this remarkable transformation with a record for good governance and a lack of corruption."" ""He had to be a combination ... of a reformer, of a judge, a jury in some cases, and deal with dissent, as well as dealing with economic issues,"" Robert Jordan, a former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, told CNN. ""So I think he's well prepared for the task at hand."" Salman's experience running Riyadh also involved keeping many of the numerous members of the Saudi royal family in line. ""Since most of the royal princes and princesses live in Riyadh, he was also the family sheriff, ensuring any transgressions were dealt with smoothly and quietly, with no publicity,"" said Riedel, who worked for the CIA for 30 years. His national roles have since brought him wider responsibility. Salman ""has been chairing cabinet meetings for several months and handling almost all foreign travel responsibilities for the monarchy since he became the heir in 2012,"" Riedel said. Salman's ascension to the throne is in line with the appointments put in place by Abdullah before his death. ""I think that you'll see a continuation -- very similar policies, very similar dynamics unfolding,"" said James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute. ""The kingdom is modernizing; it's changing, it's reforming and it will continue to do so over the next several decades."" Riedel says the royal family ""values family collegiality and harmony highly."" ""The two previous Saudi kingdoms in the 18th and 19th centuries were wracked by internal family squabbles, which their foreign enemies exploited,"" he explains. ""With the Arab world facing its worst crisis in decades, the royals will want to present an image of stability and strength."" Salman's first order after assuming the throne was to appoint his youngest brother, Prince Muqrin, as the new crown prince. Analysts see that appointment as an effort to ensure future stability. Abdullah had named Muqrin as deputy crown prince in March. At 69 years old, Muqrin is relatively youthful. A former head of intelligence for the kingdom, he is also reportedly well-liked by world leaders. Muqrin ""has been closely linked to Abdullah and his policies of modernization and reform,"" according to Cordesman. But the succession plan isn't without its critics. Muqrin's mother does not have royal blood, which is a sticking point for some people in Saudi Arabia. Several of Salman's sons also hold prominent positions. They include Prince Sultan, who in the 1980s became the first Muslim astronaut and is now the president of Saudi Arabia's tourism authority; Prince Abdulaziz, the deputy oil minister; and Prince Faisal, the governor of the Medina region. Another son, Prince Khaled, was reportedly among the pilots who carried out the first airstrikes on ISIS positions in Syria last year. Details about Salman's earlier life and upbringing weren't immediately available Friday. But an official biography contained one nugget about his youth: he had apparently memorized the Quran by the age of 10, it said. King Abdullah's legacy: 5 things to know .

"The United States is sending more troops to northern Iraq, a move that U.S. officials told CNN on Tuesday is necessary to help in the rescue of tens of thousands of Yazidis trapped in the mountains by extremists who have vowed to kill them. About 130 Marines and special operations forces have been dispatched to Irbil, U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said, adding to the hundreds already in the country advising Iraqi troops in their fight against the Islamic State, formerly known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. ""Very specifically, this is not a combat boots on the ground operation. We are not going to have that kind of operation,"" Hagel said during an address at Camp Pendleton, a Marine base in California. ""But short of that, there are some things we can continue to do and we are doing."" Word of the additional American support came as embattled Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki ordered his troops to stay out of the political battle being waged in Baghdad, where he has vowed to hold on to power. Al-Maliki has vowed to fight the nomination of Haider al-Abadi, a man who has the support of the United States and Iran. The new Prime Minister-designate is the deputy speaker of the Iraqi Parliament and a former aide to al-Maliki. The United States hopes the designate will form a government quickly and build a united front against ISIS rebels, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said. Helicopter crashes during Yazidi rescue . The political turmoil has been playing out against the backdrop of a growing humanitarian crisis, with hundreds of thousands of Iraq's minority ethnic and religious minorities -- Yazidis, Christians, Kurds and others -- fleeing ISIS fighters. Nowhere is the crisis more evident than the Sinjar Mountains, where an estimated 40,000 minority Yazidis are hiding from the Sunni extremist fighters after fleeing their homes. Yazidis are considered one of the world's smallest and oldest monotheistic religious minorities, a pre-Islamic sect based in Zoroastrianism that draws from Hinduism, Christianity and Judaism. An Iraqi helicopter bringing aid to the group crashed after making its food and water drop and picking up roughly two dozen Yazidis. The pilot died in the crash, but others survived, the Kurdistan Regional Government said. Kurdish rescue crews transported them to safety, bringing the injured to hospitals, the government said. The military cited ""technical failure"" in the crash of the MI-17. Fuad Hussein, the Kurdish Regional Government's chief of staff, told CNN the crash appeared to have been caused by pilot error. Survivors included a woman who has come to symbolize the struggles of Yazidis. Vian Dakhil, the only Yazidi in Parliament, made a heart-wrenching appeal to the Iraqi government last week for help in stopping the slaughter of her people. New York Times journalist Alissa Rubin suffered ""a concussion, at least one broken wrist and possibly some broken ribs but was conscious,"" The Times reported. Freelance photographer Adam Ferguson ""said via cellphone text that he suffered a sore jaw and some minor bumps,"" the newspaper reported. Three helicopters are being used by the Iraqi military to reach the desperate Yazidi families who fled to the mountains more than a week ago, Hussein said. Yazidi plight . The plight of the Yazidis, coupled with the ISIS assault against Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region, prompted the United States to begin targeted airstrikes against ISIS. Airstrikes in northern Iraq have helped Iraqi troops and the Kurdish fighting force, known as the peshmerga, to carry out the missions. Until recently, the Kurdish region as considered the most stable in Iraq. The Kurds gained semiautonomous rule after the Iraq War. The deployment of more U.S. military advisers to northern Iraq comes as the Obama administration is looking to boost the capabilities of Kurdish forces. On Tuesday, the U.S. military carried out airstrikes against ISIS mortar positions north of Sinjar, the military's Central Command said. ISIS had been firing on Kurdish forces that were defending Yazidis who were trying to flee the area, Central Command said. ""ISIS has all sorts of sophisticated weapons,"" Hussein said. ISIS, previously known as al Qaeda in Iraq, seized a large number of U.S.-made weapons and vehicles after Iraqi military units in Iraq's second largest city of Mosul abandoned their posts and fled ahead of the militant advance. The group has tanks, armored vehicles, artillery and more, Hussein said. ""We need either the same kinds of weapons, or more sophisticated weapons, so that we can beat ISIS,"" he said. Treacherous journey for Yazidis . If the United States participates in the evacuation of the Yazidis, it may have to work with a group it designated a terrorist organization -- the PKK, also known as Kurdistan Workers Party. The PKK launched a guerrilla war against neighboring Turkey nearly 30 years ago, with an initial goal of establishing an independent Kurdish state. Hundreds of Yazidis managed to make it on foot down from Mount Sinjar, northward into Syria, in a region controlled by Kurds. They managed to trek along the border to a crossing point back into Iraq, where a CNN crew saw a number of them arrive Tuesday. ""If you're running for your life, you'll do it.

"Syrian President Bashar al-Assad indicated Monday he might consider a halt in fighting in the city of Aleppo to allow U.N. humanitarian aid into the beleaguered city, according to Syrian state-run SANA news agency. Aleppo is Syria's largest city, and rebels fighting the al-Assad regime still have a strong hold in parts of the city. Isis is also a threat in areas outside of Aleppo. Al-Assad met Monday in Damascus with U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura to discuss a U.N. proposal for a fighting ""freeze,"" which was first presented to the U.N. Security Council last month.  A U.N. statement called the meeting a ""constructive"" discussion. The plan ""merits consideration,"" al-Assad said after the meeting, according to the Syrian state-run news agency SANA. Aleppo would only be the first local ""freeze"" in Syria under the U.N. plan. ""The proposed 'freezes' as envisaged by the United Nations are intended first and foremost to lead to a de-escalation of violence, starting from specific areas with a national impact, and allow for return to some normalcy for the civilians caught in the conflict,"" the U.N Statement said.","Bashar al-Assad says a UN plan to ""freeze""  fighting in Aleppo ""merits consideration""

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actor Pernell Roberts, who played the eldest Cartwright brother in TV's ""Bonanza,"" died at his Malibu, California, home Sunday at 81, his lawyer said. Younger TV viewers may remember Roberts from the lead role in ""Trapper John, M.D.,"" a medical drama that aired on CBS for seven years, ending in 1986. Roberts, a native of Waycross, Georgia, spent much of his adult life ""pursuing his dream of equality for all,"" according to a family statement released by his lawyer, Richard Stone. Roberts spent the first decade of his acting career on stage -- including Broadway -- before he moved to Hollywood to act in movies. His first film was ""Desire Under the Elms,"" starring Sophia Loren and Burl Ives. In 1959, he landed the role of Adam Cartwright, the handsome and smart son of rancher Ben Cartwright (Lorne Greene) in the new western series ""Bonanza."" His character was serious and introspective, in contrast to younger half-brothers Hoss (Dan Blocker) and Little Joe (Michael Landon). The move to a television series ""was a difficult transition,"" the family statement said. ""Accustomed to freely moving from part to part, now being in a wildly popular show, without costume changes, about three grown men living at home with their father, he found did not hold much creative interest for him,"" it said. Roberts walked alongside the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in the historic 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery in Alabama, the family said. ""On the set of 'Bonanza,' he protested the use of all white crews and guest stars, finding some support but never enough to satisfy his sense of outrage,"" the statement said. Roberts left the popular western after the end of the sixth season in 1965, although ""Bonanza"" stayed in production for another eight years. While the show's storyline kept open the possibility of his return to the Ponderosa ranch, Roberts never did. He never gained much of a foothold in film, but stage acting kept Roberts busy for more than a decade. He also guest starred in more than 60 TV series. His role of Dr. ""Trapper"" John McIntyre, starting in 1979, was a spin-off of a character from the hit TV comedy ""M*A*S*H."" Roberts played the balding physician working in a San Francisco hospital nearly three decades after he returned from the Korean War. His last regular TV job was in 1991 when he was host of the short-lived ABC police anthology ""FBI: The Untold Stories."" Roberts was married four times. His only son, Chris, was killed in a motorcycle crash in 1989. His fourth wife, Eleanor Criswill, was by his side when he died Sunday, the family said. CNN's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.","Roberts, 81, died at his California home, his lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- Before the Brooklyn Nets and Cleveland Cavaliers faced off on the basketball court Monday night, several players were already scoring points with protesters outside the arena. As they warmed up for the game, Cleveland Cavaliers LeBron James and Kyrie Irving were among the players wearing T-shirts that said ""I can't breathe"" -- Eric Garner's last words, which have become a rallying cry for protesters after last week's grand jury decision not to indict an officer in his death. Outside the Barclays Center, a large crowd of demonstrators swarmed the streets, chanting ""hands up, don't shoot"" and ""black lives matter."" The crowd erupted in cheers after an organizer told them about the players' T-shirts. The NBA players' show of support for protesters comes a week after five players from the St. Louis Rams walked onto the field and raised their palms in the air, demonstrating the ""hands up, don't shoot"" gesture that protesters have been using in demonstrations over the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Activists have been threatening to disrupt the visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who are visiting New York and attending the Nets-Cavaliers game. ""They need to know this is what America is. ... America is a system where those who benefit from others neglect to see the underclass, the people who are underprivileged, and that's why we're out here,"" said Jibri Nuriddin, a protester from New York. Demonstrations, he said, aren't going to stop. ""We're going to keep chanting and keep marching,"" he told CNN from outside the arena. ""Everyone's going to know that this is an issue. We're not going to let this issue die."" Amanda Jack, a public defender in New York, said she joined protests after seeing many of her clients suffer at the hands of what she called a racist system. ""There can't be any more business as usual when this kind of injustice continues. I think this (basketball game) is one of the examples of consumerism and excess, so it's time. Shut it down,"" she said. ""We've got to address our broken justice system."" Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, a former New York police officer, said protesters have a right to take a stand. ""There's nothing more American than having the right to voice your concern,"" he told CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""We want them to be constructive and not destructive."" The New York demonstration was one of a number of protests across the United States Monday night, days after a grand jury in New York City decided not to indict a police officer in Eric Garner's death and two weeks after a Missouri grand jury decided not to indict former Officer Darren Wilson in Brown's killing. In Washington, demonstrators protesting police violence laid down in the street several blocks from the White House on Monday, blocking rush hour traffic. Protesters chanted, ""black lives matter"" and ""off the sidewalks, into the streets."" One woman held a sign that said, ""Stop killing us."" The demonstration blocked traffic at cross streets along Connecticut Avenue, a major thoroughfare that connects the White House to upper northwest Washington. Collette Flanagan of Dallas told protesters her unarmed son was killed by police. ""Our babies should be here in the prime of their lives,"" she said. And Berkeley, California, protestors temporarily shut down the I-80 freeway in both directions Monday night. New York mayor praises police . New York Mayor Bill de Blasio praised police officers' handling of the protests. ""They've respected people's right under the First Amendment to express their views. They've kept the peace. They've kept order,"" he told reporters Monday. ""We had only a handful arrests the last two days, which is extraordinarily impressive given all of the activity that's happening."" De Blasio says he understands parents who are worried about what might happen if their kids encounter police. The New York mayor says he's had to warn his own son about that possibility. ""When he was just becoming a teenager, you know, the conversation was a difficult one and a complicated one, because you're trying to say to a young person who obviously looks up to police, you know, be careful and be smart and respect the police, but also recognize that there are these realities to be grappled with -- and that's a tough conversation to have with a young man,"" he said. De Blasio is white. His son is biracial. ""This is a national reality. It's not just a New York reality,"" de Blasio said. ""And that, unfortunately, is further evidence of how much more we all have to learn from each other. ... The goal is to get to a day when no parent feels they have to have that conversation."" Protesters flood California streets . A day after a heated standoff on a freeway between protesters in Oakland, California, and the California Highway Patrol, demonstrators in the area took to the streets again Monday. CNN affiliate KTVU showed throngs of protesters in the streets in Berkeley, California. It was a peaceful scene, KTVU reported. But violence erupted in earlier Berkeley protests Monday. Some protesters looted and vandalized businesses, police spokeswoman Jennifer Coats said. One protester was struck in the head with a hammer when he tried to keep fellow protesters from damaging and looting a Radio Shack, she said. The man was hospitalized, but his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening. Two Berkeley officers also suffered minor injuries. Coats said five people were arrested, but she did not know the charges. On Sunday night, demonstrators flooded a highway in Oakland, California. Some threw explosives, bottles and rocks at officers, authorities said. Officers responded by deploying gas and arresting eight protesters. In the end, two officers suffered minor injuries. Police said five patrol cars were damaged. Not everyone is on their side . In Imperial, Missouri, demonstrators staged a different kind of protest Sunday. They burned St. Louis Rams football jerseys after the protest by players last week, CNN affiliate KSDK reported. ""Why would you do something like that? It's utterly ridiculous,"" said Larry Magee. ""I think the Rams ought to pack their bags, and I'll give them a plane ticket back to L.A."" Daughter: 'This is not a black-and-white issue' Garner's daughter Erica said she was deeply moved by the diversity of protesters who have demonstrated across the country. ""This is not a black-and-white issue. This is a national crisis,"" Erica Garner said. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has announced a federal civil rights investigation into Garner's death. And on Monday, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said he was asking the state's governor to issue an executive order to change the way the state reviews cases such as Garner's. The order, Schneiderman's office said in a statement, should direct the attorney general ""to investigate and, if necessary, prosecute cases involving unarmed civilians killed by police officers."" ""The horrible events surrounding the death of Eric Garner have revealed a deep crisis of confidence in some of the fundamental elements of our criminal justice system,"" Schneiderman said. Unlike with the Michael Brown case, a video showing the moments leading up to Garner's death has been widely circulated. Erica Garner says that video has struck a nerve with many. ""For white people to come out and show how deeply they was hurt and like Asians and, you know, different people from different nations and different parts of the world to come out and show that they felt the same way I felt on that video, I greatly appreciated it. It's like a sense of I'm not the only one that feels this way.""

"The most senior Syrian diplomat to defect and publicly embrace his country's uprising is calling for a foreign military intervention to topple President Bashar al-Assad.  He also accused the Damascus regime of collaborating with al Qaeda militants against opponents both in Syria and in neighboring Iraq. ""I support military intervention because I know the nature of this regime,"" Nawaf al-Fares told CNN. ""This regime will only go by force."" Until a few days ago, Fares was Syria's top man in Baghdad. His defection marks a shocking about-face for an official who occupied a critically important post. Until Fares was sent to Iraq in 2008, Syria had no ambassador stationed in Baghdad for more than 20 years. ""I was at the top of the Syrian regime,"" Fares said in his first interview with a U.S.-based TV network since his defection. ""But what happened in the last year during the holy revolution, all of the killing, the massacres, the refugees, and the declaration of war by Bashar al-Assad against the Syrian people, stopped any kind of hope for reform or real change, which had been promised previously by Bashar al-Assad. ""I tried during the last year and a half to convince the regime to change its treatment of the people,"" Fares added. ""But I wasn't successful, so I decided to join the people."" Opposition calls on Obama to act now . Damascus confirmed news of Fares' defection in a short article published by Syria's state news agency SANA, which announced that the ambassador had effectively been fired for leaving the Syrian Embassy in Baghdad without official authorization. Prior to his diplomatic assignment in Iraq, Fares served as a provincial governor in different parts of Syria for a decade. He was also a regional boss in Syria's ruling Baath Party. Photographs on Syrian government websites as well as from Fares' personal collection show that on more than one occasion, this native of the eastern city of Deir Ezzor reported directly to the Syrian president. In an interview that lasted for nearly two hours in the gilded halls of a luxury hotel in the Qatari capital, Fares laid the blame for large-scale allegations of human rights abuses in Syria squarely at the feet of the country's president. ""The regime in Syria is a totalitarian regime and a dictatorship. There is only one person who gives the orders: one person who is the president,"" Fares said. Iran offers to host talks . Syria's state news agency has maintained that ""armed terrorist groups"" are behind the violence, which the United Nations estimates has killed more than 10,000 people since March 2011. CNN cannot independently verify reports from Syria, including Fares' allegations, because the nation has restricted access by international journalists. Syrian opposition leaders applauded the very public departure of such a high-ranking Syrian official because it clearly embarrasses and weakens the Damascus regime. But they appeared reluctant to invite one of al-Assad's trusted lieutenants into the ranks of the opposition movement. ""We don't reject him because we want everyone to quit the ship,"" said former Syrian National Council chairman Burhan Ghalioun, who spoke to CNN in the lobby of the same Doha hotel where Fares was staying under Qatari protection. Ghalioun insisted he did not know the former Syrian ambassador was sharing the same quarters. ""But we cannot put him in a political position (in the opposition) ... no one will accept Tlas or Fares at the head of the movement,"" Ghalioun added. The activist was referring to Gen. Manaf Tlas. Like Fares, Tlas is a Sunni Muslim who once held a high rank in an Alawite-dominated regime. He abandoned the Syrian government and fled into exile just days before Fares' departure. ""I know General Tlas. ... There is friendship between us,"" said Fares.  ""But there has been no coordination between me and him in terms of defecting."" Throughout the interview, Fares played down growing sectarian divisions between the ruling Alawite minority and the Sunni majority, who make up much of the current uprising. He also rejected the Syrian government's common claim that the rebellion is being led by militants from al Qaeda. Instead, he accused Damascus of cooperating closely with al Qaeda militants, ever since the U.S. invasion of neighboring Iraq in 2003. ""The Syrian regime felt threatened and felt that it, too, might fall,"" Fares recalled. ""So they had an agreement with al Qaeda to keep the road open to Iraq.  The militants started coming from all over the world through Syria, under the eyes of the Syrian secret police, which are directly responsible for the killing of thousands of Iraqis in Iraq as well as Americans and coalition forces. ""The secret police were encouraging enthusiastic young people in Syria to go for jihad in Iraq and join al Qaeda,"" Fares continued. ""Bashar al-Assad and his security forces are directly responsible for the killing of thousands and thousands of Iraqis and coalition forces, because he gave al Qaeda everything it needed. He trained and provided shelter and he built safe havens for them to hide in."" One of these ""safe havens,"" Fares said, was the Syrian border village of al Sukariya, near the border city of Abu Kamal. In response to the accusations, a senior U.S. administration official said that Fares' claims about the Syrian government 's cooperation with al Qaeda during the war in Iraq are ""broadly consistent with our understanding."" ""Since 2003, al-Assad allowed al Qaeda and associates to facilitate weapons, money and fighters to al Qaeda's Iraq-based affiliate, setting the conditions for those same elements to shift from Syria-based facilitation to active attacks -- this time focused against the al-Assad regime,"" the official said. ""This emerging al Qaeda operational presence in country bolsters our own argument that the sooner al-Assad leaves, the better,"" said the official, noting that that the current al Qaeda-linked effort in Syria is small and not representative of either the opposition or the broader population. In October of 2008, the U.S. government claimed responsibility for a controversial cross-border raid into Syria near Abu Kamal. U.S. officials later told CNN that special forces soldiers and helicopter gunships targeted an Iraqi man named Abu Ghadiya, who they called ""the top facilitator of al Qaeda foreign fighters into Iraq."" At the time, the Syrian government angrily protested the violation of its airspace and what it said was the killing of eight civilians. Four years later, however, Fares claimed the American forces had in fact struck an al Qaeda training camp run by one of al-Assad's close relatives by marriage. ""This was a hiding place for al-Qaeda on the border with Iraq, and it was under the control of Assif Shawkat, the brother-in-law of the president,"" Fares said. ""One hour after the raid, Assif Shawkat was there at the location. A conversation took place between me and him ... and he was angry about the attack made against al Sukariya and he was kind of scared,"" Fares recalled. Claims like this, which CNN cannot independently confirm, will likely make the former Syrian ambassador a much sought-after asset for Western intelligence agencies, as well as for the Qatari government. Doha has publicly lobbied for arming Syrian rebels against the al-Assad regime. Fares went on to repeat a long-stated Syrian opposition accusation: that the Syrian government is staging al Qaeda-style attacks in Syria as a fear-mongering tactic. The former ambassador was reluctant to explain the details of how he escaped from Baghdad to Doha. He said he timed his departure with the escape of his wife and grown children from Syria. But he had a message to the Syrian president and his former colleagues in the government. ""My former colleagues, I ask them to join the people and leave this corrupt regime. There is still time,"" Fares said. ""To Bashar al-Assad, I say you don't know history.  Two wills cannot be defeated: the will of God and the will of the people. ... History will curse you for the crimes you committed in Syria.""","A U.S. official says defector's claims about al Qaeda cooperation are ""consistent""

"Radical anti-government fighters in Syria mistakenly beheaded a wounded fellow rebel soldier after assuming he was a supporter of President Bashar al-Assad, according to an online statement from the radical fighters' group. A separate online video showed a gruesome display of radical fighters holding what appeared to be the victim's head. After the beheading earlier this week, the victim was determined to be Mohammed Fares, an anti-government fighter wounded in clashes against the Syrian Army earlier, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. On Thursday, an online statement from a spokesman for the al Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), whose fighters apparently carried out the beheading of Fares, called for forgiveness for the killers and asked for ""restraint and piety"" from anti-government supporters. ""We call on God to accept Mohammed Fares into his Kingdom and to forgive his brothers that sought to rid us of the enemies of God and our enemies,"" Omar Al-Qahatani said in Arabic in the ISIS statement. Fares apparently shouted the names of two revered figures in Shiite Islam when he arrived wounded in a makeshift hospital, prompting the overwhelmingly Sunni opposition to assume he was a government fighter, Al-Qahatani added in the statement. In the separate online video, two fighters from ISIS are seen displaying what appears to be the decapitated head of a bearded man to a crowd in Syria's commercial capital of Aleppo. ""He is an Iraqi Shiite volunteer fighter in Bashar al-Assad's army,"" a young man brandishing a knife in one hand and holding the decapitated head in another says in Arabic to a group of men all dressed in black. ""If they (al-Assad's army) enter they will not distinguish between supporters and opponents. I swear they will rape the men before the woman,"" another jihadi fighter continues in the amateur video. The incident comes as deadly clashes and infighting continues between extremist opposition factions and more secular rebel brigades, potentially weakening the armed movement against al-Assad and further threatening the safety of civilians caught in the conflict. Human rights groups and some member of the Syrian opposition have condemned what they deem barbaric actions by ISIS including the alleged execution of wounded government soldiers, the shooting of a 15-year-old boy for blasphemy, and public flogging of women for behavior deemed to violate Sharia law. Catholic group posts video of what it says is monk's beheading in Syria .","The victim was an anti-government fighter who'd been wounded .

"One cannot choose to not be a pedophile, but one can choose to not be a child molester. As details of the accusations of sexual abuse emerged from the Jerry Sandusky trial, and as the public looks on with horror, a central element to the case that has received scant attention is pedophilia itself. ""Pedophilia"" was long used as a synonym for ""child molestation,"" and both were often seen as psychological failures of self-control. Child molesters were thought to be acting out their own histories of abuses, reacting to fears of adult relationships, or manifesting a symptom that might be resolved in psychotherapy, after which they would no longer be pedophilic. Recently, however, a number of studies have starting changing that view. It appears that one can be born with a brain predisposed to experience sexual arousal in response to children. Pedophilic men have significantly less white matter, which is the connective tissue that is responsible for communication between different regions in the brain. Pedophiles perform more poorly on various tests of brain function, tend to be shorter in height and are three times more likely to be left-handed or ambidextrous (characteristics that are observable before birth). Although nonbiological features may yet turn up to be relevant, it is difficult, if not impossible, to explain the research findings without there being a strong role of biology. No one has been able to find a way to change pedophiles into nonpedophiles. But that does not mean we cannot prevent child molestation. Sexual preference for children doesn't have to result in actual sexual behaviors toward children. Cases of child molestation that involve long strings of victims over the course of years illustrate what can happen when someone gives in to, or outright indulges, his sexual interests, regardless of its potential damage on others. It is those cases that dominate headlines and provoke revulsion toward pedophiles. But they are rare. An untold number of cases merit sympathy. The science suggests that they are people who, through no fault of their own, were born with a sex drive that they must continuously resist, without exception, throughout their entire lives.  Little if any assistance is ever available for them. They are often unable to consult mental health professionals (because of mandatory reporting rules); their families will often disown rather than support them; and despite the openness of the Internet, there are few options for coming out and joining communities of other pedophiles for mutual support. Having encountered thousands of cases, it is my experience that the pedophiles who do go on to become actual child molesters do so when they feel the most desperate. Yet, much of what society does has been to increase rather than decrease their desperation. In the United States especially, the great majority of attention is on punitive measures, invoked after the fact.  However, the more beneficial social policies may be those aimed at prevention. The best example of this effort is the Prevention Project Dunkelfeld in Germany, supported financially by private donation. It began with a media campaign aimed at people struggling to resist their sexual interests to children. By offering counseling and other services, it is expected that they can remain offense-free.  Hundreds of people contacted the Dunkelfeld project after it was established. People from all over the world, including Austria, Switzerland and England, turned to the assistance. Another example is the Circles of Support and Accountability, which was developed in Canada. The programs are staffed by volunteers who have received training from professionals. They provide support to people who are under no mandate to attend but are nonetheless seeking help to not commit sexual offenses. It's too early to tell whether these efforts are effective over the long term, but preliminary reports are encouraging. Even though very few researchers study the causes of pedophilia, we hope that the scientific community will learn more as new tools and opportunities become available. If it is the brain's wiring that ultimately determines who will go on to develop pedophilia, can we detect it early enough to interrupt the process? Until we uncover more information, we will do more good by making it easier for pedophiles to come in for help rather than force them into solitary secrecy.","James Cantor: In Sandusky case, a central element that has been overlooked is pedophilia .

"Russia and the United States, in their third day of talks in Switzerland, said Saturday they have reached a groundbreaking deal on a framework to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stood side by side in Geneva as they set out a series of steps the Syrian government must follow. Syria must submit a comprehensive list of its chemical weapons stockpile within one week, Kerry said, and international inspectors must be on the ground no later than November. President Barack Obama said in a statement that the framework ""represents an important concrete step toward the goal of moving Syria's chemical weapons under international control so that they may ultimately be destroyed."" He added, ""There are consequences should the Assad regime not comply with the framework agreed today. And, if diplomacy fails, the United States remains prepared to act."" Senior U.S. State Department officials said that according to the timeline, initial inspections of declared chemical weapons sites must be completed by November; all production and mixing and filling equipment must be destroyed by November; and all chemical weapons material must be eliminated by mid-2014. The best way to ensure international control of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal will be to remove as much as is feasible and to destroy it outside Syria, if possible, the framework document says. Read the framework of the agreement . Kerry said the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must allow ""immediate and unfettered"" access to international inspectors. He said the inspectors should be able to get to Syria's chemical weapons sites despite the ongoing civil war, provided the al-Assad regime cooperates, since Syria has moved its chemical weapons into areas where it has tight control. The United States and Russia reached a shared assessment on the amount and type of chemical weapons possessed by the al-Assad regime, Kerry said. ""Providing this framework is fully implemented, it can end the threat these weapons pose not only to the Syrian people but also their neighbors,"" and the wider world, he said. Syrian Prime Minister Wael Nader al-Halqi welcomed the deal, saying his country is bent on implementing the political program as the ""sole exit"" from the crisis, according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency. Enforcement measures . The verification and destruction process will be carried out by personnel from both the United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the body that implements the international ban on chemical weapons use, according to the framework agreement. Russia and the United States will now work to get a U.N. Security Council resolution that will keep the process under review and allow the Council to consider the use of force if Syria fails to comply. Syrian crisis: Keep up with key developments . Russia has veto power in the Security Council and would be unlikely to agree to using force. Other options include imposing sanctions. Senior State Department officials told reporters that Saturday's agreement ""sends a very powerful message"" about the use of chemical weapons but acknowledged that the goal of eliminating them in Syria by the middle of next year is ""daunting."" The United States and Russia ""agree that Syria has a stockpile that includes chemical warfare agents as well as the precursors for those agents,"" judged to be about 1,000 tons in total, the officials said. ""We agree that it includes blister agents such as sulfur or mustard (gas) as well as nerve agents such as sarin,"" they said. But the number of locations for these agents has still to be agreed, they added. The United States and its allies blame al-Assad's forces for the chemical weapons attack outside Syria's capital last month that Washington says killed more than 1,400 people. Al-Assad and other officials vehemently deny their forces were responsible. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Friday his team is preparing a report for the Security Council that he believes will be an ""overwhelming report that chemical weapons were used."" The report is expected to be delivered Monday morning, according to three diplomatic sources. Syrian opposition fears . The Syrian opposition struck a note of skepticism. Gen. Salim Idriss, head of the rebel Free Syrian Army, told reporters in Istanbul he has information that Syria already started to move chemical materials and weapons out of the country, into Lebanon and Iraq. In Turkey, U.S. soldiers guard against Syrian missile threat . He predicted that al-Assad would keep some of his chemical weapons arsenal, and ""then use it against our people and the FSA and then he will come out and accuse terrorists, and he will say that he gave up everything he has."" The Syrian government refers to the opposition fighters as terrorists and has previously accused them of chemical weapons use. Some inside Syria criticized the focus on chemical weapons. Protesters in one town held up a banner in Arabic saying they are ""worried that the international community is giving Assad a license to kill with all kinds of weapons except the use of chemical weapons."" Hopes for peace . French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the U.S.-Russian agreement ""constitutes an important step forward,"" a sentiment echoed by UK Foreign Secretary William Hague. The two plan to meet Kerry on Monday in Paris to discuss the framework and its implementation. Ban pledged U.N. support for the plan, his spokesman said, and expressed hope that it would both prevent any future use of chemical weapons and pave the way for a political solution in Syria. Opinion: Is diplomacy the harder solution in Syria? Kerry and Lavrov announced the deal on their third day of talks. Friday, they signaled their intent to meet later this month on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, where they hope to set a date to restart long-stalled parallel talks on the broader issue of ending the Syrian civil war. The U.N. estimates more than 100,000 people have been killed since the civil war began in 2011, in addition to more than 2 million becoming refugees and over 4 million being displaced within Syria. 7-year-old's story shows pain, worry of Syrian refugees .","Kerry: Syria must list its stockpile within a week .

"Washington (CNN)New allegations have emerged from the man described as the 20th 9/11 hijacker, alleging members of the Saudi royal family supported al Qaeda. Zacarias Moussaoui, who pleaded guilty in 2005 to six terror-related charges, makes the allegations in a sworn statement contained in a brief submitted Tuesday as part of an ongoing civil case by the families of 9/11 victims. In the late 1990s, Moussaoui says, he was tasked by Osama bin Laden to create a digital database cataloging al Qaeda's donors. Every day for two or three months, he says, he entered names of the group's donors into a Toshiba computer, along with how much they gave. Moussaoui, who has been in U.S. custody for more than 13 years, said the list featured high-profile people, including several members of the Saudi Royal family, whom he named in his testimony. They include Prince Turki al-Faisal Al Saud, former director-general of Saudi Arabia's Foreign Intelligence Service and ambassador to the United States. Moussaoui, a French national, said he was chosen for the database job because of his education and ability to speak English. ""Shaykh Osama wanted to keep a record who give money ... who is to be listened to or who contribute to -- to the jihad,"" he said in sometimes stuttered answers. CNN cannot independently confirm the claims Moussaoui makes in his new testimony, which was made under oath as part of a brief filed in opposition to a motion to dismiss a case against Saudi Arabia for its alleged involvement in the 9/11 attacks. Unlike a deposition, Moussaoui was not subjected to cross-examination by the defendants' lawyers. Moussaoui's credibility has been called into question before. And though Saudi Arabia's role in the attacks has long been a topic of suspicion, the 9/11 Commission's report, released in 2004, concluded there was no evidence the Saudi government funded al Qaeda. See also: ISIS captors 'didn't even have the Quran' ""It does not appear that any government other than the Taliban financially supported al Qaeda before 9/11, although some governments may have contained al Qaeda sympathizers who turned a blind eye to al Qaeda's fund-raising activities,"" the report said. ""Saudi Arabia has long been considered the primary source of al Qaeda funding, but we have found no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organization."" Still, the report noted in parentheses, ""This conclusion does not exclude the likelihood that charities with significant Saudi government sponsorship diverted funds to al Qaeda."" In a statement reacting to these latest allegations, the Saudi Embassy in Washington said, ""There is no evidence to support Moussaoui's claim. The Sept. 11 attack has been the most intensely investigated crime in history and the findings show no involvement by the Saudi government or Saudi officials."" The Saudi statement also referred to the assessment of the 9/11 Commission. ""Moussaoui is a deranged criminal whose own lawyers presented evidence that he was mentally incompetent. His words have no credibility,"" the statement said. ""(Moussaoui's) goal in making these statements only serves to get attention for himself and try to do what he could not do through acts of terrorism -- to undermine Saudi-U.S. relations."" Moussaoui's new sworn statements were taken in October at a supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, where he has been held since his life sentence was handed down in 2006. Related: Saudi dilemma: How to spot potential terrorists . In them, Moussaoui goes on to say he met with members of the Saudi royal family in person more than once in Saudi Arabia, in order to hand-deliver letters to and from al Qaeda's notorious leader. ""I was introduced as the messenger for Shaykh Osama bin Laden,"" Moussaoui told attorneys on Oct. 21. ""Did they treat you well during the [first] visit?"" the lawyer asked. ""Extremely well,"" Moussaoui said. Moussaoui said he traveled on private jets and in limousines. His meetings took place in luxury hotels and even Saudi palaces. He was also given money for travel expenses at the Saudi Embassy in Islamabad, which he considered a bribe, he said. Furthermore, Moussaoui said his primary point of contact with the royal family was Prince Turki al-Faisal Al Saud, and that Turki introduced him to other prominent members of the family, including another former Saudi ambassador to Washington, Prince Bandar bin Sultan. Tuesday's court filing also included statements by three members of the 9/11 Commission, former Secretary of the Navy John Lehman, and former Sens. Bob Graham and Bob Kerrey. Their statements do not support the specific claims Moussaoui makes, but do say that further investigation of Saudi government involvement is necessary. ""I am convinced that there was a direct line between at least some of the terrorists who carried out the Sept. 11th attacks and the government of Saudi Arabia,"" Graham wrote. Kerrey told CNN on Friday that while he can't verify Moussaoui's specific allegations, he does believe the new information highlights the need for further investigation. ""It deepens suspicions that everything about Saudi involvement is not as well-known as it should be,"" he said. But this suspicion of the Saudi government is not shared by all. Robert Jordan, who was U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 2001 to 2003, told CNN he ""was given no hint whatsoever of direct Saudi leadership involvement -- any financing or any planning -- for these attacks."" Jordan said he was regularly in touch with Robert Mueller and George Tenet, who led the FBI and CIA, respectively, and felt assured over the course of their investigation that allegations against the Saudi government were without merit. ""A lot of it was my own questioning,"" said Jordan."" 'Are you sure? Have you made certain that none of the people we're dealing with now at the senior level had anything to do with these attacks or with supporting the terrorists who financed and orchestrated them?' And I was routinely and universally given the information that they felt comfortable at least at the senior level they hadn't."" See also: Why Obama says fight with ISIS isn't a religious war . Moussaoui has made incriminating claims about the Saudi government before. Last November, he said that Saudi Embassy officials were involved in a plot to shoot down Air Force One ""to assassinate Bill Clinton and/or Hillary Clinton."" He also said at that time that he had met with a Saudi prince and princess in early 2001 when he was taking flying lessons in Norman, Oklahoma, and that she ""gave me money."" Lawyers for the Saudi government denied those claims, saying pointedly, ""The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had no role in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001."" And the Saudis are not the only ones who have refuted Moussaoui's account of the 9/11 plot. In 2006, Osama bin Laden released an audiotape in which he denied Moussaoui's assertion that he was supposed to strike the White House with a 747 on September 11, 2001. ""I am the one in charge of the 19 brothers,"" bin Laden said, referring to the 19 known hijackers, ""and I never assigned brother Zacarias to be with them in that mission."" Many -- if not all -- of Moussaoui's statements over the years have been called into question. During his 2006 sentencing trial, an expert witness testified that Moussaoui suffered from delusional paranoid schizophrenia. He was prone to loud and disruptive outbursts during that trial, and guards testified he would sometimes make irrational claims to them. He has also asked for certain concessions in exchange for testimony, such as a warmer cell in a different unit of the supermax prison. Beyond his claims about the donor database, Moussaoui also says in this latest sworn statement that he was involved in a series of other plots against U.S. targets. Specifically, he says he was given explosives training to attack the U.S. Embassy in London with a truck bomb. ""I conducted a trial test of explosives for bomb of 750 kilogram of ammonium nitrate,"" he said. ""The plot was agreed with Shaykh Osama bin Laden."" Moussaoui said his team in that plot included Richard Reid, known as ""the shoe bomber,"" who Moussaoui previously said was supposed to take part in the 9/11 attacks -- allegations that Reid has denied. The plot against the embassy in London was eventually canceled, Moussaoui said, and he was sent to Malaysia to explore the possibility of attacking the U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. That plot was also canceled, Moussaoui told his attorneys, so he went to the U.S. to look into attacking Air Force One -- the plot he first revealed in November. ""My plan was not to launch the attack,"" he insisted in the statement. ""It was only to see the feasibility of the attack."" CNN's Jennifer Rizzo, Deborah Feyerick and Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report.","Zacarias Moussaoui says members of the Saudi royal family supported al Qaeda .

"(CNN)Months after Iraqi troops dropped their weapons and ran for their lives in Mosul, up to 25,000 are expected to head back there in April or May to try to retake the city from ISIS, according to a U.S. official. But can they actually do it? Answering that question is key to what might happen in Mosul but also as to whether the terrorist group can be taken out entirely in Iraq. Mosul has been a symbol of Iraqi military incompetence, given how troops and police ran from their posts as militants arrived in June. The stunning collapse stirred concerns about the ability of then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki not only to recapture Mosul but to save the entire country. And it also shined a harsh spotlight on the will and capabilities of Iraq's military, now that U.S. combat troops had exited the country. The group calling itself the Islamic State is still a force in Iraq, controlling vast swaths of the country and neighboring Syria. But Iraq's government has made changes since Mosul fell, including the appointment of a new Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, as well as some discussion and action to address sectarian divisions. There has been the start of airstrikes by the United States and others against ISIS as well. The Iraqi military has also had fresh training, some of it conducted by U.S. and allied forces, to make it more effective. It has had some success in curbing the ISIS onslaught, but not in taking back a lot of territory -- much less that as valued as Mosul. Yet al-Abadi told the BBC this week that, while there's still work to do, he is sure the Iraqis are going to retake the crucial northern city. ""We are now planning an offensive on Mosul in the coming few months,"" the Prime Minister said. ""We have to prepare for it carefully, because the only choice we have in Mosul (is to win). We have to win in Mosul to keep (ISIS) out."" Up until now, one of the biggest and most successful forces has been the Kurdish Peshmerga that serve Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish government, often at odds with Baghdad. These fighters will have a role, including around Mosul. In his BBC interview, al-Abadi said that liaisons between Iraqi forces and the Peshmerga ""must be powerful and must be watertight"" to defeat ISIS. According to the U.S. official, who spoke to reporters Thursday, Mosul police and tribal forces would likely join Iraqi troops in the assault on the city. Peshmerga would play a supporting role, not going into Mosul but instead blocking off supply and escape routes north and west of the city. Count Sirwan Barzani, a senior Peshmerga commander, is among the skeptics that such a spring assault would work. ""I don't think it's realistic, and I don't have any idea about a plan,"" Barzani told CNN's Ben Wedeman. ""And if it involves the Iraqi army only, it's not going to work. The Iraqi army is not ready for the fight."" If the Iraqi forces -- from five army brigades -- do the street-to-street fighting, theoretically they should significantly outnumber their ISIS counterparts. Right now, ISIS has an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 fighters in Mosul, the U.S. official said, but more could join the fight if they take the threat of attack seriously. The approximate time of the attack had previously been reported: A U.S. Central Command official told CNN earlier this year that Iraqi forces could make their first move in April. A Central Command official said Thursday that the hope is for an operation in April or May to avoid running into Ramadan (mid-June through mid-July) and Iraq's summer heat. Still, the official stressed a final decision on the go-ahead for an attack is a ways off. Even then, the question arises, why divulge such specifics? The U.S. official said that offering the details demonstrates Iraq's commitment to winning back Mosul. In the BBC interview, al-Abadi said that more needs to be done to get Iraqi forces up to speed but, once they are, ""I'm pretty sure we can liberate Mosul with a minimum of casualties and cost."" If Iraqi troops are ready to go into Mosul, what about their American counterparts? In addition to providing air support, the U.S. military has troops on the ground in Iraq. They're there ostensibly for training and other purposes, but not combat. Still, if they were ever needed to be in the thick of things in the ISIS fight, Mosul would be the place. That could happen. Gen. Lloyd Austin, head of Central Command, and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have both suggested a small number of U.S. troops could be needed on the ground to help call in airstrikes. The more ISIS reinforces its defenses around Mosul -- as it has been doing -- the more help Iraqi forces would need in locating military targets, a Central Command official told CNN this month. The Central Command official who spoke to reporters Thursday said no decision has been made in this regard. Still, even with all this talk about U.S. advisers, no officials have indicated American troops will engage ISIS in fighting on the ground -- something President Barack Obama has been wary to do.","U.S. official: Up to 25,000 Iraqi troops could take part in Mosul assault in April or May .

"On Tuesday, al Qaeda's affiliate in Iraq announced that it had merged with the Syrian opposition group Jabhat al-Nusra to form the ""Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant."" The announcement came in the form of an audio message from the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, Sheikh Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, that was distributed to key jihadist websites. The merger was first reported by SITE, a Washington-based group that tracks jihadist material online. The authors were able to confirm the announcement by monitoring the jihadist site, Ansar al Mujahideen, which frequently posts material from al Qaeda, including Tuesday's news of the merger of the Syrian and Iraqi wings of al Qaeda. Complicating matters, on Wednesday al Nusra claimed it wasn't merging with al Qaeda's affiliate in Iraq, but instead was pledging its allegiance to al Qaeda's overall leadership. The news that there is some kind of connection between al Qaeda in Iraq and the Syrian Jabhat al-Nusra (in English ""the Victory Front"") is not entirely surprising. U.S. officials have long suspected that al-Nusra was really, in part, a front for Iraqi jihadists who had crossed the Syrian border to join the fight against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The State Department added Jabhat al-Nusra to its list of designated foreign terrorist organizations in December. The fact that al-Nusra has publicly aligned itself with central al Qaeda is worrisome. A long-term safe haven for this group in Syria could be the prelude for the formation of an organization with the wherewithal to attack the West, just as al Qaeda's sojourn in Afghanistan when it was controlled by the Taliban prepared the group for the 9/11 attacks. Second, al-Nusra is widely regarded as the most effective fighting force in Syria, and its thousands of fighters are the most disciplined of the forces opposing Assad. Al-Nusra is also the first al Qaeda affiliate to take a page out of Hezbollah's book and operate not only as an effective fighting force but also as a large-scale provider of services, for instance, distributing enormous quantities of desperately needed bread in the areas of Syria that the group controls. Finally, al-Nusra is the first jihadist group for many years that has chosen to merge with al Qaeda at a time when it is having significant success on the battlefield. Al Qaeda's North African franchise, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, as well as the Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, both announced their affiliation with al Qaeda only when they were struggling for resources and exposure. While al-Nusra is enjoying real battlefield success in Syria, it is formally allying itself to al Qaeda at a time of great weakness for the global terrorist organization. The announcement of the merger with al-Nusra provides al Qaeda's leaders, now headed by the Egyptian Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, the chance to prove they are still relevant. Al Qaeda has received severe blows in recent years: a contingent of U.S. Navy SEALs killed the group's leader, Osama bin Laden, two years ago, while CIA drone strikes have decimated al Qaeda's ranks in Pakistan's tribal regions, and the group hasn't pulled off an attack in the West since the suicide bombings on the London transportation system in 2005. Sheikh al-Baghdadi, the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, said that he had delayed the announcement of the formal merger with al-Nusra because he wanted to allow Syrians time to get to know al-Nusra on its own terms, without the inherent negative bias that would be caused by an early announcement of its ties to al Qaeda. This was prudent. Had al-Nusra voiced its links to al Qaeda during the rebellion's nascent stages, al-Assad would have had an easier time blaming the uprising on ""terrorists"" as he has done since violence first broke out in Syria in March 2011. Syria is in its third year of a bitter civil war that has claimed the lives of more than 70,000 people, and wide swaths of the population support the opposition. In these circumstances, if al-Nusra continues to fight effectively against  al-Assad, Syrians are not, at least for the moment, likely to care too much about what the group's broader ideological leanings are. For al-Nusra the gains of a public announcement of its alliance with al Qaeda are far from clear. In fact, it is likely to be quite counterproductive. According to Leila Hilal, a Syrian-American who meets regularly with the Syrian opposition and is the head of the Middle East Task Force at the New America Foundation, the merger announcement may ""confirm the suspicions of much of the Syrian public that al-Nusra is not fighting for a free Syria, but for the establishment of an ultra-fundamentalist state."" That might explain why the head of al-Nusra, Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani, claimed in an audio message released on Wednesday that he wasn't ""consulted"" on the announcement of the merger of the Syrian and Iraqi wings of al Qaeda. Jawlani then stepped on his effort at damage control by announcing his pledge of allegiance to Ayman al-Zawahiri, who is, of course, the overall head of al Qaeda worldwide. For al Qaeda, the advantages of commanding an effective, large-scale fighting force in Syria, which is in the heart of the Arab world and borders on Israel, are all too obvious. The people of Syria, however, should have good reason to worry about this ominous development. Finally, the announcement that al Nusra has pledged allegiance to al Qaeda underlines that the Obama administration's seeming dithering about how exactly to aid the Syrian opposition makes more sense than it has done hitherto. There clearly are unintended consequences and risks in supporting the Syrian opposition, which is fractured into hundreds of local groups, some elements of which are hardly supportive of the United States. The Obama administration decision, reported by CNN Tuesday, to sign off on a new tranche of nonlethal aid to the rebels in Syria is best understood as an effort to bolster the Syrian opposition groups that are separate from al-Nusra and to give them a better fighting chance in what everyone agrees is likely a long Syrian war in which al-Assad is eventually removed from power -- but only then, unfortunately, does the real fighting for lasting power begin.","Peter Bergen: The announcement of links between Syrian insurgents, al Qaeda is worrying .

"By any measure it's historic: The vast majority of Africa's leaders flying to Washington at the invite of the President, whose father was born on the continent, to mark what the White House hopes is a new era of cooperation. While plans for the first African Leaders Summit this week in the nation's capital are ambitious, the reality is the United States still has strides to make on the kind of political and economic relationships in Africa that can benefit both sides. Other nations, namely China, have turned their focus to the continent as a trade partner. Terrorist networks have expanded their reach in some countries, most notably in Nigeria, where hundreds of schoolgirls remain at large after being kidnapped earlier this year. And while U.S.-backed efforts have helped slow the spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa, countries there rate among the lowest in life expectancy and infant mortality. ""The importance of this for America needs to be understood,"" President Barack Obama said on Friday about the summit. He added later that Africa ""happens to be one of the continents where America is most popular and people feel a real affinity for our way of life."" Here are five reasons that the U.S.-Africa Leader's Summit, which kicked off on Monday,  is important: . 1. Health scare: The health problems in Africa were underscored this week when an Ebola outbreak prompted leaders of two nations to cancel their trips to Washington. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, and Ernest Bai Koroma, the leader of Sierra Leone, both said they would remain in their countries. Ebola has killed more than 700 people in three nations: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra. Summit leaders, and even Obama, have stressed there is no risk to Washingtonians from those arriving from Africa this week. Obama said anyone who might have been exposed to the virus would be screened both in their home countries and upon arrival in the United States. But worry over the worsening outbreak only highlighted challenges Africa faces in combating disease and poverty, despite the billions in U.S. aid over the years. ""This is an uphill challenge for them,"" said Gayle Smith, Obama's senior director for development and Democracy, noting both Liberia and Sierra Leone had recently emerged from periods of civil war. Obama hopes to move past the traditional elements of humanitarian aid to Africa, focusing instead on potential trade. But promoting commercial ties with countries engulfed in Ebola outbreaks could prove to be difficult. The State Department warned against non-essential travel to Sierra Leone and Libera last week, and some schools and businesses have closed. ""The timing is very unfortunate, and no one would have wished for this,"" said Howard French, an associate professor of international affairs at Columbia University. ""Having high-level discussions between the U.S. and Africa on business and investment are infrequent. So to the extent that this distracts from that I think will be regretted all around."" 2. Security challenges: Another potential barrier to U.S. investment in Africa: Growing extremism on the continent, which has overwhelmed certain governments. The most flagrant example came earlier this summer, when the group Boko Haram kidnapped more than 200 school girls in Nigeria. The incident prompted international outrage and so far, a U.S.-backed team has not located them. Nigeria-based Boko Haram opposes western-style education, and there are fears the group's influence could be crossing borders. Last month, armed gunman suspected to be Boko Haram militants abducted the wife of Cameroon's deputy prime minister. Intra-country sniping has followed. Nigeria has expressed frustration with Cameroon for not doing enough to fight Boko Haram on its side of the border, a charge Cameroon has  denied. The unrest has inflicted damage on African economies, including Nigeria's, the largest on the continent. Other African nations combating violent extremism, like Mali, Kenya and Somalia, are also tough sells for U.S. investment. Many of those nations want more U.S. assistance to counter militants, sentiments likely to be expressed at this week's summit. ""We are concerned about efforts by terrorist groups to gain a foothold in Africa,"" said Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser. He pointed to U.S. counterterror efforts that aim to partner with nations in stemming unrest. ""We're looking at how do we get at the broader issue of countering violent extremism in Africa so that these groups, like Boko Haram, like al-Shabaab, like al-Qaeda, are not able to prey on young people with disinformation and intimidation,"" he said. 3. Countering China: The United States has some catching up to do in Africa when it comes to trade and investment. China's imports of African oil and natural minerals have skyrocketed over the past two decades. Alongside have come massive Chinese investments in African infrastructure and construction projects, manned by waves of Chinese workers who ended up remaining in Africa. More than a million Chinese citizens now live there. ""Africa is in a very particular moment, economically speaking,"" said French during an interview with CNNI from Nairobi. ""The continent has been growing very fast. Demographically, there's a bulge in terms of it's youth population. And Africa needs partnerships."" Obama wants to make sure the United States is one of those partners, and a more attractive one than China. ""My advice to African leaders is to make sure that if, in fact, China is putting in roads and bridges, number one, that they're hiring African workers; number two, that the roads don't just lead from the mine to the port to Shanghai, but that there's an ability for the African governments to shape how this infrastructure is going to benefit them in the long term,"" Obama told The Economist last week. 4. Cementing legacy: Obama's two predecessors both secured legacy achievements in Africa -- Bill Clinton through his African Growth and Opportunity Act, and George W. Bush through his program combating HIV/AIDS. Obama similarly hopes for a way to leave his mark on the continent after he leaves office, though his status as the first president of African descent has already made history. That fact led some Africans to regard Obama with outsized expectations when he took office in 2009, leading to some disappointment that he hasn't focused more on shoring up U.S.-Africa ties. During his time in office, Obama has focused on terrorism, uprisings in the Arab world, Russian provocations, and the much-awaited pivot to Asia. Obama made his first presidential trip to sub-Saharan Africa in 2009 when he visited Ghana. He didn't return again until 2013 with tour of Senegal, Tanzania and South Africa. He's embarked upon an initiative that aims to bring electricity to more Africans, and a program supporting young leaders working toward Democratic governments. Both are elements to a legacy designed to shore up conditions for individuals on the continent. And the summit itself, while not expected to produce any large-scale trade agreements, is meant to signal a shift from purely humanitarian assistance to a two-way partnership. ""We believe it can be a game-changer in the U.S.-Africa relationship,"" Rhodes said of the summit. 5. Not invited: While the bulk of Africa's leaders will be in Washington, the continent's most reviled leaders won't be attending. They include Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe and Sudan's Omar al-Bashir. They weren't invited because of their alleged human rights abuses. Other controversial leaders -- like Kenya's Uhuru Kenyatta, accused of crimes at the International Criminal Court -- will attend. Like any major diplomatic gathering, the Africa Leaders Summit has been an exercise in protocol and careful planning. Instead of meeting with leaders separately, Obama has been scheduled for larger group discussions, to the disappointment of some who wanted to talk to him one-on-one. ""We just wouldn't be able to do bilats with everybody, and so the simplest thing is for the President to devote his time to engaging broadly with all the leaders.  That way we're not singling out individuals at the expense of the other leaders,"" Rhodes said. He noted Obama would speak with each leader individually during a dinner at the White House on Tuesday. That event has taken on state dinner-type proportions, with a large tent constructed on the South Lawn. Organizers have the added stress of accommodating leaders of 50 nations, all with varied religious and cultural sensitivities that must be respected. For example, servers must know who drinks alcohol and who abstains for religious reasons. It's a reflection of just how diverse Africa is, and how high the stakes are for Obama as he forges new relationships there.","Majority of African leaders convene in Washington for first-ever African leaders summit .

"A  truck is loaded with munitions, then driven up a hillside in northern Syria. Moments later, there is a massive blast followed by cries of ""Allahu Akbar,"" or God is great in Arabic, as well as the rattling of gunfire. Suicide bombings like this are not new in war-torn Syria. But what could make this one different is the man who radical Islamists say played a part in pulling it off. An American. Abu Farouk al Shamy, a spokesman for the rebel Suqour al-Sham battalion, told CNN the Sunday attack was executed in coordination with the al-Nusra Front, an al Qaeda-linked organization that the U.S. government has blacklisted as a foreign terror organization. One video on YouTube, with the title ""the American martyrdom from al-Nusra Front,"" identifies the suicide bomber as Abu Hurayra Al-Amriki. This video and several other social media posts feature a picture of a bearded man with that name, smiling and holding a cat. The man's full and true identity is not known, and CNN cannot independently verify an American by any name recently died in Syria. But a U.S. law enforcement official concurs the man likely has an American connection. It's not known if he might be a U.S. citizen or resident, though. And the official pointed out any identity can't be confirmed until remains are recovered or examined, something that would be difficult, given the size of the explosion. U.S. concern about Americans fighting in Syria . Syrian activists say the video is from Sunday and shows militants' preparations and ultimate attack on Syrian military checkpoints in Jabal Al-Arba'een, near the city of Ariha in Idlib province and believed to be along a key rebel supply route. According to Syrian activists and social media postings, four vehicles laden with explosives were part of the attack. One YouTube video says the American detonated the biggest one, which contained 17 tons of explosives, including artillery shells. It is not clear what exactly this man's involvement was, including whether he was driving an armored truck, a tanker or some other vehicle. Even if he clearly did not act alone, it is the man identified as Abu Hurayra who has gotten a lot of attention on websites and social media venues tied to radical Islamists. This includes a tweet by a man with the handle Abu Suleiman al-Muhajer, whose bio identifies him as belonging to al Qaeda in the Levant, the umbrella organization for the al-Nusra Front. His tweet, which was published on the radical Islamist website Hanein, features the alleged American's picture and the words, ""Abu Hurayra Al-Amriki performed a martyrdom operation in Idlib, Jabal Al-Arba'een. May Allah accept him."" The name Abu Hurayra, which is popular among Sunni Muslims, offers little clue as to the man's identity. Abu Hurayra was a companion of the Islamic prophet Mohammed and the narrator of Hadith. Regardless, if his U.S. nationality could somehow be confirmed, it wouldn't be a total surprise. U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials have expressed concerns about Americans joining the fight in Syria, including with groups like the jihadist al-Nusra Front. The worry is that they and other Westerners might pose a threat when they return a home. ""There's going to be a diaspora out of Syria,"" FBI Director James Comey said last week.

"Gun-related homicides and crime are ""strikingly"" down from 20 years ago, despite the American public's belief that firearm crime is on the upswing, a new study said Wednesday. Looking back 50 years, a Pew Research Center study found U.S. gun homicides rose in the 1960s, gained in the 1970s, peaked in the 1980s and the early 1990s, and then plunged and leveled out the past 20 years. ""Despite national attention to the issue of firearm violence, most Americans are unaware that gun crime is lower today than it was two decades ago,"" the researchers say. A Pew survey of Americans in March found 56% believed gun-related crime is higher than 20 years ago and only 12% said it's lower. The survey said 26% believed it stayed the same and 6% didn't know. Chicago's record murder rate: Don't blame guns alone . The new study found U.S. firearm homicides peaked in 1993 at 7.0 deaths per 100,000 people. But by 2010, the rate was 49% lower, and firearm-related violence -- assaults, robberies, sex crimes -- was 75% lower in 2011 than in 1993, the study found. Those drops parallel an overall decline in violent non-fatal crime, with or without a gun, the study said.

"A Pennsylvania State Police officer shot in an ambush is conscious and speaking for the first time since his surgery, according to police. Trooper Alex T. Douglass was in stable but critical condition after being shot late Friday night just outside the police barracks in Blooming Grove, Commissioner Frank Noonan said. Police hope that Douglass can provide them with information that will help them identify a suspect. ""We hope to interview him and see if he can provide any information on the incident,"" Trooper Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania State Police, said Sunday night. Another Pennsylvania State Police officer, Cpl. Bryon K. Dickson, was killed in the attack. Police have not made any arrests in the case. Earlier, Noonan said police had no description of the shooter or any information about the motive. ""It cuts us to the core that such an event could happen,"" Noonan said. ""[They] really had no chance to defend themselves. It's a cowardly attack."" The shooting happened at 10:50 p.m. Friday in a rural, wooded area. Dickson and Douglass were young troopers with families. Dickson previously served at the Philadelphia barracks, according to Noonan. ""Every attack on an officer of the law is an attack on our state, our country and civilized society,"" Gov. Tom Corbett said in a statement. Corbett ordered that all state flags in the Capitol complex and at commonwealth facilities in Pike County fly at half-staff to honor Dickson. Investigators were interviewing a ""person of interest"" Saturday morning, but no arrests had been made, spokeswoman Trooper Connie Devens said. Noonan stressed that police would be interviewing ""hundreds"" of people. ""This attack seems to be directed particularly at the Pennsylvania State Police,"" Noonan said, but warned that residents should be careful. ""Until we have this person in custody, obviously everyone should be cautious and aware that there is a dangerous criminal on the loose,"" he said. Police from New York, New Jersey and throughout the Northeast are assisting in the search, Noonan said. Police have set up traffic checkpoints throughout the area, according to Kelly, for two reasons: To get ""useful information"" and to help the community feel more comfortable and secure. Pennsylvania State Police raised their reward to $50,000 for information that would help lead to the arrest and conviction of an individual responsible for the shooting. 2 officers from 'Alaska State Troopers' killed in confrontation .","One trooper is conscious after being shot .

"(CNN)A phenomenal thing has happened in Washington: Progressive advocates and conservative forces have united around legislative action supported by the strong majority of the American people. Groups as disparate as the Center for American Progress and ACLU on the left and the Koch Brothers on the right; Republican Sen. Rand Paul and Democratic Sen. Cory Booker; and over two-thirds of the American people all support major overhauls to America's criminal justice system.  As do, presumably, the 2.2 million Americans ensnared in our nation's costly and counterproductive current prison system.  So what's stopping reform?  One man: Chuck Grassley. Grassley is the senior Republican senator from Iowa.  He was first elected to Congress in 1975, serving first in the House of Representatives before going to the Senate in 1981.  That means Grassley's been in Congress long enough to have been there when the idea of mandatory minimum sentences for federal criminal convictions was first introduced.  In the 1980s, Congress passed so-called ""mandatory minimums"" as part of the national war on drugs, supposedly to make it easier to keep traffickers and kingpins locked up. Yet by basically any measure, mandatory minimums have been a maximal failure. Yes, nationwide the crime rate has declined in the past 40 years. But a new study confirms that America's drop in crime had very little, if anything, to do with mandatory sentencing laws and the increase in incarceration.  For instance, while incarceration played a small role -- estimated at around 5% -- in the drop of crime rates between 1990 and 1999, it had ostensibly no effect between 2000 and 2013. Meanwhile the federal prison population has grown from 20,000 prisoners in the 1980s to over 200,000 prisoners today.  With states also passing mandatory sentencing laws, the prison population overall has skyrocketed.  Today, the United States has more people behind bars than any other country in the world. One out of every 100 adult Americans is in prison or jail.  And the laws have had a disproportionately harsh effect on communities of color. For instance, on average, black male offenders are given sentences 20% higher than white males.  Meanwhile federal prisons are overcrowded by 40%, and incarceration costs eat up 25% of the Justice Department's budget. The federal government could be investing more in public infrastructure jobs and higher education, since employment and education have proved to decrease crime rates dramatically. Instead, politicians are slashing food stamps and public assistance funding while spending $29,000 per year per inmate in federal lockup. And as the conservative writer Betsy Woodruff wrote in Slate, ""When Elizabeth Warren and Ted Cruz both think the same bill is a good idea, you might think it would have legs."" Yet it would appear Grassley just doesn't wanna change the rules. Grassley is the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Simply put, given the generally powerful position of committee chairs on Capitol Hill, if Grassley doesn't want reform to happen, it won't.  And he doesn't. This past May, Grassley gave a floor speech voicing his strong opposition to the ""Smarter Sentencing Act."" Grassley connected America's drop in crime over the past decades partly to the use of mandatory minimum sentences. Citing a year when the number of state and federal prisoners had dropped, Grassley argued there was a corresponding rise in crime despite other contradictory evidence.  Plus, Grassley said, ""the only tool Congress has to make sure that federal judges do not abuse their discretion in sentencing too leniently is mandatory minimum sentences."" In Grassley's world, the war on drugs is working and mandatory minimum laws are a tool for combating liberal activist judges.  Given such illogical conclusions, one might jokingly ask whether Grassley is crusading against drugs or using too much of them himself. But to anyone paying attention, what seems illogical is Grassley's ability to stand in the way of a strong bipartisan coalition of his colleagues and the overwhelming weight of factual evidence and public support.  It's yet another reason Washington seems so dysfunctional. It's one thing when one party in the majority passes, say, health care reform and then the other party stubbornly votes over and over again -- over 50 times -- to repeal the law.  That's undeniably pointless and absurd but can at least be chalked up to petulant partisanship. Yet here we have that rarest of species in Washington, agreement -- and in alignment with facts and popular opinion.  The idea hat one person can stand in the way is insane.  This isn't what our Founding Fathers had in mind.  This isn't a checks-and-balances democracy.  It's more like a monarchy, where Chuck Grassley is king. Over 2 million Americans may continue to waste away in our bloated and broken prison system, and more will probably join them, merely because the way Congress does business gives so much power to committee chairs such as Grassley. Until there's a way around that, Washington will seem broken, too.","Left and right have united against harsh U.S. minimum sentences .
Sally Kohn: Will Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley block reform?"
"Nearly two years before he shot and killed a 12-year-old who had an air gun, Cleveland Police Officer Timothy Loehmann resigned from another police job after a supervisor described him as ""distracted and weepy"" and ""emotionally immature."" Records from the Independence Police Department obtained by CNN include comments from a supervisor detailing what they called ""a pattern of lack of maturity, indiscretion and not following instructions,"" a ""dangerous loss of composure during live range training"" and an ""inability to manage personal stress."" ""I do not believe time, nor training, will be able to change or correct these deficiencies,"" Independence Deputy Chief Jim Polak wrote in a November 2012 memo. Now Loehmann, who could not be immediately reached for comment, is one of two Cleveland police officers under investigation after the fatal shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice last month. Police have said the boy was shot after pulling out an air gun that looked like a real firearm. Loehmann joined the Cleveland Police Department in March. A Cleveland Police spokesman said Thursday that during a background check before hiring Loehmann, his department didn't review the officer's personnel file from Independence, a suburb south of the city. Detectives did speak with the Independence human resources director, the spokesman said. ""During that interview detectives inquired if there were any disciplinary actions or incidents that Cleveland Police should be aware of prior to hiring Loehmann, at which point they were told there were none,"" Sgt. Ali Pillow said. ""The reason for departure indicated was resignation. Officer Loehmann indicated that he resigned for personal reasons, which was substantiated by the City of Independence."" According to the records, Loehmann worked at the Independence Police Department as an officer until December 2012, when he submitted his resignation ""for personal reasons"" after he was told that a disciplinary process of separation had begun. ""Ptl. Loehmann's inability to perform basic functions as instructed, and his inability to emotionally function because of a personal situation at home with an on and off again girlfriend leads one to believe that he would not be able to substantially cope, or make good decisions, during or resulting from any other stressful situation,"" Polok wrote. Another memo from a sergeant who worked with Loehmann at a shooting range described the officer as ""distracted,"" ""not fit to return"" after an emotional outburst and someone who was ""not following simple instructions."" An Independence spokeswoman said in a statement that the city had made all personnel files for Loehmann available. Loehmann has been on paid injured leave since November 22 after injuring his ankle in the shooting, Pillow said. His partner is also on paid administrative leave . The shooting has sparked criticism from community members who accuse police of unnecessary violence. Police said it's not clear if the responding officers involved in the shooting received information about the age of the suspect or the gun being ""probably fake."" Fred Loehmann, Timothy Loehmann's father, told the Cleveland Plain Dealer this week that his son didn't know the boy's gun was fake or realize he was 12 years old. ""I was right there and he went for the gun,"" he recalled his son saying, according to the newspaper. ""I had no choice."" Efforts by CNN to reach Loehmann Thursday were not immediately successful.

"The U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions Tuesday on leaders of the jihadist al-Nusra Front in Syria, hours after the State Department moved to blacklist the rebel group as a foreign terror organization linked to al Qaeda in Iraq. The Treasury also sanctioned two armed militia groups that operate under the control of the Syrian government, Jaysh al-Sha'bi and Shabiha, it said. Syrian opposition groups have voiced their opposition to the U.S. move against the rebel fighters, suggesting that they are being targeted because they oppose a new anti-government coalition. The move came the same day President Barack Obama recognized the leading Syrian opposition coalition as the legitimate representative of the country's people. ""We've made a decision that the Syrian Opposition Coalition is now inclusive enough, is reflective and representative enough of the Syrian population that we consider them the legitimate representative of the Syrian people in opposition to the Assad regime,"" he told ABC's Barbara Walters. In recent months, the radical Islamist al-Nusra Front has emerged as one of the most effective groups in the Syrian resistance, drawing on foreign fighters with combat experience in Iraq and elsewhere. Read more: New head of Syrian opposition briefs European foreign ministers . But Washington accuses the group of using the Syrian conflict to advance its own ideology and ends. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland confirmed Tuesday that the al-Nusra Front had been added to the list of aliases for al Qaeda in Iraq, already designated a foreign terrorist organization. She said the group had claimed nearly 600 attacks in several cities in the past year, including suicide bombings, and was responsible for the deaths of ""numerous innocent Syrians."" Al-Nusra ""has sought to portray itself as part of the legitimate Syrian opposition while it is, in fact, an attempt by AQI to hijack the struggles of the Syrian people for its own malign purposes,"" she said. The designation makes it illegal for any U.S. citizen to give ""material support or resources,"" including money, training or weapons, to al-Nusra fighters. Read more: Syrian rebels move toward unified command . The Treasury's financial sanctions also target two senior al-Nusra leaders, named as Maysar Ali Musa Abdallah al-Juburi and Anas Hasan Khattab. The measure means that any assets they may hold in the United States are blocked and that U.S. citizens are barred from doing business with them. The Treasury sanctions against pro-government groups target two Shabiha commanders, named as Ayman Jaber and Mohammad Jaber, along with the two militia groups. Its statement said the Shabiha have ""operated as a direct action arm of the government of Syria and its security services,"" working alongside its intelligence services, and have been ""complicit in the commission of human rights abuses in Syria, including those related to repression."" ""Since the beginning of the unrest, the Shabiha have fired into crowds of peaceful Syrian demonstrators, shot and killed Syrian demonstrators, arbitrarily detained Syrian civilians, and shot Syrian soldiers who refused to fire on peaceful demonstrators,"" it said. The Jaysh al-Sha'bi militia has ""conducted unilateral and joint operations with Syrian military and security elements against the Syrian opposition"" that have led to the deaths of opposition members, the statement said. It accuses Iran of training, funding and arming the Jaysh al-Sha'bi militia. Washington's move comes a day ahead of a Friends of Syria meeting scheduled in Morocco. The goal of the designation is to isolate extremist groups in Syria while giving a boost to the new political opposition group unveiled last month in Doha, Qatar, U.S. officials said last week. Al-Nusra and several other groups last month announced their opposition to the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, a new anti-government coalition. U.S. officials estimate al-Nusra members represent about 9% of rebel forces in Syria. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based opposition group, said fighters from the al-Nusra Front were among rebel forces who it says have seized control of a government military base in the Sheikh Sleiman area of western Reef Aleppo. But their designation as a foreign terrorist group isn't being made on the grounds of past or possible future actions, according to the Observatory's Rami Abdelrahman. ""The United States decided to single out the Nusra Front because of their recent rejection to the political opposition front and (because) they have a different approach to post-Assad's Syria,"" he said. Read more: Syrian National Council picks new president . Syrian Minister of Information Omran al-Zoubi told Lebanese al-Manar TV on Monday that Damascus understood why Washington wanted to blacklist the al-Nusra Front. ""When the U.S. places Jabhat al-Nusra on the international terrorist organizations list, that is because it realizes the nature of these groups which are fighting the Syrian armed forces,"" he said. Read more: In Syria, marriage as defiance . Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has characterized the nearly 21 months of violence that have ravaged his country as a fight against terrorism. But the Syrian National Council, a largely expatriate opposition group, on Sunday voiced its ""full rejection of any accusation of extremism and terrorism to any of the forces that are fighting the Syrian regime."" Any accusations made against factions within the Free Syrian Army, which brings together disparate groups, were intended to cause division within its ranks and between its forces and the Syrian people, it said. ""Terrorism is a characteristic that can only be attributed to the Syrian regime,"" it said. The commander of the Falcons of the Levant Brigade, a rebel group, criticized the U.S. move in a statement, saying the international community ""should have designated Bashar al-Assad, his army and his criminal thugs on that list first and last for what they are committing against our people."" The group said it would ""refuse to be dragged into these Western accusations against any group"" and would continue to back al-Nusra and any other faction fighting government forces. U.S. officials have previously said the jihadist al-Nusra Front has not affiliated itself publicly with al Qaeda in an apparent effort to appear more mainstream. The group has claimed responsibility for complex attacks in Damascus and Aleppo, frequently involving suicide bombers. At least 165 people were killed Tuesday across the country, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported an attack in the village of Aqrab, in Hama province. More than 125 people were either killed or injured, the vast majority of which belong to the Alawite minority, it said. Al-Assad hails from the same group. A local activist in Aqrab told CNN the village has been under heavy shelling for about a week. The shelling intensified Tuesday, forcing families to flee, said Hekam Abu Rayan. He described bodies still trapped under the rubble. The Hama Revolutionary Command Council, an activist group affiliated with the Free Syrian Army, similarly reported deaths in Aqrab. It accused a pro-government militia of using women and children as ""human shields,"" holding them in a building surrounded by rebel fighters. When rebels sent in people to negotiate with the militia, they were taken hostage and later killed, the council said. Women and children attempting to escape were also killed, it said. Syrian state news, citing a military source, denied any attack in Aqrab. CNN is unable to confirm casualty reports as the government has severely restricted access by international journalists. The meeting in Morocco this week follows a renewed international push for a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Syria, amid concerns about the potential use of chemical weapons. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told reporters Tuesday, however, that intelligence about new attempts by Syrian government forces to move chemical weapons ""has really kind of leveled off."" U.S. officials said last week that they had seen intelligence suggesting that Syrian military units might be preparing chemical weapons for use, prompting strong warnings from international figures. ""We haven't seen anything new indicating any aggressive steps to move forward in that way,"" Panetta said. ""But we continue to monitor it very closely, and we continue to make clear to them that they should not under any means make use of these chemical weapons against their own population. That would produce serious consequences."" Panetta said he would like to believe that al-Assad has gotten the message: ""We've made it pretty clear and others have as well."" But, he added, ""You know it's also clear that the opposition continues to make gains in Syria, and our concern is that if they feel like the regime is threatened with collapse that they might resort to these kinds of weapons."" President Obama has said that any use of chemical weapons would cross a ""red line,"" eliciting a swift U.S. reaction. Syrian state-run media said Monday that the United States has falsely accused Syria of considering the use of chemical weapons.","President Barack Obama recognizes a Syrian opposition coalition .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama will appoint Ron Klain his ""Ebola czar,"" knowledgeable sources tell CNN. The president on Thursday signaled his openness to the idea to have one individual coordinating the entire federal response to any threat of an outbreak in the United States. ""It may make sense for us to have one person ... so that after this initial surge of activity, we can have a more regular process just to make sure that we're crossing all the T's and dotting all the I's going forward,"" Obama said. White House press secretary Josh Earnest got a little more specific with reporters after the announcement was made Friday. ""I think what you can assume Mr. Klain's role will be is an important, high-level implementation role,"" said Earnest. ""Ultimately, it will be his responsibility to make sure that all the government agencies who are responsible for aspects of this response, that their efforts are carefully integrated. He will also be playing a role in making sure the decisions get made."" GOP slams Klain as Ebola czar . The administration has been criticized for its response to the incidents of Ebola in the United States, in terms of how prepared hospitals have been for potential Ebola patients and also how prepared health care workers were in terms of their personal protective gear. Some lawmakers have called for a travel ban on individuals coming from West Africa, where the outbreak is most serious but the administration has so far not embraced that idea. Klain is highly regarded at the White House as a good manager with excellent relationships both in the administration and on Capitol Hill. His supervision of the allocation of funds in the stimulus act -- at the time and incredible and complicated government undertaking -- is respected in Washington. He does not have any extensive background in health care but the job is regarded as a managerial challenge. ""He's strong. He's very tough,"" said CNN political analyst David Gergen. ""It's important in this job to be a coordinator; you have to knock heads together. He's tough enough to do that."" Related: Crises endanger Democrats in Midterm . Gergen said that while Klain doesn't have a health care background, he does have both domestic policy and foreign policy assignments on his portfolio and both will come into play as the administration deals with Ebola. Klain will report to both White House homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco and National Security Adviser Susan Rice, according to a White House official. A former chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden and also to then-Vice President Al Gore, Klain is currently president of Case Holdings and general counsel of Revolution, an investment group. He has clerked for the U.S. Supreme Court and headed up Gore's effort during the 2000 Florida recount and was portrayed in the HBO movie ""Recount"" by Kevin Spacey. He could not be reached for comment on Friday. Even though some Republicans who had called for a more coordinated response seized on his lack of a health care background as a disqualifier. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce said Obama should have tapped someone with medical experience. ""Given the mounting failings in the Obama administration's response to the Ebola outbreak, it is right that the President has sought to task a single individual to coordinate its response,"" the California Republican said. ""But I have to ask why the president didn't pick an individual with a noteworthy infectious disease or public health background."" Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida had called for an Ebola czar to coordinate the government's response to the deadly virus, but said Friday that ""already, concerned have been raised about the president's choice."" ""I hope Mr. Klain will come forward quickly with a set of concrete actions to reassure Americans that this administration is taking this situation seriously, including but not limited to common sense travel restrictions on individuals from the affected countries in West Africa,"" he said. Biden, though, endorsed Klain's selection in a tweet. And as for the term ""Ebola czar,"" it is not officially endorsed by the White House. ""As far as I'm concerned, you can call him anything you want,"" Earnest told reporters. ""We call him the Ebola Response Coordinator.""

"Hezbollah forces are fighting on the side of the Syrian government in the strategic town of Qusayr against rebels, its leader said Saturday. ""Syria is the backbone of the resistance (in the region) and its main supporter,"" Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech broadcast live on Hezbollah-owned Al Manar Television. ""The resistance will never stand by while its backbone is exposed."" The pro-regime and pro-Iranian Shiite militia, based in Lebanon, is regarded as a terrorist group by the U.S. government and Sunni countries. Nasrallah's 75-minute speech marked the first time he has acknowledged Hezbollah forces are fighting in the conflict. It came shortly after an opposition group said that shelling by Hezbollah fighters had killed at least 30 people in the strategically important western Syrian town of Qusayr. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria said the fatalities included women and children. Another opposition group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said that 27 of the dead were rebel fighters. Syria agrees 'in principle' to attend peace conference . The Free Syrian Army said it had killed 45 members of Hezbollah. In eastern Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, thousands of Hezbollah supporters watched the speech on a big screen. ""Regarding this battle, like all the battles before it, our men are there and we will make victory there,"" he said to cheers. Nashrallah accused the rebel forces of belonging to extremist religious movements, and said Hezbollah forces were acting to protect Lebanon. ""If the armed groups control Syria or specific Syrian provinces, especially those on the Lebanese border, then we consider them a great threat to Lebanon, the unity of the nation and all Lebanese, not just Hezbollah or Shiites in Lebanon."" Hezbollah fighters represent only a tiny minority of foreign fighters in Syria, Nasrallah said. ""Tens of thousands of (rebel foreign) fighters did not bother the so-called Friends of Syria countries whose representatives met in Amman a couple of days ago,"" he said, referring to the opposition umbrella group, which met in Jordan. ""But the interference of a small group from Lebanese Hezbollah was considered a foreign intervention. We never interfered (in Syria) until a few months ago, so I am completely honest with you."" Nasrallah said the government in Damascus has always been willing to negotiate a peaceful resolution with rebels, but that the opposition -- hopeful that President Bashar al-Assad would be ousted -- has refused to do so. For its part, the government-run Syrian Arab News Agency said government forces were carrying out an operation against ""armed terrorist groups"" in the town, and had killed large numbers of them. In Istanbul, Turkey, a Syrian opposition leader called for weapons, fighters and other aid. ""In today's Syria, terrorism is killing tolerance; ignorance is killing logic; barbarity is overwhelming civility,"" Syrian National Coalition Acting Chairman George Sabra told reporters. Referring to Hezbollah forces, he said, ""You are heading in the wrong direction. The resistance should not be in the north, in Qusayr or Daraya.

"(CNN)Not since Lena Baker, an African-American convicted of murder in Randolph County, has Georgia executed a woman. The state is scheduled to snap that 70-year streak on Wednesday. Kelly Renee Gissendaner, 47, was convicted in a February 1997 murder plot that targeted her husband in suburban Atlanta. Gissendaner was romantically involved with Gregory Owen and conspired with the 43-year-old to have her husband, Douglas Gissendaner, killed, according to court testimony. Owen wanted Kelly Gissendaner to file for a divorce, but she was concerned that her husband would ""not leave her alone if she simply divorced him,"" court documents said. The Gissendaners had already divorced once, in 1993, and they remarried in 1995. Details of the crime, as laid out at trial and provided by Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens, are as follows: . Owen and Kelly Gissendaner planned the murder for months. On February 7, 1997, she dropped Owen off at her home, gave him a nightstick and hunting knife and went out dancing with girlfriends. Douglas Gissendaner also spent the evening away from home, going to a church friend's house to work on cars. Owen lay in wait until he returned. When Douglas Gissendaner came home around 11:30 p.m., Owen forced him by knifepoint into a car and drove him to a remote area of Gwinnett County. There, Owen ordered his victim into the woods, took his watch and wallet to make it look like a robbery, hit him in the head with the nightstick and stabbed Douglas Gissendaner in the neck eight to 10 times. Kelly Gissendaner arrived just as the murder took place, but did not immediately get out of her car. She later checked on her husband to make sure he was dead, then Owen followed her in Douglas Gissendaner's car to retrieve a can of kerosene that Kelly Gissendaner had left for him. Owen set her husband's car on fire in an effort to hide evidence and left the scene with Kelly Gissendaner. Police discovered the burned-out automobile the morning after the murder, but did not find the body. Authorities kicked off a search. Kelly Gissendaner, meanwhile, went on local television appealing to the public for information on her husband's whereabouts. Her and Owen's story started to unravel after a series of police interviews. On February 20, Douglas Gissendaner's face-down body was found about a mile from his car. An autopsy determined the cause of death to be knife wounds to the neck, but the medical examiner couldn't tell which strike killed Douglas Gissendaner because animals had devoured the skin and soft tissue on the right side of his neck. On February 24, Owen confessed to the killing and implicated Kelly Gissendaner, who was arrested the next day and charged. While in jail awaiting trial, Kelly Gissendaner grew angry when she heard Owen was to receive a 25-year sentence for his role in the murder. (Owen is serving life in prison at a facility in Davisboro, according to Georgia Department of Corrections records). She began writing letters to hire a third person who would falsely confess to taking her to the crime scene at gunpoint. She asked her cellmate, Laura McDuffie, to find someone willing to do the job for $10,000, and McDuffie turned Kelly Gissendaner's letters over to authorities via her attorney. Kelly Gissendaner has exhausted all state and federal appeals, the attorney general said in a statement. The State Board of Pardons and Paroles will consider a clemency request Tuesday. As of late Tuesday afternoon, no decision had been made, said the spokesman for the board. In the clemency application, Gissendaner's lawyers argue she is equally or less culpable than Owen, who actually did the killing. Both defendants were offered identical plea bargains before trial: life in prison with an agreement to not seek parole for 25 years. Owen accepted the plea bargain and testified against his former girlfriend. Gissendaner was willing to plead guilty, her current lawyers said, but consulted with her trial lawyer and asked prosecutors to remove the stipulation about waiting 25 years to apply for parole. According to her clemency appeal, her lead trial attorney, Edwin Wilson, said he thought the jury would not sentence her to death  ""because she was a woman and because she did not actually kill Doug. ... I should have pushed her to take the plea but did not because I thought we would get straight up life if she was convicted."" Her appeal lawyers also argue Gissendaner has expressed deep remorse for her actions, become a model inmate and grown spiritually. They say her death would cause further hardship for her two children. For her last meal, she's requested an extravagant one: two Burger King Whoppers with cheese (with everything), two large orders of fries, popcorn, cornbread, a side of buttermilk and a salad with tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, carrots, cheese, boiled eggs and Paul Newman buttermilk dressing, CNN affiliate WGCL-TV in Atlanta reported. She also requested a glass of lemonade and cherry-vanilla ice cream for dessert. Kelly Gissendaner is currently the only woman on Georgia's death row. She would be the first woman executed in the state since Baker in 1945. Only 15 women have been executed in the United States since 1977, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.","Kelly Gissendaner was sentenced to death for a murder plot targeting her husband .

"Some of the most heartbreaking images to emerge from the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crash scene have been those of passengers' belongings. A guide book, a stuffed toy monkey, a passport -- items that remind us that those traveling on the Boeing 777 were, in many ways, just like us. Which is why many Sky News viewers watching the network's live broadcast Sunday were shocked to see a reporter begin picking through the contents of an open suitcase lying among debris in the eastern Ukrainian field where the passenger plane went down. Immediately realizing his error while on air, correspondent Colin Brazier said, ""We shouldn't really be doing this, I suppose."" But the damage had already been done. A flurry of messages posted to social media decried the segment as ""sickening"" and ""disrespectful."" Both Brazier and Sky News have apologized ""profusely"" for any offense caused, in a statement released by the network. In a piece published Tuesday in Britain's Guardian newspaper, Brazier again apologized and sought to explain what had led to what he called a ""serious error"" of judgment and a gaffe. ""Good journalism takes many things and the empathy I hope they have wrought in me is one of them. But so is understanding the boundaries of decency and taste. And from time to time, we screw up,"" he wrote. ""At the weekend I got things wrong. If there was someone to apologise to in person, I would."" Brazier said that seeing a pink water bottle just like one owned by his 6-year-old daughter in the midst of the victims' belongings had pushed him over the edge emotionally. What viewers of the broadcast didn't see, he said, ""is that I had lost it. It is a cardinal sin of broadcasting, in my book anyway, to start blubbing on-air. I fought for some self-control, not thinking all that clearly as I did so. Too late, I realised that I was crossing a line."" Meanwhile, anger over the handling of the crash site in the rebel-controlled area of eastern Ukraine is growing amid allegations of looting, tampering with evidence and investigators being stopped from examining the wreckage. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry described reports of ""drunken separatists piling the remains of people into trucks in an unceremonious fashion."" The rebels' local leader, Alexander Borodai, has rejected accusations that his forces removed the bodies and denied responsibility for reported use of stolen bank cards taken from the crash victims. Borodai said he could not rule out the possibility that ""some local residents could have searched the bodies.""","""If there was someone to apologise to in person, I would,"" Colin Brazier writes in UK paper .

"(CNN)The Lunar New Year is the only time of year China's army of migrant workers gets to go home. Known as ""chunyun,"" the annual travel crush is the world's largest migration of humans. The lengths workers go to to see their families during the country's biggest holiday, which this year began February 19, is one facet of migrant worker life captured by factory hand turned photographer, Zhan Youbing. For more than a decade, Zhan was himself one of China's 250-million strong ""floating population"" of migrant workers. Originally from the rural, inland province of Hubei, he worked as a security guard in the factories that surround the southern boom town of Guangzhou, over a thousand kilometers away. Now a professional photographer, he trains his camera lens on those he left behind. ""I have lived this life,"" he says. ""So I know exactly what their situations are."" For the past 10 years, he has photographed workers in eight factories in Dongguan, a factory town near Guangzhou, documenting their life on and off the assembly lines. The scenes Zhan has captured range from the bizarre to the intimate. In one electronics factory, workers resembling astronauts -- their protective clothing only reveals their eyes -- take a quick nap. But he also shows a life where strong friendships are forged -- at a dormitory dinner party for example. He's taken more than 400,000 photos and they've been been exhibited across the country. But he didn't go to any of the exhibitions. ""I didn't have the travel expenses,"" he says. In November, he published a book called ""I'm a Migrant Worker,"" a compilation of writing and more than 150 photos. Map captures biggest human migration on earth . Zhan started taking photos for an internal factory publication in 2002. He then took vocational classes. When he returned to his hometown for the Lunar New Year celebrations, he found photos a better way than words to describe life in the factory to his mother and mother-in-law. Yet it was a deeper feeling of insecurity that drove him to keep documenting the life of migrant workers - a turbulent life over which they have little control. ""Sometimes, you want to jump ship for better pay at another factory shortly after starting your current job,"" Zhan says. ""Yet at other times when you want to stay on and settle down, you get fired or the factory gets taken over."" If photography meant self-fulfillment for Zhan in the early days, it is now more of a mission. He says the more photos he takes, the more deeply he understands the issues migrants face. Zhan says he is particularly concerned about the plight of children left behind by parents. Restrictions on housing, education and healthcare, make it hard for migrant workers to bring along their kids and they are often raised by grandparents, relatives or neighbors. ""The parents have devoted their lives to the manufacturing industry, but they barely get anything. Now their kids start entering the sad cycle."" Despite his success, Zhan thinks himself no different to a migrant worker and says the feeling of uneasiness from that time will never fade. ""I feel like rootless duckweed on a strange land.""

"(CNN)Some say it's the most famous, perfectly composed news photo of all time. Monday marks 70 years since Joe Rosenthal captured the iconic picture of five U.S. Marines and a Navy sailor raising an American flag over the battle-scarred Japanese island of Iwo Jima. The image was so inspiring that, by 1945 standards, it went viral. It triggered a wave of national hope that Japanese forces would soon be crushed and peace was near. It spurred millions of Americans to buy war bonds to keep the nation on solid financial footing. Basically, this simple photo was so powerful it helped win World War II. But Rosenthal was just one of several cameramen on the island's Mount Suribachi that day. Their images reveal the entire story behind the famous picture. They provide clues into the anger and ugly rumors over whether the Pulitzer Prize-winning photo was staged. Hal Buell, a former executive newsphoto editor at the Associated Press, knew Rosenthal. Buell shared with CNN the inside story surrounding the photo. ""The most surprising thing to me is ... that even today there are many people who believe that the picture was posed,"" Buell said. ""It still comes up over and over again."" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. On February 23, 1945, Rosenthal, an AP photographer covering the battle for Iwo Jima, had heard Marines were headed up the mountain. He decided to make the climb and see what was going on. But Sgt. Louis Lowery, a Marine photographer for Leatherneck magazine, had beat him to it. Lowery was already on the summit snapping photos of Marines proudly raising the American flag. For miles around, the sight of Old Glory atop the mountain set off whistles, gunfire and celebrations. The noise stirred up a firefight with Japanese soldiers near the summit. Lowery dove for cover and fell 50 feet, smashing his camera. Lowery decided to descend the mountain to get new equipment. On the way, he ran into Rosenthal coming up with two Marines: Pfc. Bob Campbell, who was also a photographer, and Sgt. William Genaust, who was a motion picture photographer. According to Buell, Lowery said, ""Hey, you're late fellas, there's already a flag up there."" Lowery told Rosenthal that he should keep going to experience the breathtaking view. As Rosenthal got closer to the summit, the flag began to come into view. ""He stopped and was struck by a wave of emotion about what it cost to put that flag up there,"" Buell said. Rosenthal thought about all the bloody fighting and the Marines who sacrificed their lives to capture the mountain. Reaching the top, Rosenthal, Campbell and Genaust spotted a group of Marines holding a second flag. The Marines said they'd been ordered to replace the first flag with a bigger one so more people could see it below. Suddenly Rosenthal knew he had a second chance to photograph an important moment on the summit. Let's stop a minute and remember that this was long before today's sophisticated cameras and digital technology. Photographers took one picture at a time, often with only one opportunity to get the perfect shot. Rosenthal had to quickly decide whether to shoot both flags simultaneously -- one rising while the other lowered -- or to photograph the second flag as it was being raised. He chose to focus on the second flag. Rosenthal's choice made all the difference. ""Joe did not pose that picture,"" Buell said. He explains what happened: ""While the photographers were taking their positions to get the shot, Genaust -- the motion picture photographer -- asked Joe, ""I'm not in your way, am I?' Joe turned to look at Genaust, who suddenly saw the flag rising and said, 'Hey, there she goes!' "" Up came the flag. Just in time, Rosenthal raised his camera to his eye and took the shot. There it was: a genuine moment in history, artfully captured for all time. ""Like any good, experienced and talented photographer, there's a sense of anticipation and a sense of shooting a picture at peak action -- and Joe got it,"" Buell said. ""You couldn't have captured the action at a better peak. A moment earlier, and the flag would have been too low. If it had been a second later, the flag's staff would have been straight up and the photo wouldn't have had that strong diagonal line."" This is our cue to talk about the photo's amazing composition. ""It's exquisite,"" Buell said. ""You have this strong, diagonal line made by the flag staff. You have the flag snapping in the breeze. You have the pyramid-like shape of the Marines pushing the flag up. The men obviously are separate, but they appear as one. The blank background enhances the action by providing no distractions. Also, the photo is gifted with a softly filtered light. A very thin haze of clouds filters the light so that the shadows aren't harsh, but there is detail in all the shadows on the uniforms and the flag."" Think about it: At the exact moment that Genaust cued Rosenthal, sunlight, shadows, wind and the Marines all converged perfectly. What were the chances? ""I hate to use the word accident,"" Buell joked. ""Let's call it serendipity."" But what about Lowery's flag photo? How was the composition of his image? ""It was perfectly serviceable,"" Buell said, because it showed the first flag. The photo shows a Marine in the foreground holding a rifle. In the background is the first flag, snapping in the breeze. But it's just not a memorable picture, Buell said, which is likely why it never gained fame. It didn't have the same powerful visual message and photographic excellence of Rosenthal's image. ""There's just no comparison,"" Buell said. ""I mean, we're talking about the difference between diamonds and glass."" On the other hand, Rosenthal's ""picture captured the heroism of the whole World War,"" Buell said. ""It captured a moment during a ferocious battle and it looked to the future -- to victory and the end of the war."" In fact, the image was so good that critics accused Rosenthal of staging it -- a myth he fought for more than 60 years. The rumor started for a good reason. Rosenthal actually did stage a photo on the summit. But the photo he posed was a different picture that was taken after the famous flag-raising. In the staged photo, Marines posed in front of the flag, victoriously holding their helmets and rifles in the air. That image is referred to as Rosenthal's ""Gung Ho"" Iwo Jima photo. Before he even saw his photos, Rosenthal sent his film by plane to Guam, where it was developed and edited. The famous photo was transmitted by radiofax to San Francisco before it was shared with newspapers across the nation and around the world. When Lowery saw Rosenthal's photo, Lowery ""was pissed off,"" Buell said. Lowery had missed the second flag-raising, so he didn't know what happened. All he knew was that Rosenthal's photo was on the front page of virtually every newspaper in America, and Lowery's photo was being ignored. Lowery alleged that Rosenthal's picture must have been posed. According to Buell, ""someone asked Joe if he posed his picture, and Joe -- thinking they meant the 'Gung Ho' photo -- said yes."" Minutes later, Rosenthal realized what photo they were talking about and immediately tried to correct his error. Too late. Damage done. Any journalist knows that ""the correction never catches up with the error,"" Buell said. ""Joe spent the rest of his life defending what was alleged as a 'phony picture.' "" It took a special meeting in Washington between military officials and editors at Life magazine and AP to put the controversy to rest. ""They came to the conclusion that the picture was not posed,"" Buell said. ""It was an authentic news picture of the second flag being raised."" Years later, Rosenthal and Lowery settled their differences. During a Marine event somewhere in the Carolinas, they reunited in a hotel room where they shared a bottle of bourbon, Buell said. Afterward, Lowery acknowledged Rosenthal's picture was not posed. ""He said it was an honest-to-God picture and they remained friends,"" Buell said. ""In fact, Joe attended Lou Lowery's funeral when he died."" Before Rosenthal died in 2006 at age 94, he told Buell he never got over the controversy. It always annoyed him -- ""the same charges and allegations over and over,"" Buell said. The picture has become almost an unofficial symbol of the Marine Corps and World War II in the Pacific. The Marines embraced it by transforming the photo into a memorial statue in Arlington, Virginia. Hollywood movies have been made about the flag-raising. The U.S. Postal Service featured it on a stamp. Even the shape of the National Museum of the Marine Corps, in Triangle, Virginia, was inspired by Rosenthal's photo. Buell said that as Rosenthal looked back on his life, he was glad his photo came to represent the bravery and sacrifice of the men he called ""my Marines.""","Many thought the famous photo of U.S. troops raising the flag at Iwo Jima was staged .

"(CNN)""I have been told at my job to hide the fact I am Muslim for my own personal safety by a manager."" ""I worry for my wife who wears a headscarf and my children when they are with her and I am not there to protect them."" ""I feel terrified for my two sons. Although all three of us were born and raised here I fear for our safety."" ""My dad recently asked my mother and sister to try and disguise their hijab with a hat."" ""I don't feel safe. I fear that if some could shoot me and my family and get away with it, they would."" Those are just a small sample of the alarming responses I received on Facebook when I asked my fellow Muslim Americans if they felt safe. Our community's fears have been elevated by the killing this month of three young Muslim American students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.  And while there's still a debate going on over whether this was, from a legal point of view, a hate crime, to the Muslim American community it seems hard to imagine the attack wasn't motivated at least in part by the faith of the three young victims. True, the suspect reportedly had disagreements with other residents in his apartment complex. But it seems telling that when he allegedly turned violent, it was only three Muslims who were shot in the head. Regardless, the concern felt by many in our community -- including myself -- actually predates these killings. In fact, six days before the shooting, I was one of 14 Muslim Americans to meet Present Barack Obama at the White House, and I raised the very fears that many of us feel. I explained to the President my worry that if anti-Muslim bigotry continues to go unchallenged, we could see someone target Muslim Americans in a violent attack. The President expressed his sincere concern, making it clear that there's no place for bigotry in our nation. And during his speech Wednesday at the White House summit on countering violent extremism, he also acknowledged that ""many Muslim Americans are worried and afraid."" To underscore the point, he then read a Valentine's Day card sent to him by an 11-year-old Muslim American girl named Sabrina, who wrote: ""I am worried about people hating Muslims. ... If some Muslims do bad things, that doesn't mean all of them do. Please tell everyone that we are good people and we're just like everyone else."" Her concerns are by no means misplaced, because the truth is that anti-Muslim bigotry has been building in recent years. We have seen acid thrown at an Islamic school in Illinois, and shots fired at a Southern California mosque. And the list goes and on. In the last week alone, an Islamic school in Rhode Island was vandalized with anti-Muslim graffiti and the words: ""Now this is a hate crime."" And despicably, some on social media even cheered the burning down of an Islamic center in Houston. Last Thursday, meanwhile, a Muslim American man in Michigan was allegedly beaten up at a local grocery store by two white men yelling racial and religious slurs. While these events don't garner national headlines, they do make headlines within our community.  And although statistically Muslims are second to Jews in terms of being victims of hate crimes, there were still five times more hate crimes perpetrated against Muslims in recent years than before 9/11, The Washington Post notes. Sobering as these statistics are, though, they mean little to Muslim American parents who are more worried about their own children's safety. Nor to the young Muslim American woman who fears she will be harassed for simply wearing a hijab. The perception for many in our community is that we are under siege, unsafe and alone. Why this uptick in fear? Well, the primary cause is events we have zero involvement in, namely the actions of al Qaeda and ISIS. But these fears have been exacerbated by the professional anti-Muslim bigots, certain pundits (primarily on the right, but some on the left as well) and some Republican elected officials (Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's baseless claims about Muslims setting up ""no go"" zones being one of the most talked about examples). So, what can be done to reduce this climate of anti-Muslim bigotry? I wish I had a simple answer, but there isn't one. It's akin to trying to counter anti-Semitism, racism or homophobia -- it will require a concerted effort over time, as well as constant vigilance to ensure these forms of hate remain on the fringes of society. Meanwhile, my hope is that the ""good people,"" as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. put it, will no longer be silent in the face of hate. If you believe that no American should have to fear for his or her safety or be harassed simply because of his or her religious beliefs, then speak out. It could be through as simple an act as countering a hateful posting on social media or not sitting silently as someone spews ignorant comments. But whatever role you choose to play, you will be doing a real service to America by making one thing clear: There's no place for this type of bigotry in our great nation.","Dean Obeidallah: Muslim Americans seeing an uptick in fear .

"(CNN)As ominous music plays, the ISIS flag flutters, child fighters wield weapons and graphic images of beheadings flash across the screen. At first, it seems like one of the notorious, slick jihadist recruitment videos flooding the Internet. But the tone quickly shifts. There are images of Syrian children crying, dead bodies lying on the floor and dire warnings: ""You will discover hell on Earth"" and ""You will die alone far from home."" The video campaign, which started this month, is the latest volley in a fierce battle being fought online between the French government and jihadist groups. What's at stake is nothing less than the lives of the country's youth. It's an idea that's catching on. Online recruiting by extremist groups was among topics discussed this week at a White House summit on countering violent extremism. Several online initiatives to combat those recruiting efforts are being launched by various countries, including France. Brazen, brutal: 5 terror groups making headlines . ""This is clearly a communication war against jihadist groups,"" Jean-Charles Brisard, head of the independent French Center for the Analysis of Terrorism, told CNN. ""And it is going to be a long-term endeavor."" And even though the latest ""battlefields"" are social media platforms and no real bullets are being fired, there are French civilians already caught in what amounts to a cyber-crossfire. Precise figures on the number of Europeans who have gone to Iraq and Syria -- and which jihadist groups they have joined -- are hard to come by. The consensus among counter-terrorism analysts is that more than 3,000 have traveled, of whom 500 have returned. In France, officials say the stakes are high. Recruiting by jihadist groups has been successful there. More than 400 of its citizens are believed to be fighting in Syria or Iraq, according to Prime Minister Manuel Valls, and another 1,000 or so are believed to have some involvement with those groups. President Francois Hollande's government started its first anti-ISIS online communication campaign, ""Stop Jihadism,"" on February 5. The effort is aimed at countering recruiting in France by ISIS and other jihadist groups. The French government's campaign, posted on YouTube, features an online video edited in the style of an ISIS video -- complete with harrowing music showing screenshots of Facebook accounts from ISIS supporters. After a few seconds, a Facebook message from a purported ISIS supporter pops up on the screen: ""Hey, I like the stuff you like on Facebook. Are you interested in what's going in Syria these days? If you have any question, don't hesitate. The truth is over there, you should go! ... I can put you in touch with friends who are fighting there."" Then, the images of crying children and the warning about ""hell on Earth"" play. ""This is video is very simple and goes straight to the point,"" Brisard said. ""It is important to counter propaganda. It is worse to do nothing."" But ISIS fired back just two days after France began its new initiative, posting its own material with French-speaking ISIS fighters mocking the government's campaign. ISIS supporters used Twitter to post graphics with the same typography and the same kind of slogans as the French government campaign. When the French government used catchphrases such as, ""If you go to Syria, you will massacre civilians,"" ISIS supporters replied online with slogans telling potential recruits if they go to Syria, they would be ""happy to kill"" their enemies, as opposed to leading depressed lives in France. Other jihadist groups have joined in the effort to counter the French campaign. Omar Diaby, purported to be one of the most influential French jihadist recruiters, released a trailer video focused on the January attacks in Paris. The video, called ""Once upon a time Charlie,"" an obvious reference to the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, features French-speaking al Qaeda fighters, uses special effects, music and voices of male, female and teenage jihadists. Speakers in the video praise the names of the brothers who carried out the attacks, and they try to argue against the French government with lines such as, ""France pretends to be a country of free speech but censors all the time our video."" Last September, the French government commissioned an anti-radicalization organization called the Prevention Center Against Sectarianism Related to Islam, which goes by the French acronym CPDSI, to counter online recruitment of French youths by jihadist groups. ""The recruitment and the first contacts are most of the time established on the Internet,"" said Donia Bouzar, director of CPDSI. According to a study published by the CPDSI, jihadists in charge of online recruitment use specific arguments to attract young people. These arguments target five different categories of individuals who could be susceptible to recruitment such as ""heroic knight"" for men or ""humanitarian cause"" for women. Other categories include young people who are avid players of war video games, aimless teens looking for a leader or people who are simply ""in need of power."" According to the CPDSI, young French people who get involved with jihadist groups are from a range of economic, social and religious backgrounds. In fact, most of the families whose teens become involved with jihadist groups consider themselves to be nonreligious or atheist, the CPDSI says. ""The jihadist in charge of online recruitment will look for key words on social media,"" Bouzar said on French TV Canal Plus. ""They will look for people who have Facebook or Twitter statuses mentioning they want to be nurses or social workers, for example."" French journalist Anna Erelle knows that type of effort well. During a recent month, she pretended to be ""Melanie,"" a young French woman converted to Islam who wanted to join ISIS. In her book ""In the Skin of a Jihadist,"" she tells how she decided to be in virtual contact with French jihadi already in Syria and Iraq. One of them, a 38-year-old man, was especially insistent and did everything he could to get her to travel to Raqqa, Syria. ""I had a fake Facebook account and I wanted to understand why a young French woman would want to leave her family and her friends to join ISIS,"" Erelle told CNN. ""I was shocked by how the jihadists become quickly ever-present in your daily life. When they have a target they won't stop."" A 16-year-old French girl that the government identifies only as ""Léa"" echoes that, saying repeated contacts began after she posted online that she wanted an altruistic job -- she wanted to be a nurse. ""More than 50 people were contacting me per day. It was all day. They contacted me in the morning, at night. They were men, then women. They wanted me to attack a synagogue in Lyon (France),"" said Léa, according to the French government. Some Muslims in French-speaking countries say the government's new campaign is culturally insulting, and holds Muslims as a group to ridicule. A French-speaking Belgian organization named Muslim Rights Against Islamophobia said the French campaign completely is ""full of generalizations and conflations."" One online graphic in the campaign shows nine signs of radicalization parents should look for in their teens, including ""changing the way they dress,"" ""stopping listening to music"" or ""eating differently."" ""It's not because we have a beard or that we don't listen to mainstream music that we are necessarily going to attack someone,"" Redwane Tehla, a 22-year-old Muslim student in Paris told CNN. ""Again, in France, the Muslim community is blamed for jihadism. ""The problem is not Internet, the problem is Islamophobia in France ... France is not fighting against the real social problems that push people to go join ISIS,"" Tehla said. The French government insists that its campaign is legitimate and is to ""prevent young people from turning to terrorism activities."" ""We know that 90 percent of French young jihadists started on the Internet,"" Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said at a press conference the day the government launched the website. Some terrorism experts agree with the French government's strategy. ""It is not supposed to stigmatize the Muslim community, it is supposed to stigmatize terrorists. The French government needed to be shocking and had to make a powerful statement,"" says terrorism expert Jean Paul Ney. ""This needs to be fought the same way intelligence services would fight against a sect -- with mass mind control through propaganda."" Experts say it's too early to tell whether the new campaign is producing results, but they point out that France is not the first country to have started an online platform against ISIS propaganda. The U.S. State Department launched the campaign ""Think Again Turn Away"" last September, which also used a graphic video using ISIS's own pictures. ""All governments involved in the war against terrorism are trying to find new tools to stop jihadists' online recruitment,"" Brisard told CNN. ""Internet recruiting is new, we all grope around and see what could work best.""","More than 400 French citizens are believed to be fighting in Syria or Iraq, the government says .

"(CNN)Between light-hearted moments like Benedict Cumberbatch taking a swig from a hip flask and Neil Patrick Harris parading on stage in his underwear, it was all about activism and controversial topics at the 87th Academy Awards. A broad range of issues, from immigration to suicide to Alzheimer's disease to wage inequality, took center stage. Sean Penn rubbed many the wrong way when he joked ""Who gave this son of a bitch his green card?"" as he presented Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu the best picture award for ""Birdman."" Iñarritu seemed unperturbed and devoted the Oscar win to his fellow Mexicans, saying, ""I just pray they can be treated with the same dignity and respect of the ones that came before and built this incredible, immigrant nation."" In the press room, Iñarritu said of Penn's joke, ""I found it hilarious. Sean and I have that kind of brutal (relationship) where only true friendship can survive."" Mostly, though, the night belonged to messages of empowerment. After expressing the usual gratitude to cast and crew of Richard Linklater's ""Boyhood,"" best supporting actress winner Patricia Arquette took a moment at the end of her acceptance speech to call for equal pay for women. ""To every woman who gave birth to every taxpayer and citizen in this nation: We have fought for everybody else's equal rights. It's our time to have wage equality in the U.S.,"" she said, causing an uproar in the room as well as on social media. Despite Meryl Streep's whooping approval, some viewers said the irony was not lost on them that Arquette's speech was given at such a lavish affair. Others argued that although the message was important, it marginalized the LGBT and non-white communities. Reese Witherspoon, who was nominated for best actress for her role in ""Wild,"" advocated for the hashtag #AskHerMore, which encourages red carpet presenters to ask more thought-provoking questions instead of the usual appearance-driven ones like ""Who are you wearing?"" Graham Moore gave an emotional speech after his win for best adapted screenplay for ""The Imitation Game."" ""When I was 16 years old, I tried to kill myself because I felt weird and I felt different and I felt like I did not belong,"" Moore said. ""And now I'm standing here, and so I would like this moment to be for that kid out there who feels like she's weird or she's different or she doesn't fit in anywhere. Yes, you do. I promise you do. Stay weird. Stay different, and then when it's your turn and you are standing on this stage, please pass this same message to the next person who comes along."" The hashtag #StayWeird took off in the wake of Moore's speech. Resources for suicide awareness and prevention include the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and The Trevor Project. And lastly, J.K. Simmons got preachy about a topic that hits close to home for many: The winner of best supporting actor for ""Whiplash"" encouraged viewers to #CallYourMom. ""And if I may, call your mom. Everybody -- I'm told there's like a billion people or so. Call your mom; call your dad. If you are lucky enough to have a parent or two alive on this planet, call them. Don't text, don't email,"" he said. So, have you called her yet?","Sean Penn's immigration comment at the Oscars causes some to cry ""inappropriate!""

"(CNN)A new CNN/ORC poll shows nearly 8 of 10 Americans believe parents should be required to vaccinate their healthy children against preventable diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella and polio. If the children are not vaccinated, most agree the child should not be allowed to attend public school or day care. These results come as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting a total of 154 cases of measles in the country, from January 1, 2015 to February 20, 2015. That's an additional 13 cases in the last week. The poll, conducted February 12-15, 2015, found 78% of the respondents believe parents should be required to vaccinate their child against preventable diseases if the child is healthy; only 22% disagree. Older Americans are most supportive of the required vaccinations (84% of those 50+ versus 72% of those under 50), and women express more support than men (81% to 75%). Seventy percent of parents with children under age 18 also agree with the requirement. Nearly 6 in 10 Americans believe that children should be barred from public school and day care activities if they are not vaccinated (58% say a child should not be allowed to participate in public school; 61% daycare). But when it comes to private schools, Americans are split:  51% say they should be allowed; 48% say they should not. Another 39% of Americans think it's likely that measles will strike their local community within the next few weeks. More women than men say they believe measles might infect someone in their community (43% vs. 33%) and Democrats see it as more likely than Republicans (45% vs. 36%). Residents of the West are most concerned, with 39% saying its 'very likely' measles will strike their community, compared with 10% in the Northeast and 8% in both the South and Midwest. According to the CDC, 118 of the reported 154 cases are linked to a large, ongoing multi-state measles outbreak that started in the Disneyland amusement park last December. There are two other, ongoing outbreaks, one in Illinois with 14 cases linked to a daycare and Nevada where there are six cases. The majority of people who have developed measles were unvaccinated. Health officials say the rise in measles and other vaccine preventable diseases is being fueled by people who opt not to vaccinate. The poll interviews were conducted for CNN via landlines and cellphones by ORC International.  All respondents were asked about basic demographics, and the sample was weighted to reflect national census figures for age, race, gender, education, geographic region and telephone usage. CNN's Debra Goldschmidt contributed to this report.","Nearly 8 in 10 believe parents should be required to #vaccinate children against preventable diseases.
Nearly 6 in 10 are opposed to unvaccinated children participating in public school or daycare.

"Las Vegas (CNN)The lawyer for the 19-year-old man accused of killing a Las Vegas woman -- allegedly after a road rage incident -- says his client feared for his life. Erich Milton Nowsch made his first court appearance Monday, a brief initial hearing inside a packed Clark County courtroom in which he did not enter a plea. His lawyer, Conrad Claus, says he will argue self-defense. He questions the version of events given by police and the victim's family and claims police interviewed Nowsch while he was high on marijuana. In fact, the lawyer claims Nowsch asked police if he could get high during the standoff that ended in his arrest, and that police agreed. But Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson, interviewed Tuesday night on Erin Burnett OutFront, said he doesn't think self-defense is a factor in the shooting. ""I don't see that in this case,"" he said. Wolfson said authorities are looking for the person who was driving the car in which Nowsch was riding, and possibly a third person who was in the car. ""This was a drive-by shooting. He shot out of a moving vehicle,"" Wolfson said. ""The driver has certain culpability."" Nowsch is charged with murder, attempted murder, assault and firing a gun from a car in the February 12 death of Tammy Meyers, 44. Police say Nowsch shot Meyers in front of her home after a confrontation while driving. The victim and the suspect knew each other -- a fact the family knew but police say they only found out the day of the arrest. According to police, the incident began when Meyers was giving her daughter a driving lesson at a school parking lot when ""a silver four door car sped up behind them and pulled along the driver's side of the car."" After the daughter honked the horn, the other car raced ahead and blocked their path, and a man got out of the car threatening them. Meyers later went looking for the car with her 22-year-old son, who was armed with a 9 mm pistol, according to police. After finding the car, they began following it. The driver stopped, and the passenger began firing at the Meyerses, according to police. Meyers drove home, but the other car followed and the occupant opened fire on them in front of their house, according to police. Meyers was struck in the head and died two days later. Claus said Meyers' son pointed a gun at Nowsch before anyone started shooting. He said his client received death threats, but he did not elaborate. Road rage suspect knew victim, husband says . The lawyer questions whether the alleged road rage incident between Meyers and Nowsch occurred and has doubts about the family's account of what happened. ""There was no road rage,"" Claus said. He said accounts of Nowsch's reported discussions of the shootings with friends don't appear to be consistent with the road rage claim. He also questioned the family's initial description of the shooting suspect. Meyers' daughter described the driver who threatened them as being 6 feet tall. Nowsch is much shorter. ""There are serious inconsistencies and problems with their story and I have serious concerns,"" Claus told CNN. A preliminary hearing was set for March 10, during which investigators will reveal more of the evidence and a judge will determine whether the case should go forward. However, the district attorney has issued a notice that his office may go to a grand jury instead of a preliminary hearing. The defense says such a move would indicate something weak about the prosecutors' case. Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson told reporters after the hearing that prosecutors are sure of their case against Nowsch. ""It is not a straightforward case,"" he said. ""It is not a garden variety, run-of-the-mill case.  We all know there are certain nuances to this case.  But at the end of the day, this young man is charged with a  senseless, stupid act of murder and we intend to prove it in court."" Meyer's husband, Robert Meyers, also attended the hearing. ""I'll be here every court date,"" he told reporters. Sara Weisfeldt and Sara Sidner reported from Las Vegas. Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN)A former cop ""disenfranchised with law enforcement"" and known to own ""a lot of guns"" is accused of killing his ex-wife before ambushing a sheriff and deputy who responded to the scene, a Georgia Bureau of Investigation official said Monday. The deaths appear to have resulted from a ""long-simmering domestic dispute,"" Rusty Andrews, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation's deputy director of investigations, told reporters. Anthony Giaquinta, an ex-military contractor and a former law enforcement officer with the Gainesville Police Department and Habersham County Sheriff's Office, was found dead from what police believe was an exchange of gunfire with a deputy. Giaquinta's 16-year-old daughter and her boyfriend were at the house outside Clarkesville when Giaquinta arrived and produced a gun. She heard gunshots, saw her mom dead, called 911 and fled, Andrews told reporters. Habersham County Sheriff Joey Terrell, Deputy Bill Zigan and a second unnamed deputy responded to the scene and found Kathy Giaquinta Smith dead in the garage, Andrews said. Terrell and the second deputy entered the house to search it, while Zigan secured the garage entrance in case Giaquinta returned, Andrews said. There, Zigan was ""likely ambushed from a position Giaquinta had taken"" in a nearby wooded area, he said. Struck by multiple bullets from Giaquinta's Glock 9-millimeter, Zigan took cover between two vehicles inside the garage. Terrell and the other deputy entered the garage after hearing gunshots, and Giaquinta fired again from a position to the side of the garage door, striking Terrell in the bicep, Andrews said. The second deputy then exchanged gunfire with Giaquinta, Andrews said. The officers called for backup, and after setting up a perimeter around the home, they found Giaquinta's body in the back yard. There was no sign of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and it appears he was killed by the ""return fire by law enforcement,"" Andrews said. The medical examiner will make the final determination on Giaquinta's cause of death. Also in the yard was the body of Steve Singleton, a 45-year-old Flowery Branch man who police believe ""had some type of friendship with Kathy Giaquinta Smith,"" Andrews said. It's unclear how Singleton died. The sequence of events remains unclear, but early indications are that Singleton was killed before police arrived. Terrell was released from the Northeast Georgia Medical Center late Sunday, and Zigan remains in the hospital for ""further treatment and observation,"" County Manager Phillip Sutton said Monday morning, adding that he's ""hopeful that he will be released soon."" The alleged shooter is a former Gainesville police dog handler who also worked for the Habersham County Sheriff's Office, Andrews said. He left the sheriff's office to take an overseas position as a military contractor and returned to the Habersham County force before being terminated in June 2013 following an allegation of domestic violence, Andrews said. That allegation was never adjudicated, he said. Though there had been no previous reports of gun activity involving Giaquinta, Andrews said it was ""well-known that Anthony had a lot of guns in his possession."" Andrews said he was unaware of any bad blood among Giaquinta and the sheriff and deputies who responded, but Giaquinta was ""disenfranchised with law enforcement in general."" Terrell ""was asked to go there to help with the situation,"" Sutton said, though he didn't say why the sheriff was requested at the scene. On Sunday, Sutton told CNN affiliate WSB-TV that the sheriff responded to the call ""probably because he knew the person who was involved in the incident"" and because he thought he could calm down Giaquinta. The Habersham County Sheriff's Office made national headlines last year after the department SWAT unit, based on word from an informant, conducted a drug raid at a house, throwing a flash-bang grenade and seriously burning a 19-month-old baby. In that case, officers did not find the drugs they were seeking at the house, only methamphetamine residue. Habersham County is about 85 miles north of Atlanta.

"For 13 years, President Bashar al-Assad has governed Syria. For 2½ of those years he's faced repeated calls from many inside and outside the country for his resignation. Now, al-Assad's regime is thought by many Western governments to have used chemical weapons against its own people, prompting talk of international military intervention. But Syria's president shows no sign of stepping back from the brink of confrontation. So who is al-Assad and what might he do next? When Bashar al-Assad succeeded his father Hafez Assad in 2000, there was the promise of a modern and more democratic Syria. In his inauguration speech, al-Assad indicated he would be a very different kind of leader to his father. ""I shall try my very best to lead our country towards a future that fulfills the hopes and legitimate ambitions of our people,"" he said. And for a while that promise was kept. His official website says he has built free-trade zones, licensed more private newspapers and private universities, and fought government waste and corruption. He has also worked on social and economic reform. Low profile for Syria's first lady . But many say al-Assad's promises have largely not been delivered. Human Rights Watch called his first 10 years as president ""the wasted decade,"" with a media that remained controlled by the state, a monitored and censored Internet and prisons still filled with dissidents. Back in 2011, al-Assad drew criticism from around the globe as he met popular protests and unrest with force. Since then, the conflict has escalated into a brutal civil war and the rebels have at times threatened government strongholds in Damascus. Through it all, al-Assad and his government have consistently said that its forces are targeting armed terrorists funded by outside agitators. And the president has shown no sign that he will accede to demands that he stand down and quit the country. In November last year, he told Russia Today TV: ""I am Syrian. I was made in Syria and to live and die in Syria."" Over time, his public appearances have become rare events. But an Instagram account set up on July 24 offers an alternative vision of the president's life -- one that is all about feeding the hungry, science Olympiads and widespread support for al-Assad and his wife, Asma. The closest it comes to reflecting the ongoing war are pictures of the president meeting ""with the armed forces who are fighting the terrorist groups."" Andrew Tabler, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, describes al-Assad as ""a master of deception"" -- and his manipulation of the media is one part of that. ""I think that the regime -- the package of Bashar and his wife Asma, it's very seductive. And it draws you -- how could someone who seems so reasonable command such a horrific regime?"" said Tabler. And if the threat of Western military intervention in Syria is borne out, al-Assad's response may not be an obvious one, he said. ""He's going to think about, 'How am I going to react to these strikes?' Now what we can see from past strikes by the Israelis is that actually Bashar does very, very little in terms of a direct response. But over time, he might carry out other kinds of attacks on American assets."" A brutal war? Not to hear al-Assad's Instagram tell it . 'Victim of cruelty' Two former regime insiders -- now its opponents -- told CNN of their time with the younger al-Assad. Former Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam said Bashar was often the victim of his elder brother's cruelty. ""His brother Basil bullied him as a child. His father never gave him as much attention as Basil,"" Khaddam said. Al-Assad's uncle Rifaat, who left Syria in 1984 after being involved in a failed coup, also recalled the future president. ""He is very different than his father. Hafez was a leader, the head of the entire regime, while Bashar was never that close to being one and never fell within that framework. He is being perceived as the leader but he follows what the regime decides on his behalf."" Al-Assad himself said reform faltered because of unrest in neighboring states -- Lebanon and Iraq. But Khaddam, who was vice president under both Bashar and his father, says the younger al-Assad is both brutal and indecisive. ""Bashar's problem is that he listens to everything but denies and forgets quickly. You discuss an issue with him in the morning and another person comes along and changes his mind. ""Politically, Bashar does not have a consistent ideology; he changes his opinion according to his interests and that of the regime."" And the regime is a family affair. Al-Assad's younger brother Maher commands an elite division of the army, and is accused of widespread human rights abuses. His cousin Rami Makhlouf is the richest man in Syria. The Assads belong to Syria's Alawite minority, who according to the president's uncle Rifaat, are driven by fears they could be overwhelmed. ""There is no doubt that the Alawites are a minority who are in fear of the outcome and they are driven by that fear factor,"" he said. 'Not my forces' Despite the brutal crackdown in Syria, al-Assad has maintained that he is not in charge of Syria's military. He told ABC's Barbara Walters in 2011: ""They are not my forces. They are forces for the government. I don't own them. I'm president. I don't own the country. So they are not my forces."" Wouldn't al-Assad, the commander in chief, have had to give the order for any military actions? ""No, no no,"" he said. Not by your command? ""No,"" he said, ""on no one's command. There was no command to kill or to be brutal."" Al-Assad said those members of the armed forces who ""went too far"" had been disciplined. But Khaddam, the former vice president, expressed no doubts about who does give the orders to kill: ""Bashar Al-Assad and no one else. He gives out orders to use all means of force to crush the revolution. He is surrounded by close aides and a security apparatus that advise him, but he decides."" It wasn't expected that Bashar would carry on the family's political dynasty. He didn't seem to have the personality for the job; he wasn't deeply involved in military or government matters, according to ""Inheriting Syria: Bashar's Trial by Fire,"" a biography by Flynt Leverett, who worked as an expert on Syria for the CIA in the 1990s and was the senior director for Middle East affairs at the National Security Council in the early 2000s. Because his older brother Basil was expected to succeed his father, Bashar al-Assad went to London in the 1990s and studied ophthalmology, and headed the Syrian Computer Society. ""Dr. Bashar,"" as he was widely known, liked to windsurf and play volleyball. He is believed to have started dating British-born Asma al-Akhras during this time. But Bashar was called back to Syria in 1994 when Basil died in a car wreck. This turn of events made him first in line to rule Syria, and he was appointed president by Syria's rubber-stamp Parliament in 2000 after his father died. Before 2000 ended, he and Asma were married. They have three children. Steps toward change? Shortly after the Arab Spring started in early 2011, al-Assad made apparent moves toward change in Syria. Initially, protesters wanted basic reforms, more freedoms, a multiparty political system and an end to emergency law. Some of these measures were, on paper, implemented by al-Assad, but they were far too little and, by the time they came about, too late. In a speech in January 2013, al-Assad laid out his latest solution to the ongoing crisis in Syria. He said he wanted to foster national dialogue and proposed a new constitution that would be put up for a public referendum. He also said he would not negotiate with terrorists and asked regional governments to stop supporting them. Months later, though, any chance of finding a political solution seems as remote as ever. A date has yet to be agreed for a second international meeting on Syria in Geneva, Switzerland, initially proposed for June. After more than two years of violence and more than 100,000 deaths, many opposition supporters have lost any faith they ever had in al-Assad's ability to deliver reform, and simply want an end to his rule and true democratic elections. But the president's days at the helm may be far from over.","Bashar al-Assad has been president of Syria since 2000 .

"(CNN)Royal Jordanian Air Force pilot Moath al-Kasasbeh cut a swashbuckling pose in one military photo, with hands akimbo on his hips, exuding confidence. In another, the cleanshaven young man in uniform appears deadly serious, as one might expect from a fighter pilot whose airstrikes demand precision. Behind his military postures was a devout Muslim who memorized the Quran and hailed from a large family and prominent tribe noted for its loyalty to the monarchy. Al-Kasasbeh's fate had been a mystery since last December, when his aircraft crashed during a mission and he was reportedly captured by ISIS in Syria. That mystery ended Tuesday when video and images purportedly by ISIS show the pilot suffered a horrible death. Footage and images released by the Islamist militants depict the pilot in a cage, being burned alive. Jordanian state TV confirmed his death, but CNN could not immediately verify the authenticity of the tape. The pilot's father, Safi al-Kasasbeh, described his son as an unassuming Muslim. The father made those remarks well before his son's death was disclosed. At the time of the capture, Safi al-Kasasbeh told the Jordan Times that his son was ""a very modest and religious person,"" who memorized the Muslim holy book and ""was never harmful to anyone."" The 27-year-old pilot was a lieutenant, according to the Jordan Times, an English-language newspaper published daily in the kingdom. One of eight children, Moath al-Kasasbeh came from Karak governorate in Jordan and graduated from King Hussein Air College, the newspaper said. Prior to the announcement of his death, a message purportedly from ISIS had presented an ultimatum to Jordan: Bring convicted terrorist Sajida al-Rishawi to the Turkish border by sunset January 29 or the pilot will die. Tied to his fate was that of Japanese hostage Kenji Goto, whose apparent beheading was shown in a video released by ISIS militants over the weekend. Jordan had said it was ready to release al-Rishawi if al-Kasasbeh were to be released unharmed. Reeling with shock at how the pilot was murdered, Jordanian officials were said to be considering a military response to ISIS's claims. King Abdullah condemned the killing, and said that ""the brave pilot was killed in defense of his religion, his country and his (Islamic) nation."" ""It is the duty of the sons and daughters of Jordan to stand together and show the mettle of the Jordanian people in unity, determination and resolve,"" the King said. A Jordanian official said the pilot was actually killed a month ago, in early January. The purported immolation is a macabre closure to al-Kasasbeh's life. While he was still considered missing, the family's desperation grew as time passed and as al-Kasasbeh's fate was linked to that of Goto and the release of al-Rishawi. Goto appeared to hold a picture of the pilot, now bearded, in a video message purported to be from ISIS that was released in January. On the same day, Safi al-Kasasbeh joined hundreds of fellow Jordanians at a solidarity protest held in the capital, Amman, where he called on the Jordanian authorities to act to secure his son's release. ""I firmly ask whomever has sent Moath to fight outside the borders of Jordan, on a mission unrelated to us, to make strong efforts to bring back  Moath,"" he said. ""Moath's blood is precious. It's precious and it represents the blood of all Jordanians,"" he said. The plight of Moath al-Kasasbeh resonated with King Abdullah, who has been a pillar of the international effort against ISIS and is himself a former helicopter pilot. The young captive hailed from a high-ranking tribe considered especially loyal to the royal family. Abdullah's wife, Queen Rania, posted an image to her 400,000 Instagram followers shortly after meeting with the pilot's family. ""We are all Moath,"" it said in Arabic, beneath a picture representing a fighter jet in the colors of the Jordanian flag. From the start, Jordan has played a pivotal part in the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS, but it was not a popular war within Jordan, which only added to the pressure on the authorities to secure al-Kasasbeh's release. In late December, ISIS published in its English-language online magazine Dabiq what it claimed was an ""interview"" with the pilot. Al-Kasasbeh was shown wearing what appeared to be an orange jumpsuit. Asked whether he knew what ISIS would do with him, he replied: ""Yes. They will kill me."" The militants claimed they captured al-Kasasbeh after he ejected from the crashing of his F-16 on December 24. The pilot was part of the U.S.-led coalition airstrikes near ISIS' de-facto capital, Raqqa. Images provided by ISIS's media wing and circulated widely on social media showed bearded men with Kalashnikovs pulling the terrified airman out of a nearby river. ""We entered the region of Raqqa to sweep the area, then the striker jets entered to begin their attack,"" al-Kasasbeh said, according to the online publication. ""My plane was struck by a heat-seeking missile. I heard and felt its hit."" The Jordanian government and U.S. Central Command said the aircraft had crashed but adamantly stated ISIS had not shot it down, as the group claims. ""I checked the system display and it indicated that the engine was damaged and burning,"" the pilot was quoted as saying. ""The plane began to deviate from its normal flight path, so I ejected. I landed in the Furat River by parachute and the seat caught on some ground, keeping me fixed, until I was captured by soldiers of the Islamic State."" CNN's Salma Abdelaziz, Becky Anderson, Jomana Karadsheh and Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.","Images, footage released by ISIS show militants brutally killing pilot .

"(CNN)It was a story that moved Stan Lee, the creator of many of the best-known superheroes in history, into action: a Spider-Man-loving boy with autism named Jamel Hunter. According to the New York Times, a December Times article about the child, who reportedly didn't say a word until he was in preschool, caught the eye of one of Lee's neighbors, jazz musician Corky Hale. That would be the same Stan Lee who co-created Spider-Man (as well as Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, the X-Men and so many other Marvel characters). The Times story described how 8-year-old Jamel, who loves Spider-Man, had a birthday party at an East Harlem community center. The place was full of Spidey images. His struggling mother put everything she had into the party. Upon hearing the tale at his home in California, Lee decided to pitch in. ""After hearing of the boy's situation, how could I not?"" he told CNN. Lee decided to draw a sketch of Spider-Man for Hunter. Lee, it should be noted, isn't an artist; Spidey was first drawn by Steve Ditko. But he can do the character in a pinch. New York Times writer Michael Wilson delivered the drawing to Jamel, with Lee's signature in the corner. ""(Spider-Man) is a teenager, not an adult so (young people) can relate to him,"" Lee explained. ""He has many of the problems they themselves have, such as not enough money."" Lee's act of generosity captured the hearts of many on social media this past weekend. CNN's attempts to reach Jamel's family were unsuccessful.","Comic book legend Stan Lee draws Spider-Man for a boy with autism .

"(CNN)Cristiano Ronaldo scored his first La Liga goal in four games to seal Real Madrid's 2-0 win over Elche Sunday which re-opens its four point lead over Barcelona at the top. Ronaldo also played his part in the 56th opener for Karim Benzema which broke a frustrating deadlock for the league leaders at Estadio Manuel Martinez Valero. Later his firm header after a cross by Isco extinguished any hope of a home comeback, his 29th league goal of the season. Real, looking to take advantage of Barcelona's shock home defeat to Malaga Saturday, had been frustrated by the superb goalkeeping of Przemyslaw Tyton and some wasteful finishing with both Gareth Bale and Ronaldo left to rue first half missed chances. Benzema, who was scoring his 19th goal of the season, also had an earlier spectacular scissor kick effort ruled out. At the other end, Iker Casillas was making his 500th career appearance in the Real goal, but was barely troubled. In another milestone, Carlo Ancelotti was taking charge of his 100th game for Los Blancos, who beat Schalke 2-0 in midweek in defense of the Champions League crown. After the crushing 4-0 defeat to Atletico in the Madrid derby, Ancelotti has been delighted with the reaction of his team. ""Since the loss against Atletico, conceding four goals, we've kept three clean sheets. Team has defended well, everyone together,"" he told gathered reporters. Earlier Sunday, David Moyes' Real Sociedad came from behind to secure a 4-3 win over Sevilla which lifts his side to 10th and eight points clear of the relegation zone. Defeat leaves Sevilla trailing fourth placed Valencia by five points in the battle for Champions League qualification. Liverpool triumph . Meanwhile in the English Premier League, the race for the Champions League spots is also closing up, with Liverpool's 2-0 win at Southampton Sunday boosting its chances. A sublime early strike from Philippe Coutinho and a second half goal from Raheem Sterling sealed three points for the visitors, who move up to sixth, but only two points behind fourth-placed arch-rival Manchester United. Fifth-placed Southampton had two strong penalty appeals turned down but their fate was sealed when Matt Targett slipped as he tried to clear a cross and the ball fell invitingly for Sterling to score his 10th goal of the season. The vital win lifts Liverpool above Tottenham Hotspur, who had to score two late goals to salvage a 2-2 home draw with West Ham. Harry Kane scored an injury time penalty after being pulled down for the spot kick. His initial effort was saved by Hammers goalkeeper Adrian but he converted the follow up. Danny Rose had started the Tottenham fightback after goals from Diafra Sakho and Cheikhou Kouyate had left the visitors ahead with just nine minutes left to play at White Hart Lane. The other game saw bottom club Leicester denied a valuable win as a late own goal from Matthew Upson allowed Everton to equalize for a 2-2 draw.","Real Madrid beats Elche 2-0 in La Liga .

"To the world, he was known as ""Chespirito.""  Roberto Gomez Bolanos gained fame as a comedian, but he was also a writer, actor, screenwriter, songwriter, film director and TV producer. The legendary entertainer died Friday at the age of 85 at his home in Cancun, Mexico.  A native of Mexico City, Gomez Bolanos had been living in the resort town for the last few years due to health problems. He leaves behind his wife, Florinda Meza, also an actress and comedian, and six children from a previous marriage. Gomez Bolanos' death was confirmed by Televisa, the Mexican media conglomerate where he spent most of a career that spanned more than four decades, mainly on television. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto expressed his condolences.  ""Mexico has lost an icon whose work has transcended generations and borders,"" the President said on his Twitter account. According to his official biography, Gomez Bolanos got his nickname from a film director who, after reading something he'd written, dubbed him ""a little Shakespeare."" The term was later adapted to the more Spanish-friendly Chespirito.  The fact that he was only 5 feet 2 inches tall (1.6 meters) reinforced the nickname. Fellow actor and comedian Edgar Vivar called Gomez Bolanos ""the best writer of Spanish-language television."" Vivar, who played several Chespirito's characters, said that part of Gomez Bolanos' genius was ""that he wrote (TV shows) based on the individual actor's or actress' acting ability,"" which allowed for better and funnier comedy situations. His son Roberto Gomez Fernandez, also a TV producer, said his father had ""an extraordinary knowledge of human nature in many respects,"" which allowed his TV shows to be translated into multiple languages without losing their comedic impact. ""His ultimate intention was to entertain audiences in a wholesome way,"" Gomez Fernandez said of his father, who never used profanity or situations not appropriate for children on his shows or movies. Gomez Bolanos was born in 1929.  According to his official biography, his father was a painter, sketch artist and newspaper illustrator.  Though trained as an engineer, Chespirito never worked as one, choosing instead to write for TV and radio shows and screenplays starting in the mid-1950s. By 1968, Gomez Bolanos was already writing for his own show, and by 1971, he had developed two of his most famous TV characters. In ""El Chapulin Colorado"" (""The Red Grasshopper""), Chespirito dressed in a red bodysuit and wore vinyl antennae.  A parody of superheroes like Batman and Superman, the Red Grasshopper had certain powers, like the ability to shrink. ""El Chavo del Ocho"" (""The Boy from Number Eight"") was an orphan boy from a working-class Mexico City neighborhood. By 1973, both TV series were popular throughout Latin America. ""While the parents of my friends went to work building houses or to hospitals or attorneys' offices, my dad would dress in all red, wore antennae and went to work,"" Gomez Fernandez said. ""It was kind of normal to me.  As I grew up, I started to realize how relevant his work was."" Televisa said Chespirito's TV shows ""were watched in Mexico, just like they were watched in Brazil, Thailand or Russia.""  According to Televisa, ""El Chavo del Ocho"" has been dubbed into 50 languages. Chespirito's last show was produced in 1995, but his catchphrases and sayings continue to be part of Mexican culture. El Chapulin Colorado has also been profiled in the American TV series ""The Simpsons."" His first message on Twitter on May 28, 2011, was ""siganme los buenos,"" or ""follow me, those of you who are good,"" a phrase that he constantly used on his shows and that many people still use in Mexico and elsewhere. People we've lost in 2014 .","Known as ""Chespirito,"" Gomez Bolanos was also a writer, actor, director and producer .

"(CNN) -- ""Birdman"" flew high at the nominations for the 72nd Golden Globes. The film, starring Michael Keaton as a former superhero-playing actor trying to recharge his career with a Broadway play, was nominated for seven Golden Globes on Thursday morning, leading all films. ""Birdman"" was nominated for best comedy or musical, best actor in a comedy or musical (Keaton), best supporting actor (Edward Norton), best supporting actress (Emma Stone), best director (Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu), screenplay and score. Two films earned five Globe nominations: ""Boyhood"" and ""The Imitation Game."" Full list of nominations . The best drama nominees are ""Boyhood,"" ""Foxcatcher,"" ""The Imitation Game,"" ""Selma"" and ""The Theory of Everything."" The best comedy or musical nominees are ""Birdman,"" ""Into the Woods,"" ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" ""St. Vincent"" and ""Pride."" The Globes, put on by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, are one of the many tea leaves awards-season watchers examine in order to determine which way the wind is blowing for the big prize, the Oscars. It also makes for a dandy TV show, as the alcohol flows freely and the winners are usually fairly loose (and sometimes loose-lipped). Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, who have been highly praised for their sharp hosting of the show in recent years, will return again for the 2015 edition. Aniston looking strong . Some films were boosted by the Globes' division of films into dramas and comedy/musicals. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" director Wes Anderson's movie about a high-class European lodge between the world wars, was nominated for four Globes, including nods for best comedy or musical, director, star Ralph Fiennes and screenplay. ""St. Vincent,"" starring Bill Murray as a curmudgeonly old man who takes charge of a 12-year-old boy, earned two nominations, for best comedy or musical and Murray's performance. And there were surprises. Jennifer Aniston is now looking like an Oscar contender, thanks to a nomination for best actress in a drama for ""Cake."" She was also nominated for a SAG Award on Wednesday. Julianne Moore picked up two nominations: one for her performance in the drama ""Still Alice"" and the other for best supporting actress in ""Maps to the Stars."" The latter, the new David Cronenberg movie, also earned Moore an honor at the Cannes Film Festival this year. ""Selma"" received nominations for best drama, actor (David Oyelowo), director (Ana DuVernay) and song (""Glory""). ""Glory's"" songwriters, Common and John Legend, were pleased with the attention. ""We're Golden Globe nominated! @Common and I wrote 'Glory' for @AVAETC's beautiful @SelmaMovie. Now we're nominated for Best Original Song!"" Legend exulted on Twitter. Other films fell short. ""Interstellar,"" Christopher Nolan's polarizing film about a trip to the far reaches of the universe, received just one nomination, for Hans Zimmer's score. ""Inherent Vice,"" the new film by much-lauded director Paul Thomas Anderson, also got just one nomination, for Joaquin Phoenix's lead performance. And ""American Sniper,"" a Clint Eastwood film starring Bradley Cooper, came up with nothing, as did Angelina Jolie's ""Unbroken."" Several directors also found themselves squeezed off the list, including ""Foxcatcher's"" Bennett Miller, ""The Imitation Game's"" Morten Tyldum and ""The Theory of Everything's"" James Marsh. 'Fargo' tops TV shows . The Globes also go out to television shows. ""Fargo"" led all nominees with five nominations, followed by ""True Detective"" with four. ""Jane the Virgin"" received two. ""Wow! Normally when your phone starts ringing that early in the morning, something bad happened. Honored,"" tweeted ""Fargo's"" Colin Hanks. With ""Breaking Bad"" now off the air, the drama race seemed open to some new candidates -- but only ""The Affair,"" the Showtime series about a troubled extramarital relationship, squeaked in. The other nominees -- ""Game of Thrones,"" ""Downton Abbey,"" ""The Good Wife"" and ""House of Cards"" -- are familiar, though ""Game of Thrones"" hadn't made the cut since 2012. That was ""Thrones' "" only nomination, however. The comedy series nominations went to ""Girls,"" ""Orange Is the New Black,"" ""Jane the Virgin,"" ""Silicon Valley"" and ""Transparent."" The latter marks Amazon's first Golden Globe nomination. Perhaps more surprising were the shows that came up empty. ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"" last year's best comedy series winner, didn't get a single nomination. Neither did ""Modern Family"" or ""The Big Bang Theory."" ""Scandal"" was also left out entirely; not even its star, Kerry Washington, who received a nomination last year, nabbed a nomination. However, producer Shonda Rhimes' new show, ""How to Get Away With Murder,"" earned a nomination for star Viola Davis. Not that ""Scandal"" star Joshua Malina minded. He puckishly thanked the Foreign Press Association for a nomination he didn't receive. ""Thrilled to have been nominated for my first Golden Globe! Thanks, foreigners! #Scandal #Humbled #WhyArePeopleHumbledByAwards,"" he tweeted. The 72nd Golden Globes will air January 11 on NBC.","""Birdman"" picks up seven Golden Globe nominations .

"(CNN) -- The Sinjar Mountains rise suddenly from the endless desert of northern Iraq, a ridge of craggy rock some 50 kilometers (30 miles) long, running east to west. Barren and windswept, some 1,400 meters (4,600 feet) high, they make a forbidding sight. But for centuries, they have been the refuge of the desperate and a place of mystical importance. Last week, the mountains saw another influx, as tens of thousands of people tried to escape the rapid advance of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, which now calls itself the Islamic State. Many of them were Yazidis, fleeing the town of Sinjar and surrounding villages in convoys of dozens of vehicles. The lucky ones used smuggling routes to cross into Syria and back into Kurdish-controlled areas of northern Iraq. The less fortunate were either seized by ISIS militants or headed into the mountains. The Yazidi are an ancient religious sect -- mainly ethnic Kurds -- that worship an angel figure held by many Muslims to be the devil. ISIS has executed Yazidis who refuse to convert to its extreme ideology. By Sunday, according to Iraqi and Kurdish sources, as many as 20,000 had been able to leave the mountains -- perhaps half of those who had been stranded for nearly a week. U.N. agencies estimated late last week there were as many as 50,000 people in the mountains. Kurdish peshmerga forces appear to have secured an escape route, but a hazardous one with ISIS militants still roaming the area. According to some accounts, Syrian Kurds also helped people use parts of northeastern Syria under their control to reach Kurdish areas of northern Iraq. U.S. airstrikes Saturday against several armored personnel carriers used by ISIS in the area may have helped the escape. But President Obama acknowledged Saturday that securing safe passage for those still stranded would be ""logistically complicated."" Donatella Rovera of Amnesty International, who is in the region, spoke Sunday of families that had escaped, arriving in the town of Fishkhabour after a circuitous trek through Syria ""in terrible condition, fainting from exhaustion."" Some had told her that ISIS had abducted women and girls. Unless food and water reach those remaining, mainly on the southern slopes, they have an impossible choice between dying of dehydration and giving themselves up to ISIS. Daytime temperatures exceed 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit). Video of a Kurdish relief mission showed a helicopter landing with supplies on a barren scarp. Hundreds of desperate people ran toward it. Twenty lucky ones were able to scramble aboard for the return flight, many of them hysterical. A few dozen more have been picked up by Iraqi helicopters, which have also been bringing aid to the mountains. Photographs from last week showed thousands of people abandoning their vehicles before trekking to higher altitudes, carrying what they could. On the northern side of the range, Christians were also fleeing, as ISIS fighters pushed toward the mountains from two directions. A few took refuge in caves, according to those who have escaped. Many more wandered the boulder-strewn slopes. The U.S. Air Force has carried out three relief drops on successive nights since Thursday, which have included some 50,000 ready-to-eat meals. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the Pentagon had ""pretty solid information"" that of the 72 bundles dropped by C-17 and C-130 aircraft in the first mission, more than 60 had reached ""the people who were trapped up there."" Two more U.S. airdrops followed, the latest on Saturday night, as well as one by the Royal Air Force. The U.N. Children's Fund -- UNICEF -- estimates that at least 20 flights would be needed to keep the thousands trapped alive for a week. France is also planning aid drops. Crossroads of conflict . The Yazidis settled in the area around Sinjar in the 12th century. The mountains on which they now suffer had a special place in their beliefs. Yazidi tradition held that Noah's Ark had come to rest on the summit. As a minority, they are no strangers to conflict and persecution. Through the ages, cultures, religions and ethnicities have competed and clashed in this part of Iraq. In the early 19th century, the Kurds, Arabs and Yazidis all had different names for Sinjar. Kurdish fighters invaded Yazidi lands, killing hundreds. Frederick Forbes, a British colonial officer who visited the area in 1838, said the Yazidis had ""kept the whole of the country between Mosul and Nisibin in a state of alarm"" until being ""pacified"" by the Ottoman Empire. When he reached the town of Sinjar, Forbes found a fertile place fed by mountain streams, but the ""ruins of many Mohammedan buildings"" recalled earlier battles. Another colonial visitor, Gertrude Bell, wrote in the 1920s that ""until a couple of years ago the Yezidis were ceaselessly at war with the Arabs and with everybody else."" Everybody else included the Turkish army, which had tried to force the Yazidis to convert to Islam in the last few years of the 19th century, a story told by the traveler Oswald Hutton Parry in his ""Six Months in a Syrian Monastery,"" written in 1895. After the Yazidis had been told to convert, Parry wrote, ""none responded. Christianity they were less unready to accept; the Christians were their friends and fellow-sufferers. Islam had always cursed and persecuted them."" So the Sultan sent troops commanded by his son to Yazidi villages. ""The soldiers slew in all some five hundred men. ... The pretty women and girls he took captive, marrying them by force to his soldiers."" The Yazidis did indeed see Christians as fellow sufferers. A hundred years ago, they helped Armenian Christians fleeing Turkey to settle in the shadow of the Sinjar Mountains, along with Chaldean and Syriac Catholics. But in the spring of 1918, Turkish forces arrived and destroyed the settlement as well as many Yazidi homes. For a while after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the Yazidis were unsure whether they would end up as part of Iraq or Syria. Eventually, in 1933, an international commission placed Sinjar inside Iraq -- a decision by colonial overlords that would later haunt the Yazidis. During Saddam Hussein's rule, many of their settlements were razed and their inhabitants forced into ""collective villages"" as a buffer against the troublesome Kurds. As Matthew Barber writes in the blog Syria Comment, ""Saddam bulldozed countless Yazidi towns until there was nothing left but gravel, and then forcibly moved their former inhabitants into collectives situated in locations that served his strategic interests."" At least one of those collectives saw its population swell with refugees from Sinjar in recent days. Even after Hussein was overthrown, there was little peace for the Yazidis. Relations with Sunni Arabs remained tense, and after a 17-year old Yazidi girl in the town of Bashika was suspected of having a relationship with a Sunni teenager, extremists murdered more than 20 Yazidis. The girl was stoned to death by her own relatives for daring to have an ""impure relationship"" -- a so-called honor killing. At the time, the region was a stronghold of al Qaeda in Iraq and a conduit for militants arriving from Syria to fight U.S. forces. Suicide bombings in August 2007 targeted Yazidi communities in and around the town of Qahataniya, killing nearly 200 people. One U.S. military raid near Sinjar in October of that year uncovered hundreds of al Qaeda documents listing foreign fighters who had passed through the area. Now another -- much more powerful -- surge of Islamist militancy threatens the existence of one of the Middle East's most vulnerable peoples.","Tens of thousands of people are trying to escape militants from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria .

"(CNN)The same superbug that contributed to two deaths in Los Angeles has been reported in North Carolina, where one person has died, a spokesman told CNN. Eighteen people have contracted carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, so far this year, said Kevin McCarthy, spokesman with the Carolinas HealthCare System. Of those, 15 had CRE upon admission to the hospital in Charlotte; three acquired it in the hospital, and one died, the spokesman said. The cause of death was not immediately clear. McCarthy declined to provide details on any of the patients. It was also not clear how any of them became infected. In Los Angeles, seven patients contracted CRE after routine endoscopic procedures. Two of them died, the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center said last week. CRE was a contributing factor in the deaths, but the exact cause of the deaths wasn't immediately disclosed in those cases either. Hospital officials there have said the outbreak was caused by two medical scopes that still carried the deadly bacteria even though disinfection guidelines were followed. The UCLA hospital was using a duodenoscope made by Olympus, but the Food and Drug Administration is also reviewing data from the two other U.S. companies that make the devices, Fujifilm and Pentax. The medical center is contacting 179 others who underwent endoscopic procedures between October and January. It's offering them home tests to screen for the bacteria. In a statement, McCarthy said Carolinas HealthCare System uses standard methods for disinfecting its equipment, saying that all duodenoscopes that have been tested have shown to be negative for CRE. Some CRE bacteria can resist most antibiotics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website. CNN's Ben Tinker, Michael Martinez and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Eighteen people have contracted CRE so far this year at a hospital in Charlotte, North Carolina .

"One moment, a man reaches into his vehicle after a South Carolina trooper asked for his driver's license. Seconds later, the trooper shoots him, and the man asks why. Days afterward, prosecutors aren't satisfied with the answer. Authorities released dash-camera video Wednesday showing what they say is Sean Groubert, a decorated South Carolina Highway Patrol trooper, shooting Levar Jones, who was unarmed, in the parking lot of a gas station just outside Columbia on September 4. Jones, 35, survived the shooting. But Groubert, who has since been fired for the incident, has been charged with aggravated assault and battery, a felony that could get him up to 20 years in prison if convicted, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division said Wednesday. ""The force administered in this case was unwarranted, inconsistent with how our troopers are trained, and clearly in violation of department policies,"" South Carolina Public Safety Director Leroy Smith said last week in announcing Groubert's firing. This wasn't the first time Groubert had fired his weapon. He was lauded the previous time: His department gave him a medal of valor for an incident in which he and another trooper shot and injured a man who had shot at them in 2012, SCPSD spokeswoman Sherri Iacobelli said. Patrol officer beats woman . 'Why did you shoot me?' In this year's incident, police said Groubert, 31, stopped Jones in the parking lot of a Circle K station in daylight, for what police say was an alleged seat belt violation, around 5 p.m. Video that authorities say was recorded from Groubert's police car shows the trooper driving up to a vehicle just as its driver -- who authorities say is Jones -- steps out of the vehicle. When Groubert asks for Jones' license, Jones pivots toward the vehicle he just exited -- the driver's door is still open -- and leans inside as if to retrieve something, the video shows. About two seconds later, the trooper that police identify as Groubert comes into view with a gun drawn and yells ""Get out of the car! Get out of the car!"" The gun is fired -- at least four shots are heard -- and Jones steps away from the vehicle, raising his hands in the air and eventually moving off camera. ""I just got my license! You said get my license!"" says someone off camera, apparently Jones. After being told to put his hands behind his back, Jones asks: ""What did I do, sir?"" ""Are you hit?"" asks another off-camera voice, apparently Groubert's. ""I think so,"" comes the response. ""I can't feel my leg. I don't know what happened."" The conversation continues: . ""Why did you shoot me?"" ""Well, you dove head-first back into your car. Then you (unintelligible), I'm telling you get out of your car."" Ohio man shot by police in Walmart store . Shot in the hip . Jones was shot in the hip, CNN affiliate WACH reported. He was taken to a hospital and later released, authorities said. Jones was found not to be armed, Smith said. ""I believe this case was an isolated incident in which Mr. Groubert reacted to a perceived threat where there was none,"" Smith said last week. In a court hearing Wednesday night, a judge ordered Groubert held with bond set at $75,000, WACH reported. CNN's attempts to reach Groubert's and Jones' lawyers weren't immediately successful. In explaining Groubert's firing Friday, Smith said the department's policy on using force says that officers can use ""only the level of force necessary to accomplish lawful objectives."" ""That protocol was not followed in this case. Further, this incident occurred in broad daylight. Mr. Groubert had a clear and unobstructed view of Mr. Jones,"" Smith said. The shooting, Smith said, ""deviates from SCDPS standards and cannot be tolerated."" Medal of valor . Groubert, who joined the Highway Patrol in 2005, earned kudos for the other time he'd fired his gun in the line of duty. Police said Groubert stopped a car that had passed him at a high rate of speed in Richland County in August 2012. The driver eventually took off without permission, and Groubert pursued him, police said. Another trooper joined the pursuit, and the driver stopped at a bank, exited his vehicle and fired shots at both troopers in the parking lot, police said. Groubert and the other trooper returned fire, injuring the suspect, the SCDPS said. At some point, it appeared that the suspect intended to go inside the bank, Iacobelli said. That suspect was charged with attempted murder and convicted in 2013, according to the SCDPS. The SCDPS gave Groubert a medal of valor in 2013 for his handling of the incident, Iacobelli said.","South Carolina police release a video of a trooper shooting a man in a traffic stop .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)Deposed Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi picked up support Monday from the Gulf Cooperation Council, with that regional group of six Arab states calling on the Yemeni people to support Hadi against Houthi militants who forced him from office. Hadi escaped from the capital, Sanaa, on Saturday after being under house arrest for a month following his resignation under pressure from Houthi rebels. After his escape, he released a statement declaring he is still President of Yemen, and calling all political decision made since September illegal and invalid. The statement from the Gulf Cooperation Council Monday echoed Hadi, with council members stressing that all procedures taken by the Houthi after their coup were invalid. According to two presidential aides, Hadi met Monday with an official Saudi delegation that informed him of Saudi Arabia's recognition of him as the constitutional President of Yemen. Meanwhile the Gulf council -- whose member countries are the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait -- urged the U.N. Security Council to consider measures against the Houthis, and the council called on the Houthis to release Prime Minister Khalid Bahah along with government ministers who remain under Houthi arrest. A nephew of the President was kidnapped Sunday by Houthi rebels, two security officials in Ibb province told CNN. The nephew, Nasser Ahmed Mansour Hadi, was heading to the seaport province of Aden, where the President fled after escaping from house arrest. Tens of thousands of anti-Houthi protesters took to the streets Monday for the third continuous day in support of Hadi. On Sunday, Sanaa saw large demonstrations calling for an end to the militant occupation of the city, and urging Hadi to stand against the Houthis. ""The Houthis thought they could not be stopped, and it only took hours for them to fall in the eyes of the people. Yemen has a President and the people will stand with him to uproot the Houthi militants from Sanaa,"" Ali Al-Saedi, a protest organizer in Sanaa, told CNN. In Taiz, tens of thousands took to the streets to show support for the legitimacy of Hadi as President, and to condemn the continued Houthi takeover of the capital. They carried placards reading ""Out to militant rule, return of government institutions."" Last month, Houthis attacked the presidential palace and ministerial Cabinet, forcing both the President and Prime Minister to resign. Houthi militants then put Hadi under house arrest. Since then, Houthis have failed to form a government or reach a deal with other political factions for the formation of a presidential council. The militants tightened their grip on power over the last month, but the House of Representatives has not met to accept Hadi's resignation. Hours after Hadi fled Sanaa on Saturday, Houthi officials tried to force parliamentarians to meet immediately to accept his resignation, but their efforts failed. On Monday, a senior aide to Hadi said the ousted President sent a letter to Yemen's head of Parliament asking that his resignation be withdrawn. The ruling General People's Congress Party, headed by Yemen's former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, which holds a majority of seats in Parliament, said it will not push for a Parliament vote to accept the resignation of Hadi. ""Hadi is the President of Yemen, since his resignation has yet to officially reach Parliament. Yemen is still led by a constitutional elected President,"" said Abdul Aziz Jubari, the secretary general of the independent Justice and Building Party. Houthis are Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni Muslim country. They had been at war with the central government for more than a decade, but their entry into Sanaa in September brought things to a head, sparking battles that left than 300 people dead before a ceasefire was agreed to that month. Houthis then pressured Hadi to step down last month after he refused to agree to certain political demands. The Houthis' takeover of Sanaa stunned governments of Western nations, which pulled out diplomatic staff this month. Foreign evacuation continued in the Yemeni capital as Egypt evacuated all its Embassy staff and closed its Embassy on Monday morning. Earlier this month, the United States, along with most European and Gulf countries, suspended operations in their embassies in Yemen amid growing unrest. CNN's Jason Hanna, Ed Payne, Ben Brumfield and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Aide: Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi has sent a letter to Parliament withdrawing his resignation .

"The head of the opposition Free Syrian Army told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Thursday he has intelligence showing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government is moving its chemical weapons out of the country. ""Today, we have information that the regime began to move chemical materials and chemical weapons to Lebanon and to Iraq,"" Gen. Salim Idriss said from inside Syria. CNN could not independently verify Idriss' claim. Several senior Israeli officials told CNN's Elise Labott that they have not seen movements into Lebanon or Iraq, and that they did not believe it made sense for the Syrians to be moving weapons so soon. And Iraq categorically denied that chemical weapons had crossed into its territory, with an adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki speculating ""there is a political agency behind this claim."" ""We were the victims of chemical weapons under Saddam's regime,"" said the adviser, Ali al-Moussawi. ""And we will never allow to let any country to transfer chemical materials to our lands at all."" Still, if the allegation were true, it could fundamentally shift the assessments of U.S. intelligence officials, CNN's Barbara Starr reports. Namely, these officials have said that al-Assad would not disperse his stockpile of chemical weapons because he knows the United States would not bomb it, that Syrian security forces firmly control the weapons and that there exists a large, secure infrastructure that has been moving these arms from rebel-held areas. Moving these weapons into Iraq, Lebanon or some other country outside Syria might prompt U.S. intelligence authorities to question whether they were being transferred by a rogue element or whether it was evidence of a crack in the government's control. The Syrian opposition is afraid, Idriss told CNN's Amanpour, that al-Assad's forces will then use those weapons sometime in the future -- even after the international effort to collect and destroy its chemical weapons arsenal is finished. ""The regime,"" he said, ""is behaving like Saddam Hussein."" Idriss said he talked Thursday about what's happening diplomatically with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who the rebel leader claimed told him ""that he will discuss with the Russians how honest the regime is."" ""And if our friends discover that the regime is trying to play games and waste time,"" Idriss said by way of summarizing Kerry's remarks, ""the threat of the strikes is still on the table."" Earlier on Thursday, Idriss told NPR that he had not received ""any weapons from our American friends,"" despite reports that lethal aid had indeed started reaching the Syrian opposition. That includes a U.S. official who told CNN on Wednesday that light and anti-tank weapons as well as ammunition -- paid for by the United States albeit made elsewhere -- had begun flowing to Syrian rebels over the past two weeks. Idriss told Amanpour that he ""can't talk about weapons,"" though he did stress that opposition forces were getting help. ""We are getting now a lot of support from our American friends, but I can't talk in detail about all kinds of the support,"" he said. For its part, the opposition will support efforts to take control of and eventually dismantle Syria's chemical weapons, with Idriss saying, ""We will do our best to help them."" But the rebel leader questioned that things will play out as hoped. ""I think the regime will prevent them to go to the locations and to do their job,"" Idriss said. ""I think the regime will tell them, 'Today you can't go out of the hotels because the situation is very dangerous, and tomorrow you can't go,' and they will delay and delay."" And even if Idriss is proven wrong and Syria's chemical weapons are wiped out as part of this process, the rebel leader stressed that bigger issues remain in a civil war that the U.N. estimates has killed more than 100,000 people -- most of them by conventional weapons. ""We have many, many problems with the regime,"" he said. ""The chemical weapons (are) not ... the only problem that we have.""","Gen.

"They brave the risk of drowning, drifting endlessly or dying of thirst to make it illegally to a better life in Europe. Migrants traveling, often on overfilled boats, usually make it. But last year, 3,419 didn't. They perished in the Mediterranean Sea, the United Nations Refugee Agency said Wednesday. Some went under, like the 500 killed, when their angry traffickers sank their boat on purpose in September, according to survivors. The men, women and children had refused to transfer to very small boat they felt sure would not hold them and wasn't seaworthy. They asked to be taken back to their departure port in Egypt. Instead the traffickers rammed their boat and laughed while they watched it sink, the survivors said. The seafaring dangers are little deterrent for those leaving abject misery, such as the intense bloodshed of wars, which is driving hordes into asylum. More than 207,000 people have crossed the Mediterranean for Europe this year illegally -- almost three times the previous high of about 70,000 in 2011, the agency said.  That's 60% of the 348,000 boat migrants worldwide this year. Figures on such crossings is inexact, as many boats elude detection. ""Europe, facing conflicts to its south (Libya), east (Ukraine) and south-east (Syria/Iraq) is seeing the largest number of sea arrivals,"" the UNHCR said. Nearly 50% of the sea arrivals are from the civil-war ravaged Syria and from Eritrea, where a dictator has ruled for more than 20 years, and where, Human Rights Watch says, young people are forcibly conscripted into the military, often for open-ended servitude akin to slavery. The Italian government has led search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean -- called Mare Nostrum or ""Our Sea"" -- rescuing tens of thousands of migrants. Despite pleas from various aid agencies, it ended those operations in October. But boat migrants come from many conflict regions. The Horn of Africa region saw an estimated 82,680 people crossing mainly from Ethiopia and Somalia making their way to Yemen and other countries in the Middle East. And in Asia, nearly 54,000 people have taken to the sea, the majority from Bangladesh and Myanmar crossing through the Bay of Bengal. Last month, at least 24 people died after a boat carrying 43 illegal migrants and asylum seekers sank near Istanbul, Turkey. Nine of the passengers were carrying Afghan passports.","UN: 3,419 die in migrant boats on the Mediterranean Sea in 2014 .

"Disturbing reports are emerging from Afghanistan that a 10-year-old girl named Spozhmai was pre-empted from carrying out a suicide bombing attack against a police station in Khanshin. Though Taliban forces are already deploying female operatives in a limited capacity, it was the first report of a young girl who was groomed for martyrdom. It represents the latest development in a long history of terrorist organizations' use of children. BBC reports suggest the girl is the sister of a Taliban commander. This is not unexpected. Indeed multiple Islamist groups specifically recruit within their own families. In Chechnya and Dagestan, we have seen sisters, brothers and cousins involved in terrorist operations, sometimes together. In both Afghanistan and Pakistan, various Taliban units have engaged in targeted recruitment of pairs of siblings. In our research over the past year into children being groomed for terrorist activity in Pakistan, several of the youth we encountered undergoing de-radicalization and preparation for reintegration via the Sabaoon facility (Pakistan's rehabilitation facility for child militants) were recruited by relatives in the Pakistani Taliban. In almost all cases we have studied, the child recruits were genuinely unaware of what they were being asked to do -- what such operations could entail. Those who were aware displayed serious hesitation and were often given drugs by their recruiters to help them to comply. Some of the children changed their minds at the last minute and thus found refuge at Sabaoon. Duping children into carrying out a suicide attack is not a new tactic. In June 2007 in the southern Afghan province of Ghazni, the Taliban failed to deceive a 6-year-old boy, Juma Gul, into being a suicide bomber. Putting the vest on him, the Taliban repeatedly told him that ""flowers and food would appear once he pressed the button."" Walking toward his target, Juma hesitated. He decided not to press the button and instead called out for help from nearby Afghan National Army soldiers, who deactivated the device on his body. The incident was a watershed. Abdul Rahim Deciwal, the chief administrator for Juma's village of Athul, brought the boy and his brother to meet with the village elders, who expressed strong disapproval of the tactic and even began cooperating with NATO forces to weed out the Taliban. Incidents such as these would appear to indicate that Taliban fighters are adopting the strategies of Iraqi insurgents, who have been known to use children to disguise bomb-laden vehicles or dupe drivers into carrying improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, at times without their knowledge. In those cases, the would-be bombers are detonated by remote control. This week's report of the attempted attack did not include a remote control detonator, and the 10-year-old girl was unsuccessful in executing the mission of those who deployed her. Afghan security forces, however, have long been aware of this particularly insidious tactic. Taliban spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadi has denied the group used child fighters, disclosing at the time of the Juma Gul incident that the Taliban had hundreds of adults ready for suicide missions. ""We don't need to use a child,"" he said. ""It's against Islamic law, it's against humanitarian law. This is just propaganda against the Taliban."" Such statements are easily disputed. For example, in the publicly released documents seized from his Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound, Osama bin Laden acknowledged that ""most of the work in Afghanistan (has) turned to the goal of luring and preparing the youth."" More recently, in November, there were media reports that Afghan police had pre-empted a 12-year-old bomber in the Panjwai district of Kandahar; the child was allegedly wearing an explosive vest en route to a local girls' school. When children are forced into terrorism, they become victimized and traumatized by their experiences in the process. In turn, they exploit and victimize others. Many remain in the movement until adulthood and beyond. And it's not just in their home countries: Efforts to groom children and adolescents as a future generation of militants has also been uncovered in diaspora communities within the United States and the UK. Perhaps the most well-known case in recent times has been the disappearance of some 17 Somali-American adolescent boys and young men from Minneapolis. Jonathan Evans, former director-general of the British Security Service, or MI5, warned that al Qaeda is targeting vulnerable youth -- even the very young -- in such communities as terrorist recruits, underscoring the need to protect children everywhere from exposure to violent extremism. Evans explained: ""They are (radicalizing), indoctrinating and grooming young, vulnerable people to carry out acts of terrorism. This year, we have seen individuals as young as 15 and 16 implicated in terrorist-related activity."" Such realities pose serious challenges to countering violent extremism, especially when most efforts today place firm emphasis on undermining the allure of troublesome ideologies. Most of the children are not recruited on ideological grounds, and in cases where some children do appear to be under some ideological influence, it is clear they do not understand it. Whether for children recruited by the Pakistani Taliban, or young Somalis recruited in Minneapolis, there is a critical role to be played by families and communities in protecting young children from being vulnerable to the clutches of violent extremists. These efforts cannot be limited to a frame of counterterrorism. This is a challenge of basic child protection.","Writers: Reports of 10-year-girl in Afghanistan intent on suicide bombing is a first .

"Tensions spiked in the Middle East on Tuesday as Iran extolled its ""axis of resistance"" with Syria, and the United States warned of proxy and terror activity. Saeed Jalili, a top Iranian official meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, was cited by Syrian state media as saying he will not permit ""enemies"" to break what he called the ""axis of resistance of which Syria is an essential part."" ""What is taking place in Syria is not an internal issue but rather a conflict between the resistance axis on one hand and the enemies of this axis in the region and the world on the other hand, with the goal being to strike Syria's resistant role,"" state media quoted Jalili as saying. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, said from Pretoria, South Africa, that those working ""to exploit the misery of the Syrian people, either by sending in proxies or by sending in terrorist fighters, must recognize that that will not be tolerated, first and foremost by the Syrian people."" World powers have not intervened in Syria, but the lines in the sand have been drawn regionally and internationally. Nations such as the United States, France, Britain and Turkey, as well as Arab League countries such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia, have supported Syrian rebels and the opposition. There are also reports of Islamist cells schooled in terror tactics helping some rebels fight the al-Assad regime, and weaponry has flowed across the borders to Free Syrian Army rebels. Syria has been supported by Iran and groups like Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group. Syria is heavily equipped with Russian weaponry. Jalili and Clinton spoke as violence raged in Aleppo, Damascus and its suburbs, and other hot spots. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said at least 170 people were killed across the nation Tuesday. CNN inside Aleppo: Strafed by shells, fear, misery . Syrian State TV showed footage of Jalili and al-Assad meeting, the first video of the president that has surfaced since last month. The diplomats spoke a day after the defection of Riyad Hijab, who was Syria's prime minister for the last two months. Hijab cited the ""killing and terrorist regime"" as a reason for his defection. He arrived in Jordan on Tuesday, according to a source with knowledge of the situation. Clinton remarked that his departure was the latest ""in a line of such defections."" Jalili, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, met with al-Assad to discuss resolving the 17-month-long civil war and rescuing several Iranians who were kidnapped over the weekend in Syria. The Iranian diplomat called on Syrians to sit down and forge a solution to the crisis, which morphed into a nationwide uprising and civil war after government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters in March 2011. ""The Islamic Republic of Iran believes in a Syrian solution based on national dialogue among all Syrian groups to settle the country's issues, and does not consider foreign approaches as useful,"" Jalili said, according to Iran's state-run Press TV. Syrian and Iranian news outlets have reported that 48 Shiite pilgrims from Iran were abducted Saturday. But rebels say the Iranians are military personnel, an assertion Iran denies. Iran's foreign ministry is working through diplomatic channels, such as the United Nations, to get the people freed. Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi, in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon asking for help in freeing the people, also has expressed concern about media reports that three of the people were killed by rebels and hostage-takers have threatened to kill others. The ministry has summoned the charge d'affaires of Switzerland to protest the abduction and urge the United States to use its influence to free the abducted Iranians. An Iranian Foreign Ministry official said Washington is responsible for the lives of the Iranians because the United States supports the rebels. The Swiss Embassy represents U.S. interests in Iran because the United States and Iran lack diplomatic relations. Syrian blogger: 'I live or die here' Acting Deputy State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said the United States cannot confirm the identity of the Iranians but is following the situation closely and would like more information. Ventrell, speaking to reporters Tuesday, said Iran's contention that the United States is responsible for their security ""doesn't seem to make sense."" ""We call on anyone holding prisoners in this conflict to treat them humanely and in accordance with international law. And of course people will be held responsible if that is not followed,"" he said. Clinton, meanwhile, said that the opposition ""is becoming increasingly coordinated and effective,"" holding territory from northern Aleppo to the Turkish border and seizing regime weaponry such as tanks. Noting opposition strides and government setbacks, she said planners can begin talking about what happens after the regime falls, even though there's no timeline. ""The intensity of the fighting in Aleppo, the defections, really point out how imperative it is that we come together and work toward a good transition plan,"" she said. ""We must figure out a way to hasten the day when the bloodshed ends, and the political transition begins."" Clinton was referring to the battle in Aleppo, Syria's most populous city, where rebels and regime forces fight for control of the sprawling metropolis amid fears of a major Syrian military assault. State TV said special forces engaged terrorist groups in Aleppo and caused big losses to them, including casualties and injuries. The LCC said at least 33 people died in Aleppo, including 10 ""field-executed"" prisoners, as shelling engulfed the city. The 24 U.N. monitors in Aleppo have been temporarily pulled out of the city because of the ""deteriorating security situation,"" a spokeswoman for the U.N. Supervision Mission in Syria said. Deaths mounted in other regions, including 33 in Damascus and its suburbs, 35 in Homs, and 25 in Daraa, the LCC said. The group reported warplane shelling and clashes. In one incident in the Damascus suburbs, a muezzin, the mosque official who proclaims the call to prayer, was killed when regime forces stormed, vandalized and burned a mosque, according to the LCC. As the violence spirals, France is proposing a ministerial meeting of the U.N. Security Council to be held on August 30, Western diplomats said Tuesday. Past attempts by the council to adopt tough resolutions against the regime, including more widespread sanctions, have been blocked by Russia and China. Roughly 17,000 people have been killed since the Syrian conflict began, U.N. Secretary-General Ban said last month. The opposition has put the toll at more than 20,000.

"Syria has crossed a ""red line"" with its use of chemical weapons, including the nerve agent sarin gas, against rebels, a move that is prompting the United States to increase the ""scale and scope"" of its support for the opposition, the White House said Thursday. The acknowledgment is the first time President Barack Obama's administration has definitively said what it has long suspected -- that President Bashar al-Assad's forces have used chemical weapons in the ongoing civil war. ""The intelligence community estimates that 100 to 150 people have died from detected chemical weapons attacks in Syria to date; however, casualty data is likely incomplete,"" Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, said in a statement released by the White House. ""While the lethality of these attacks make up only a small portion of the catastrophic loss of life in Syria, which now stands at more than 90,000 deaths, the use of chemical weapons violates international norms and crosses clear red lines that have existed within the international community for decades,"" Rhodes added. The administration also appeared to indicate that it was stepping up its support of the rebels, who have been calling for the United States and others to provide arms needed to battle al-Assad's forces. ""Put simply, the Assad regime should know that its actions have led us to increase the scope and scale of assistance that we provide to the opposition, including direct support to the (rebel Supreme Military Council). These efforts will increase going forward,"" Rhodes' statement said. 'Our own timeline' Rhodes later told reporters on a conference call that the president has made a decision about military support for the rebels but stopped short of saying the U.S. government would put weapons in the hands of rebels. The president has previously said he did not foresee a scenario with ""American boots on the ground in Syria."" Rhodes also said no decision has been made by Obama over whether to institute a no-fly zone in Syria, something rebel forces have said is needed to halt al-Assad's aerial bombardment of their strongholds. The administration plans to share its findings with Congress and its allies, and it will make a decision about how to proceed ""on our own timeline,"" Rhodes said. Syria will be among the chief topics for Obama at the Group of Eight summit in Northern Ireland next week, where Rhodes said the president will share the U.S. findings on al-Assad's use of chemical weapons. ""We'll be consulting at the G8 and the United Nations about what might be necessary,"" Rhodes said. Syria has long maintained that rebels, not government forces, are behind the use of chemical weapons. It also asked the United Nations to investigate its claims, but it didn't allow inspectors into the country after the United Nations demanded that its teams be given unrestricted access to the country. The administration believes that al-Assad's government maintains control of the chemical weapons and that there is ""no reliable, corroborated reporting to indicate that the opposition in Syria has acquired or used chemical weapons,"" Rhodes statement said. Rhodes gave no indication of how many times al-Assad's forces used chemical weapons, but a U.S. Senate source briefed on the matter said the administration believes Syria used such weapons on at least eight occasions. No 'half measures' The White House announcement comes at a critical time for the Syrian opposition, which has suffered a series of significant losses in recent weeks. The setbacks in large part have coincided with the arrival of thousands of Hezbollah Shiite fighters, backed by Lebanon and Iran, to reinforce al-Assad's forces battling the mainly Sunni uprising. After months of gaining ground, the rebels this month lost Qusayr -- one of its strongholds near the Lebanese border -- that was considered essential for its supply route. U.S. Sen. John McCain, who has repeatedly called on the administration to step up its support of the rebels, said on CNN's Situation Room that the rebels need anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons. ""They need a lot more military assistance,"" McCain, an Arizona Republican, said, adding that the United States and its allies also need to ""establish a 'no-fly' zone to create a safe area"" within Syria. ""You can't do it with half measures. You can't do it with just supplying weapons,"" he said. McCain said the options were not ideal and a response will not be easy. But doing nothing, he said, would be catastrophic. Until now, the United States has limited its aid to rebels, providing communications equipment, medical supplies and food. What complicates any U.S. military support for the opposition is that many of the rebel fighters are militants with pro-al Qaeda sympathies, the same stripe of militants America has battled in Iraq and Afghanistan. They include an group called the al-Nusra Front, a rebel group that the United States says has links to al Qaeda. Earlier this year, the United States said its intelligence analysts had concluded ""with varying degrees of confidence"" that chemical weapons had been used in the Syrian civil war. But Obama said then that ""intelligence assessments alone are not sufficient."" Syria's stockpile . As recently as last week, France's foreign minister said sarin gas had been used several times in the Syrian civil war, citing results from test samples in France's possession. In early May, the head of the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said that evidence points to the use of sarin by Syrian rebel forces. But the commission later issued a news release saying it ""has not reached conclusive findings as to the use of chemical weapons in Syria by any parties to the conflict."" In April, the head of the Israeli military's intelligence research said the Syrian government is using chemical weapons against rebel forces. Sarin gas can be hard to detect because it is colorless, odorless and tasteless. It can cause severe injuries, including blurred vision, convulsions, paralysis and death, to those exposed to it. Analysts believe the Syrian government may have one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons in the world. Specifically, the supply is believed to include sarin, mustard and VX gases, which are banned under international law. Syria has denied the allegation. The Chemical Weapons Convention prohibits the production, stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons. Syria is not one of the 188 signatories to the convention. In recent months, reports have repeatedly surfaced that Syrian forces have moved some of the chemical weapons inventories possibly because of deteriorating security in the country, raising fears the stockpile could fall into the hands of al Qaeda-linked groups working with the opposition should al-Assad's government fall. As a result, the United States has been talking with neighboring countries about the steps needed to secure the weapons should al-Assad be forced from office. The U.N. estimates that more than 92,000 people have been killed since the conflict began in March 2011, when a brutal government crackdown on Arab Spring-inspired protests devolved into an armed conflict.","The White House says it plans to share the findings with Congress and U.S. allies .

"(CNN) -- A now-retracted British study that linked autism to childhood vaccines was an ""elaborate fraud"" that has done long-lasting damage to public health, a leading medical publication reported Wednesday. An investigation published by the British medical journal BMJ concludes the study's author, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, misrepresented or altered the medical histories of all 12 of the patients whose cases formed the basis of the 1998 study -- and that there was ""no doubt"" Wakefield was responsible. ""It's one thing to have a bad study, a study full of error, and for the authors then to admit that they made errors,"" Fiona Godlee, BMJ's editor-in-chief, told CNN. ""But in this case, we have a very different picture of what seems to be a deliberate attempt to create an impression that there was a link by falsifying the data."" Britain stripped Wakefield of his medical license in May. ""Meanwhile, the damage to public health continues, fueled by unbalanced media reporting and an ineffective response from government, researchers, journals and the medical profession,"" BMJ states in an editorial accompanying the work. Speaking to CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360,"" Wakefield said his work has been ""grossly distorted"" and that he was the target of ""a ruthless, pragmatic attempt to crush any attempt to investigate valid vaccine safety concerns."" The now-discredited paper panicked many parents and led to a sharp drop in the number of children getting the vaccine that prevents measles, mumps and rubella. Vaccination rates dropped sharply in Britain after its publication, falling as low as 80% by 2004. Measles cases have gone up sharply in the ensuing years. In the United States, more cases of measles were reported in 2008 than in any other year since 1997, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 90% of those infected had not been vaccinated or their vaccination status was unknown, the CDC reported. ""But perhaps as important as the scare's effect on infectious disease is the energy, emotion and money that have been diverted away from efforts to understand the real causes of autism and how to help children and families who live with it,"" the BMJ editorial states. Wakefield has been unable to reproduce his results in the face of criticism, and other researchers have been unable to match them. Most of his co-authors withdrew their names from the study in 2004 after learning he had had been paid by a law firm that intended to sue vaccine manufacturers -- a serious conflict of interest he failed to disclose. After years on controversy, the Lancet, the prestigious journal that originally published the research, retracted Wakefield's paper last February. The series of articles launched Wednesday are investigative journalism, not results of a clinical study. The writer, Brian Deer, said Wakefield ""chiseled"" the data before him, ""falsifying medical histories of children and essentially concocting a picture, which was the picture he was contracted to find by lawyers hoping to sue vaccine manufacturers and to create a vaccine scare."" According to BMJ, Wakefield received more than 435,000 pounds ($674,000) from the lawyers. Godlee said the study shows that of the 12 cases Wakefield examined in his paper, five showed developmental problems before receiving the MMR vaccine and three never had autism. ""It's always hard to explain fraud and where it affects people to lie in science,"" Godlee said. ""But it does seem a financial motive was underlying this, both in terms of payments by lawyers and through legal aid grants that he received but also through financial schemes that he hoped would benefit him through diagnostic and other tests for autism and MMR-related issues."" But Wakefield told CNN that claims of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism ""came from the parents, not me,"" and that his paper had ""nothing to do with the litigation."" Read autism coverage on ""The Chart"" blog. ""These children were seen on the basis of their clinical symptoms, for their clinical need, and they were seen by expert clinicians and their disease diagnosed by them, not by me,"" he said. Wakefield dismissed Deer as ""a hit man who has been brought into take me down"" by pharmaceutical interests. Deer has signed a disclosure form stating that he has no financial interest in the business. Dr. Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist at Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital in Cleveland, said the reporting ""represents Wakefield as a person where the ends justified the means."" But he said the latest news may have little effect on those families who still blame vaccines for their children's conditions. ""Unfortunately, his core group of supporters is not going to let the facts dissuade their beliefs that MMR causes autism,"" Wiznitzer said. ""They need to be open-minded and examine the information as everybody else."" Wakefield's defenders include David Kirby, a journalist who has written extensively on autism. He told CNN that Wakefield not only has denied falsifying data, he has said he had no way to do so. ""I have known him for a number of years. He does not strike me as a charlatan or a liar,"" Kirby said. If the BMJ allegations are true, then Wakefield ""did a terrible thing"" -- but he added, ""I personally find it hard to believe that he did that."" CNN's Elizabeth Cohen and Miriam Falco contributed to this report.","NEW: Dr. Andrew Wakefield says his work has been ""grossly distorted""

"Jerusalem, Israel (CNN) -- A top Israeli official on Sunday criticized a new statement from Catholic bishops on the Middle East and blasted the remarks of a Catholic archbishop who spearheaded the statement as ""libel."" On Saturday, Catholic bishops from the Middle East concluded a two-week conference in Rome, Italy, with a call for the international community, especially the United Nations, to work ""to put an end to the occupation"" of Palestinian territories. On Sunday, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon criticized that concluding statement of the conference, called a synod. ""We express our disappointment that this important synod has become a forum for political attacks on Israel in the best history of Arab propaganda,"" Ayalon said in a statement. ""The synod was hijacked by an anti-Israel majority."" Ayalon singled out the remarks of a Catholic archbishop who said at the conference that Israel is not the Jews' promised land. ""We Christians cannot speak of the 'promised land' as an exclusive right for a privileged Jewish people,"" Archbishop Cyril Salim Bustros, who leads the Greek Melkite Church in the U.S., said at the conference's final press conference on Saturday. ""This promise was nullified by Christ."" ""There is no longer a chosen people -- all men and women of all countries have become the chosen people,"" Bustros said. On Sunday, Israel's Ayalon said that ""We are especially appalled at the language used by Archbishop Bustros during his press conference."" Bustros led the committee that drafted the synod's concluding statement on Israel and the Palestinians. ""We call on the Vatican to distant themselves from Archbishop Boutros' comments which are a libel against the Jewish People and the State of Israel and should not be construed as the Vatican's official position,"" Ayalon said in his statement.  ""These outrageous comments should not cast a shadow over the important relationship between the Vatican, the state of Israel and the Jewish people."" The Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, praised the synod and echoed Bustros' remarks. ""Israel cannot use the biblical concept of a promised land or chosen people to justify new settlements in Jerusalem or Israeli territorial claims,"" Saeb Erakat, a spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and a chief palestinian negotiator, said in a statement Sunday. Erakat said the synod sent ""a clear a message to the government of Israel that it may not claim that Jerusalem is an exclusively Israeli city."" ""(In) coming weeks we will engage in discussions with the Vatican on ways to further consolidate our fantastic relations,"" Erakat said. "" The Catholic synod's Saturday statement came at the end of a meeting headed by Pope Benedict XVI. ""The Palestinian people will thus have an independent and sovereign homeland where they can live with dignity and security,"" the statement said. ""The State of Israel will be able to enjoy peace and security within their internationally recognized borders."" ""The Holy City of Jerusalem will be able to acquire its proper status, which respects its particular character, its holiness and the religious patrimony of the three religions: Jewish, Christian and Muslim,"" it said. ""We hope that the two-state-solution might become a reality and not a dream only."" The pope first publicly endorsed a two-state solution to the Middle East crisis during a visit to the region in May 2009. At the time, he assured Palestinians of the Vatican's support of a sovereign Palestinian homeland. It was a concept that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu resisted. More recently, the issue of settlement construction has threatened to scuttle the reactivated and now stalled peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians.","Israeli official: Catholic bishops' conference was ""hijacked by an anti-Israel majority""

"I enjoyed having tea with Teru Yamada one Sunday afternoon recently. It felt like visiting an elderly relative in my native London, except that the 78-year-old widow lives in a cramped prefabricated housing complex about 37 miles (60 kilometers) from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in north-eastern Japan. She was one of thousands of people displaced by the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck the region last March.  Like other survivors, her family moved in to temporary housing, where the Red Cross helped them to settle in with a package of household electrical appliances including a rice cooker, TV and refrigerator. I had visited her twice before during my work with the Red Cross, which had taken me to Japan five times since the disaster. In the week that followed the massive earthquake, I was based in the busy Japanese Red Cross office in Tokyo dealing with the huge number of requests for information from the international media. The questions followed a familiar pattern: What were the main needs? Was the situation improving? How were people coping with the nuclear danger? Each day I relayed reports from Japanese Red Cross President Tadateru Konoe, who was out in the worst affected areas assessing the situation. He described what he was seeing as comparable to the flattened ruins of Osaka and Tokyo during World War II. But amid the chaos, I recognized that the elderly were perhaps the most vulnerable and needed constant support to prevent them from being isolated and neglected in the aftermath. It was during my third trip to Japan that I first met Teru at her temporary housing complex. She had recently visited the home she had been evacuated from, which was inside the mandatory 12-mile (20-kilometer) exclusion zone that surrounds the quake-damaged Fukushima nuclear plant. Journey inside Japan's nuclear exclusion zone . She told me how she managed to retrieve a photograph of her husband, who died just months before the tsunami, ad well as his spirit tablet -- common sight in homes in many Asian countries as a place where the spirits of ancestors reside. It was a moving sight as she lit a stick of incense and bowed before his portrait. When I visited her again in January it was heartening to see her in more cheerful spirits. She had been keeping herself busy making elephants out of toweling, part of a community project set up by a local non-profit organization. Yet it soon became clear that life for her remained full of ups and downs. In October, she, her daughter and grandson were allowed another visit to their old home. Living with the aftermath of Japan's tsunami nightmare . ""I felt very disappointed,"" she recalled. ""The grass had grown so long around the family home, a herd of cows nearby was running wild and it was very sad to see them."" Despite Teru's initial cheerfulness, the emotional strain began to show and she broke down in tears. She said she missed life in her village. ""I was born there and married someone from only four kilometers away and spent my whole life there,"" she said. However her daughter remains stoical. ""Sometimes I tell myself that I must stop thinking of myself as a disaster survivor or victim,"" she said. Witness to disaster: Japan's tsunami . Further north, in the coastal town of Otsuchi, Tomokazu Sato paced over the concrete foundations that are all that remain of the house where he grew up until the age of 18. ""It still doesn't seem real; I can hardly believe this has happened,"" he said. His grandmother lost her life when the tsunami swept in. ""She was in the house by herself, because my mother had just gone up the hill to renew her driving license,"" he recalled. As Sato stood in the road in front of the empty space where his house once stood, he showed me a photograph of himself age 20, together with three of his best friends, all dark suited, at their coming of age day celebration to mark the legal passage into adulthood -- when young adults can do things like vote and purchase alcohol. ""The guy on the right lost his mother and sister, the guy on the left's father and elder brother are still missing,"" he said. Sato explained that the fourth member of the group died in a car accident eight years ago. ""His grave has been washed away."" In the nearby town of Yamada, where the Japanese Red Cross is handing over six school buses to local schools, we sit down with a couple of students from a local school. The two 13-year olds radiate a calmness and cheerfulness that's reassuring in kids so young. A local education department official told me that parents here are still suffering from stress as a result of the disaster, and are passing on this unease to their children. When I asked Kaito and Nao about their parents, Kaito said his father has a job provided by the local government in an oyster fishing cooperative. But he said his father remains anxious about when the authorities will make a decision on the location of new permanent homes. Nobody seems to have a clear idea how long they will have to spend in the temporary housing and many of the decisions on reconstruction have yet to be taken. Nao said it is difficult getting a proper night's sleep in the temporary housing. ""You can hear people snoring and shutting doors in the nearby houses,"" he said. But what are the two youngsters' hopes for 2012? ""I just hope there will be no more earthquakes,"" said Nao. ""I hope that more shops will open in our town so it will gradually be a bit brighter,"" added Kaito.","Francis Markus worked for the IFRC in Japan after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami .

"United Nations (CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday issued a statement condemning the Syrian government's crackdown on protesters and calling for an immediate end to violence by all parties. ""The Security Council condemns the widespread violations of human rights and the use of force against civilians by the Syrian authorities,"" the eight-paragraph statement says. It further calls for ""all sides to act with utmost restraint, and to refrain from reprisals, including attacks against state institutions."" The statement says those responsible for the violence should be held accountable but offers no suggestion that foreign intervention is being considered. ""The Security Council reaffirms its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Syria,"" it says. ""It stresses that the only solution to the current crisis in Syria is through an inclusive and Syrian-led political process, with the aim of effectively addressing the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the population which will allow the full exercise of fundamental freedoms for its entire population, including that of expression and peaceful assembly."" Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who is to update the council on the situation in Syria within seven days, welcomed the statement. ""The world has watched the deteriorating situation in Syria with the most profound concern, but the events of the past few days have been brutally shocking,"" he told reporters. ""Once again, I call on President (Bashar al-) Assad and the Syrian authorities to immediately cease all violence against their people, to fully respect human rights and implement reforms that they have already announced."" He further urged Damascus to comply with the Security Council's demand that international humanitarian organizations be granted unimpeded access to affected areas. ""Those responsible should be held to account,"" he said. He praised the 15-nation Security Council for speaking out ""with one voice and condemning all this violence and asking them to take necessary measures"" after long discussions on the matter. But Lebanon's ambassador, Caroline Ziade, said her country, which is Syria's neighbor, dissociated itself from the statement. However, Lebanon chose not to block the measure, as it could have done. Resolutions usually carry with them some sort of action. Presidential statements are simply unanimous on-the-record positions. Though a resolution would have been more significant than the presidential statement, U.S. diplomats said they were glad the United Nations had taken a stance. U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice called the statement ""long overdue."" She added that she hoped Damascus will ""be chastened by the strength and the unity of the condemnation."" About Lebanon's reaction, she said, ""The Lebanese allowed this council to speak with one voice. It was a unanimous statement by the Security Council and we don't view their statement after the fact as in any way undermining that unity."" The statement came on the third consecutive day of talks in New York to address the crisis, which a White House spokesman called ""grotesque and appalling."" Conflict continued Wednesday in Syria, where residents of the western city of Hama said security forces were brazenly advancing into the heart of the city, a center of discontent and a bastion of anti-government protest, where violence has persisted for days. The city, which has seen massive demonstrations by anti-government protesters in Friday demonstrations, was the site of the 1982 bloody crackdown by the Alawite-dominated government against a Muslim Brotherhood uprising. Hama is under siege by security forces amid a military offensive, according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and witnesses said communications have been shut off amid the military push. ""There is a big, ongoing military operation,"" said the observatory's Rami Abdul-Rahman. His group monitors the unrest in Syria through many contacts on the ground, and his sources report hearing explosions and seeing plumes of smoke. ""There are great concerns of a massacre in the city."" ""The human situation is very bad,"" said a witness from an opposition movement who said he was in the center of Hama and asked not to be named for security reasons. Security forces killed four people after evening prayers on Wednesday, according to the observatory group. One death occurred in the southwestern town of Nawa, in Daraa province, one in the central city of Palmyra, and two in Damascus, the group said. Wednesday's death toll could rise. Corpses were seen on the ground after tanks occupied parts of central Hama amid heavy shelling, said a resident who fled the city. Dozens more people have been killed in Hama and other Syrian cities in recent days, rights groups have said. Residents said the city is running short on food. Power and water are scarce and residents said they fear a humanitarian crisis. Across Hama, intermittent gunfire and shelling rang out, helicopters whirled overhead and government snipers took positions, making it difficult for people to venture out, residents said. Security forces also have launched a series of raids and detentions in the Khaldiyeh neighborhood of Homs, another western city, and dozens of people have been detained in the area, the scene of marches by anti-government protesters. In the coastal city of Latakia, a 9-year-old girl was killed by sniper fire as she was getting off a bus with her mother, the observatory said. Security forces had been dispersing a demonstration at the time. The girl's uncle was killed by security forces at the beginning of the crisis. Syria's parliament plans to meet Sunday to discuss ""issues related to the homeland and citizens' interests,"" the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported Wednesday. CNN is unable to independently confirm death tolls or events in Syria, which has restricted access to the country by international journalists, including CNN's. Since mid-March, anti-government protesters have taken to the streets across the whole country to demand reforms from or an end to the al-Assad's regime. The death toll in Syria since its uprising began in mid-March has reached 2,003, the observatory's Abdul-Rahman said. The dead include 1,629 civilians and 374 Syrian security forces. The figure doesn't include tolls from the Wednesday unrest in the city of Hama, where it is difficult confirming information because of the ongoing military offensive there. Activists blame the deaths of demonstrators on security forces, but the government has consistently attributed the violence to ""armed groups."" The violence has outraged world powers. Italy urged other European Union nations to follow its lead after recalling its ambassador in Damascus in light of the ""horrible repression of the civilian population,"" the country's foreign ministry said Tuesday. White House spokesman Jay Carney said al-Assad is ""completely incapable of dealing with"" meeting the aspirations of his people and the administration views him as ""the cause of instability"" and what he termed the ""grotesque and appalling"" situation in Syria. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States is ""exploring broader sanctions that will isolate the Assad regime politically and deny it revenue with which to sustain its brutality."" Three U.S. senators plan to introduce legislation that would set down sanctions targeting Syria's energy sector. Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, Mark Kirk, R-Illinois, and Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut who caucuses with the Democrats, say they plan to introduce the Syria Sanctions Act of 2011 this week. ""Under this bill, the president would be called on to block access to the U.S. financial system, markets, and federal contracts for companies that invest in Syria's energy sector, purchase the country's oil, and sell gasoline to Syria,"" the lawmakers said in a news release.

"If you serve in the U.S. military and you rape or sexually assault a fellow service member, chances are you won't be punished. In fact, you have an estimated 86.5% chance of keeping your crime a secret and a 92% chance of avoiding a court-martial. These disturbing statistics illustrate an ongoing epidemic of rape and sexual assault in the military that Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta believes amounted to 19,000 incidents just in 2010. A culture of acceptance combined with few prosecutions against assailants and the conflicted chain of command structure discourages victims from reporting crimes. Service members who report being sexually assaulted by a commanding officer or military colleague do so at their own peril. They face ridicule, demotion, investigation that includes a review of their sexual history and even involuntary discharge. Betrayal of Trust? Allegations of rape at West Point, Annapolis . In 2006, when Marine Lt. Elle Helmer reported to her commander that a superior officer assaulted and raped her the night before, her colonel discouraged her from obtaining a rape kit. In spite of his objections, she sought a thorough medical investigation. Helmer appealed to her rapist's supervisor, who still refused to press charges or significantly punish the assailant. He said, ""You're from Colorado -- you're tough. You need to pick yourself up and dust yourself off. ... I can't babysit you all of the time."" Rape victims say military labels them 'crazy' Instead of Helmer's attacker being prosecuted, she became the subject of investigation and prosecution. She was ultimately forced to leave the Marine Corps. Her rapist remains a Marine in good standing. Elle's story is featured in the documentary ""The Invisible War,"" which will be screened in five major cities for a week, starting Friday. The powerful film includes interviews with former U.S. service men and women who were raped by co-workers or superior officers. The survivors explain that they felt the greatest betrayal was from the military itself and the conflicted chain of command structure that did not protect them from avoidable harm or support their need for justice. Victim testimony from a widespread and ongoing sex scandal at Lackland Air Force base in San Antonio, Texas, sheds light on another tragic component of the epidemic: Service members are trained to follow the orders of all superior officers, no matter what. Two of the women who have come forward were called over an intercom shortly after they graduated from basic training and asked to leave their dorm to meet their instructors, an unusual order. The victims told a military court that they were lured to a dark supply room where two instructors engaged them in sexual acts. ""I didn't know what to think or what to do,"" one woman, an airman first class, said when a prosecutor asked what she was thinking as her training instructor performed oral sex on her. Female service members sue U.S. military for alleged rape, sexual assault . ""I was frozen,"" she said. Thirty-five instructors have been removed from their jobs during the past year at Lackland, but the military refuses to disclose how many are accused of sexual assault. We know that four military training instructors have already been charged with sexual misconduct with at least 24 trainees. One of the instructors is charged with having sexual contact with 10 women, including sodomy and rape. Another, Staff Sgt. Peter Vega-Maldonado, admitted in a plea bargain to having sex with one woman. His punishment is 90 days in jail, 30 days of hard labor, reduction in rank and forfeiture of $500 a month in pay for four months. He will be forced to leave the Air Force but without a bad-conduct discharge. After striking this deal with prosecutors, Vega testified that he actually had improper contact with 10 trainees. He is not immune to further prosecution, but his admission of guilt cannot be used against him in future procedures. Each victim will have to come forward, and the prosecution will have to start from scratch. I have called for a congressional hearing to investigate the systemic abuse of power at Lackland Air Force Base. It is clear that the inherent conflicts within the chain of command structure are at the core of the epidemic of military rape and sexual assault. Last fall, I introduced bipartisan legislation that would create a path to justice for service men and women who are victims of rape or sexual assault. H.R. 3435, the Sexual Assault Training Oversight and Prevention Act (STOP Act), has 125 co-sponsors. It would take these cases out of the normal chain of command and place the jurisdiction, still within the military, in the hands of an impartial office staffed by experts -- both military and civilian. Right now, it is far too easy for a sexual predator in the military to rape or sexually assault a fellow service member and get away with it. Until these crimes are taken seriously and assailants are punished as the felons they are, the epidemic will continue. Victims of military rape deserve justice . We should not have to hear another story like Elle Helmer's, watch another movie like ""The Invisible War,"" and have to investigate yet another scandal like the one at Lackland Air Force Base. In the words of Defense Secretary Panetta, ""One assault is one too many.""","Jackie Speier: If you commit sexual assault in the military, you'll probably get away with it .

"CIA-funded weapons have begun flowing to Syrian rebels, a U.S. official told CNN. But opposition groups say they have yet to receive any. The official confirmed details first reported by the Washington Post but would not speak publicly. ""That is something we are not going to dispute, but we are not going to publicly speak to it,"" the official said. The weapons are not American-made, but are funded and organized by the CIA. They started to reach rebels about two weeks ago, the official said. The artillery was described as light weapons, some anti-tank weapons and ammunition. The Syrian National Coalition and the Free Syrian Army deny they have received weapons from the United States. ""We have some promises from the U.S. administration of shipment of weapons in a short period of time, but until now we have not received any,"" said Free Syrian Army Political and Media Coordinator Louay al-Mokdad. ""We have logistical help, but we didn't get weapons until now. We hope that in the next short period of time we will start receiving weapons, because we have promises from EU countries and the U.S. that they will help us and support us."" The supply is in addition to the non-lethal aid that the United States has been providing the rebels since April, when the Obama administration first altered the nature of the aid to include items such as body armor, night vision goggles and other military equipment. The official insisted the effort has been in the works for some time, and did not start as an effort to appease those calling for more rebel aid during the new diplomatic initiative with Russia. Kerry hints at transfer . Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday during a Google+ Hangout discussion that ""many of the items that people complained were not getting to them are now getting to them."" He did not elaborate on specifics. A spokeswoman for the National Security Council declined comment. ""We aren't able to inventory or provide timelines for every type of assistance we provide to the Syrian opposition,"" spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said. CNN could not reach members of the rebel forces early Thursday morning. Congress approved supply . The supply of weapons was approved by Congress after the Obama administration asserted the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had used chemical weapons on a small scale. But no progress toward physically supplying the rebels had been reported since then. ""Some things have not been getting to the opposition as rapidly as one would have hoped,"" Kerry said Tuesday. CNN first reported on the plan to arm Syrian rebels with small arms and ammunition in June, but officials refused to lay out a time line on delivery. Obama's national security team and members of Congress have repeatedly urged the president to increase direct aid for the rebels. They argue such a step would strengthen the hand of moderate members of the Syrian opposition, and make them less reliant on well-armed extremist elements within their ranks. Other developments . The latest developments come on the eve of new diplomatic negotiations between the United States and Russia, which begin Thursday in Geneva, Switzerland. Secretary Kerry will meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov for two days to discuss a Moscow proposal to avert a U.S.-led strike in Syria by having the Syrian government put its chemical weapons stockpile under international control. But as Russia continues to supply Bashar Al-Assad's regime with weapons while the U.S. supplies the rebels, and Putin writes a piece in the New York Times questioning the authority of Obama's call for military strikes, the baggage being brought to the negotiation table continues to pile up before talks have even begun.","Rebel groups say they have yet to receive weapons .

"The Obama administration and its allies believe the Syrian government may have used chlorine gas in a deadly attack this month on its own people, several U.S. officials and other diplomats told CNN. The alleged assault that killed at least two and affected dozens of others occurred in the village of Kafr Zeita, a rebel-held area. While there is no firm proof as the matter is being looked into, several U.S. officials and Western diplomats say the United States believes the regime of Bashar al-Assad is responsible because it has such chemicals and the means to deliver them. ""Our assessment is it is, at a minimum, concentrated chlorine dropped from helicopters,"" a U.S. official said. ""That could only be the regime."" The official did not speak for full attribution. If true, such an attack would spotlight a deal brokered by Russia last fall and approved by the U.N. Security Council that requires Syria to surrender its chemical weapons to the international community. The agreement quieted threats of military action by the United States over allegations Syria launched a chemical attack last August outside Damascus that killed more than 1,400 people. Al-Assad and other officials vehemently denied their forces were responsible. The Syrian opposition, which does not have helicopters to carry and deliver such weapons, and the regime have been trading accusations about the April 11 incident for more than a week. Controversy followed video clips posted on anti-government websites showing a number of civilians, including children, appearing to have difficulty breathing and using oxygen masks. The chemical symbol for chlorine (Cl2) is visible on the side of a canister that opposition activists say was used in the attack. ""There are indications that these substances maybe have been used by the regime, but it has to be verified,"" one Western diplomat said. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki conveyed Western suspicions on Monday. She said the United States ""had indications of the use of a toxic industrial chemical, probably chlorine, in Syria this month, in the opposition-dominated village of Kfar Zeita."" ""We're examining allegations that the government was responsible,"" Psaki said. Chlorine is not listed as a chemical Syria is expected to give up under the Security Council resolution.  But its use as a weapon of war is prohibited under the 1925 Chemical Weapons Convention, of which Syria is a signatory. ""You don't have to use sarin and mustard to terrorize a population,"" another official said of deadly chemical gases. ""And you don't have to kill a lot of people to terrorize the population."" U.S. officials and Western and Israeli diplomats point to several incidents over the last month suggesting the use of toxic gases, seen as particularly effective in sowing panic and fear in rebel-held areas. Officials say there now is a debate within the administration about how to respond. The matter is likely to be referred for investigation to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the global body charged with eliminating Syria's stockpiles. The latest revelation poses a new dilemma for the administration on Syria, where civil war continues to rage. While chlorine is not as poisonous as chemicals like mustard gas or sarin, it would violate of Syria's international obligations. While some of the administration feel a strong response is needed, officials said others are concerned a robust response would complicate ongoing cooperation with Syria on its more dangerous stockpiles. ""There is not a consensus,"" another U.S. official said. ""Some would like to be stronger and some are more cautious. It can't go answered but if we equate it to a chemical attack then the question becomes what are we going to do about it? And I don't think we have figured that out yet."" Sen. John McCain, who has been sharply critical of the administration's Syria policy, said in a statement the latest allegations are troubling. ""It is essential that the Obama administration work with the international community to fully and immediately investigate these reports. If substantiated, it is clear that such attacks violate the spirit of the U.S. agreement with Russia for the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons and the Assad regime must finally be held accountable for it actions,"" the Arizona Republican said.","New allegations surface that Syria used toxic chemical against rebel-held area .

"Egypt's new president slammed the Syrian government and called for support for opposition forces Thursday. Egypt's Mohamed Morsy called President Bashar al-Assad's government ""an oppressive regime that has lost its legitimacy."" He said backing the opposition is ""a moral obligation, and a political and strategic step that comes in our belief of a new independent Syria."" Morsy made the remarks at the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Iran, whose theocratic Shiite regime backs al-Assad. It was the first visit by an Egyptian president to Iran since the Islamic revolution in 1979. Two weeks ago, at the Organization of Islamic Cooperation's summit in Saudi Arabia, Morsy spoke of Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey working together to deal with the Syrian crisis. He was quoted by Egypt's Ahram Online as saying ""it is time for the Syrian regime to leave."" On Thursday in Iran, the Syrian delegation at the summit walked out in protest during Morsy's speech and returned after he finished. The president's remarks were being aired live on Syrian state media, but they were cut short. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al-Moallem on State TV called the remarks inciting and an interference in Syria's internal affairs. Morsy's support of the Syrian opposition reflects his solidarity with the people who took to the streets during the Arab Spring, the popular label for the democratic movements that swept across the Middle East and North Africa last year. The grassroots opposition that forced the departure of President Hosni Mubarak and the collapse of his autocratic and pro-West regime last year led to this year's democratic election of Morsy. Egypt is the most populous Arab country and is very influential, and Morsy's remarks underscore the isolation of al-Assad's regime in the Arab world, particularly among Sunnis. Al-Assad is opposed by Sunni nations like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and his domestic opposition is predominantly Sunni. His regime is dominated by minority Alawites, an offshoot of Shiite Muslims. Morsy is long affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood's political movement, which is a traditionally Islamist movement. In other developments: . Rebels report shooting down a jet .

In one attack two weeks ago, at least 60 people died, the group said. ""Day after day, Aleppo residents line up to get bread for their families, and instead get shrapnel piercing their bodies from government bombs and shells,"" said Ole Solvang, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, who has just returned from Aleppo. ""Ten bakery attacks is not random -- they show no care for civilians and strongly indicate an attempt to target them."" Government forces attack 'terrorist groups' At least 94 people died across Syria on Thursday, the LCC said. At least 26 of those deaths occurred in Damascus and its suburbs and an additional 26 in Idlib province.

Protesters took to the Damascus streets Wednesday night after a pro-government television station aired an interview with al-Assad.

"(CNN)It started out as a morning walk, but ended up with a 57-year-old grandpa laying partially paralyzed in an Alabama hospital bed. Sureshbhai Patel, who is visiting from India, needed spinal fusion surgery to repair damage to his back after his family says a police officer in Madison twisted his arm and forced him to the ground. Officer Eric Parker was arrested on Thursday, Madison police Chief Larry Muncey said. Parker faces a charge of misdemeanor third-degree assault. Parker turned himself in to sheriff's officials, the chief said. The department released two videos shot by cameras on the dashboards of police cars at the scene. The video shows an officer slamming the man to the ground. The incident began Friday when Madison police got a suspicious person report. Police say someone in the small community about 12 miles east of Huntsville called to report a man walking in neighbors' driveways and peering into garages. ""The caller, who lives in the neighborhood did not recognize the subject and thought him to be suspicious,"" a statement from Madison police said. When police responded, there was a language barrier. Patel, who is helping take care of his developmentally delayed, 17-month-old grandson Ayaan, speaks little English. Chirag Patel, told CNN Affiliate WHNT that his father tried to communicate with officers, telling them ""No English. Indian,"" when they approached.  He also said his father gave police his address and pointed to his son's house. Madison police agree that there was ""a communication barrier"" between officers and the elder Patel. The police statement says Patel reached into his pocket while speaking with the officers. ""Officers attempted to pat the subject down and he attempted to pull away,"" the statement reads. That's when officers forced Patel to the ground, leaving him with an injured neck and no feeling in his arms, the family says. Months of physical therapy are ahead for Patel, who can now move his hands, but can't grasp anything, WHNT reported. Chirag Patel said his father can move his right leg but not his left .

"Allegations of a chemical weapons attack carried out by the Syrian regime last week have heightened tensions internationally. There's been tough talk from Western leaders and a flurry of activity by the United States -- all of which seem to suggest that a military strike against the regime could be in the offing. But through it all, Syria seems to retain the support of some good friends. Why do Russia, Iran and China continue to support a regime that's accused of slaughtering tens of thousands of civilians in the 2-year-old civil war? Here's why. Who wants what after chemical weapons horror . RUSSIA . Why it cares: . Two main reasons: One has to do with economics; the other with ideology. a) Economics: Russia is one of Syria's biggest arms suppliers. Syrian contracts with the Russian defense industry have likely exceeded $4 billion, according to Jeffrey Mankoff, an adjunct fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies Russia and Eurasia Program. He noted the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimated the value of Russian arms sales to Syria at $162 million per year in both 2009 and 2010. Moscow also signed a $550 million deal with Syria for combat training jets. Russia also leases a naval facility at the Syrian port of Tartus, giving the Russian navy its only direct access to the Mediterranean, Mankoff said. b) Ideology: Russia's key policy goal is blocking American efforts to shape the region. Russia doesn't believe revolutions, wars and regime change bring stability and democracy. It often points to the Arab Spring and the U.S.-led war in Iraq as evidence. Russia also doesn't trust U.S. intentions in the region. It believes humanitarian concerns are often used an excuse for pursuing America's own political and economic interests. ""Russia's backing of (Syrian President Bashar) al-Assad is not only driven by the need to preserve its naval presence in the Mediterranean, secure its energy contracts, or counter the West on 'regime change,'"" said Anna Neistat, an associate program director at Human Rights Watch. ""It also stems from (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's existential fear for his own survival and the survival of the repressive system that he and al-Assad represent. In Putin's universe, al-Assad cannot lose because it means that one day he, Putin, might as well."" What it's saying: . Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov insists there's no proof yet Syria's government is behind the chemical weapons attack. And any plans to strike Syria would challenge provisions of the U.N. charter, the ministry said. The ministry accused Washington of trying to ""create artificial groundless excuses for military intervention."" On Wednesday, Russia walked out of a U.N. Security Council meeting where Britain was expected to pursue a resolution to authorize the use of force against Syria. ""The West handles the Islamic world the way a monkey handles a grenade,"" Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin tweeted. Why it matters: . Russia is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. It has the power to veto Security Council resolutions against the Syrian regime and has done so repeatedly over the past two years. So, if the United States and its allies are relying on a U.N. mandate to greenlight a military strike, they may be waiting a long time. Chemical weapons in Syria: How did we get here? IRAN . Why it cares: . Iran and Syria are bound by two factors: religion and strategy. a) Religion: Iran is the world's most populous Shiite Muslim nation. The Syrian government is dominated by Alawites, a Shiite offshoot, and the rebels are dominated by Sunnis. That connection has bound them for quite a while. Iran counted on Syria as its only Arab ally during its eight-year war with Iraq. Iraq was Sunni-dominated. The last thing Iran wants now is a Sunni-dominated Syria -- especially as the rebels' main supporters are Iran's Persian Gulf rivals: Qatar and Saudi Arabia. b) Strategy: For Iran, Syria is also a strategically key ally. It's Iran's main conduit to the Shiite militia Hezbollah in Lebanon, the proxy through which Iran can threaten Israel with an arsenal of short-range missiles. In 2009, the top U.S. diplomat in Damascus disclosed that Syria had begun delivery of ballistic missiles to Hezbollah, according to official cables leaked to and published by WikiLeaks. So, it's in Iran's interest to see al-Assad's regime remain intact. Western intelligence officials believe the Islamic Republic has provided technical help such as intelligence, communications and advice on crowd control and weapons as protests in Syria morphed into resistance. A U.N. panel reported in May that Iranian weapons destined for Syria but seized in Turkey included assault rifles, explosives, detonators, machine guns and mortar shells. Ayham Kamel of Eurasia Group believes the Iranians must be alarmed that the tide is turning against al-Assad. ""Iran probably has excellent information regarding Assad's position. That information would make clear that Iran is increasingly likely to lose its only ally in the region, greatly reducing its strategic reach,"" he said. What's it saying: . Iran has cast events in Syria as part of a much broader ideological battle. It's a ""war between the front of hegemony and the front of resistance,"" Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said. Iran's position, as outlined by Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and new President Hassan Rouhani, is that the Syrian government is a victim of international plots. Iran believes the West and almost all Arab countries are in cahoots in an effort to implement regime change in Syria. Iran says the main objective of this plot is to make the region safer for Israel. This week, Zarif warned of ""graver conditions"" in Syria is attacked. ""If any country attacks another when it wants, that is like the Middle Ages,"" Zarif said Wednesday. Why it matters: . Many believe Iran is Washington's greatest threat in the region, especially with its nuclear potential. It's unclear how Iran might respond if Syria is attacked. But the rhetoric certainly has been ominous. ""Starting this fire will be like a spark in a large store of gunpowder, with unclear and unspecified outcomes and consequences,""  Khamenei told Iranian Cabinet members this week. ""The U.S. threats and possible intervention in Syria is a disaster for the region and if such an act is done, certainly, the Americans will sustain damage like when they interfered in Iraq and Afghanistan."" What justifies intervening if Syria uses chemical weapons? CHINA . Why it cares: . China's relationship with Syria is more nuanced. Some say it wants to maintain its financial ties. It was ranked as Syria's third-largest importer in 2010, according to data from the European Commission. ""Beijing's renewed interest in Damascus -- the traditional terminus node of the ancient Silk Road ... indicates that China sees Syria as an important trading hub,"" according to a 2010 report from The Jamestown Foundation, a Washington-based research and analysis institute. But there's a bigger factor at play. China has said foreign countries shouldn't meddle in Syria's internal affairs -- and perhaps for good reason. China has had its own share of international controversies over its policies with Tibet as well as allegations of human rights violations. Finally, China doesn't want to reprise what happened with Libya. It abstained from a U.N. Security Council resolution on that one, clearing the way for a NATO military intervention in Libya. ""It was rather disappointed with the payoff,"" said Yun Sun of the Brookings Institution, writing in the East-West Center's Asia Pacific Bulletin. ""Neither the West nor the NTC (Libyan National Transitional Council) showed much appreciation for China's abstention."" So, he says, China has ""formulated a far more sophisticated hedging strategy"" when it comes to Syria. ""Rather than siding with either Assad or the opposition and standing aside to 'wait and see,' Beijing is actively betting on both."" What's it saying: . China said it is firmly opposed to the use of chemical weapons and supports the U.N.'s chemical weapons inspectors. It also said it wants a political solution for Syria -- though some say hopes for such an ending have waned. ""A political solution is always the only realistic means to resolve the Syria issue,"" Foreign Minister Wang Yi said. Like Russia, China also walked out of Wednesday's U.N. Security Council meeting where Britain planned to pursue a resolution on Syria. Why it matters: . China is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. And like Russia, China has repeatedly blocked sanctions attempts against the Syrian regime -- leading to a perpetual stalemate at the U.N. body to take any serious action on Syria.

"London, England (CNN) -- European scientists say they've figured out the recipe for water in space: Just add starlight. They made the discovery while examining a dying star that is 500 light-years away from Earth, using an infrared observatory launched by the European Space Agency last year. ""This is a good example of how better instruments can change our picture completely,"" said Leen Decin of the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, who is the lead author of the paper about the work. The story begins in 2001, when astronomers discovered an unexpected cloud of water vapor around an old star called IRC+10216. The star is known as a carbon star, not thought to make much water, so scientists initially thought the star's heat must have evaporated comets or dwarf planets to produce the water vapor. After the European Space Agency's Herschel laboratory launched last year, however, scientists discovered spectral lines in the light coming from the water vapor. ""Some of these lines can only be there if the temperature is high, otherwise we wouldn't see them,"" said Goran Pilbratt, a project scientist for the Herschel space observatory. ""None of them have been seen before."" Those spectral lines gave scientists a vital clue: The water was hot, with temperatures as high as 800 degrees Celsius (nearly 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit). That meant the water was too hot to have been formed by the destruction of icy celestial bodies, and had to have been formed much closer to the star than comets could stably exist. So if the water wasn't the result of comets being blasted apart as they passed by, scientists wondered, where did it come from? The water vapor sits in a dusty cloud surrounding IRC+10216. Scientists deduced that ultraviolet light from surrounding stars had penetrated that dusty cloud, breaking up molecules in it like carbon monoxide and silicon monoxide, which in turn released oxygen atoms. Those oxygen atoms attached themselves to hydrogen molecules, forming water. ""The ultraviolet light didn't create it -- it helped it to be formed,"" Pilbratt told CNN. Ultraviolet light is the only way water could have been produced in such conditions, he said. IRC+10216 is a red giant star, hundreds of times the sun's size, the European Space Agency said. If it replaced the sun in our solar system, it would extend beyond the orbit of Mars. The star is barely detectable at visible wavelengths because of that huge cloud of dust surrounding it. It can be seen at some infrared wavelengths, however, because the dust cloud absorbs almost all of the star's visible radiation and re-emits it as infrared light. Scientists now hope to observe other carbon stars. ""We are very hopeful that Herschel will find the same situations around those stars too,"" Decin said.","Spectral lines found in light from distant water vapor provided the clue .
The lines revealed heat, European scientists say .
The water likely was formed after the action of ultraviolet light on a dusty cloud, they say ."
"A 25-year-old Florida man intended to use explosives and weapons ""to create mayhem'"" in Tampa -- a plot that authorities say was foiled thanks to the local Muslim community and law enforcement -- a U.S. attorney said Monday. ""When a person's got an AK-47 which he believes is operable, when he has explosives which he believes are real, and when he has an explosive pack and a car bomb which ... he is going to utilize against Americans, that makes it a crime,"" Robert O'Neill, U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Florida, told reporters. ""Was it real? It was very real."" O'Neill spoke Monday in Tampa after an afternoon hearing for Sami Osmakac on one count of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction. The 25-year-old naturalized American born in Kosovo planned a car bombing that would be followed by hostage-taking and the explosion of a suicide belt he planned to wear, according to a criminal complaint made public Monday. ""We all have to die, so why not die the Islamic way?"" Osmakac allegedly told an undercover FBI employee, according to the complaint. Osmakac said in a martyrdom video message recorded shortly before his arrest Saturday night that he wanted ""'pay back' for wrongs he felt were done to Muslims,"" the complaint said. O'Neill said that, through the local Muslim community, ""we were able to know that this person had this ideology and wanted to commit a crime."" Steve Ibison, who heads the FBI's Tampa office, called assistance from members of the Muslim community ""very significant"" throughout the investigation. ""This case is not about the Muslim religion, and it's not about the Muslim community,"" Ibison said. ""It's about an individual who committed a crime."" Two law enforcement officials, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to talk about the probe, said the suspect does not appear to have any ties to al Qaeda, and early information indicated he was ""self-radicalized."" ""I don't have any indication anyone else was involved in the plot and pushing this,"" one official said. ""There is no indication he was acting at the control or direction of al Qaeda,"" a second official said. The federal investigation of Osmakac began in September when a ""confidential human source"" told the FBI that Osmakac, a resident of Pinellas Park, Florida, ""asked for al Qaeda flags,"" the complaint said. By November, the suspect was discussing potential terror targets in Tampa and asked for the confidential source's help in getting guns and explosives for the attacks, the complaint said. The government's source introduced Osmakac to an undercover FBI employee, which led to a December 21 meeting during which the suspect said ""he wished to acquire an AK-47-style machine gun, Uzi submachine guns, high capacity magazines, grenades and an explosive belt,"" the complaint said.  He later allegedly gave the FBI employee a $500 down payment for the weapons, according to the document. ""The explosives and firearms that he allegedly sought and attempted to use were rendered inoperable by law enforcement and posed no threat to the public,"" the government said. Osmakac outlined his plans during a New Year's Day meeting with the undercover FBI employee, it said.  His alleged bomb targets were ""night clubs in the Ybor City area of Tampa, the operations center of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office in Ybor City and a business in the South Tampa area,"" the government said. By Saturday night, however, his primary target was an Irish bar in south Tampa, according to one of the law enforcement officials who spoke to CNN. Osmakac was looking for places where there would be large crowds, the official said. After the car bombing, he planned to retrieve guns and explosives stashed in a Tampa hotel room so he could begin the second phase of his attacks, the complaint said. He told the FBI employee that ""he wanted to use the explosive belt to 'get in somewhere where there's a lot of people' and take hostages,"" the complaint said.  He would then demand that the FBI ""release some prisoners,"" it said. ""Once I have this ... they can take me in five million pieces,"" he allegedly said, ""an apparent reference to the explosive belt that would be attached to his waist,"" according to the government. FBI agents arrested Osmakac on Saturday night, just after he made the video explaining his motives, the complaint said. ""We arrested him when the attack was imminent,"" O'Neill said. The U.S. attorney acknowledged that there might have been significant bloodshed were it not for the tips from local Muslims and the work of law enforcement. ""There was no real danger to the community once we got involved, because we knew we could handle the situation,"" O'Neill said.","A U.S. attorney says the attack was ""imminent"" and the threat was ""very real""

"A flurry of small earthquakes rumbling near the Mammoth Mountain Volcano, have been categorized as ""volcanic unrest"" by the United States Geological Survey. Nearly three dozen earthquakes ranging from magnitude 2.6 to 3.8 have swarmed the area, northeast of Fresno, California, over the last two days. Earthquake swarms in this region are not uncommon.  David Shelly, a seismologist with California Volcano Observatory, said this swarm is ""bigger than we've seen recently, but normal in the area.""  He adds they are keeping a close eye on the movement, ""but in the larger scheme of things, it's within in the range of activity over the last several decades."" Mammoth Mountain is in an area called the Long Valley Caldera. The center of the caldera has been uplifting slowly over the last several decades and seismologists continuously monitor it.  ""We think there is fluid coming up from the crust triggering the earthquakes,"" said Shelly. The last swarm of quakes from 1997 to 1998 produced over 2,500 earthquakes per week at its height, according to the USGS. Since then, the region has been relatively quiet. In July, USGS scientists installed a volcanic-gas monitoring station on the mountain. It tracks gases that fluctuate with earthquake activity to better track the changes in real-time. The awareness level on the USGS website remains at green/normal.  Mammoth Mountain, standing at 11,053 feet, last erupted about 57,000 years ago, according to the USGS.","Three dozen earthquakes in last 2 days near Fresno, California .

"(CNN)Cristiano Ronaldo has beaten Lionel Messi to the Ballon d'Or for the second successive year. The 29-year-old was voted best player in the world ahead of the Argentina and Barcelona forward and German international and Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer at a FIFA ceremony held in Zurich, Switzerland. Ronaldo received the most votes from a panel made up of captains and coaches of national teams and a selection of the world's media. ""I would like to thank all of those who voted for me,"" Ronaldo said after receiving the award. ""It has been an incredible year. I would like to continue the work that I have done so far. I want to try to improve, to become better as each day goes by. ""I never thought that I would bring this trophy back home on three occasions. I want to become one of the greatest players of all time."" Ronaldo, who picked up his first world player of the year award in 2008 and repeated the feat in 2013, was hotly tipped to scoop the title for the third time after completing another spectacular season at Real Madrid. The Portuguese scored 56 goals in 51 appearances for Los Blancos in all competitions in 2014 and netted a total of 61 goals from 60 appearances during the calendar year. He was instrumental in helping Carlo Ancelotti's side lift a 10th UEFA Champions League title as well as winning the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Super Cup. Ronaldo also broke the record for most La Liga hat-tricks in December last year. His three goals against Celta Vigo took him to a total of 23 hat-tricks, one more than La Liga legend Telmo Zarra and Real Madrid icon Alfredo di Stefano. In the same match he also notched up his 200th La Liga goal. The Portuguese has enjoyed a remarkable La Liga season so far, scoring 26 times in 17 matches for table-topping Real Madrid this term. Messi, who won the FIFA award for four consecutive years from 2009 to 2012, admitted in an interview at the weekend that it would be ""difficult"" to win this year when Ronaldo and Neuer had enjoyed such success in 2014 -- the German was a key member of country's World Cup winning side in Brazil and conceded just 40 goals in 62 matches all year. If nothing else, the trip to Zurich was a welcome distraction from speculation about his future at Barcelona. Rumors have circulated recently that the Argentine is unhappy at the Nou Camp -- Messi was recently left out of the starting line up in a La Liga match against Real Sociedad and missed a training session the following day with ""a stomach bug."" Reports have suggested that he is unhappy with manager Luis Enrique's coaching methods and is seeking suitors in the English Premier League. But he was quick to dismiss any idea of a move. Speaking to Barcelona TV after the Catalan club's 3-1 win against Atletico Madrid, Messi said suggestions that he wanted to leave the Spanish giants were ""lies."" ""I haven't asked for anything to stay here because I have never wanted to go anywhere else. I have also heard that I have spoken to Chelsea and [Manchester] City...but it's all lies,"" Messi told the Spanish club's TV channel. Stories circulating that he had poor relationships with former coach Pep Guardiola, former star players including Samuel Eto'o and Zlatan Ibrahimovic and asked for them to be moved on were ""in no way true,"" he said. ""I am tired of hearing things about me. They say that I run the club when I am just another player. I don't make those decisions, nor have I asked to make them."" However, at the awards ceremony, Messi sent the rumor mill turning when he admitted: ""I don't know where I'll be next year."" He added:  ""I always said that I would finish my career at Barcelona and then at (his home town club in Argentina) Newell's. ""As Cristiano (Ronaldo) said recently, football has many twists and anything can happen."" Low on a high . A number of other awards were given out during the star-studded ceremony including the World Coach of the Year which went to the man who masterminded Germany's World Cup win last July, Joachim Low. ""It is the icing on the cake, the cake being the World Cup,"" Low said. ""I know this award is not just for me, I am taking it here on behalf of all those who have assisted. We have had excellent conditions to produce what we have been able to produce. ""It's a consequence of many years of hard work. I'd like to say thank you to all of the German coaches who do so much with the young players every day."" The award for the Women's World Player of the Year went to German midfielder Nadine Kessler who beat Brazil striker Marta and Abby Wambach, the U.S. team's all-time leading goalscorer to the title. Kessler succeeds her compatriot Nadine Angerer, who became the first goalkeeper to win the award 12 months ago. James Rodriguez's sensational volley at the 2014 World Cup won the FIFA Puskas Award for the best goal of 2014. The 23-year-old netted his goal during Colombia's 2-0 win against South American rivals Uruguay in the last 16. It was one of six goals Rodriguez scored during the tournament -- a total that earned him the coveted Golden Boot award, given to the player who scores most goals at a World Cup Finals. ""I'd like to thank everybody who has voted for me. This was a very special moment for me and everyone in Colombia. I feel incredibly happy."" Rodriguez's goal -- scored in front thousands of spectators at the Maracana stadium in Rio and watched by millions on television -- pipped Stephanie Roche's volley. Roche's spectacular goal was witnessed by an altogether smaller audience -- just 95 people were at Peamount's National League game against Wexford Youths. Even so Roche's effort beat Robin van Persie's flying header -- scored for Holland against Spain in the World Cup -- into third.","Cristiano Ronaldo wins the FIFA Ballon d'Or 2014 .

"(CNN) -- Staff Sgt. Edwin Caba served in Afghanistan for nearly three years. Like his fellow soldiers, he longed for a sense of normalcy during his tours. ""We'd spend hours not sleeping, and rushing to eat meals, and staying on guard,"" said Caba, 26. When a litter of puppies was born on the base where Caba served, the animals provided just the relief he needed. ""You walk in, and the dogs are wagging their tails, jumping on your legs and so excited to see you,"" Caba said. ""You forget that you're halfway across the world, in a desert, with hostile things going on."" The soldiers began feeding, bathing and caring for the puppies, and Caba bonded with one in particular. ""She was sleeping on her back, with her mouth wide open, her tongue out a little bit and it was such a dopey thing to do -- and it's just like me,"" said Caba, who named the dog Cadence. ""So I kind of knew that was it for me."" But a few months later, the soldiers' tour was coming to an end. Determined not to leave the dogs behind, they searched for a way to get them to America. That's when Caba was connected with Nowzad Dogs. Since 2007, the organization has reunited hundreds of soldiers with the stray dogs and cats they rescued while serving on the front lines. ""On every single street corner in Kabul you will find stray dogs,"" said Pen Farthing, a former Royal Marine sergeant who founded the nonprofit. ""To be able to get that animal home to them, it closes the loop. ... They don't want to just abandon that animal."" Soldier's best friend . Farthing knows firsthand the bond that can form between a soldier and a dog. In 2006, while on patrol in Afghanistan, he and his troop encountered a dog fight. ""We broke up that dog fight not realizing that one of those dogs was actually going to adopt me,"" said Farthing, 45. The dog followed Farthing back to base. They became friends, and Farthing named him Nowzad, after the town where he saved him. ""He was just war-torn and battered, just like the town we were actually fighting over,"" he said. For several months, Farthing and Nowzad filled an important void in each other's lives. ""As the troop sergeant, I was there to motivate the guys and get them fired up again to go out and do the job. ... But no one was doing that for me,"" Farthing said. ""My time with this dog was a way of de-stressing, collecting my thoughts and popping my head back in the game."" After his tour ended, Farthing went through a difficult process to get Nowzad home to Britain. He realized he not only wanted to help other soldiers do the same, he wanted to do more to help Afghanistan. ""One day you are fighting the Taliban, and the next day you are home and grocery shopping,"" Farthing said. ""When I got home, I thought, 'What am I doing here?' I didn't want to leave Afghanistan forever."" Today, Nowzad Dogs also works to promote animal welfare in the country. The group's shelter and clinic in Kabul are staffed by 14 Afghan nationals, four of whom are trained veterinarians. The group spays/neuters street dogs and cats and vaccinates them against rabies to reduce the stray animal population. In turn, those efforts help protect residents by having fewer rabid animals roaming the streets. Farthing said his organization has the only official animal shelter in Afghanistan. The group also places rescued animals in caring homes there. Journey to a new home . Farthing's group has reunited animals with nearly 700 service members from eight countries. Soldiers' dogs and cats are first brought to the shelter in Kabul, where kennel manager and former British soldier Louise Hastie begins the quarantine process. All animals are spayed/neutered, vaccinated and micro-chipped. They spend two to three months at the shelter before being transported to the soldier's home country. Last year, Caba and fellow soldiers were reunited in New York with the puppies for which they had cared. ""When I pulled Cadence out of the crate at (the airport), I was just so excited. I was even more excited that she remembered me,"" Caba said. ""It kind of brought me back to coming back after a mission and having her there. It brought me right back to that feeling."" Nowzad lived with Farthing in Britain for the last six years until the dog's recent death. For Farthing, he was a constant reminder of their journey. ""My connection with Afghanistan stayed alive because of Nowzad,"" Farthing said. ""So for me, every time I look at him, it just makes me smile. I could never have dreamed that we'd be doing something like this in Afghanistan."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN)With Ben Ainslie, it's in the stare. Charming, polite, every bit the sailor-cum-businessman, the clothes are perfectly pressed with not a hair out of place. But it's the look in his brown eyes, the glare that offers a glimpse of the other side of sailing's Jekyll and Hyde. His friend and America's Cup rival skipper Iain Percy once described him as the ""most competitive man on the planet."" And on an industrial estate in a small, understated office -- quintessentially Ainslie -- in Portsmouth on England's south coast, Britain's greatest ever sailor is plotting how to win the America's Cup. ""It's the same drive to win,"" he says of Britain's bid to seal their first win in the event's 163-year history. ""Until we're on the start line we won't know for sure how we've done. It's exciting and terrifying so you have to keep the intensity."" Even Ainslie  admits to having different personalities on and off the water: ""I'm pretty aggressive and I certainly wouldn't want to be like that on land."" On the water, there's no shut-off valve, just an unabated desire to win. It was there to see in his four Olympic gold medal wins, most notably his infamous Incredible Hulk-inspired ""don't make me angry"" speech to his rivals at the London 2012 Games. It's even there in training. In the build-up to those Olympics, I traveled to Mallorca to watch Ainslie, already selected for the Games, racing against his British Finn rivals, who were there simply to support him. At dinner the night before, he was quiet and unassuming. On the water, it was like a switch had been flicked, a red mist descended. Ainslie was determined to win this particular training session, racing as though Olympic gold was being dangled before him. It's a competitive nature that has landed Ainslie in hot water. The contentious tactics he employed to edge out Robert Scheidt and win his first Olympic title, led to death threats from Scheidt's native Brazil and Ainslie confesses to ""still losing my temper when things aren't going right."" Now 37 and with a team off 55 staff -- and growing -- around him, he is trying to be calmer and adapt to his new responsibilities. There's certainly a noticeable difference between the Ainslie of 2012 and the Ainslie of now. There's a calm confidence as he walks through the office from a morning's sailing, helped it must be said by the knowledge that his staff have bought into his mission -- with many leaving other jobs to work solely for him. He might downplay his role -- ""I'm not doing any role specifically bar steering the boat when it's on the water"" -- but Ainslie is Britain's America's Cup bid. It's his name -- Ben Ainslie Racing (BAR) -- on the entrance to the team's headquarters, on the boat and on the clothing that they wear. An essentially shy sportsman who has achieved remarkable feats -- he was also part of Team Oracle's America's Cup victory last year -- it's as if Ainslie has become his very own brand. Dirk Kramers, the ideas man of the team that played a key role in Oracle's dramatic turnaround in San Francisco Bay last year -- before switching allegiances to BAR -- says that Ainslie ""is almost embarrassed that his name's on the door."" Anslie concurs: ""It's strange having my name there but it's something I have to accept because, when we started, the team wasn't anything and we had to sell it around a brand if you like. ""As we build certainly I'm keen for it rather than being Ben Ainslie Racing for it to ultimately be BAR and whoever our partners are."" While he used to be focused on winning Olympic gold every four years, now Ainslie has myriad other tasks to think about. ""For the first time I'm having to sell our team and maybe that doesn't sit naturally,"" he said. ""It's more of a sales pitch."" He appeared to have pulled off the ultimate PR coup by gaining royal approval for his venture when the Duchess of Cambridge -- Kate Middleton -- lent her support as a co-patron with Ainslie of BAR's charity, the 1851 Trust. The partnership between the knight and the duchess came about after Ainslie took her sister Pippa sailing. Once on the ocean, the conversation turned to the Middleton family's fondness for sailing. ""It got to the discussion, 'Wouldn't it be a great idea if she was supporting the America's Cup team?'"" explained Ainslie, who then contacted the Duchess' office to put in what became a successful request. ""The duchess is obviously such a global icon really now so it's a huge positive to have someone like that backing us."" Queen Victoria was supposedly on hand to watch the first America's Cup in 1851; the duchess is married to Victoria's great, great, great, great grandson providing a loose symmetry with the 2017 America's Cup. The battle for the Auld Mug, the trophy on offer, has a rich and diverse history, with the first regatta taking place around the Isle of Wight -- a mere 15 miles from where Ainslie has set up his headquarters. So why is it that Britain, with its rich maritime history, has never won sailing's most coveted prize? ""It's a great question and it goes to show how hard it is,"" says Ainslie. ""For sure, we can win it. ""We wouldn't be here if we didn't think we could, but I think it needs the right financing and group of people at the same time and we never quite had that before. We think that this is a really good group of people. We've pulled together a strong team."" Ainslie has adopted a ""best of British"" ethos in everything the team does, despite an influx of international staff in certain key roles. ""In sailing terms, it would be the biggest thing that ever happened in British sailing,"" says Ainslie, reflecting on how big an achievement it would be if the indomitable Team Oracle was upset.

"(CNN) -- The new ISIS offensive in the North of Iraq has both shaken the Kurds and threatened the Yazidi minority with not only genocide, but also cultural extinction. In response the United States early Friday morning used airpower against ISIS targets inside Iraq. This is the first use of force against ISIS both since ISIS rebranded from al Qaeda in Iraq and since the departure of U.S. forces at the end of 2011. So what can U.S. airstrikes accomplish? Airpower is incredibly potent when properly used, but nearly useless in the wrong situations. ISIS will present both these alternatives in Iraq. Put very simply, airpower is incredibly effective against an enemy who is on the offense. If an enemy—be it a person or a vehicle or a weapon system—is on the move and/or fighting, they create a ""signature"" that is easy to spot from the air. Since there will be no U.S. forces on the ground as target designators or air controllers, being able to see a target from the air will be crucial. So, a column of ISIS trucks or—as seen early Friday morning—a captured artillery piece firing against Kurdish positions, each make easy acquisition. Against these targets, airpower is nearly invincible. One thinks of the devastation released over two decades ago by U.S. airpower on the ""Highway of Death"" (albeit these forces were not attacking, but retreating—but the signature is the same). So when President Obama talks about targeted airstrikes to protect American personnel in Baghdad or Irbil, he is, in essence, saying that if ISIS attacks toward these cities, we will use airstrikes on their then-vulnerable forces. Note that the President did not say that airstrikes would be used to eject ISIS forces from Mosul or Kirkuk or Fallujah. For in densely populated cities like these, airpower has real limitations. An enemy in defensive positions, particularly in urban terrain, is very difficult to engage with airpower. Even if the target can be hit, the possibility for collateral damage that causes civilian casualties is very real. And if the target is missed, the collateral damage can be exponentially higher, even catastrophic. So while mission creep is always a danger in any war, in this case the chances of it seem rather minimal. The President has chosen one means—airpower—and given it a mission at which it excels; prevent enemy forces from attacking prepared positions, whether in Irbil or Baghdad. This mission is well within the capacity of U.S. airpower. When and if unleashed, U.S. warplanes can absolutely prevent ISIS from moving against these two Iraqi cities. But reclaiming territory from ISIS will be another matter altogether. This will require a unified Iraqi effort—Arab and Kurd alike—under a new government with the will, legitimacy and resolve to accept the casualties that a ground offensive will require. We need only look at the U.S. experience in Second Fallujah—almost 10 years ago now—to picture what this might look like. Nor will U.S. ground forces be joining in this endeavor. This must be clear. There is no—zero—appetite in the U.S. public for such a commitment. To that end, we must hope that Iraq remains on its constitutional timeline so that a new government can be formed and begin the long, hard task of regaining control over its territory. Therefore, new Iraqi President Fuad Masum must charge the largest bloc in the Iraqi parliament with forming a government. Soon.

"As more reports of bloodshed and chaos emerged from Syria on Monday, the government announced it will hold presidential elections on June 3. Parliament Speaker Mohammad Jihad al-Laham said the constitutional court will start accepting presidential nominations Tuesday. But it's unclear whether the elections will yield any major change in Syria, which has been wracked by violence over the past three years. Well over 100,000 people, including many civilians, have been killed in the Syrian civil war, which pits government forces against rebels trying to end the Assad family's four-decade rule. But new elections may not necessarily mean regime change. After President Bashar al-Assad succeeded his father in 2000, he won a second term unopposed in 2007. As the government announced the election date, opposition activists reported more barrel bombs raining down on neighborhoods across Syria. The explosives, which usually involve barrels stuffed with nails and other objects to maximize damage, fell in Daraa and Idlib provinces Monday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. By midday Monday, at least nine people had been killed across the country, the LCC said. The political uprising against al-Assad's regime began in Daraa province in 2011. The Syrian regime has consistently said it is battling armed terrorist groups. On Monday, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said demonstrators in Khan Arnabeh took to the streets to express support for the army ""in confronting terrorism."" Over the past year, foreign fighters have joined both sides of the civil war.","The election will take place on June 3, Syrian parliament speaker says .

"A short video released by ISIS on Friday shows the apparent beheading of British aid worker Alan Henning, with the executioner blaming the death on the United Kingdom for joining the U.S.-led bombing campaign against the group. Before he is killed, Henning speaks to the camera, referencing the British Parliament's decision to participate in coalition of more than 40 countries who have banded together to go after the so-called Islamic State terror group in Iraq and Syria. At the end of the video, ISIS shows American aid worker Peter Kassig and threatens his life. There is no reason to believe the video is not authentic, a U.S. intelligence official told CNN, adding that American officials are studying it. ""The brutal murder of Alan Henning by ISIL shows just how barbaric and repulsive these terrorists are,"" UK Prime Minister David Cameron said, referring to the group also known as ISIS. ""Alan had gone to Syria to help get aid to people of all faiths in their hour of need,"" Cameron said. ""The fact that he was taken hostage when trying to help others and now murdered demonstrates that there are no limits to the depravity of these ISIL terrorists."" The news of Henning's beheading comes just days after Britain joined the coalition. UK jets began flying reconnaissance flights over Iraq a week ago, and on Tuesday dropped its first missiles on an ISIS heavy-weapon position and an armed pickup truck in Iraq, according to the UK Defense Ministry. A taxi driver from near Manchester, England, Henning was part of a team of volunteers that traveled to Syria in December 2013 to deliver food and water to people affected by the Middle Eastern country's devastating civil war. He was abducted the day after Christmas by masked gunmen, according to other people in the aid convoy. The Prime Minister vowed to bring the killers to justice. Last week, the British Foreign Office released an audio file of Henning pleading for his life. His wife made a public plea for ISIS to spare his life. Barbara Henning's pleas were joined by voices of Muslim leaders around the world. They included Shaykh Haitham Al Haddad, a judge on the Shariah Council in London, who has said that ""whatever your grievance with American or British foreign policy, executing this man is not the answer."" But the calls for mercy appear to have been met with bloodshed. The White House released a statement condemning Henning's murder and vowing to work alongside the UK and its allies to ""degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL."" Video similar to others . If the authenticity of the video is confirmed, Henning will be the fourth Westerner to be beheaded on camera by ISIS. This summer, ISIS beheaded American freelance journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff -- showing their gruesome killings in videos posted online. ISIS then claimed its first British victim, aid worker David Haines, according to video that appeared online on September 13. In the video released by ISIS Friday, Henning's name is misspelled ""Allen."" Who is the ISIS? The video is similar to the previous ones, with a clearly scripted statement being delivered by the victim. But unlike the previous ones, this one is shorter and is shot tightly, showing none of the surroundings. And just like the previous videos, it ends with a threat to another hostage. The National Security Council confirmed that Kassig is being held by ISIS. ""We will continue to use every tool at our disposal -- military, diplomatic, law enforcement and intelligence -- to try to bring Peter home to his family,"" according to agency spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden. The American who appears at the end of the video, Kassig, is a former soldier who became an aid worker in the Middle East. Kassig's parents, Ed and Paula, confirmed to CNN it was their son, ""who was doing humanitarian work in Syria, is being held captive."" ""We ask everyone around the world to pray for the Henning family, for our son, and for the release of all innocent people being held hostage in the Middle East and around the globe,"" the statement said. Kassig, 26, founded the non-profit Special Emergency Response and Assistance group. At the time, the organization was providing humanitarian aid to refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war. Kassig worked as a medic and was en route to Deir Ezzor in northern Syria for SERA when he was kidnapped on October 1, 2013, according to his family. ""I am not a doctor. I am not a nurse. But I am a guy who can clean up bandages, help clean up patients, swap out bandages, help run IVs, make people's quality of life a little bit better,"" he told CNN's Arwa Damon during an interview in 2012.

"Pleading for asylum after spilling American secrets, Edward Snowden told Ecuador's government that he fears inhumane treatment or even death if he's handed over to face U.S. espionage charges, Ecuador's foreign minister said Monday. Snowden told Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa that it is ""unlikely that I will have a fair trial or humane treatment"" if handed over to U.S. officials to stand trial, according to a letter from Snowden read by Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino. The whereabouts of Snowden, the computer contractor who exposed details of the National Security Agency's surveillance programs, were uncertain late Monday. He was last known to be in Moscow, where he landed after a flight from Hong Kong on Sunday. He had been expected to board a flight to Cuba on Monday, Russia's semiofficial Interfax news agency reported. But CNN journalists on two successive Moscow-to-Havana flights said Snowden did not appear to be in the cabin, while officials at the Russian capital's Sheremetyevo International Airport declined to say whether he was still there. U.S. officials have yanked Snowden's passport, but he left Hong Kong on a ""refugee document of passage"" issued by Ecuador, according to Julian Assange, founder of the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, which is aiding Snowden's efforts to find a safe haven. Assange would say only that the former National Security Agency contractor is ""in a safe place and his spirits are high."" While Patino, speaking at a news conference in Vietnam, said the country has yet to decide on Snowden's asylum request, he questioned whether it was Snowden or the United States that was acting badly in the affair. He called the surveillance programs revealed by Snowden ""a breach of the rights"" of people around the world. ""We have to ask, who has betrayed who?"" he said. Correa, meanwhile, took to Twitter to address the issue. ""Rest assured that we will analyze the Snowden case very responsibly and we will make with absolute sovereignty the decision that we believe is most appropriate,"" the president tweeted. He added, ""A big hug to everyone and happy week."" Snowden has acknowledged that he leaked classified documents about NSA-run surveillance programs to the Guardian newspaper in Britain and to The Washington Post. The documents revealed the existence of programs that collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and monitor the Internet activity of overseas residents. The disclosures shook the U.S. intelligence community and raised questions about whether the NSA is eroding American civil liberties. He walked away from a six-figure job in Hawaii with the computer consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, an NSA contractor, and went to Hong Kong before the newspapers began publishing stories based on his leak. He told the Guardian that he exposed the surveillance programs because they pose a threat to democracy, but administration officials said the programs are vital to preventing terrorist attacks and are overseen by all three branches of government. A Hong Kong paper, the South China Morning Post, reported Tuesday that Snowden took the job at Booz Allen early this year to ""collect proof"" about the programs before disclosing them to reporters. Snowden told the paper that he intends to release more of the documents he took from the firm. ""If I have time to go through this information, I would like to make it available to journalists in each country to make their own assessment, independent of my bias, as to whether or not the knowledge of U.S. network operations against their people should be published,"" the newspaper quoted Snowden as saying. In addition to Ecuador, Snowden is asking Iceland and other, unspecified countries to consider granting him asylum, WikiLeaks attorney Michael Ratner told reporters Friday. Iceland has not received a formal application from Snowden, the Interior Ministry said Monday. Meanwhile, U.S. officials cast a wide net seeking his return, telling Russia and Latin American countries that they should hand Snowden over should he land on their soil. President Barack Obama told reporters Monday that the United States is pursuing all legal channels to bring Snowden back. And White House spokesman Jay Carney said U.S. officials are reaching out to numerous countries in an effort to have Snowden turned over. ""The U.S. is advising these governments that Mr. Snowden is wanted on felony charges and as such should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel other than is necessary to return him here to the United States,"" he said. But CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the issue now ""is much more of a political and diplomatic matter than it is a legal matter."" ""In an ordinary case, sure, you need a passport to get around,"" Toobin said. ""But here, where this case is causing increasing embarrassment for the United States, governments that want the United States to be embarrassed are only too happy to waive some of the technical legal rules."" Secretary of State John Kerry particularly urged Russian authorities to work with the United States, noting that U.S. officials have turned over seven prisoners to Russia in recent years. ""We need to cooperate on this because it's important to the upholding of the rule of law,"" he told CNN. He defended the U.S. effort to capture Snowden for prosecution, saying ""people may die as a consequence of what this man did."" FBI Director Robert Mueller called his counterpart at Russia's Federal Security Service twice Monday concerning Snowden, a senior administration official said. And a Justice Department official told CNN that the United States isn't planning to ask for a ""red notice"" calling on members of the international police agency Interpol to take Snowden into custody -- but the official would not say whether the United States has sent or will send provisional arrest warrants to other countries that might take Snowden in or help him in his travels. Ecuador 'analyzing' request . It seems unlikely that Cuba, Venezuela or Ecuador -- the nations on Snowden's potential itinerary -- would be inclined to send him back to the United States. The U.S. government has already asked those three Latin American countries to not admit Snowden or to expel him if they do, a senior Obama administration official told CNN on Sunday. But Cuba and Venezuela have long had strained relations with Washington. And Ecuador has given Assange refuge in its embassy in London for a year after he unsuccessfully fought extradition to Sweden in British courts. Why would Snowden head for Ecuador? Assange say he fears Sweden, which wants him for questioning about sexual assault allegations, would transfer him to the United States. In his letter, read by Patino, Snowden compared himself to Pvt. Bradley Manning, the U.S. soldier accused of leaking classified information through WikiLeaks. He said U.S. officials have treated Manning inhumanely by holding him in solitary confinement, and he predicted a similar ""cruel and unusual"" fate for himself if he falls into U.S. hands. Carney questioned Snowden's assertion that he acted in defense of democratic transparency, saying his argument ""is belied by the protectors he has potentially chosen -- China, Russia, Ecuador."" ""His failures to criticize these regimes suggests that his true motive throughout has been to injure the national security of the United States, not to advance Internet freedom and free speech,"" Carney told reporters. The Committee to Protect Journalists has criticized Correa's government for pushing legislation that would roll back press freedoms, calling its policies increasingly repressive. But Snowden isn't looking for ""political nirvana,"" said Glenn Greenwald, the columnist for the Guardian who broke Snowden's revelations. ""He's searching for a place where he can be safe and remain free and participate in the debate, and Ecuador seems to be the place he has chosen,"" Greenwald told CNN's The Lead. U.S. warns China . Carney said Monday that Hong Kong's decision to let Snowden leave dealt efforts to build trust between the United States and China a ""serious setback."" He declined to speculate what impact the decision could have on U.S.-China relations, but said U.S. officials are making their displeasure known ""very directly."" Hong Kong's semi-autonomous government said Sunday it declined to act on a U.S. request for a provisional arrest warrant because it needed more information -- and without that information, it said, it had no reason to stop Snowden from boarding his flight to Moscow. Carney said U.S. officials had told Hong Kong authorities that Snowden's passport had been revoked ""in plenty of time to have prohibited travel."" ""We are just not buying that this was a technical decision by a Hong Kong immigration official,"" Carney said Monday. ""This was a deliberate choice by the government to release a fugitive despite a valid arrest warrant, and that decision unquestionably has a negative impact on the U.S.-China relationship."" Lawmakers say tenuous ties shaken further as Snowden lands in Russia . But an online petition calling on the White House to pardon Snowden passed the key threshold of 100,000 signatures over the weekend and had more than 110,000 early Monday. The petition describes Snowden as ""a national hero."" The White House says it will respond to any petition on its site that gathers more than 100,000 signatures in 30 days.

"Rep. Paul Ryan doubts President Barack Obama will be able to maintain his promise that there will be no American boots on the ground in the fight against ISIS. ""I'm supportive of what the President has done going into Syria and Iraq, but you have to see this thing through,"" the Wisconsin Republican said Tuesday on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" Obama suggested in an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that his policy of sending no U.S. combat troops will stay in place. The situation in the region is more a political problem than a military one, he said. According to a CNN/ORC International poll, the overwhelming majority of Americans (73%) support the current airstrike campaign but less than four in 10 favor sending combat troops into Iraq and Syria. If Obama's administration ultimately comes to Congress with a plan to send combat troops to Iraq and Syria, Ryan said he would support it. ""I think the President should come to Congress with an authorization of force resolution and I would support it,"" he said. ""And I would help the President pass that because I think it's necessary to see this threat through."" ""We need to destroy ISIS, and we need to do what it takes to destroy ISIS,"" he continued. McCain: ISIS' rise like 'watching a train wreck' Ryan, the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee and a potential 2016 presidential contender, said that he doesn't think ""whole divisions"" will be needed. ""This is not a 100,000 boots on the ground campaign, but I do believe, based upon our experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan in particular, that having Special Forces teams embedded with indigenous fighters and a coordinated air campaign has been very successful for us in the past.""

Having enablers on the ground to help guide the air campaign and avoid civilian targets would be helpful, he said. ""What I fear is the President is micromanaging the military in such an incremental way, making the same mistakes we've made in the past,"" he said.

"Last week the Electronic Privacy Information Center filed a petition with the Supreme Court asking it to stop the government's collection of telephone records of Verizon customers. It was not a decision we took lightly. But as an organization dedicated to protecting privacy, we had no choice. Of all the recent revelations about the government's surveillance activities, the most significant is a secret court order that required Verizon to provide to the National Security Agency -- on an ongoing basis -- the call detail records on all of its customers. Not since the congressional hearings of the Church Committee -- the Senate committee that investigated widespread intelligence abuses in the 1970s -- has there been evidence of such extensive spying by the U.S. government on the American public. But unlike then, the digital data of the modern telephone network allows for an extraordinary sorting and sifting of digital information today. A phone number is easily linked to a person, perhaps a doctor, a minister, a family member, or a close friend. Call detail records can also reveal where people are and who they are with. Such information can be very useful when tracking a particular target in a criminal or intelligence investigation, but collecting such data on all Americans who have a telephone is without precedent. In our filing with the Supreme Court, the Electronic Privacy Information Center asked a simple question that we hope the Court will answer: Is it legal for the government to collect so much information about so many people suspected of no threat to national security? According to the law -- section 215 of the Patriot Act -- the government is only allowed to obtain such information if it is ""relevant"" to an ""authorized investigation"" and if its use is for very narrow purposes. How could it possibly be that all of the customers of Verizon could be subject to an authorized investigation of the U.S. government? To us that seems impossible. And that is also the view of some of those who wrote the law and who served on the court that applies the law. Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, the original author of the Patriot Act, recently said he was ""extremely disturbed"" about the news of the Verizon order and said it was ""not consistent with the Patriot Act."" Retired Judge James Robertson, who served on the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, said he was ""stunned"" to learn about the court's broad authorities. The views of Sensenbrenner and Robertson are shared by many legal scholars. It is simply inconceivable that Congress could grant legal authority for the routine surveillance of all of our telephone records. And the secrecy surrounding these activities -- not only was the court order kept secret, but so too was the legal justification -- should set off alarm bells. If the government has a good justification for the program, it should not be difficult to provide a public explanation, even if some of the details must be withheld. Some are surprised that our organization went directly to the Supreme Court. They point out that the Supreme Court prefers hearing disputes after the issues have been considered by lower courts. But under the special rules of the secret court that issued the Verizon order, we had no choice. Only the government or Verizon could have objected to the order of the secret court. They didn't, so we turned to the one Court that has the ultimate authority to say what the law allows. And if there is one case that justifies review under the Supreme Court's ""mandamus"" standard, our organization's  challenge to the NSA's domestic surveillance program is that case. Over the next month, we look forward to working with legal scholars, technical experts and others who have expressed support for our petition. They will be filing friend of the court briefs to explain to the Supreme Court in more detail the important issues in our case. We anticipate that the Court will consider our arguments when it returns in early October. Still, there is more to do. We believe that the NSA's decision to undertake domestic surveillance has also triggered a provision of law that requires the agency to take public comments. We believe that the public should have the opportunity to express its views on the program. Whether you oppose or support the NSA's domestic surveillance program, your views should be heard.","Marc Rotenberg: Electonic Privacy group wants Supreme Court to step in on privacy .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- A pair of suicide bombs detonated outside the Iranian Embassy in Lebanon's capital Tuesday, killing nearly two dozen people in a bloody new ripple from neighboring Syria's civil war. Lebanon's Health Ministry said at least 23 people were killed and 147 wounded. Among the dead was Iran's cultural attache, Ebrahim Ansari, Iran's state-run news agency reported. The victims also included two Iranian civilians who lived in a building close to the embassy, Lebanon's National News Agency reported. The Abdullah Azzam Brigades, a Sunni jihadist group linked to al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for the bombings via Twitter. The group warned that more attacks would come unless the Lebanese-based, Iranian-backed Shiite militia Hezbollah stops sending fighters to support Syrian government forces. It also demanded the release of the group's members being held prisoner in Lebanon. The Lebanese army said one of the blasts was caused by a suicide bomber on a scooter, and the other was caused by a suicide bomber in an SUV. Stunned witnesses looked on as massive flames and pillars of black smoke leaped into the sky over Beirut, while fires burned out several cars parked on a nearby street. At least six buildings were damaged, Lebanese Internal Security Forces said. Lebanon's acting prime minister, Najib Mikati, said the blasts were ""a cowardly terrorist attack"" and urged the Lebanese public ""to exercise the utmost restraint because we are going through a very difficult phase,"" according to NNA, the Lebanon news agency. Mikati also called the Iranian ambassador to check on his safety and express his condolences, NNA said. The Iranian ambassador to Lebanon, Ghazanfar Roknabadi, told Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV that he had no doubt the embassy was the target of the two blasts, but that any effort to thwart Iran's agendas would be unsuccessful. ""We have no fear when it comes to giving more martyrs in the line of duties,"" he said. Tuesday's attack is the latest in a series of bombings, rocket attacks and killings that have spilled over from Syria's three-year civil war, which also has left Lebanon straining under the weight of more than 818,000 refugees, according to the United Nations. In August, a pair of bombs ripped through neighborhoods near mosques in Tripoli, Lebanon, with ties to Syrian rebels. At least 27 people died in that attack, while a car bomb targeting a Hezbollah stronghold in a southern suburb of Beirut killed at least 22 and injured hundreds. More than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria, where the Iranian-backed government of President Bashar al-Assad is battling rebels seeking an end to his family dynasty. Al-Assad and the core of his regime are Alawites, members of an offshoot of Shia Islam, but the majority of Syrians and a large portion of the rebels are Sunni. Group: 31 Syrian troops die in bomb attack . Beirut-based Middle East analyst Rami Khouri told CNN that Sunni jihadist groups have grown rapidly in the past decade and now threaten ""everybody in the region."" ""They're anti-Iran, anti-Arab, anti-Israeli, anti-Turkish,"" said Khouri, director of the Issam Fares Institute of Public Policy and International Affairs at the American University of Beirut. ""They are the big threat, and the fact that these guys are now getting into the business of bombing embassies and bombing their adversaries with suicide bombs is really something quite frightening to everybody."" The Abdullah Azzam Brigades has claimed responsibility for a failed attack on U.S. warships docked in Jordan and for bombings of Egyptian beach resorts in 2004 and 2005 that killed more than 100 people. The United States declared it a terrorist group in 2012, saying it was responsible for a 2010 attack on a Japanese-owned oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz and had expressed interest in attacking Western interests in the Middle East. The group formed in the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon and has battled Lebanese government troops before, Khouri said. Khouri said the violence is part of a longstanding struggle for influence among Shiite-led Iran, Sunni-led Saudi Arabia and their allies that has turned much of the region ""into a single political and military battleground."" ""Syria aggravated this and made it much more brutal, much more barbaric and spilling over with refugees, arms flows, artillery fire across borders in the region,"" he said. But he added, ""If Syria were to settle down tomorrow, you would probably still have some of these groups fighting each other in Iraq or in Lebanon or in other places in the region.""

"The U.S. Supreme Court is being asked to stop the National Security Agency's surveillance of domestic telephone communications data. In an emergency appeal filed Monday, a privacy rights group claimed a secret federal court improperly authorized the government to collect the electronic records, and said only the justices could resolve the statutory issues at stake. The Electronic Privacy Information Center filed its petition directly with the high court, bypassing the usual step of going to the lower federal courts first. Such a move makes it much harder for the justices to intervene now, but the privacy group argues ""exceptional ramifications"" demand judicial review now. Published reports linked to Edward Snowden, who has admitted leaking classified national security information, indicated the NSA received secret court approval to collect vast amounts of so-called metadata from telecom giant Verizon and leading Internet companies, including Microsoft, Apple, Google, Yahoo and Facebook. The revelations have triggered new debate about national security and privacy interests, and about the secretive legal process that sets in motion government surveillance. The once-secret approval came in April from a judge at the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which handles individual requests for electronic surveillance for ""foreign intelligence purposes."" Verizon Business Network Services turned over the metadata to the government. ""Telephone records, even without the content of the calls, can reveal an immense amount of sensitive, private information. There are no reasonable grounds for the NSA to have access to every call record of every Verizon customer,"" said Marc Rotenberg, president of the privacy information group. He added that the surveillance court has applied the law ""in a way that is contrary to the text and purpose of the statute."" Opinion: The NSA spies and Democrats look away . The group also argues restrictions in federal law mean only the Supreme Court can review surveillance court orders. The privacy center is suing as a Verizon customer. Its case is the first direct challenge to the surveillance court order and it says the Obama administration should have to publicly explain its legal justification for the spying program. The Supreme Court does not comment on pending cases. The Justice Department has the option of formally replying to the petition as well as asking for more time to do so. That could delay high court consideration of the appeal for another few months. Prior lawsuits against the NSA program have been unsuccessful. The American Civil Liberties Union has challenged the telephone surveillance in New York federal court. And Freedom Watch also filed a separate claim on behalf of Verizon customers. Telecommunications companies were the initial targets of legal action after the NSA domestic surveillance program was unveiled in 2005. Congress later gave retroactive immunity to those firms. The surveillance court secretly decides whether to grant certain types of government requests, including wiretapping, data analysis, and other monitoring of possible terrorists and spies operating in the United States. Legal sources say the tiny courtroom and adjacent areas are sealed tightly to prevent any eavesdropping by outsiders. Eleven federal judges from around the country serve on the court for seven-year terms. They are appointed by the Chief Justice of the United States. John Roberts has named all current members, as a well as a three-judge panel to hear appeals of related orders. Because it hears only the government's side of an issue it has been criticized as a ""kangaroo court"" that too easily accedes to any government request.","Privacy rights group seeks Supreme Court review, bypassing lower courts .

"An aid convoy that came under fire in a besieged neighborhood in Homs has left the area after delivering only a portion of the aid it was carrying, the Syrian Red Crescent said Saturday. ""Although the team was shelled and fired upon we managed to deliver 250 food parcels,190 hygiene kits and chronic diseases medicines,"" the organization said in a tweet. The team said that one driver suffered a minor injury when explosions and gunfire hit near the convoy in Homs. The convoy left, except for two trucks that were damaged and had to be left behind, the organization said. Valerie Amos, the U.N. humanitarian chief, lamented that the ""three-day humanitarian pause agreed (upon) was broken today and aid workers (were) deliberately targeted."" ""Today's events serve as a stark reminder of the dangers that civilians and aid workers face every day across Syria,"" said Amos, who applauded ""the courage and tenacity"" of U.N. and Red Crescent aid workers. Video from the scene posted by activists showed bullet holes in the aid vehicles, and damage to buildings from explosions. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency had reported that four Syrian Arab Red Crescent workers were wounded Saturday by gunfire from ""terrorist groups"" while they were trying to deliver humanitarian aid to the Old City of Homs. Homs' Governor Talal al-Barazi said that ""armed terrorist groups"" had violated a truce in the Old City by firing mortar shells on the police command building in the Old Sa'a area. But in a statement to SANA, Barazi said the government would keep its promise to help get civilians out of the Old City of Homs . The government refers to rebels in the civil war that has fractured the country as ""terrorists."" The U.N.-led operation to help civilians wishing to leave the Old City of Homs started Friday with the evacuation of 83 women, children and elderly civilians after an agreement between the government and opposition groups for a cease-fire that was also intended to allow for humanitarian aid to reach the city on Saturday. As many as 2,500 people are thought to be trapped in Homs, parts of which have been under siege since June 2012. The first group of civilians was allowed to leave the city, SANA reported Friday. A video posted Saturday to YouTube showed more than a dozen civilians carrying bundles as they walked between four U.N. vehicles -- two on each side -- in an apparent attempt to avoid being shot. It was not clear whether they reached their destination. The killing flared anew Saturday across the nation, with at least 83 people killed, 10 of them children and six women, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported. Five of the deaths occurred in Homs, it said. Nearly half of the deaths -- 41 -- occurred in Aleppo, where video shot by an opposition activist and posted to YouTube showed the graphic aftermath of what the poster said was a barrel-bomb attack carried out by government helicopters: buildings with their faces blown off, bodies with their limbs blown off and cars ablaze. Barrel bombs are drums packed with explosives and shrapnel. ""Each and every barrel bomb filled with metal shrapnel and fuel launched against innocent Syrians underscores the barbarity of a regime that has turned its country into a super magnet for terror,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said this week in a statement after another reported barrel-bomb attack on the northern city, which has become a flashpoint in the war.","U.N. humanitarian chief says aid workers were ""deliberately targeted""

"(CNN) -- Driving a lorry or a truck across the country isn't easy. In the United States, by law truckers have to take a break after 11 consecutive hours. In Britain, the maximum driving time is nine hours per day. But imagine a world where trucks drive through the night without ever stopping. There's no need for a coffee break or a nap, and yet there are never any accidents. That's because these trucks don't actually have any drivers. The age of the driverless vehicle is upon us. Some famous names have been developing and testing prototypes with the aim of making them commercially viable. Google, a pioneer in the field, started its self-driving car project in 2009 and its autonomous vehicles completed 100,000 miles (about 161,000 kilometers) on public roads 18 months later. The United Kingdom recently allowed the vehicles on the road, joining California, Florida and Nevada in the United States in changing the laws to accommodate the new technology. Businesses stand to benefit in a multitude of ways, whether they are waiting for delivery of goods or for executives to arrive for meetings or conferences. Smoother traffic flow will make journey times more predictable and scheduling simple. Maintenance of a steady speed will reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions. And the ""drivers"" -- if vehicles have them -- may carry out other tasks while traveling and arrive fresher. And it's not chump change. For example, in Europe, 76% of total goods traffic in 2011 were transported by road, according to the European Union. Daimler, the German car giant, says that, despite European roads becoming over-congested as the highway network has hardly grown in recent years, goods traffic is set to increase substantially in the coming years. The company is developing the Mercedes-Benz Future Truck 2025 with the promise that in a decade drivers of the vehicle will be ""transport managers"" rather than truck drivers. ""We are facing completely new models for freight traffic,"" said Prof. Sabina Jeschke, director of the faculty of information management in mechanical engineering at RWTH Aachen University in Germany. These new intelligent cars ""are able to initiate and organize their collection, transport and delivery at their destination. They are thus able to react flexibly to spontaneous situations like traffic jams or increased cargo volumes by negotiating new delivery times with each other or customers."" Under Daimler's system, once driving at 80 kph (around 50 mph) on a highway, the driver will be prompted to activate the Highway Pilot that puts the truck in autonomous mode, leaving him or her free to pivot the seat 45 degrees. The driver will then have access to a center console ""in the style of an office workstation"" and will be able to use a removable tablet touchscreen computer for other tasks such as sending invoices or completing tax returns, according to Daimler. Nissan successfully carried out its first public road test of the technology using its Leaf electric vehicle on a highway southwest of Tokyo last November. Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Nissan, said recently that innovations to ease congestion and emissions are badly needed due to the increasing number of ""global mega-cities."" Nissan is making progress on an autonomous car in both Japan and France, where the government recently authorized testing with a view to opening French roads to the vehicles by 2020. The Japanese carmaker has been working with universities including MIT, Stanford and Oxford. It says around 90% of road accidents are currently caused by human error. Under its system, drivers remain at the wheel but the vehicle can automatically steer, brake, accelerate, change lanes, merge into traffic and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. ""At the moment lorry drivers need to stop every four hours,"" under British laws for rest breaks, said Prof. Will Stewart of the University of Southampton's Optoelectronics Research Center, "" but driverless trucks can go 24 hours a day."" Driverless technology could help companies reliant on the roads in much the same way as unmanned drones like those tested by Amazon and Google's solar-powered Titan Aerospace unit hold the promise to speed up deliveries by air. But there are some other considerable obstacles to overcome, including extensive legal issues. For example, does a driver have to be in a driverless car -- just in case? An amendment to the U.N. Convention on Road Traffic was agreed to allow a car to drive itself so long as the driver is present and able to take the wheel and the system ""can be overridden or switched off by the driver,"" according to the consultancy SBD. A lack of standardized technology is a concern, as are issues of public and private responsibility. Britain's Department for Transport review is currently inviting submissions up to September in order to establish regulatory, safety and social obstacles to the testing of self-driving cars on public roads -- and how they can be removed. Such consultations may help to clear up the ethical conundrum of whether man or machine is responsible for accidents. And if the technology is to realize its full potential, large numbers of vehicles must be able to communicate with each other and with computers integrated into the roads. But there is mounting evidence to suggest that within a decade or so, it will be commonplace for the average person to drive past a heavy-goods lorry with no-one at the wheel - and be perfectly comfortable with that. Market research company Frost & Sullivan reckons that by 2030, more than 40% of all vehicles in Europe are likely to be equipped with driverless car technology. Quite what this means for the humble roadside truck stop remains to be seen. WATCH: Driverless cars could let you sleep . READ MORE: Google's new car: no driver, and no steering wheel .

"Just 18, Hamad al-Tamimi says he was a religious studies student in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, before jihadists influenced and recruited him online. Now he's in the hands of Iraqi authorities, accused of being an ISIS fighter captured in Iraq's west. Al-Tamimi is one of numerous foreign fighters believed to have swelled the Sunni extremist group's ranks in recent months. On Thursday, the CIA made a startling announcement: The number of people fighting for ISIS may be more than three times the previous estimates. And among their ranks are foreign fighters -- those such as al-Tamimi. A dramatic rise . Analysts and U.S. officials initially estimated there were as many as 10,000 fighters, including those freed from prisons by ISIS and Sunni loyalists who joined the fight as the group advanced across Iraq. But now ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, can ""muster between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters across Iraq and Syria,"" a CIA spokesman told CNN on Thursday. ""This new total reflects an increase in members because of stronger recruitment since June following battlefield successes and the declaration of a caliphate, greater battlefield activity and additional intelligence,"" the spokesman said. Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, said Friday that the increased estimates won't alter how the United States approaches ISIS, a group that he insisted ""nobody has underestimated."" ""The 20,000 to 31,500 estimate doesn't necessarily change ... our estimate or (Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's) belief that this is going to be a long-term struggle,"" Kirby said. Kirby added,"" We're not just simply about degrading and destroying ... the 20 to 30,000 (ISIS fighters). It's about degrading and destroying their capabilities to attack targets, particularly Western targets. It's about destroying their ideology."" Colorado teen pleads guilty in plan to join ISIS . 'There are many nationalities' Al-Tamimi -- known by his nom de guerre, Abu Walid --  says he traveled from Saudi Arabia to Kuwait in July, and from there on to Turkey, a main route for jihadists into Syria. Handlers who met him in Syria took away his passport and phone, he says. He estimates he then spent a week with some 270 fresh fighters. ""There are many nationalities,"" he says. ""From Norway, from America, Canada, Somalia, Korea, China, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Lebanon and other European countries such as Germany and France."" A CIA source told CNN this week that more than 15,000 foreign fighters, including 2,000 Westerners, have gone to Syria. It was not immediately clear how many have joined ISIS and how many are with other groups opposed to the Syrian government. The foreign fighters come from more than 80 countries, the CIA source said. Bergen: When Americans leave for jihad . Flow of fighters . Mowaffak al-Rubaie, a former Iraqi national security adviser and now a member of parliament, told CNN that thousands of Iraqis were recruited after ISIS militants seized control of the northern city of Mosul in June. ""Young Iraqis as young as 8 and 9 years old with AK-47s, they are recruiting and brainwashing with this evil ideology,"" he said -- in the same way as al Qaeda in Iraq sought to recruit them in the past, but on a far bigger scale. Al-Rubaie says he believes that Iraqis and Syrians probably constitute more than 70% of ISIS fighters. They add sizable bulk to the number of foreign fighters. ""These foreign fighters, when we squeeze them in Iraq and in Syria, they will permeate, they will infiltrate, they will cross the borders to Turkey, to Lebanon -- they have already started doing that and into Jordan, and Saudi Arabia is not very far,"" he said. He warned that Persian Gulf nations are ""not immune"" from the threat they pose. ""I believe they should work very hard with us -- intelligence and cutting the oxygen from the terrorists, stopping the money, stopping the traveling of these terrorists, the young men, coming from Saudi and (Gulf nations) and North Africa."" Canadians have joined ISIS to fight --- and die -- in Syria . In the cross hairs . Recognizing the threat that ISIS poses, President Barack Obama laid out a plan this week to ""dismantle and ultimately destroy"" ISIS, including authorizing airstrikes. Would-be jihadists such as al-Tamimi will now be firmly in the sights of the United States. There's also been a strong diplomatic push in recent days. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday met with Gulf leaders in Saudi Arabia seeking to enlist regional support for a coalition. On Friday, he traveled to Turkey to meet leaders there. The White House has picked retired Gen. John Allen to lead the international effort against ISIS, Kerry announced Friday. Deputy Secretary of State Brett McGurk will be deputy special envoy, Kerry said. Coordinating ISIS coalition familiar ground for Allen . Kerry also announced another $500 million in humanitarian assistance for the crisis in Syria, with $50 million of it going to Turkey. Turkey has seen more than 1 million refugees enter from Syria and has felt the effects of the crisis strongly, Kerry said. Obama on Wednesday vowed to go strongly after ISIS. ""I have made it clear that we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are,"" he said. ""That means I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL in Syria as well as Iraq,"" he said, using another acronym for the group, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. ""This is a core principle of my presidency: If you threaten America, you will find no safe haven."" A spokesman for Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi welcomed Obama's speech, saying the responsibility to fight ISIS is an Iraqi one, but there is a need for the international community to help. The Iraqi Prime Minister on Friday said that French President François Hollande confirmed that France will strike ISIS targets in Iraq. Two Iraqi politicians contacted by CNN -- a Shiite and a Sunni -- agreed that international help is needed to fight the terror threat. ""We welcome any international cooperation at any level to end ISIS in Iraq, but these actions must be done quickly as ISIS have begun to grow large and threaten all regional countries and the Western world,"" said Mohamed al-Tamimi, a spokesman for Sunni Deputy Prime Minister Saleh al-Mutlek. Shiite lawmaker Khaled al-Asadi said the United States has not done as much as it can. ""Considering the size of the terrorism threat we face, we don't feel the scope of their support has yet matched that threat and much more will definitely need to be done,"" he said. On Friday, Kirby -- the Pentagon spokesman -- said the destruction of ISIS will require more than just airstrikes. ""It is going to require partners on the ground to take back and hold the territory that this group has tried to obtain and maintain. It is also going to take the ultimate destruction of their ideology,"" he said. The jihadist training . None of those he met after heading for Syria used their real names, al-Tamimi says in an Iraqi Defense Ministry video. ""From Germany, I knew Abu Hamza, and from Britain one named Abu Dawoud, and from America one named Abu Ibrahim,"" he says. All, like him, were young. After 22 days at a religious indoctrination camp, the Saudi says, he had to swear allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Next followed military training at an air base in Raqqa, an ISIS stronghold in Syria. After a short time fighting in Aleppo, Syria, the order came to move across the essentially nonexistent border into Iraq, where ISIS fighters battling Iraqi forces near the Haditha Dam -- the scene of recent U.S. airstrikes and Iraqi ground operations -- needed reinforcement. And here, less than two months after his journey began, his short-lived jihad came to an end. Al-Tamimi says he just wants to go home. But fighters like him returning -- bringing their extremist ideology with them -- is what many nations now fear the most. France: Dangerous man arrested . One such example may be that of Frenchman Mourad Fares, arrested Thursday in Paris on his return from Turkey. France's Interior Ministry described him as ""a particularly dangerous individual, with close ties to the jihadist terrorist movements ISIS and Al-Nusra Front, whose role would be crucial in recruiting young French, in Toulouse and Strasbourg, and in their departure to Syria."" He went to Syria in July 2013, the ministry said, and Turkish authorities arrested him August 16. But one of his older brothers, speaking to France Info radio, said Fares was ""no kingpin,"" although he did help others cross the Turkish-Syrian border. The brother, whose name was not given by France Info, said Fares was the one who decided to return because he had had enough. ""He had left Syria a month earlier and was in Turkey. He decided by himself to call the French Embassy, saying, 'I am Mourad Fares, I want to come home.' He paid for his plane ticket; he was escorted by the Turkish authorities to the airport. He was not handcuffed at the Istanbul airport, he got on the plane by himself and was awaited in Paris,"" he said. Fares was no extremist despite his decision to go to Syria, his brother said. ""I believe he was fed up with violence. They all left in order to fight (Syrian President) Bashar al-Assad, but as we speak, it is a war of everyone against everyone. I don't think people find their place there.""","Pentagon spokesman: Higher ISIS estimate doesn't change military approach .

"The beheading of American aid worker Peter Kassig by ISIS is an act of cruelty, but it's also an act of desperation by a terrorist organization that has found itself on the run. None of us, sadly, can be surprised anymore at the brutality of ISIS, the insidious group that now controls huge chunks of territory in Syria and Iraq. But Kassig's murder also reveals how little regard the so-called ""Islamic State"" has for Islamic values. Moderate and radical Islamic clerics alike had called for ISIS to spare the life of Kassig -- also known as Abdul-Rahman -- a former U.S. Army Ranger who toured Iraq in 2007 and converted to Islam during his year in captivity. Killing a convert to Islam is an extremely serious violation of the well-established consensus in the Islamic community on the sacredness of life for converts to the religion. Abu Muhammed al-Maqdsi, a mentor to many al Qaeda leaders, had called for mercy -- not only because Kassig was a convert to Islam, but because he had given up so much to move to Syria and help victims of the war. Militant Islamists in the country also went public with a request for mercy. They said Kassig, a trained medic, had treated them when they were injured in battles against Syrian government forces. It was inevitable that these calls would fall on deaf ears. Beheading Western hostages is one of the only tools ISIS has at its disposal to retaliate against the American-led airstrikes that are beginning to land serious blows on the group. Hundreds of fighters have been killed by airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, particularly around the Syrian town of Kobani, and Iraqi troops have also made a series of advances. It took the Americans about two months to build up a critical mass of intelligence -- what U.S. military officials call ""patterns of life"" -- about the behaviors and organization of ISIS, but in the last few weeks that critical work has begun to bear fruit. On November 7, American warplanes bombed a convoy of vehicles near Mosul, in northern Iraq. The airstrikes were conducted against what was assessed to be a meeting of ISIS leaders near the town. Unconfirmed reports suggested that a number of top commanders -- including ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi -- could have been injured in the attack. While it is difficult to keep track of the latest developments on the ground, what we do know is this: The momentum, at least in Iraq, is shifting. The group's leaders are being hunted down, and they're feeling the pain. In July, a video emerged of a defiant Baghdadi delivering a sermon at a mosque in Mosul. Last week, ISIS released an audio clip of a man purporting to be Baghdadi -- a sign that, like al Qaeda's leaders before them, ISIS bosses are going deeper and deeper underground. ISIS' surge has been blunted by U.S. airstrikes. The days when the group could sweep into a town and take it over seem long gone. The Iraqi army along with its allies -- the Kurds and the Shia militias -- have made good progress in the past two months, retaking Baiji and other strategic towns in Iraq. The nation's military is being restructured and rebuilt, and the Iraqi state is beginning to stand on its own two feet. The terror group's success up until now has been based on its ability to sell its narrative to poor local Sunni communities. ISIS has portrayed itself as the defender of persecuted Sunnis against sectarian Shia-led governments in Iraq and Syria and elsewhere, and embedded itself into the communities of cities like Mosul, Tikrit and Fallujah. This narrative brought thousands of Sunnis together to fight the Shia under ISIS' banner, even though these tribes didn't subscribe to the group's extremist ideology. But more and more Sunnis are beginning to realize that ISIS isn't their friend. In fact Muslims, have until now borne the brunt of ISIS' brutality. The group has killed thousands of Shias and Sunnis are also being targeted. In August, ISIS fighters massacred 700 members of the Sunni Shaitat tribe in eastern Syria, according to the Washington Post. In early November, ISIS murdered hundreds of members of the Albu Nimr tribe, a powerful Sunni clan in Anbar province, west of Baghdad. Today, more and more Sunni tribes are beginning to organize themselves in opposition to ISIS' bloody reign. The battle for Kobani could now prove to be the turning point. ISIS has made a last stand of sorts in this small Kurdish town on Syria's border with Turkey. The group wanted to send a message to the world that not only could it defeat local opposition, it could defeat the Americans. That mission has failed, and it was a monstrous strategic error. ISIS poured thousands of skilled fighters into Kobani. We have evidence that many of them never returned, and that ISIS has forced local policemen to join their ranks. But the heroic will of the Kurdish defense forces in Kobani have broken the group's will -- and most significantly, they have shattered ISIS' narrative of invincibility. Kobani has shown that ISIS can be defeated. ISIS has been stopped in its tracks. The group is bleeding and the beheading of Kassig shows ISIS' desperation to lash out, to show that it still has options. Is the battle over? Of course not. It will be long, it will be costly, it will be risky, and it will last for years -- perhaps even a decade. This is an army of tens of thousands of skilled, fanatical soldiers who are willing to kill and be killed. The voice (purported to be Baghdadi's) on last week's recording declared: ""They will never abandon fighting ... They will be triumphant even if only one man of them is left."" The top-down approach of airstrikes and ground forces won't rid the Middle East of ISIS' insidious ideology. This is not about winning one or two battles -- it's about dismantling Baghdadi's killing machine from the ground up. The group can only be defeated when its sectarian narrative about the persecution of Sunnis is dismantled. We need a bottom-up approach that addresses the legitimate grievances of poor Sunni communities in Iraq and Syria, and gives them a stake in their political future. We need a political solution to the civil war in Syria that has provided ISIS with motivation, funding, and thousands of skilled soldiers. And we need to put an end to the proxy war being waged in these countries by the Sunni rulers of Saudi Arabia and the Shia regime in Iran. Given the complexity of the situation, this is all easier said than done. The latest developments have shown that ISIS is not invincible -- but to defeat the group, military cooperation without true political consensus on how to end the crisis will not be enough.","American hostage Peter Kassig beheaded by ISIS militants in new video released online .

"In 16 years, cancer will become the leading cause of death in the United States, surpassing heart disease, according to a new report from the American Society of Clinical Oncology. The number of new cancer cases is expected to increase nearly 45% by 2030, from 1.6 million cases to 2.3 million cases annually. This influx of new patients will place a bigger burden on a field of medicine already stretched by physician shortages and financial difficulties, says the report, which highlights growing problems for cancer care in the United States. Dr. Jeffery Ward knows these issues well. When he joined a community oncology practice in Seattle, it had three doctors. A few years later the group merged with another practice, and connected with a national network of community doctors that enabled them to invest in new technologies and receive group discounts on cancer drugs. In return, they paid a percentage of their practice's profit to the network. Over time, the doctors' profit margins became slimmer. They couldn't compete with hospitals in the area for radiation therapy and other services that would have diversified their practice, and insurers had the upper hand in contract negotiations. It became obvious, as Ward said, ""that 0% of zero would be zero."" So Ward and his colleagues decided to leave the community oncology network and join a large hospital system in Seattle. Nearly two-thirds of the small oncology practices surveyed said they were likely to merge, sell or close in the upcoming year, according to the oncology group's inaugural report, ""The State of Cancer Care in America.""  And as community practices disappear, patients are paying more and traveling farther for quality care. ""If you can't get care, you can't get good care,"" said American Society of Clinical Oncology President Dr. Clifford Hudis, chief of Breast Cancer Medicine Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and a professor at Weill Cornell Medical College. WHO: Imminent global cancer ""disaster"" Adding to the burden will be an increase in the number of cancer survivors. Fifty years ago, only a handful of ""minimally effective"" treatments for cancer existed, according to the report. Today, there are more than 170 FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs. Two-thirds of Americans now live at least five years after a cancer diagnosis, up from about half in the 1970s, the report authors write. Survivors need ongoing care, as they're at higher risk for other types of cancer and conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. The Affordable Care Act will also increase the need for oncologists, as millions of Americans get newly covered by health insurance. Taking these future patients into consideration, the oncology society expects demand for oncology services to grow 42% by 2030. Yet the number of oncologists is expected to grow only 28%, leading to a shortage of more than 1,400 physicians. A large part of this is because of the aging physician population, according to the report. In 2008, the proportion of oncologists older than 64 surpassed the proportion younger than 40 for the first time. A large number of communities in central and Midwestern states are covered solely by these older doctors. When they retire, more patients will have to travel farther to find care. ""The shortage of oncologists is a real problem,"" said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. ""Many smaller practices actually provide a lot of uncompensated care to those who do not have insurance or have insurance that does not pay well."" The report also highlights the need to lower costs, for both doctors and patients. Right now, the system is designed to compensate doctors for how much they do, rather than how well they do it. That goes against the oncology society's recommendations, which encourage physicians to avoid performing unnecessary tests and treatments. ""One of the reasons that so many patients are harmed in medicine is they are over-treated,"" Brawley said. How doctors do harm . Drug prices are another big concern. When Ward started practicing, the average cancer drug cost $1,000 per month. Today, he said, the average is $10,000 per month. ""If we don't begin to control these prices in one way or another, in 20 more years, the average cost of a cancer drug will be $100,000. That's not sustainable,"" he said. ""Twenty percent copay on $10,000 (per month) is not in the pocketbook for most of my patients."" Brawley said price is one of the biggest reasons there is such a disparity in cancer outcomes; research shows minorities are more likely to develop cancer and more likely to die from cancer. To combat some of the issues raised in the report and improve patient care, the society is working on several projects involving ""big data."" These projects will help physicians ""distill massive volumes of data into meaningful information,"" according to the report authors. Shoppers have Amazon. Students have Google. Oncologists will have CancerLinQ. ""Medicine has lagged behind the rest of society in adopting and benefiting from these remarkable and ubiquitous technological improvements,"" Hudis said. CancerLinQ is an electronic health system that will collect and analyze data from millions of patients and provide feedback to providers in terms of standards of care and best practices. Its goal, Hudis said, is to prevent mistakes before they happen. ""I'd rather have a doctor who avoids mistakes than one who learns from them,"" he said. The oncology society said it expects to roll out some components of the system in early 2015.

"For the fifth time this year, ISIS has flaunted its savagery by posting a video about a Westerner's beheading. This time, it was the family of American hostage Peter Kassig that received the horrific news. But the video that purportedly shows the aftermath of Kassig's beheading is different from the other videos -- and shows hints of desperation by the terror group, analysts say. Here are some key points about the latest video and what they could indicate about ISIS: . The actual killing isn't shown . The video, released online Sunday, shows the aftermath of a beheading, but the victim's decapitated head is not clearly recognizable. The White House confirmed that the video showed Kassig. Kassig, 26, was a U.S. soldier who served in Iraq in 2007. He returned to the Middle East as a medical worker, helping victims caught in Syria's civil war. That's when ISIS captured him. Kassig converted to Islam in captivity and also went by the name Abdul-Rahman Kassig. The ISIS video doesn't show the actual killing, unlike previous videos. But it does show -- in gruesome detail -- the beheadings of what the group claims are pilots for the Syrian government, which is also battling ISIS forces. ""It can't be said enough,"" said CNN's Nic Robertson. ""This is the most barbaric they've done so far."" The production is more basic . Unlike the glossy productions of the past, the latest footage appears to be more hastily produced, CNN national security analyst Bob Baer said. ""I think what this tape indicates is these guys are on the run,"" said Baer, a former CIA analyst. ""They didn't have time to do a nice setup (with) a lot of production values. I think they know they're being targeted. There's a lot of American platforms in the area looking for the hostages, so I think they're trying to beat those."" And for the first time in such a video, the speaker names the place where he is standing with the victim -- in the town of Dabiq in Aleppo province, Syria. There was no threat of another beheading . In each of the previous beheading videos, an ISIS militant shows another Westerner who it says will be next to be killed. And each time, it has followed through on its threat. In the latest video, ISIS did not show images of another Westerner targeted for beheading. But that doesn't mean Westerners are spared from more killings, said Haras Rafiq of the anti-extremist think tank Quilliam Foundation. ""As we see the U.S. and the coalition making gains against ISIL, we will find that they try and show that they are still strong, try and show that they are just as barbaric as they have been, and unfortunately one of the things we'll see is that the videos will become more and more barbaric,"" Rafiq said. ISIL is another acronym for ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. ""I think it's a sign of desperation,"" he said. ""I think it's a sign that they know and feel they are under attack, they're under siege and they're struggling."" Yet after almost 900 airstrikes by U.S.-led coalition forces, ISIS is still operating and has shown it is still killing Westerners. ""I think until we really deal with the political problems in that part of the world, the airstrikes will only go so far."" The video could also be directed at Syrians and Iraqis . The video is clearly ""a prize piece of propaganda for them,"" Robertson said. It is likely also meant to scare Syrians and Iraqis into obeying ISIS' orders when it comes calling, said retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. Joe Ruffini, a counterterrorism expert. ""What ISIS is telling them is, 'When we come in and tell you to do what we tell you, you know what the consequences are if you say no,'"" Ruffini said. But it also comes at a time when the United States and its anti-ISIS allies are claiming their airstrikes and support for ground forces fighting the group are beginning to slowly turn the tide, said retired U.S. Maj. Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks. ""Clearly there are no coincidences,"" Marks told CNN on Sunday. ""This is timed very specifically to those activities by the coalition and, I would say, the results of those activities."" Has ISIS peaked? Terror group suffers setbacks in Iraq . The U.S. says it is making progress . Since beginning airstrikes in August, U.S. officials have touted successes in disrupting ISIS communications and logistics, slowing its advances and forcing fighters to disperse into smaller formations. Earlier this month, President Barack Obama said the fight was entering a new phase that would rely heavily on Iraqi ground troops and other local fighters. More recently, U.S. officials have suggested more openness to a role for U.S. ground forces in the fight. Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey testified last week that commanders are ""certainly considering"" the prospect that U.S. forces might be needed to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul, currently held by ISIS. In the latest ISIS video, the narrator taunted Obama to do just that. Hostages tortured before beheadings .","Analysts say the latest video is aimed partly at local residents .
Some say the video suggests ISIS is feeling the sting of U.S. and coalition airstrikes .
Marks: The video's release was timed to counter coalition claims that it's make strides against ISIS ."
"Peter Kassig first went to the Middle East as a U.S. soldier and returned as a medical worker, feeling compelled to help victims of war. ""We each get one life and that's it. We get one shot at this and we don't get any do-overs, and for me, it was time to put up or shut up,"" he said in a 2012 interview with CNN. Now Kassig, 26, is being held hostage by ISIS. His life was threatened Friday in an ISIS video that showed the apparent beheading of British aid worker Alan Henning. In a statement Friday, Kassig's parents, Ed and Paula Kassig of Indianapolis confirmed that he was being held hostage by ISIS but provided no other details. They had maintained silence about his capture since he was taken hostage in 2013. ""The Kassig family extends our concern for the family of Alan Henning,"" Kassig's parents said. ""We ask everyone around the world to pray for the Henning family, for our son, and for the release of all innocent people being held hostage in the Middle East and around the globe."" Joined the Army in 2006 . Kassig's journey began when he joined the U.S. Army Rangers in 2006 and deployed to Iraq in 2007. He was honorably discharged for medical reasons after a brief tour  and returned to the United States to study political science and train for 1,500-meter races.  But something wasn't right. ""I was going to school with kids who look the same, were the same age as me, but we weren't the same,"" he said.  ""I wanted more of a challenge, a sense of purpose."" Portraits of conflict: Can an image stop the bloodshed? In 2010, Kassig took time off and began his certification as an emergency medical technician. In the two years that followed, he fell in love, got married and quickly divorced. Devastated and heartbroken, he went back to school, but he couldn't shake his depression. ""I needed a game changer,"" he said. He decided he would head to Beirut, follow the situation in Syria and try to help. So, on his spring break this year he packed his medical kit and flew into the Lebanese capital. The next two weeks were filled with eye-opening misadventures as Kassig began to scratch the surface of the complexities of the Syrian conflict and the Middle East as a whole. Founded a humanitarian aid organization . ""I had learned enough to know that I didn't know anything,"" he said. After finishing the semester back in the United States, he returned to Lebanon, only this time with a plan. ""The way I saw it, I didn't have a choice. This is what I was put here to do. I guess I am just a hopeless romantic, and I am an idealist, and I believe in hopeless causes."" Kassig founded SERA (Special Emergency Response and Assistance), a nongovernmental organization. In summer 2013 he moved its base of operations to Gaziantep, Turkey. Kassig's family said SERA was dedicated to providing first-response humanitarian aid for refugees fleeing the widening civil war in Syria. Kassig found and delivered food and medical supplies to the growing camps on both sides of the Syrian border, his family said, and provided primary trauma care and trauma care training to civilian casualties inside Syria. ""I am not a doctor. I am not a nurse,"" he said in the 2012 interview. ""But I am a guy who can clean up bandages, help clean up patients, swap out bandages, help run IVs, make people's quality of life a little bit better. This is something for me that has meaning, that has purpose."" He was undertaking a project for SERA when he was ""detained"" on October 1, 2013, on his way to Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria, according to his family's statement. ""For the past year, the Kassig family has maintained silence at the wish of those who have held their son,"" the family statement said. ""His family, along with friends and colleagues inside and outside Syria, have worked tirelessly, and quietly, to secure his release."" Converted to Islam . Kassig's family said he converted to Islam while being held hostage and now goes by Abdul-Rahman. The family said it ""understands from speaking to former hostages that Kassig's faith has provided him comfort during his long captivity."" While working in hospitals, some of those Kassig helped treat were rebel fighters, all who vowed they would return to the battlefield as soon as they could. Others were the innocent victims of a spiraling conflict. One patient,  24-year-old Louliya, said she and her three children were run over by a military jeep as they tried to escape the Syrian military siege of their village.  Her spinal cord was crushed, leaving her unable to move from the neck down.  She was smuggled across the border to Lebanon for surgery. She smiled bravely but was unable to stop the tears from rolling down her face. ""All I want is to be able to hold my children in my arms again,"" she  said softly, trying but failing to imitate the cradling of a child. Despite dangers, doctors honor oath in a secret Syrian field hospital . He bonded with doctors, patients . Kassig  said his direct exposure to what was something of an alien conflict and culture before  transformed his perspective. ""There is this mentality from where I come from back home that I have a little bit of a problem with,"" he  said. ""I don't want to get on a political soap box, but at the same time we have to think about why as a country we choose to help certain people and not others. ""We have to think about why we just chalk up the Middle East [as] this complex enigma that we will never understand because they are so different from us.  But at the end of the day, they are really not. It's just about whether or not you're willing to go out on a limb and understand something,"" he said. ""Peter can tell the American people who we are,""  said Marwan, a Syrian nurse he worked with. ""We are not what the regime says we are -- terrorists and al Qaeda. Peter knows we are good people, who love joking and laughter. We just want to live."" Kassig was struck by the resilience of the Syrians he met, by their ability to smile and somehow joke even in the darkest of circumstances. ""This is real, and it's scary stuff, and it's sad what is happening to people here,"" he  said. ""People back home need to know about it, they need to know. Sometimes you gotta take a stand, you gotta draw a line somewhere.""","American Peter Kassig, 26, helped treat wounded Syrians .

"The story would not be out of place on the TV thriller ""Homeland"": the Danish petty criminal turned double agent who receives $250,000 in cash for helping the CIA try to ensnare one of al Qaeda's most wanted -- by finding him a wife. The wanted man was American-born al Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who had become one of the most effective propagandists for the group. The bride-to-be was a pretty blonde from Croatia. The agent was Morten Storm, who had long moved in radical Islamist circles and had apparently won the trust of al-Awlaki during a stay in Yemen in 2006. But unknown to his militant ""brothers,"" Storm had contacted Danish intelligence late in 2006 and offered his services. They had brought in the CIA. And when al-Awlaki fled the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, for a remote desert hide-out, Storm became one of the contacts the agency tried to use to pinpoint al-Awlaki and take him out of circulation. The Danish biker and the trail that led to Al Qaeda's most wanted . According to Storm's account, in a series of lengthy interviews with the Danish newspaper Jyllands Posten, one of his many meetings with al-Awlaki took place at a desert camp in Shabwa province in September 2009. ""He asked if I knew a woman from the West he could marry. I think that he lacked someone who could better understand his Western mind-set,"" Storm told Jyllands Posten. Al-Awlaki, according to Storm, already had two Arab wives, but they lived in Sanaa.  He wanted a white Muslim convert who could be his ""companion in hiding"" in remote tribal areas. Neither the CIA nor the Danish intelligence agency PET has publicly commented on Storm's account, and the story might seem implausible were it not for copious evidence shown by Storm to Jyllands Posten. The evidence includes video recordings exchanged by al-Awlaki and his bride-to-be, communications from al-Awlaki, travel receipts and a photograph of a briefcase stuffed with $250,000 in cash that Storm said he had received from the CIA. Read more: Al Qaeda leader calls for more protests . Storm said that two months after returning from Yemen, he stumbled across a Facebook group supportive of al-Awlaki, whose charismatic online sermons had earned him rock-star status in jihadist circles. Storm added a comment requesting support, and several days later, a Croatian woman replied, asking him what he needed. Aminah, a pretty 33-year-old with long blond hair who worked with young disabled people in Zagreb, had recently converted to Islam and become a fan of al-Awlaki. After a series of exchanges with Storm through Facebook, she said she would be keen to marry the cleric, according to Storm. He sent word back to al-Awlaki in Yemen, and on December 11, 2009, the cleric got in touch, asking for more information. In a follow-up message three days later, according to Storm, al-Awlaki relayed this message to her: . ""I will make a few things clear. Firstly, I don't live in a fixed location, and therefore my living conditions are varied. Sometimes I live in a tent. Secondly, I sometimes have to live isolated from others, which means that I and my family cannot meet other people. If you can live in these difficult conditions, and do not mind solitude and restrictions in your communication with the outside world, it is excellent."" Al-Awlaki may have expected his living conditions to deteriorate. A few days later -- on Christmas Day 2009 -- a Nigerian student recruited by al-Awlaki in Yemen tried to blow up an airliner over Detroit with an explosive device hidden in his underwear. The attack would bring new urgency to efforts to track down al-Awlaki. Read more: 'Underwear bomber' moved to 'Supermax' prison . At some point, Storm told PET that he was in contact with a woman willing to marry al-Awlaki. The Danes, he told Jyllands Posten, contacted the CIA, which saw an opportunity to try to find the terrorist cleric. The plan the CIA and PET settled on, according to Storm, was to plant a tracking device in Aminah's suitcase. ""It was intended that she could lead us to Anwar. PET was there all along, and knew the consequences if the plan succeeded, namely that al-Awlaki likely would be killed, and that there was a risk that Aminah would also go up in smoke,"" Storm told Jyllands Posten. On February 17, 2010, al-Awlaki got in touch with Storm suggesting he meet Aminah: . ""If you visit her, I can upload a video recording of myself as (an) encrypted file, and you can get her to hear it, so she is sure that (it) is me,"" the cleric wrote. In a follow-up message several days later, al-Awlaki told Storm to tell Aminah his living conditions had improved. Read more: Security official for U.S. Embassy in Yemen killed . ""I currently do not live in a tent, but in a house (that) belongs to a friend. I'm not leaving the house, and am in a situation for my wife to be with me all the time. I prefer this residence (to) a tent in the mountains, because it gives me ability to read, write and research."" Storm says that after receiving that message, he met with his PET and CIA handlers in the Danish town of Helsingor. He says a longtime CIA contact in Denmark called Jed and a CIA official who had flown in from Washington and called himself Alex were present. Storm told Jyllands Posten that with CIA operatives shadowing him, he traveled to Vienna, Austria, and on March 8, 2010, he met Aminah outside the international bus station in the city center. Storm said he was left in little doubt about her devotion to al-Awlaki. ""Do you know the consequences?"" he said he asked her. ""Yes, I'm ready,"" Aminah replied. Storm said that at al-Awlaki's request, he showed her how to send encrypted e-mail communications by downloading jihadist encryption software. At a second meeting in Vienna, Storm showed Aminah a short video recording made by al-Awlaki, who was dressed in white robes in front of a pink background with a floral motif. ""This recording is done specifically for Sister Aminah at her request ... I pray Allah guides to that which is best for you in this life and in the hereafter. And guides you to choose what is better for you regarding this proposal,"" al-Awlaki said, in a section posted on the Jyllands Posten website. Storm said Aminah burst into tears when she heard these words. Read more about Al Qaeda on CNN's Security Clearance blog . She then recorded two short videos for al-Awlaki. In the first video, she wore a full black veil with just her face visible.  Speaking in heavily accented English, she said: ""I will accept everything that is needed to do now this way that I have chosen and inshallah Allah will help us."" In the second video, Aminah took off her veil and said: ""Brother, it's me without the scarf, so you can see my hair ... I hope you are happy with me, inshallah,"" according to Jyllands Posten. At the same meeting, Storm handed Aminah a suitcase that had been rigged with a tracking device. On May 18, 2010, Storm traveled to Vienna a third time to buy Aminah's plane ticket to Yemen and hand over $3,000 in cash on behalf of al-Awlaki, he told Jyllands Posten.  Aminah and the suitcase arrived in Sanaa at the beginning of June, and Storm's work was done. Two days later, one of his Danish intelligence handlers texted him: ""Congratulations brother, you just got rich, very rich,"" Jyllands Posten published the text Sunday on its website. Storm said that on June 9, 2010, a CIA agent handed him a briefcase at a Crowne Plaza hotel near Copenhagen, Denmark. ""What's the code?"" Storm asked. ""Try 007,"" the agent responded. Inside was $250,000. But the plot didn't work. Aminah spent several weeks in Sanaa, and then a messenger arrived to arrange her travel to meet al-Awlaki.  For security reasons -- among them concerns about tracking devices -- she was told to leave her suitcase behind. Aminah and al-Awlaki married shortly afterward. Al-Awlaki sent Storm a message thanking him for arranging the marriage. She had not only lived up to expectations, al-Awlaki wrote in a message viewed by Jyllands Posten, but was "".... much better!"" Last year, when Storm returned to Yemen on what he described as another mission for Danish intelligence, he and al-Awlaki exchanged several messages. In one obtained by Jyllands Posten, al-Awlaki requested that Storm send products from Sanaa for his new wife, including hair conditioner. Al-Awlaki was eventually tracked down and killed in a drone strike at the end of September of last year. Storm insists it was his work that finally tracked down al-Awlaki -- using a messenger carrying a USB memory stick that included a tracking device. Analysis: Al Qaeda's rock star no more . But in a conversation taped by Storm at a Helsingor hotel late last year, an American called Michael insisted that a separate stream of intelligence had led to al-Awlaki. Storm didn't believe him. ""I am convinced that the CIA seized the messenger ... but the Americans apparently won't recognize that it was an agent of PET and the small country, Denmark, which led to the detection of Anwar,"" he told Jyllands Posten. After al-Awlaki's death, Aminah continued to communicate with Storm through encrypted messages, unaware that he had been working with Western intelligence. A few months ago, she said she was working on Inspire, the online magazine of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP. She also suggested she wanted to be involved in a terrorist attack, according to Jyllands Posten. ""I would be making a martyr operation, but Sheikh Basir (al Wuhayshi, the emir of AQAP) said that the sisters so far (can) not carry out operations because it will mean a lot of problems for them ... so I can not perform operation. ... I want to be killed the same way as my husband was ... Insha'Allah,"" she wrote. Aminah's whereabouts today are unknown. CNN has been in touch with Storm, who is in hiding after several death threats from militant Islamists who were once his comrades.

"The scrapbook is filled with photographs and tributes: they show Dominique Bons' son Nicolas growing from a teenager into a young man. Offering brief glimpses of past holidays and family moments, clues to his passions and personality, the book is one of Bons' few souvenirs of her son's short life. Nicolas, from Toulouse, converted to Islam four years ago, gradually becoming more and more devout. Bons, who is a former French soldier, says Nicolas had never spoken to her about wanting to join a religious war, but last year the 30-year-old announced he and his half-brother were going on vacation together. Three weeks later he called to say they were in Syria -- two of the more than 900 French citizens the government believes are involved in the jihad there and in Iraq. Within days, his half-brother was killed, and shortly afterward he spoke to his mother for the last time, telling her she would be notified if anything happened to him. In late December, Bons received a text message explaining that Nicolas has been killed in ""an explosives operation"" -- that's all she knows. ""The body? There is no body... I don't have a body,"" she says. ""If he was killed in a truck filled with explosives, the body... boom!"" Because no body has been recovered, there is also no death certificate, meaning that --officially at least, in France -- Nicolas is still alive. For his mother, he always will be. In her grief, she has written a poem -- added to the treasured scrapbook -- telling her son: ""You will exist in my heart eternally. I love you."" Unlike Bons, one anonymous French bus driver knows his daughter is still alive in Syria -- but he is desperately worried that may not be the case for much longer. The man -- who asked not to be identified out of concern for his daughter's safety -- says the 23-year-old converted to Islam and married a Tunisian man before moving to Syria with the couple's two children. The couple said they were going there to do humanitarian work; they are now believed to be in Raqqa, and safe -- for the moment at least -- but the city, an ISIS stronghold, is a target of coalition forces. And both father and daughter fear she could be arrested if she comes back to France. He has a warning for other parents: ""Pay attention... it could happen to you before you even know it."" David Thomson, author of ""The French Jihadists,"" believes there are many reasons why so many French Muslims are becoming radicalized and heading to Iraq and Syria to join militant groups. ""Religious frustrations, material frustrations, perhaps a feeling that it would be a sin to stay back in France, a desire to experience this historic moment and die fighting the coalition,"" he explains. Concerned at the growing threat of radicalization, French authorities have introduced new regulations in an effort to stem the tide of citizens traveling to the Middle East to join the fight. ""We had to change our rules in different ways,"" Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius explained to CNN's Christiane Amanpour recently. ""First we decided that the government, the administration, would be able to suspend not only passports but also ID for people whose intention is to go to Syria."" The second step is to encourage families concerned at the path their children appear to be taking to contact the authorities and report their fears. ""Because we have many cases where families do not agree with the youngster and at the moment they are aware that the young people want to leave and therefore they have to get in touch with us in order to have a reaction,"" he said. ""We have to be very, very strict and to explain to these young people, especially the young girls -- 13, 14 years old -- that if they are going there, some of them think that it will be a new life, [but] in fact they are prostitutes, they are sexual slaves. ""The young people are utilized and many of them are killed."" Fouad El Bathy has spent the past nine months trying to bring his teenage sister safely home from Syria before it is too late. Nora, 16, was recruited and given a plane ticket to join the fight in Syria, according to French intelligence. Fouad is convinced she is being held against her will, and took the risky step of trying to find her and get her back -- he was even taken captive at one point. But when he finally tracked her down, he couldn't convince her to leave. ""I told her to come back with me but she cried and beat her head against the wall and she said I can't I can't."" Later he was told the leader of the group wanted to marry her. Since Nora is a minor, El Bathy's lawyer hopes that if she does make it back he can persuade French officials to treat her as a victim not a combatant. Like El Bathy and Bons, the relatives of many of those caught up in the jihadists' web say they feel powerless to protect their children and siblings. Bons has set up an organization aimed at publicizing what has happened to some of those who have made the trip to Iraq and Syria. She hopes that by spreading the news through schools and social media, she can convince others of the dangers posed by Islamist extremists -- though for her son, it is too late.

"After three years of seesaw battles with the regime, Syrian rebels now face another daunting challenge: fending off radical Sunni militants who are taking over swaths of the country. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has gained notoriety in recent weeks as the group captured city after city in Iraq. Its goal: To create a caliphate, or Islamic state, spanning Iraq and Syria. Now, the crises in both countries are blending into a combined regional disaster as ISIS now controls land on both sides of the border -- opening the floodgates for weapons and fighters between Syria and Iraq. All the cities between Deir Ezzor city and the Iraq border -- a stretch of 90 miles (150 kilometers) -- have fallen to ISIS, said Omar Abu Leila, a spokesman for the rebel Free Syrian Army. Deir Ezzor itself is controlled partly by the government and partly by opposition militants, he said. That's not all. ISIS also took over six Syrian oil and gas fields and a major pumping station that distributes oil from Iraq into Syria, Abu Leila said. The captures include the al-Omar oil field, Syria's largest oil facility that can produce 75,000 barrels of oil a day. ISIS has also seized a military airport and a local army base. The land grabs by ISIS now stretch from Syria's Deir Ezzor province to the group's recently gained territories in Iraq's Sunni heartland, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said. While ISIS has controlled parts of Syria for some time now, the group was fighting to open a route between its  captures in Iraq and in Syria. That victory came Thursday, when ISIS wrested control of the Albu Kamal border crossing and all the cities between the crossing and Deir Ezzor city from Syrian rebels. Some Syrians turn to ISIS . ISIS has gained not just cities, but also some Syrians' claims of allegiance. After capturing the town of al-Shahil, ISIS demanded last week that fighters surrender their weapons and repent for fighting ISIS. The militants then called on residents to leave the town for a week to 10 days until ""peace returns to the streets,"" according to a social media video obtained by activists. In a video statement, leaders in the town of al-Shahil announced their withdrawal from all anti-ISIS groups. A town representative announced by video that they ""decided to swear allegiance"" to shadowy ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. But about 30,000 people have fled the town, Abu Leila said. Other Syrians flee . Days after their land grabs across Deir Ezzor province, ISIS militants have not let residents return to the towns of Khsham and Tabyeh, the SOHR said. About 15,000 people lived in each town. The residents were forced to leave on June 23. They had been told to ""accept their repentance"" after fighting ISIS, the SOHR said. ISIS militants have already declared they have set up an Islamic state spanning large areas of the two countries. The group called on Muslims to swear allegiance to the caliphate. The message claims that the group's territory now spans from Aleppo province in northwestern Syria to Diyala province in eastern Iraq. It announced that ISIS was changing its name to just the ""Islamic State."" But both Shia and Sunni Muslims have been deeply offended by the claim. Syrian rebels demand help . A group of 11 battalions fighting ISIS in Syria has threatened to stop battling the insurgents by the end of this week if they don't get supplies and support from their Western-backed interim government. The demand, posted on the Facebook page of one of the battalions, was addressed to the Syrian Coalition and the Syrian interim government -- both of which are Western-backed rebel groups fighting the Syrian regime. ""We ask for reinforcement and full support to face (ISIS), and expel them from our land, and stop them from advancing on the liberated cities,"" the statement said. ""If our call is not answered, we will be forced to lay down our weapons and pull our fighters from the areas we control."" Syrian Coalition spokeswoman Bayan Khatib relayed the group's demands to the media, saying ISIS is not only a threat to Syria, but to the West as well. ""The Free Syrian Army has made significant gains in Syria, but ISIS has consistently battled them for these areas and often won,"" Khatib said. The demands come after ISIS made advances in Deir Ezzor and, more alarmingly, the suburbs of Aleppo -- Syria's largest city, Khatib said. The rebels ""have been screaming at the top of their lungs for months for assistance that never came,"" Khatib said. ""In their statement, they predict that ISIS will take over all opposition territory in Syria unless decisive action is taken promptly."" How ISIS is overshadowing al Qaeda .

"(CNN)James Rodriguez won the Puskas Award for the best goal of 2014, but was the Colombian's strike -- which came in front of thousands at Rio's Maracana stadium, with millions around the world watching on TV -- really the year's best effort? Rodriguez was gracious enough to say that Stephanie Roche's fabulous volley, which took second place at FIFA's glitzy ceremony Monday, just might have trumped his goal against Uruguay at the World Cup. Fewer than 100 people were there when Roche collected the ball with her back to goal, flicked it over her head and crashed it home while playing for Peamount United against Wexford Youths in a National League game on a gray afternoon in Ireland. Nevertheless, her brilliant goal -- filmed by chance -- beat Robin van Persie's flying header for Holland against Spain at the World Cup into third place. Victorious Real Madrid forward Rodriguez hailed Roche's effort as ""a golazo"" and told reporters: ""The pity is that only one can win."" He wasn't the only one to voice such sentiments, with Italy legend Alessandro del Piero describing her as the ""moral winner."" ""She is great,"" Del Piero added. ""She needs to score another one for next year. That is what I would say to her."" The award, voted for by the public, saw Roche take 33% of the vote, with winner Rodriguez on 42% and Van Persie some way back on 11%. The 25-year-old Republic of Ireland international striker, currently playing for French club ASPTT Albi, said she was disappointed not to have scooped the ultimate prize. ""Being a footballer, I wanted to win,"" she explained. ""When you have people telling you it's such a great goal -- people who know a lot about football -- it gave me the hope that I could win it.

Many of these gadgets were initially manufactured in China. Through a strange twist of global economics, much of this electronic junk returns to China to die. ""According to United Nations data, about 70% of electronic waste globally generated ended up in China,"" said Ma Tianjie, a spokesman for the Beijing office of Greenpeace. ""Much of [the e-waste] comes through illegal channels because under United Nations conventions, there is a specific ban on electronic waste being transferred from developed countries like the United States to countries like China and Vietnam."" For the past decade, the southeastern town of Guiyu, nestled in China's main manufacturing zone, has been a major hub for the disposal of e-waste.  Hundreds of thousands of people here have become experts at dismantling the world's electronic junk. On seemingly every street, laborers sit on the pavement outside workshops ripping out the guts of household appliances with hammers and drills. The roads in Guiyu are lined with bundles of plastic, wires, cables and other garbage. Different components are separated based on their value and potential for re-sale. On one street sits a pile of green and gold circuit boards. On another, the metal cases of desktop computers. At times, it looks like workers are reaping some giant plastic harvest, especially when women stand on roadsides raking ankle-deep ""fields"" of plastic chips. In one workshop, men sliced open sacks of these plastic chips, which they then poured into large vats of fluid.  They then used shovels and their bare hands to stir this synthetic stew. ""We sell this plastic to Foxconn,"" one of the workers said, referring to a Taiwanese company that manufactures products for many global electronics companies, including Apple, Dell and Hewlett-Packard. Dirty, dangerous work . This may be one of the world's largest informal recycling operations for electronic waste. In one family-run garage, workers seemed to specialize in sorting plastic from old televisions and cars into different baskets.  ""If this plastic cup has a hole in it, you throw it away,"" said a man who ran the operation, pointing to a pink plastic mug.  ""We take it and re-sell it."" But recycling in Guiyu is dirty, dangerous work. ""When recycling is done properly, it's a good thing for the environment,"" said Ma, the Greenpeace spokesman in Beijing. ""But when recycling is done in primitive ways like we have seen in China with the electronic waste, it is hugely devastating for the local environment."" According to the April 2013 U.N. report ""E-Waste in China,"" Guiyu suffered an ""environmental calamity"" as a result of the wide-scale e-waste disposal industry in the area. Much of the toxic pollution comes from burning circuit boards, plastic and copper wires, or washing them with hydrochloric acid to recover valuable metals like copper and steel. In doing so, workshops contaminate workers and the environment with toxic heavy metals like lead, beryllium and cadmium, while also releasing hydrocarbon ashes into the air, water and soil, the report said. For first-time visitors to Guiyu, the air leaves a burning sensation in the eyes and nostrils. Toxic tech . Studies by the Shantou University Medical College revealed that many children tested in Guiyu had higher than average levels of lead in their blood, which can stunt the development of the brain and central nervous system. Piles of technological scrap had been dumped in a muddy field just outside of town.  There, water buffalo grazed and soaked themselves in ponds surrounded by piles of electronic components with labels like Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Epson and Dell. The enormous animals casually stomped through mounds of sheet glass, which clearly had been removed from video monitors. Flat screen displays often use mercury, a highly toxic metal. ""Releases of mercury can occur during the dismantling of equipment such as flat screen displays,"" wrote Greenpeace, in a report titled ""Toxic Tech.""  ""Incineration or landfilling can also result in releases of mercury to the environment...that can bioaccumulate and biomagnify to high levels in food chains, particularly in fish."" Most of the workers in Guiyu involved in the e-waste business are migrants from destitute regions of China and poorly educated.  Many of them downplayed the potential damage the industry could cause to their health. They asked only to use their family names, to protect their identity. ""Of course it isn't healthy,"" said Lu, a woman who was rapidly sorting plastic shards from devices like computer keyboards, remote controls and even computer mice.  She and her colleagues burned plastic using lighters and blow-torches to identify different kinds of material. ""But there are families that have lived here for generations ... and there is little impact on their health,"" she said. Several migrants said that while the work is tough, it allows them more freedom than working on factory lines where young children are not permitted to enter the premises and working hours are stringent. Used to be worse . Despite the environmental degradation and toxic fumes permeating the air, many in Guiyu said that conditions have improved dramatically over the years. ""I remember in 2007, when I first came here, there was a flood of trash,"" said Wong, a 20-year-old man who ferried bundles of electronic waste around on a motorcycle with a trailer attached to it. ""Before people were washing metals, burning things and it severely damaged people's lungs,"" Wong added.  ""But now, compared to before, the [authorities] have cracked down pretty hard."" But residents who did not work in the e-waste business offered a very different take on the pollution in Guiyu. A group of farmers who had migrated from neighboring Guangxi province to cultivate rice in Guiyu told CNN they did not dare drink the local well water. They claimed if they tried to wash clothes and linens with the water, it turned fabrics yellow. The head of the group, who identified himself as Zhou, had another shocking admission. ""It may not sound nice, but we don't dare eat the rice that we farm because it's planted here with all the pollution,"" Zhou said, pointing at water-logged rice paddy next to him. Asked who did eat the harvested rice, Zhou answered: ""How should I know?  A lot of it is sold off ... they don't dare label the rice from here as 'grown in Guiyu.'  They'll write that its rice from some other place."" Not that surprising considering that the latest food scandal to hit the country earlier this month is cadmium-laced rice. Officials in Guangzhou city, roughly 400 kilometers away from Guiyu, found high rates of cadmium in rice and rice products. According to the city's Food and Drug Administration samples pulled from a local restaurant, food seller and two university canteens showed high levels of cadmium in rice and rice noodles. Officials did not specify how the contaminated rice entered the city's food supply. CNN made several attempts to contact the Guiyu town government.  Government officials refused to comment on the electronic waste issue and hung up the phone. However, it did appear that government efforts to restrict imports of foreign waste are reducing the flow of e-trash here. ""Why are they stopping the garbage from reaching us?"" asked one man who ran a plastic sorting workshop.  ""Of course it's hurting our business,"" he added. Domestic e-waste grows . The Chinese government had some success regulating e-waste disposal with a ""Home Appliance Old for New Rebate Program,"" which was tested from 2009 to 2011. With the help of generous government subsidies, the program collected tens of millions of obsolete home appliances, according to the U.N. Even if Chinese authorities succeed in limiting smuggled supplies of foreign garbage, the U.N. warns that the country is rapidly generating its own supply of e-waste. ""Domestic generation of e-waste has risen rapidly as a result of technological and economic development,"" the U.N. reported.  It cited statistics showing an exponential surge in sales of TV's, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners and computers in China over a 16-year period. To avoid a vicious cycle of pollution, resulting from both the manufacture and disposal of appliances, Greenpeace has lobbied for manufacturers to use fewer toxic chemicals in their products. The organization also has a message for consumers who seem to swap their phones, tablets and other computer devices with increasing frequency. ""Think about where your mobile phone or where your gadgets go,"" said Ma, the Greenpeace activist. ""When you think about changing [your phone], or buying a new product, always think about the footprint that you put on this planet.""","U.N. report: ""China now appears to be the largest e-waste dumping site in the world""

"Abu Raad pleaded with his son not to volunteer. But there was nothing he says he could say to talk his 19-year-old son out of joining ISIS, which refers to itself as the Islamic State and is formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. ""I don't know what they told him,"" Abu Raad told CNN by telephone from his home in Mosul. ""Last week, my son came home and told me that he is leaving home and joining the Islamic State."" And then, the teenager packed a bag and left. ""We have heard nothing from him,"" said Abu Raad, who asked to be identified by his Arab nickname out of fear of retaliation by ISIS for speaking out. His son is now believed to be one of hundreds of young Sunni men who, two Iraqi senior defense officials tell CNN, have joined ISIS in recent weeks in the Iraqi provinces of Nineveh, Salaheddin and Anbar. Analysts and U.S. officials estimate ISIS has as many as 10,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria, including those who were freed from prisons by ISIS and Sunni loyalists who have joined the fight as the group advanced. But that number likely doesn't include these latest recruits, mostly young men between the ages of 16 and 25 who are primarily poor, unemployed and lack an education, the two Iraqi senior defense officials told CNN. Add to that a disenfranchisement felt by Iraq's Sunni minority, who have bitterly complained of being marginalized and cut out of the political process by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Shiite-dominated government. The height of that disenfranchisement coincided with ISIS routing Iraqi security forces in Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, in June. Abu Raad blames al-Maliki's government for what happened with his son. ""He allowed those (ISIS) thugs"" to take hold in the country, he said. U.S. President Barack Obama vowed on Saturday to push Iraq's lawmakers to create a more inclusive government that ""can give confidence to populations in the Sunni areas that (ISIS) is not the only game in town."" But for now, at least in Mosul, ISIS is recruiting young men at a rapid pace, officials and residents told CNN. ""Once they are in, (ISIS) gives them cars to drive, guns, cell phones and cash money,"" said one man, who lives in Mosul and has direct knowledge of ISIS recruit efforts. In Mosul, for example, ISIS recruiting efforts appear to begin at information centers that have been set up around the city. Pictures of the centers posted online purportedly by ISIS claim to show militants, many dressed head-to-toe in black, distributing leaflets, videos and CDs about their operations to men and boys. While CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the pictures, they appear to coincide with descriptions provided by the man who described ISIS recruiting efforts. The pictures also show men and young boys gathered in front of the centers, watching videos purporting to show ISIS leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, on giant flat-screen televisions. In some of the videos, al-Baghdadi is heavily armed. In others, he appears to be preaching at a pulpit. Still other pictures appear to show videos about bomb-making and suicide bombs. At the centers, ISIS encourages young men to join, according to a man who asked to be identified only as Abu Younis out of fear of retaliation by ISIS . The actual recruiting occurs elsewhere, according to Younis, who lives in Mosul and told CNN he has visited the centers. Sometimes, he says, recruiting takes place at mosques. Last week, the Iraqi air force targeted the al-Mufti mosque in western Mosul. A senior security official in Baghdad and two residents told CNN that the mosque was being used by ISIS as a recruitment center. CNN cannot independently verify the claims. Abu Raad can't pinpoint the moment that his son made the decision to leave his life behind for ISIS. Before the militants swept into Mosul, his son listened to music and played video games. ""But then he became a different person. He stopped acting like a normal boy a few weeks ago,"" Abu Raad said. ""My wife and I begged him not do it. But he didn't listen. He packed and left."" There are stories, Abu Raad says, of young men who have been recruited by ISIS and within weeks are carrying out suicide bombings. He wonders if one them will be his son. ""My son dreamed of becoming a computer engineer,"" Abu Raad said, his voice breaking. ""Now he's just a terrorist.""","Hundreds of young Sunni men have joined ISIS in recent weeks, officials tell CNN .

"For years, as Lance Armstrong basked in the glow of an adoring public, his critics frequently were banished to the shadows, dismissed by the cycling legend and his coterie as cranks or worse. Now, with Armstrong stripped of his titles and endorsement deals, those who spoke out against him before it was the popular thing to do are feeling vindicated. ""Eleven years of bullying and threats,"" Kathy LeMond, the wife of cyclist Greg LeMond -- one of Armstrong's earliest targets -- wrote on Twitter. ""LA is now the Greatest Fraud in the History of Sports."" In some cases, vindication could also mean getting back huge sums of money. A Texas insurance company that once refused to pay Armstrong a promised $5 million bonus for winning a Tour de France, citing reports that he had doped, ended up having to pay it plus his legal costs. All told, over the years SCA Promotions paid $12 million. Now, it is ""considering all legal options"" to get its money back. London's Sunday Times has also said it may sue Armstrong over a libel case he brought against the newspaper that resulted in a costly payout. This turning of the tide comes after cycling's international governing body, the International Cycling Union, agreed with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency's decision to strip Armstrong of his seven Tour de France titles. The move concluded a stunning few weeks of freefall for Armstrong, beginning with the release of hundreds of pages of testimony and other evidence describing Armstrong's involvement in what USADA called the most sophisticated doping program in cycling history. Among other things, the report included affidavits from key Armstrong critics Frankie and Betsy Andreu, Emma O'Reilly, Tyler Hamilton and Floyd Landis, all of whom spoke out against Armstrong and, in various ways, paid the price. Frankie and Betsy Andreu . Once a close friend of Armstrong, cyclist Frankie Andreu had a falling out with him after his wife, Betsy, began to cooperate with a reporter working on a book about doping allegations against Armstrong. According to Frankie and Betsy Andreu, they were in an Indianapolis hospital room when Armstrong acknowledged to a doctor treating him for cancer in 1996 that he had used performance-enhancing drugs. Opinion: Is it time to allow doping in sport? They later testified about the incident during the arbitration case filed against Armstrong by a company seeking to avoid paying out bonuses to Armstrong for race victories during which he was accused of doping. It was a decision they would pay for, according to Andreu. ""I have been told that my public disputes with Lance Armstrong have made it more difficult for others in the cycling industry to work with me because they fear reprisal from Lance and his associates,"" he said in his affidavit released by USADA. His wife said she was pressured to sign a statement disavowing the story, and when she refused, was ""vilified."" ""I became, in Lance's words, 'bitter' and 'vindictive' and 'jealous,'"" she said in her affidavit. She recently told Cycling News that ""grown men were torn to shreds by Armstrong,"" and said she was ""extremely grateful"" to USADA for its investigation. 'What Joe Public thinks of me I don't care,"" Andreu told the New York Daily News. ""I care what my family and close friends think of me. When it affects my husband's ability to work then it's grossly unfair. Who knows how many jobs he lost because I refused to lie to protect Lance."" Emma O'Reilly . On Twitter recently, Armstrong's former personal assistant said things started getting easier for her when the USADA report came out and ""people started realising I wasn't some 'prostitute' liar!"" That's what O'Reilly, the former soigneur -- part masseuse, part go-fer for the U.S. Postal Service cycling team -- says Armstrong called her when she went public with accusations against him. Like Betsy Andreu, she first told her story in the French book ""L.A. Confidentiel,"" co-written by sports reporter David Walsh of London's Sunday Times. She told USADA that she went on a clandestine trip to pick up and drop off what she assumed were doping products for Armstrong. She also said she was in the room when Armstrong and two other team officials came up with a plan to backdate a prescription for corticosteroids for a saddle sore to explain a positive steroid test result during the 1999 Tour de France. ""Now, Emma, you know enough to bring me down,"" she says Armstrong told her after the meeting. Speaking in the aftermath of the USADA report's release, O'Reilly told CNN she went through ""two-and-a-half to three years of hell"" after she first made the decision to speak out about doping. ""I got subpoenaed, I got ... kind of ostracized and just the stress levels ... and all for telling the truth. As well as feeling feelings of guilt because I knew then that there were certain people now who would not speak to me again, and have never spoken to me again, and it's a shame because I lost those friendships."" O'Reilly said she regretted making life difficult for the cyclists and her friends in the business, who would now be viewed with suspicion. She also faced lawsuits brought by Armstrong's legal teams that totaled well over $1 million. Armstrong ""wanted to play the libel laws in the UK and keep me quiet because he had much more money than me,"" O'Reilly said. ""By putting a gag on most of us who had spoken out, it stopped people talking, it stopped it going to the press, because then the press were scared because of how much it would cost them, and their legal bills for a (minor) sport. ""And then he'd just slate (criticize) us all as well -- I was an 'alcoholic prostitute,' for my efforts."" Nonetheless, O'Reilly said her overwhelming feeling in the wake of the USADA report was one of sadness, rather than vindication. ""Sadness for all the people who got bullied, and sadness that the sport kind of got a bit tinged with all of this when there's so many good people ... and sadness, too, that it came out in 2004 and I got vilified for it, and now all of a sudden I'm telling the truth. My story hasn't changed since 2004. I've always been telling the truth. It's just times were different then."" David Walsh . The British journalist who co-wrote ""L.A. Confidentiel -- Les Secrets de Lance Armstrong"" said he took his share of abuse, as well. ""He called me 'the worst journalist in the world,' referred to me as 'the little f***g troll,' tried to pressure Betsy Andreu (a source for L.A. Confidentiel) into discrediting me and, of course, he sued,"" Walsh wrote in a piece for Sports Illustrated Monday. ""That lawsuit now seems as close as you can get to an 'Oscar' in our game."" Walsh describes how his claims that Armstrong doped made him ""a black sheep of the cycling family,"" shunned by those inside the cycling world and given the cold shoulder by fellow journalists who feared associating with him would cost them access, too. Opinion: With Armstrong's disgrace, will anything change? ""It's been a good journey because the truth was never hard to find in this story. You only had to be interested in looking. What made it interesting was how many people Armstrong had watching his back,"" Walsh wrote. ""In the highest places he had friends. But he couldn't stop Andreu, O'Reilly, (ex-New Zealand cyclist Stephen) Swart and others from telling stories that contradicted his, and you had to spend only 10 minutes in their company to know they weren't lying. They couldn't be bullied into silence."" Walsh also paid tribute to the courage of O'Reilly and Betsy Andreu on Twitter, as those ""who told the truth 10 years ago, without being compelled to do so"" despite the pressure not to speak out. That pressure had an ugly face, Walsh said. ""Armstrong insinuated Emma was an ""alcoholic whore."" He and his legal bouncers portrayed Betsy as ""a jealous bitch."" They never blinked."" Tyler Hamilton . Hamilton acknowledged doping on the CBS news show ""60 Minutes"" in May 2011 and said he had seen Armstrong doing it, as well. He accused Armstrong of trying to intimidate him over the revelation. Having first tested positive for doping in 2004, Hamilton said he continued to lie -- pointing to what he called omerta, or ""the code of silence ... within the top tier of cycling"" as a reason. ""I believed that was my only way back into the sport,"" he said. ""It is a bit of a mafia. It's a powerful group. You can say the wrong thing, and next thing you know ...""","The handful of people who spoke out over doping say they were vilified by Armstrong .

"Stephenville, Texas (CNN)Even with a conviction, the ""American Sniper"" murder trial never answered the one question that still haunts the families of Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield. Why were the two men killed while trying to help Eddie Ray Routh? There have been a series of confusing and incoherent explanations for Routh's motives the afternoon of February 2, 2013. We know Kyle sensed tension as he and Littlefield drove the former U.S. Marine to a gun range for an afternoon of bonding and helping Routh cope with what his family members believed was post-traumatic stress disorder. Kyle secretly texted Littlefield, sitting next to him in a pickup, to say Routh was ""straight up nuts."" Kyle's wife, Taya, ""could tell something was up"" that afternoon when she spoke to her husband. Kyle sounded ""irritated,"" she has testified, then he never responded to a text asking if he was OK. Yet Routh didn't reveal a clear reason in the fatal shootings. Kyle was shot four times in the back and once in the face. Littlefield was shot five times in the back. Instead, the jury heard a series of bizarre explanations for why Routh allegedly turned the guns on Kyle and Littlefield. Routh's attorneys said the former Marine suffers from psychosis, paranoia and schizophrenia. Prosecutors argued that Routh is a ""troubled man"" who struggles with a ""personality disorder,"" not insanity. 'Legend' looms over murder trial . The arguments were in direct contrast to one another. While Dr. Randall Price, a forensic psychologist who testified as the prosecution's medical expert, said Routh's heavy marijuana use caused a ""substance-induced psychotic disorder,"" Dr. Mitchell Dunn said his opinion was that Routh's ""psychosis was not substance-induced."" ""It is my opinion that he was suffering from a severe mental disease or defect that caused him not to know his conduct was wrong,"" Dunn testified. One piece of evidence -- video from the police car after Routh's arrest -- shows the accused shooter complaining of mental problems and confusion. ""I've been so paranoid-schizophrenic all day, I don't know what to even think of the world right now,"" he told the officer. ""I don't know if I'm insane. Or sane. I don't know what's even sane in the world right now."" Gene Cole worked as an officer in the Erath County Jail where Routh has been held since his arrest in the killings. Cole testified he heard Routh talk about the shootings four months after the tragedy. ""I heard Mr. Routh say, 'I shot them because they wouldn't talk to me. I was just riding in the back seat of the truck and nobody would talk to me. They were just taking me to the range so I shot them. I feel bad about it, but they wouldn't talk to me. I'm sure they've forgiven me,' "" Cole said. Family: Routh acted bizarrely for years . In May 2013, Routh did a phone interview from jail with New Yorker magazine writer Nicholas Schmidle. Portions of the recorded conversation were played for the jury. Routh described being annoyed with Kyle and Littlefield as they made the 90-minute drive from his home to the countryside gun range. Routh didn't trust the Navy SEAL and his friend after their first meeting, he told Schmidle. ""That's how I felt that day,"" Routh said on the recording. ""It was the smell in the air that morning. It smelled like s**t."" Routh continued, ""It smelled like sweet cologne. I guess it was love and hate, you know. I was smelling love and hate. They were giving me some love and hate."" Later in the phone call, Routh complained that Kyle and Littlefield stopped to feed him at a fast-food restaurant on the way to the range.  It was ""strange"" because he wasn't hungry, and he felt the two men were trying to ""force feed"" him, Routh said to Schmidle. Routh's attorneys have suggested it was the arsenal of firearms lying next to Routh that triggered his psychosis and paranoia on the car ride. ""At the time of this tragedy, Eddie Routh was insane,"" defense attorney Tim Moore said. ""Not only was he suffering from a severe mental disease or defect, not only did he not know his conduct was wrong, he thought he had to take their lives because he was in danger."" Routh said that when the men started shooting pistols at the gun range, he saw it as a showdown. ""So we're shooting pistols here, huh?"" Routh recalls telling Kyle and Littlefield during his conversation with Schmidle. ""Again, that's pretty much saying, 'Duel mother****er.' "" When Schmidle asked what triggered him picking up a firearm and shooting Kyle and Littlefield, Routh replied that he was angry that Littlefield would not participate in the shooting. ""I asked him a couple of times, 'Hey, are you gonna shoot?' "" Routh said. ""This isn't a spectator sport. It's a shooting sport. You shoot. And that's what got all, you know, wired up."" After that exchange, Routh said, ""I took care of business and then I got in the truck and left."" After deliberating less than three hours, a Texas jury found Routh guilty of capital murder in the case.  Judge Jason Cashon immediately sentenced him to life in prison without parole. CNN's Jason Morris contributed to this report.","The motive for Chris Kyle's killing remains unclear .

But according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, most often Molly is not MDMA, but a toxic mixture of lab-created chemicals. 9 things everyone should know about the drug Molly . ""I ask all students: Please, please stay away from illegal substances the use of which can put you in extreme danger,"" Roth wrote in a letter to the community. ""One mistake can change your life forever."" The chemicals in Molly are made to mimic the effects of MDMA;  most of them are central nervous system stimulants that cause euphoric highs. They can also cause a rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure, blood vessel constriction and sweating, and can prevent the body from regulating temperature. Some of the chemicals have been reported to cause intense, prolonged panic attacks, psychosis and seizures. ""I just don't really know how to feel right now.

"At a campaign event Monday in New Hampshire, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney asserted that he too would have made the decision to send a U.S. Navy SEAL team to kill Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, telling reporters, ""Of course, even Jimmy Carter would have given that order."" At the same event, former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, who was chief of staff to President George H.W. Bush and is campaigning for Romney, said that President Barack Obama was wrong to take any credit for bin Laden's death. ""It's wrong in taking credit, and it's wrong in implying that someone else would not have made the same decision."" Of course, these assertions are easy to make after you already know the successful outcome of the bin Laden operation, so let's consider the decision-making process that went on in the White House before Obama ordered the bin Laden raid and then readers can assess for themselves if just any old president would have made the call. Throughout the planning process for the Abbottabad operation, Defense Secretary Robert Gates was consistently one of the most skeptical of the president's advisers. His was a voice that carried great weight, as he had worked for six American presidents; he was working for Nixon's National Security Council when Obama was only 13. And Gates had enough experience from his tenure as CIA director to know that you could have a pretty strong circumstantial case and still be wrong. In the event of a ground attack on the Abbottabad compound, he was also concerned about the level of risk for U.S. forces and for the American relationship with Pakistan. Above all, Gates was concerned about a replay of Operation Eagle Claw, the botched effort in 1980 to release the 52 American hostages held in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran during the Iranian Revolution. It was Jimmy Carter who did make the call to send in American forces to rescue the hostages, which ended up with eight U.S. servicemen dead and no hostages being freed. The failed rescue operation was a major factor in making Carter a one-term president. Eagle Claw was something Gates had lived through in excruciating detail when he working for then-CIA Director Stansfield Turner as his executive assistant. As the disaster unfolded in Iran in April 1980, Gates was with Turner the whole night of the operation, shuttling between the CIA and the White House. Gates recalled, ""We finally left the White House at about 1:30 in the morning. ... I had a long, sad drive home."" Vice President Joe Biden, who was elected to the U.S. Senate when Obama was 10, and was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee before becoming vice president, was worried about the local fallout from a SEAL raid in Abbottabad: a possible firefight with the Pakistanis or an incident at the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad. Gates and Biden also pointed out that the proposed raid would not just cause problems in America's relations with Pakistan but would likely cause a permanent rupture, and that would mean the end of both the land and air corridors across Pakistan that were critical to the resupply of the 100,000 America soldiers then stationed in neighboring Afghanistan. There was also the issue that the case for bin Laden living in the Abbottabad compound was entirely circumstantial. No U.S. satellite ever photographed bin Laden at the compound, and no American spy on the ground had ever seen him. At one point in the months before Obama made his decision, Michael Morell, deputy director of the CIA, told the president that, when it came to the sheer volume of data points, ""the circumstantial case of Iraq having WMD (weapons of mass destruction) was actually stronger than the circumstantial case that bin Laden is living in the Abbottabad compound."" At the final National Security Council meeting to discuss the Abbottabad operation on Thursday, April 28, 2011, Gates continued to be skittish about the proposed SEAL operation, saying, ""There is a degree of risk associated with the raid option that I am uncomfortable with. An option of some kind of precision strike, I would be more comfortable with that."" The defense secretary reminded Obama's war Cabinet that he had been in the White House the night the Eagle Claw mission imploded. At this final NSC meeting, Biden was unambiguous, ""Mr. President, my suggestion is: Don't go."" At the same meeting, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave a long, lawyerly presentation that examined both the upsides and the downsides of the raid option. It wasn't clear where she was going with it until she summarized. ""It's a very close call, but I would say: Do the raid."" CIA Director Leon Panetta and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Obama's top military adviser, were both strong proponents of the SEAL raid, while Gen. James ""Hoss"" Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, was in favor of deploying a tiny experimental drone-fired bomb to take out bin Laden, an option that was very much on the table during the April 28 meeting. With both Gates and Biden still leery of the largely circumstantial intelligence and the toll that a raid would place on the critical U.S.-Pakistani relationship, that made two out of the three most-senior officials in Obama's Cabinet urging against the SEAL helicopter assault. Cartwright, whom Obama had great respect for, was also advocating an alternative course of action. In essence the nation's most senior national security advisers to the president were split down the middle about the advisability of the SEAL operation to take out bin Laden in Pakistan. Obama listened to the counsel of his senior advisers intently but kept his views to himself. One of the officials in the room who had attended countless meetings with the president says, ""He is very hard to read. He's an introverted guy. He's a thinker."" As the meeting wound up, at around 7 p.m., the president said, ""This is a close call and not one that I'm ready to make now. I need to go think about this. I'm going to sleep on it. I'll give an order in the morning."" At 8:20 Friday morning, in the White House Diplomatic Reception Room, Obama gathered some of his top aides around him and said simply, ""I've considered the decision: It's a go."" Tony Blinken, Biden's top national security adviser, heard the news shortly afterward. ""I thought, 'Man, that is a gutsy call.' First, we don't know for sure bin Laden is there; the evidence is circumstantial.  Second, most of his most senior advisers had recommended a different course of action. I remember when the president left the meeting the previous day I was not convinced he was going to do it. Leaving that meeting, I think a lot of people had visions of Jimmy Carter in their heads."" If you still think this was an easy call, I have a compound in Abbottabad I'd like to sell to you.","Mitt Romney said he would have ordered the Osama bin Laden raid in Pakistan .
Peter Bergen says President Obama OK'd the raid despite strong opposition on his team .

"President Barack Obama on Friday said that Sony Pictures made a mistake in canceling the release of a movie after a cyberattack from North Korean-backed hackers. ""I am sympathetic to the concerns that they face. Having said all that, yes, I think they made a mistake,"" Obama said at a news conference Friday. ""Let's not get into that way of doing business."" Obama's statement came hours after the FBI announced North Korea is officially responsible for the cyberattack on Sony Pictures, an attack law enforcement officials called a ""game changer."" ""We cannot have a society in which some dictators someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States because if somebody is able to intimidate us out of releasing a satirical movie, imagine what they start doing once they see a documentary that they don't like or news reports that they don't like,"" Obama said. ""That's not who we are. That's not what America is about."" U.S. government agencies have presented the White House a list of options to respond to the North Korean hack, according to U.S. officials briefed on the matter. The range of options includes economic and banking sanctions -- but, the officials said, the list does not include adding North Korea to the list of state sponsors of terrorism. The United States will respond ""proportionally"" to the attack, Obama said, though he would not say how the U.S. would specifically retaliate. He did note that the U.S. has beefed up its cybersecurity infrastructure, but that ""occasionally there are going to be breaches like this."" An FBI investigation linked the malware, infrastructure and techniques a group of hackers called ""Guardians of Peace"" used in the Sony attack to previous North Korean cyberattacks. The North Korean-backed hackers broke into Sony's servers, published private emails and information and threatened to attack movie theaters screening ""The Interview,"" a comedy film about an assassination plot on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton rebuffed Obama's criticism in an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, saying his company did not make a mistake. Instead, Lynton said Obama, the press and the public ""are mistaken as to what actually happened."" Lynton pinned the decision to pull back from the planned Dec. 25 release on the major movie theater companies that told Sony they would not screen the film. ""We have not caved, we have not given in, we have persevered, and we haven to backed down. We have always had the desire to have the American public see this movie,"" Lynton said. So far, no major video on demand distributors or streaming services have offered to carry ""The Interview"" to Americans, Lynton explained, despite a wave of suggestions that Sony distribute the film outside of movie theaters. And despite enduring what he called ""the worst cyberattack in American history,"" Lynton said his studios would make the movie again, but may have ""done some things slightly differently."" Obama added that the U.S. has ""no indication"" that any other country was involved in the North Korean attack. Secretary of State John Kerry also sounded off on what he called a ""brazen,"" ""provocative and unprecedented"" attack. ""We are deeply concerned about the destructive nature of this state sponsored cyber-attack,"" Kerry said in a statement. ""These lawless acts of intimidation demonstrate North Korea's flagrant disregard for international norms."" Sen. Dianne Feinstein said that the onus is on the government and the international community to act in the face of this cyberattack -- the latest in a string of attacks on major corporations in recent years that have also included J.P. Morgan Chase and Target. Stressing the ""monumental size"" and the ""extortion"" aspect of the cyberattack on Sony, Feinstein called for an ""international agreement"" to confront cyber threats and said the U.S. government needs to take action to better protect companies from those types of threats. ""We are going for bloodshed, I believe, if we don't stop it,"" she said on CNN. ""I would hope that we can convince the North Koreans that this carries a very heavy price."" And the idea of a foreign government launching a destructive attack on an American company over an ideological matter elevated this hack to ""one of the highest priority investigations we've worked on,"" one law enforcement official told CNN. U.S. officials also tell CNN the hackers routed the attack through servers in countries from Asia, Europe and Latin America, even some in the U.S. â€‹The hackers used common DNS masking techniques to make it look like it was coming from those places, but the National Security Agency and FBI were able to track it back to North Korea. North Korean internet traffic is routed through China, which is one way they are able to hide their activity, but the FBI was still able to trace it back to the origin, sources tell CNN. And Obama also addressed North Korea's motives, noting that attacks came after a comedic, satirical movie. ""The notion that that was a threat to them I think gives you some sense of kind of what regime we're talking about,"" Obama said. The FBI called North Korea's actions ""outside the bounds of acceptable state behavior"" in a statement released Friday and called cyberthreats ""one of the gravest national security dangers."" The FBI did not use the words ""terror"" in their statement. The investigation linked the ""tools"" of the Sony hack to North Korean cyberattacks in March 2013 against South Korean banks and media outlets. Former Sen. Chris Dodd, the Chairman and CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America, released a statement Friday after the FBI announcement slamming the North Korean attacks by ""cyber terrorists, bent on wreaking havoc"" as a ""despicable, criminal act."" ""This situation is larger than a movie's release or the contents of someone's private emails,"" Dodd said. ""This is about the fact that criminals were able to hack in and steal what has now been identified as many times the volume of all of the printed material in the Library of Congress and threaten the livelihoods of thousands of Americans who work in the film and television industry, as well as the millions who simply choose to go to the movies."" Related: Cyberattacks skyrocket . Bruce Bennett, a North Korean expert at the RAND Corporation told CNN that he consulted informally on the field as a favor to Lynton, who sits on the RAND Board of Trustees. ""He asked RAND's president if he had a Korean expert to speak to in order to help sort out how to handle the picture and RAND's president asked me to do that. We had a couple of brief conversations, viewed the movie and sent some comments,"" he said, adding ""this was not a paid consultency."" Bennett said he suggested Sony let the State Department know about the film and the potential political issues involved and offered to call Robert King, the State Department's envoy for North Korean human rights. He said ""I simply notified him of what was going on."" King told Bennett the film ""was an American business decision and the State Department doesn't get involved in things like that."" Bennett said he did not show King or anyone at the State Department the film and said he was skeptical that anyone at the State Department saw it. Referring to the State Department, Bennett said ""their attitude was that they were glad to know about it, but it was not their role to intercede."" In addition to King's discussion with Bennett, the State Department has acknowledged that Assistant Secretary for East Asian Affairs Danny Russell spoke with Lynton about the film, but denied he had any involvement in its script or creative direction. State Department spokeswoman said she did not know of anyone at State that screened the movie, though it is not clear still if State officials knew how the movie ended. ""I did not come across anyone who saw the movie in advance,"" Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in an interview Thursday on CNN's The Lead with Jake Tapper. Sen. John McCain on Friday said the cyberattack amounted to ""an act of war"" on Friday and said the U.S. should retaliate in kind with cyberwarfare. ""This is the greatest blow to free speech that I've seen in my lifetime probably,"" McCain said Friday on Arizona radio station KFYI 550's ""The Mike Broomhead Show."" ""We have to respond in kind. We have lots of capability in cyber and we ought to start cranking that up."" McCain plans to hold a cybersecurity hearing into the Sony hack in the first two weeks of the next Congress, when he takes over as the chairman of the Armed Services Committee.","President Barack Obama calls Sony's decision to cancel movie showing 'a mistake.'

"Can you imagine legally growing marijuana in your backyard? How about walking down to the corner pharmacy to buy a gram or two of ready-to-smoke pot? Starting Tuesday, this scenario will no longer be a pot smoker's fantasy in one South American country. Uruguay has published regulations for a new, legal marijuana market, a measure approved by lawmakers there in December. The law and the new regulations make Uruguay the first country in the world to have a system regulating legal production, sale and consumption of the drug. In announcing the marijuana regulations, presidential aide Diego Canepa reminded everyone that the state will control the marijuana market from beginning to end, starting with setting prices. ""The value of the gram of marijuana sold at pharmacies in the regulated market will be set by the President's office through the control agency,"" Canepa said. That's right. The Uruguayan government has created an agency whose mission is to regulate the pot market, known as the Institute for the Regulation and Control of Cannabis. The proposed price starts at 20 Uruguayan pesos per gram (about 87 cents in U.S. dollars), Canepa said. People can grow as many as six plants at home and produce a maximum of 480 grams per year, according to the published rules. Cannabis clubs of anywhere between 15 and 45 members will be legal. Another rule allows people to buy as much as 40 grams of marijuana per month at state-licensed pharmacies. Julio Rey, founder of a cannabis club and a spokesman for the National Association for the Regulation of Marijuana, told CNN in December, shortly after passage, that his organization was very pleased with the legislation. ""We will take care of the tools of this law to demonstrate that we, as the public, can objectively look at this project and comply with its proposed legality,"" Rey said. This isn't about creating a free-for-all system, Canepa told reporters. It's about creating rules that will refocus government efforts on prevention and taking the market from the hands of ruthless drug traffickers that only care about money. Opinion: Finally, a nation legalizes pot . ""What we now know is that we had a sustained increase in consumption during prohibition. This new reality, as we understand it, is going to change that, and it will be possible to implement better public policy to take care of those who abuse drugs,"" Canepa said. For anyone considering traveling to Uruguay to smoke marijuana legally, President Jose Mujica, a big supporter of the law, says go elsewhere. The law doesn't give foreigners the right to smoke or even buy the drug. In fact, consumers, sellers and distributors all have to be licensed by the government. In an interview with CNN en Español in 2012, Mujica explained his reasons for promoting the legislation. ""If we legalize it, we think that we will spoil the market (for drug traffickers) because we are going to sell it for cheaper than it is sold on the black market. And we are going to have people identified,"" he said. With the help of state-of-the-art technology, authorities will track every gram or marijuana sold, according to Canepa. Bags will be bar-coded. The genetic information of plants that are legally produced will be kept on file. This will allow police to determine whether illegal marijuana is being commercialized. Governments and drug policy experts will certainly be watching closely how the Uruguayan model develops. The marijuana legislation places the South American country at the vanguard of liberal drug policies, surpassing even the Netherlands, where recreational drugs are illegal but a policy of tolerance is in place.","Uruguay is the first country to regulate legal production, sale and consumption of marijuana .

"(CNN) -- Four members of the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah have been indicted in the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, a high-placed source in the Lebanese Army confirmed on Thursday. The Special Tribunal for Lebanon issued the indictments, and a U.N. source familiar with the body said the people include alleged perpetrators on the ground. Multiple sources in the region said they include Mustafa Badreddine. Badreddine -- who is the brother-in-law of Imad Mughniyeh, a former Hezbollah commander who was assassinated in Syria in 2008 -- is reported to be a member of Hezbollah's advisory council. The other names on the list are Hasan Oneisa, Salim Ayyah and Asad Sabra. Two additional lists of indictments are expected later this summer and are expected to include the organizers and planners of the attack, the U.N. source said. The United Nations and the Lebanese Republic negotiated an agreement on the establishment of the tribunal, based at The Hague. Many Lebanese believe the killing revolved around the controversies over Syria's role in Lebanon, occupied at the time by Syrian troops, and the Damascus government's strong political influence in Lebanon. People believe Hariri wanted the Syrians to withdraw from Lebanon and lessen Syria's influence, and many suspect that Syria and its ally Hezbollah went after Hariri because of his stance on this issue. Those suspected connections of Hezbollah and the Syrian government to the killing have raised tensions in the country, stoking fears of sectarian conflict erupting in the ethnically and religiously diverse nation, which endured a civil war from 1975 to 1990. Besides being prime minister of Lebanon for 10 years between 1992 and 2004, Rafik Hariri was the driving force behind Beirut's renaissance as a Mediterranean jewel, investing in the restoration of a city center that not so long before had been the frontline in Lebanon's civil war. Rafik Hariri was 60 when he was killed, a self-made Sunni billionaire of humble origins. His son Saad, 40, leads a political bloc known as ""March 14,"" which includes prominent Christian leaders. The group's adversaries include Hezbollah and other factions. Syria had thousands of troops in Lebanon and great influence in the country until mass protests after Hariri's assassination forced their withdrawal. Syria has denied any involvement in the assassination. But six years later, the shadow cast by that day still hangs over Lebanon, which finds itself in a political crisis -- in part caused by the bitter divide over the country's special tribunal that is tasked with investigating Hariri's assassination. Hezbollah is a political faction in Lebanon and provides social services to Shiites, but it has long been regarded as a terrorist organization by the United States and as an ally of Iran. It has had longstanding animosity toward the tribunal, based on the expectation that some of its members would be indicted as conspirators in Hariri's assassination. The Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has accused the group's arch-enemy Israel of the assassination. The movement, which fought a war on Lebanese soil against Israel five years ago, claims the tribunal is a plot involving the United States, Israel and France. Ibrahim Mousawi, a Hezbollah media relations officer, said it had no immediate reaction to the indictments. Rafik Hariri and 22 others were killed on February 14, 2005, when a bomb went off as his motorcade passed by. Saad Hariri, Rafik Hariri's son and a former Lebanese prime minister, said on Thursday the indictments were issued after years ""of patience and waiting and a constant national struggle."" Saad Hariri called on all factions to accept Lebanon's ""obligations"" to the tribunal and said on Thursday ""there is no excuse for anyone to escape from this responsibility."" ""Today, we witness a distinctive historic moment in the life of Lebanon's political, judicial security, and ethical systems. And I feel in the beat of my heart, the embrace of all the hearts of the Lebanese who defended the cause of justice and refused to bargain on the blood of the martyrs,"" Saad Hariri said in a statement. Earlier this year, Hezbollah brought down Saad Hariri's government. His replacement is Prime Minister Najib Mikati, a Sunni political independent who was backed by Hezbollah and its allies. Nasrallah said in January that Hezbollah nominated Mikati to form ""a national salvation government in which parties from across the political spectrum would take part."" He disputed the view that Mikati is a Hezbollah figure. He said Mikati is a consensus candidate and ""we will not lead the new government and it will not be the government of Hezbollah."" Speaking on TV on Friday, Mikati said the ""delicate situation"" Lebanon is experiencing ""requires us to be wise"" and avert civil strife. He stressed that the ""indictments -- no matter what their source is -- are not sentences, and that charges need to have compelling evidence, away from any doubt, and that everyone is presumed innocent until proven guilty."" The U.N.-backed court said the indictment and accompanying arrest warrants ""were transmitted to the Lebanese authorities"" on Thursday. It said the announcement ""follows a declaration by the Lebanese authorities that they have received a confirmed indictment."" ""This is not a verdict of guilt and any accused person is presumed innocent unless his or her guilt is established at trial,"" the Special Tribunal said in a statement. ""At this time, the STL has no comment on the identity or identities of the person or persons named in the indictment. Indeed, Judge (Daniel) Fransen has ruled that the indictment shall remain confidential in order to assist the Lebanese authorities in fulfilling their obligations to arrest the accused."" The tribunal says arrest warrants have been submitted to the Lebanese authorities, and that they must inform the tribunal president ""within 30 days after the confirmation of the indictment of the measures the state has taken to arrest the person(s) named in the indictment.""

"(CNN)Since 2008, FIFA's annual jamboree honoring the world's best player has been dominated by just two names. Ronaldo, Messi, Messi, Messi, Messi, Ronaldo, Ronaldo. Monday saw Portuguese and Real Madrid superstar Cristano Ronaldo crowned as winner of the FIFA Ballon d'Or for a second year in a row. It came as scant surprise, given his club's phenomenal form in 2014 that saw the return of Champions League trophy -- and with it the coveted ""decima,"" or tenth European triumph -- to the Bernabeu. ""It has been an incredible year,"" he said at the awards ceremony. ""I would like to continue the work that I have done so far. I want to try to improve, to become better as each day goes by. ""I never thought that I would bring this trophy back home on three occasions. I want to become one of the greatest players of all time."" Top of their game . This seven-year duopoly reflects the importance of these two supreme athletes on the game, and allows us to see how lucky we are to be able to witness the long summers of two of the finest players to ever grace the sport. And part of the fascination lies in how different the two men are. Debating the relative merits of Ronaldo and his great rival Lionel Messi, talismans of Real and Barcelona, respectively, has been something of a parlor game in recent years. It's easy to compare and contrast, at least superficially. On the one hand, the improbable, mercurial talent of the shaggy haired, oddly stooped figure of Messi, confusing defenders as much as inspiring his teammates to a higher level. On the other: Ronaldo. A glistening, taut mass of muscle, neck like a tree trunk, powering forward relentlessly. He looks like he was created in a lab or a high tech factory; a Terminator, the ultimate footballer. Media matters . The two couldn't be much more different, in style and, if you are to believe the majority of the media, likability. Ronaldo has suffered the slings and arrows of a largely hostile press for much of his career, starting as a foal-limbed teen in Manchester, where he was often derided as a ""show pony,"" for elaborate and unnecessary tricks, and -- a sin in the English game -- diving to win free kicks and penalties. The negativity followed him to Madrid and a then-record transfer fee. It is largely Real's cheerleading press, AS and Marca, that give him a free pass; the rest of the global sporting media grudgingly accept his gifts, but are quick to level criticism when they feel it due. He's often seen as a ball-hog, a selfish player who would rather shoot than pass to a teammate. That he has taken at least 10 shots at goal in nine matches doesn't exactly banish the perception. That his fellow ""galactico"" Gareth Bale would have the temerity to take a shot (and miss) in a recent Liga game rather than pass to CR7, as the virtuoso has styled himself, earned him a withering look from the Portuguese master, and the opprobrium of fans. Off the field, his reticence to engage the media -- a symptom, it is said, of his shyness -- has been interpreted as haughty and arrogant. Messi, on the other hand, who also eschews media coverage has typically been viewed as humble and self-effacing -- although recent tax and locker room scandals threaten to change that. Phenomenal 2014 . But the stats don't lie, and with the phenomenal return of 61 goals from 60 appearances (42 in 30 La Liga games alone) during 2014, it's hard not to give credit to this year's winner. He reached the 400-goal milestone for club and country (in 653 appearances) in January, . He is a footballing genius, and had he stood alone -- his yin unopposed by Messi's yang -- he would no doubt be already talked of as one of the all-time greats. As it stands, he's talking about that honor in aspirational terms, as a goal; he's spent most of his career battling comparisons. He's also developed in leaps and bounds since his 2008 World Player of the Year trophy, refined his unquestionable talent since he first grinned on that FIFA stage. He's far more mature; gone are the unnecessary stepovers and (almost) the petulance. To complement this, he long ago inherited an undimmable desire to win from his old mentor, Alex Ferguson, and he burns with passion and a need to score. That's only become more evident as he grows into the complete player he has developed into over the past couple of years. And along with his natural ability, he's long been an indefatigable, consummate professional who gives everything he has until the final whistle, and that's what has fueled his work- and goal-rate in 2014. He still takes a lot of shots, sure, but when ""Ronaldo doesn't score,"" on the rare occasions that he walks away from a match without netting a goal is the headline, maybe he's right to do so. Certainly his Real Madrid coach, Carlo Ancelotti, doesn't begrudge him the efforts. World Cup woes? Germany's irrepressible keeper Manuel Neuer -- who was a distant outlier for the Ballon d'Or this year -- may feel aggrieved that his superlative World Cup went unnoticed in voting. Indeed, Fabio Cannavaro won the award's predecessor, the FIFA World Player of the Year in 2006, off the back of his considerable influence captaining Italy to 2006 World Cup glory. But while he had a largely anonymous World Cup, it would be difficult to deny that, year round, it has been Cristiano's year. And, like the man or not, no one should begrudge him his time at the pinnacle.","Real Madrid superstar Ronaldo picks up his second consecutive FIFA Ballon d'Or .

"(CNN)The terror groups are getting more ruthless, their attacks more brazen. Every few weeks, right when one extremist group is dominating the news with threats of attacks, along resurfaces another with a different, more harrowing claim. Over the weekend, Al- Shabaab released a video urging its sympathizers to attack malls in the United States, UK and Canada. The same day,  ISIS had  one showing its members parading caged captives down the streets of Iraq, the latest in its string of atrocious videos. Then there's the ever-present threat of al Qaeda, the brutality of the Boko Haram and the looming Taliban. The United States has a list of 59 designated terror groups, but here are the five that have been making news this month. What is it?: A Somali-based terror group with links to al Qaeda. What does it want?: It started off with a goal of turning Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state governed under Sharia law. It has since expanded  into attacks not just at home, but  in neighboring Kenya and Uganda. What's being done?: African Union forces comprising Kenyan, Somali and Ugandan troops are battling the militants in their home country.  While the forces have pushed them out of the capital of Mogadishu, the terror group still controls some parts of Somalia and continues its bloody campaign of terror in Kenya and Uganda. Is it a global threat?:  While its attacks have mostly been limited to East Africa, it is getting more ambitious. On Saturday, it posted a video calling on its sympathizers in the West to mimic its attack of a mall in Kenya, a siege that lasted four days and left more than 60 people dead. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said there's ""no credible or specific evidence"" suggesting a U.S. mall attack, but he warned Americans to watch out. What is it?:  An extremist group with branches in the Middle East and Africa. What does it want?:  While it has not vocalized its endgame as much, its focus has been targets it considers enemies of Islam or ""infidels."" It has attacked Western nations, military facilities, even other Muslim sects it considers too liberal. It was behind the September 11, 2001, attacks on the U.S. that killed nearly 3,000 people and struck fear in the hearts of leaders worldwide. What's being done about it?: Shortly after the attacks, the U.S. teamed up with other nations to launch a war on terror,  which led to the death of al Qaeda leader  Osama bin Laden. Other nations have been on a campaign to root out any groups with ties to al Qaeda. Is it a global threat?:  Very much so. It has lone-wolf operators worldwide who subscribe to its ideology, but may not have access to a group or command. Most Johnny-come-lately terror groups are also based off of it, and it has carried out suicide attacks in farflung nations such as  Indonesia, the U.S., Kenya  and Iraq.  Its attacks have evolved with security changes, and there's no telling how or where it will strike next.  Its growing list of admirers include the Al-Shabaab. What is it?: A terror group based in Nigeria. What does it want?:  Its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Africa's most populous nation, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. In recent years, its attacks have intensified in defiance of the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the Nigerian government. It has been on a campaign of kidnappings and mass killings in the nation's north. What's being done about it?:  Nigerian forces are battling the group with the help of neighboring nations such as Cameroon and Chad.  While the U.S. has provided technical and financial support, there has been a reluctance to put boots on the ground unless there's a direct national security threat to the West. Is it a global threat?:   Boko Haram's attacks have been limited to West Africa. But the terror group has targeted western facilities such as the U.N. offices in Nigeria. What is it?: A terror group that operates in Syria and Iraq. What does it want?: Its ambitions are lofty, its means of achieving them ruthless.  It started in 2004 as al Qaeda in Iraq, before rebranding as ISIS two years later. It had similarities with al Qaeda: both were radical anti-Western militant groups devoted to establishing an independent Islamic state in the region. But ISIS has proven to be more brutal and more effective at controlling territory it has seized. It declared a ""caliphate"" spanning Iraq and Syria and asserted that the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is Caliph, the successor to the Prophet Mohammed. It has demanded that all Muslims must offer allegiance to al-Baghdadi. What's being done about it?: Airstrikes, airstrikes and more airstrikes. Jordan, Egypt and the U.S. are among nations battling the terror group after it released videos showing their citizens' gruesome killings. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is also fighting back, though his government's ability to topple ISIS  is questionable. Syria's economy has been drained by years of civil war and international isolation.  Iraq, on the other hand, is more stable, has more powerful international allies and an effective regional fighting force in the semi-autonomous Kurds. Is it a global threat?:  Yes. Not only does it abduct and behead westerners in the two nations, its popularity is growing and attackers who subscribe to its ideologies have killed people in France and Australia. It's also luring westerners, creating a potential risk for homegrown terrorists. What is it?: A terror group with branches in the Middle East, and that works closely with al Qaeda. What does it want?:  The group ruled Afghanistan until 2001, where it imposed a strict form of Islam law, or sharia. After the 2001 terror attacks, the U.S. invaded Afghanistan and toppled the Taliban.  But they remain a violent, conservative force in Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan. The latter nation's branch goes by Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan. Analysts say  while it's closely linked with its namesake in Afghanistan as well as with al Qaeda, its primary target is to overthrow the Pakistani state and the military. Its most notable attack was the shooting of Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai in 2012 as she rode to school in a van. What's being done about it?:  The Pakistani government has tried to hold peace talks with the Taliban, but they have collapsed. Western officials have accused  the Pakistani intelligence agency of colluding with militant groups, making distrust a major hurdle to effective collaboration. In Afghanistan, the U.S. and NATO have thousands of troops training Afghan security forces on counterterrorism operations. Is it a global threat? Yes. It has attacked a series of western facilities, including a U.S.  military base in Afghanistan and a consulate in Peshawar.

"Police have arrested a suspect in Marseille, France, in connection with the shooting deaths of three people May 24 at the Jewish Museum in Brussels, Belgium, Belgian federal magistrate Wenke Roggen said Sunday. The suspect is identified as Mehdi Nemmouche, a 29-year-old Frenchman from Roubaix in the Pas-de-Calais region of northern France. Nemmouche recently spent a year in Syria and is a radicalized Islamist, the chief prosecutor of Paris said at a news conference Sunday. Francois Molins said Nemmouche, who has a criminal history that included a five-year prison stint, was detained at the St. Charles Train Station on Friday after returning to France by bus from Brussels by way of Amsterdam. Molins said customs police detained Nemmouche after discovering a Kalashnikov assault rifle in his luggage and a revolver in a black bag he was carrying. Nemmouche, who has remained silent during his detention, was influenced by Islamist teachings while in prison and left for Syria three weeks after being released in September 2012, Molins said. French officials lost contact with him when he left the country. In addition to the rifle, prosecutors said, the suspect's luggage contained ammunition for the Kalashnikov and a white cloth with Arabic writing on it. Bullets and cameras . In the black bag Nemmouche was carrying when he was detained, along with a .38 special, police discovered 57 rounds of ammunition for the revolver, more than 270 cartridges for the Kalashnikov, gun parts, a portable GoPro camera, a digital Nikon camera, a black hood and gloves, a Nike cap, a gas mask, and a blue nylon jacket, all objects matching the description of the Brussels shooter. Investigators also made another discovery during the examination of the items in Nemmouche's bags, prosecutors said. They found a hidden file on the Nikon camera containing a 40-second video that showed the two weapons that were seized, the clothing worn by the shooter, and the GoPro camera. Although the suspect does not appear on the film, prosecutors said there is an audio commentary. They believe it is Nemmouche's voice heard commenting on the images on screen and explaining that the video was made because the recording of the shooting at the Jewish Museum with the GoPro camera did not work. Two of the victims who died in the attack were an Israeli couple in their 50's from Tel Aviv, Israel's Foreign Ministry has said. The third victim was a French woman. A fourth person, a Belgian national who works at the museum, was shot and injured. Caught on camera . Images from the museum in Brussels showed the gunman behind last week's deadly attack approaching the building, opening fire, and walking away. He used an AK-47 assault rifle to carry out the shooting, police have said. Photographs and video released by Belgian police showed the man wearing a cap and blue shirt, carrying two bags over his shoulder. The images do not show his face clearly. The shooter left on foot after the attack and headed toward a different part of downtown Brussels before he disappeared, according to police.","French prosecutor says Mehdi Nemmouche was radicalized by Islamist teachings while in prison .

"I had to act. A frail 18-year-old Syrian refugee girl had pleaded: ""Why have you abandoned us?"" Her apartment in Homs, Syria, had been bombed, her family made homeless, her wheelchair-bound sister thrown out on to the streets with no shelter and no food but also no medical help and no schooling for the girls. I discovered that before the civil war the girl excelled in sport and chess, had led a youth group and sang with her church choir. Now she had lost her home and her school, and she was rapidly losing hope. She had written in a private letter: ""Everything is lost. I feel like I should show you so you will believe me."" And so because of recognition from the Syrian supporters in a school in Wales, she was offered the chance of a scholarship to study in the UK. She has now been here for six months and is thriving. She works hard because she dreams that one day she can return and make a difference to her war-ravaged country. Today, UNHCR figures show there are 3 million Syrian children displaced by the conflict, more than 1 million of whom have had to flee their country in what is now a disaster of biblical proportions. Some years from now the world  will look back and ask why so many of us did so little, faced with a catastrophe that has made more people permanently homeless than in the world's worst recent natural disasters, like the Asian tsunami of 2004 and the Haiti earthquake  of 2010. Of the 1 million exiled Syrian children, almost half of them in beleaguered Lebanon, and the mantra of 50 of the world's top anti-poverty advocacy groups and international institutions is simple. ""Education cannot wait."" On best estimates they are likely to spend 10 years in camps or temporary shelters. They need food not only when starving, shelter when destitute, medical drugs when faced with the risk of polio. They also need hope -- hope that there is a future worth preparing for. If they are not to lose their childhoods -- a loss that can never be replaced -- the one way to deliver hope is by ensuring they can resume their education. Amid the chaos there is a plan, a plan conceived in Britain. It puts existing Lebanese schools on double shifts -- starting earlier and finishing later to give more lessons for more pupils -- and offers all 435,000 refugees spread across the country the chance of formal education. The annual cost is $400 dollars per pupil which is cost-effective because we do not have to create new facilities. Proof that the double shift system works, albeit on a smaller scale, can be found in a north Lebanese village called Akroum. In a unique effort volunteer Syrian teachers, local Lebanese school heads and a small Scottish charity called Edinburgh Direct Aid, are operating the local school on a timeshare basis outside of normal school hours. Almost immediately boys and girls who have fled from burnt-down and bombed schools and who were a few weeks ago child laborers or even beggars have started to recover their lost childhood and now have hope that there is something  to live for. The country-wide Lebanese plan can be operational within weeks. And what has been achieved for a few hundred children in Akroum can be now achieved for all 435,000 Syrian child refugees in Lebanon -- if we urgently adopt the plan. My frustration is that an idea conceived eight months ago, negotiated with the Lebanese Prime Minister six months ago and the subject of two in-depth reports -- one by the respected Overseas Development Institute and another by UNICEF and UNHCR -- is still sitting on a table waiting implementation while children spend a winter walking the streets begging, some now trafficked into prostitution and some even forced into marriage as child brides. This week the Lebanese prime minister, Najib Azmi Mikati, travels to London to make a plea for his nation and its people.  One of the world's smallest countries, Lebanon has been left to shoulder the biggest burden of the crisis and it is unable to cope without international support. Almost 25% of its entire population are now Syrian refugees. It is the equivalent of 15 million refugees arriving on the shores of the United Kingdom. The U.S., Norway, Denmark and the UAE have backed the plan, which would cost $195 million dollars a year to secure schooling for the 435,000 children. Now with 50 of the world's top international aid agencies making an urgent plea, today all countries with aid budgets should come on board. An important principle is at stake. More than 100 years ago, the Red Cross established the principle that the right to health care transcends borders. Now we can establish that even in war zones children can learn. Some good can yet emerge out of the ruins.","More than 400,000 Syrian children have fled to Lebanon to avoid the civil war .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN)Pakistani authorities have arrested a suspect in the December 16 attack on a public school in Peshawar that left more than 140 people dead, most of them children. Taj Muhammad, also known as Rizwan, is accused of commanding one of the Taliban units that laid siege to the Army Public School. The military says he has confessed to other attacks in the same area. Taliban militants ambushed the school, explosives strapped to their bodies, and burst into an auditorium filled with students taking exams. They sprayed bullets rapidly, killing 145 people. Of those, 132 were children, authorities said. The terror group had warned Muslims to avoid places with military ties, saying it carried out the attack to avenge the deaths of children allegedly killed by the nation's army strikes in tribal areas. The army school is home to about 1,100 students and staff, most of them sons and daughters of army personnel from around Peshawar.

"(CNN)In Paris on Thursday, fashion designer Rick Owens gave audiences quite a show when he sent male models down the runway wearing clothes with peepholes that offered a glimpse of the guys' formerly private parts. ""Nudity is the most simple and primal gesture -- it packs a punch,"" Owens said of his decision to have his models bare all. ""It's powerful. ... Who else can really get away with this stuff? It's a corporate world!"" The looks were simply for shock and awe and the attention such reactions generate -- after all, they can't be worn out in public and won't be sold in stores. But let's be honest: Were we even shocked? After all, female models have been asked to sashay down runways in states of near nakedness for years. Meanwhile, more and more films are featuring full frontal male nudity. There was Michael Fassbender in ""Shame,"" of course. And who can forget the uproar over the cameo of Ben Affleck's penis in ""Gone Girl,"" albeit so brief one had to know the precise moment to look for it? And if we've seen Ben Affleck's penis, who cares about some male model's? Of course, women have been going full frontal in films for years. Perhaps the onslaught of nakedness is a sign that public nudity is becoming an equal opportunity endeavor; that women are no longer required to do all the showing. That's not a bad thing. Maybe the ""Free the Nipple"" people are finally getting their way, and women will be able to parade topless around town, or at the gym, or wherever they please, without stares or stigma (or arrest), as men have done for ages. More likely, it's a clear sign that we're a culture so overexposed that we've got no other choice but to up the stakes at every turn. We are becoming -- have become -- immune to that which was previously surprising/revolting/ awe-inspiring. It's amazing how quickly Lady Gaga went from outre to passe, isn't it? Meanwhile, Madonna is a faint middle-aged voice from the past who in a time long ago made news with pointy bras -- positively puritanical compared to the starlets of today. Consider their norms: Going commando -- that's ""without underwear,"" because, yes, there's even a phrase for it. Giving birth on TV. Posing naked for mainstream magazines. The Kardashian sisters spent the fall one-upping each other -- first Kim's naked backside on the cover of Paper (a sight credited with ""breaking the Internet"") and then Kourtney's naked pregnant belly (and backside) online at DuJour, because if one reality sister does it, so, too, must the other. Miley Cyrus, meanwhile, continues to one-up herself, graduating from foam fingers and lewd gestures to her recent full frontal magazine spread in V magazine, the release of which she celebrated with a crude shoutout on social media. But what's next? What does she, or any of these women, do for an encore? Where does a jaded culture go from here for kicks? The envelope has already been pushed beyond what we once thought were the limits. What is left? Perhaps they'll think of something. You just know those ""Most Shocking"" shows are trying to figure out how to show somebody actually die. You know that some starlet on the verge will go beyond a private sex tape (yawn) to arrange to be caught in the act. Or maybe we'll grow up and become more European in our sensibilities, and react less like middle school boys at the sight of a breast. Maybe we'll learn that hitting bottom culturally reveals a whole new bottom underneath. Whatever the impetus, the bottom is in sight. After all, being outrageous today is hard work, and only getting harder. The payoff, meanwhile, has nowhere to go but down.","Peggy Drexler: Male models at Rick Owens' Paris runway show wore clothes that exposed their penises .

"The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has taken over much of the Iraqi province of Nineveh, including the country's second largest city, Mosul. In the course of doing so, they have released thousands of jihadist prisoners, reportedly taken hundreds of people hostage and -- perhaps most worryingly of all -- fortified their already strong territorial position in the region. The group has made impressive gains in the last year. Besides this week's achievements, ISIS have come to dominate the international media discourse on the war in Syria and wrested control of the city of Falluja, which, astonishingly, is less than an hour from Baghdad. We should be worried. This, after all, is a group that was rejected by al Qaeda because of its ferocity. Its mysterious leaders are far beyond the extremist pale, and that they seem to be consolidating a territorial base must be put at the forefront of international counter-terrorism policy. ISIS, currently led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is an al Qaeda offshoot and a spawn of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's Islamic State of Iraq (ISI). For the ISI, the last few years have been rocky to say the least, but the unprecedented instability caused by the Syrian civil war has given the group a new lease of life. Since it was formed when al-Baghdadi announced an unanticipated (by all sides) merger with Jabhat al-Nusra in April 2013, ISIS has gone from strength to strength. Commentators on Syria often refer to ISIS as the most radical of the myriad jihadist factions operating there. For some reason, though, coverage from Iraq this week has stuck to calling them Sunni ""rebels,"" ""insurgents"" or ""militants."" These terms of reference are woefully unsuitable -- ISIS fighters in Iraq are of exactly the same inclination as those in Syria, who have repeatedly been called out for their unparalleled barbarity on -- and off -- the battlefield. This doesn't just matter to Iraq, though, it matters to the rest of the world as well. In the wider region, ISIS's presence in Syria will continue to skew the fight against the Assad regime for the worse. After all, these ""rebels"" are fighting the same people as the Syrian army. On an international level, any gains for ISIS are particularly troubling because it is by far the most popular group for foreign fighters to join. This is because, more than anything else, their membership requirements are minimal -- far less, for example than those for Jabhat al-Nusra. Citizens from across the world who have been going to fight in Syria -- Europeans and Americans included -- usually end up fighting alongside ISIS. Syria commentators and counter-terrorism experts alike have warned time and again of the threat posed by ISIS returnees: if they are already extremists when they go out to Syria, what they are when they return is significantly more dangerous, not least because of the weapons training they receive. The Long War Journal has also reported that foreign ISIS fighters operate in single-nation battalions, something which equips them even better to bring the terrorist threat back home. The shooting in May at Brussels' Jewish Museum was probably the first instance of a returnee ISIS fighter committing a terrorist offence. It will most likely not be the last. A frequently-referenced study into foreign fighters in 1980s Afghanistan concluded that about one in nine returnees went on to commit terrorism offences. That may not sound like much, but if one considers that there are an estimated 2,000 EU citizens fighting in Syria now (according to Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency) it becomes a far more troubling statistic. Syria aside, ISIS's new dominance in northwestern Iraq will be the principal destabiliser of the region. If left alone, Nineveh will become a jihadist's playground, one that will welcome -- and train up -- any foreigner sympathetic to ISIS's ideology. Besides that, though, the world needs to act because of the terrible risk this runs for Iraq's Shi'ite population, a minority in Nineveh but still numbering in the thousands. ISIS has a fetish for anti-Shia sectarianism and is also reported to have targeted Christians. They are certain to perpetrate many more horrific offences there if left unchallenged. The international community has a humanitarian and strategic prerogative to act against ISIS's most recent gains in Iraq; the Iraqi government needs as much support as it can get in challenging ISIS. Aside from a robust military response, Iraqi President Nuri al Maliki's government needs to challenge the jihadists ideologically. He needs to reach out to the disenfranchised Sunni population, a group that has become marginalised economically and socially during his time in power, for this is the well from which most ISIS fighters are drawn. Taking a purely heavy-handed approach will just feed into the jihadist propaganda. Encouragingly, al Maliki seemed receptive to such suggestions in March when he attended, alongside Quilliam representatives, Baghdad's first anti-terrorism conference. One thing is for sure, though, and that is that this is Iraq's war now, and no one else's.

"A suspected Nazi war criminal died in Philadelphia overnight Tuesday, just hours before a U.S. court ruling cleared the way for him to be extradited to Germany to face trial. Johann Breyer, 89, died at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital of unknown causes, according to James Burke of the U.S. Marshals Service. On Wednesday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Timothy Rice granted the U.S. government's request for an extradition certification ""based on Breyer's role as a Nazi 'Death's Head Guard,' in the murder of 216,000 European Jews at the Auschwitz II-Birkenau death camp"" and one other location from 1943 to 1945. ""As outlined by Germany, a death camp guard such as Breyer could not have served at Auschwitz during the peak of the Nazi reign of terror in 1944 without knowing that hundreds of thousands of human beings were being brutally slaughtered in gas chambers and then burned on site,"" Judge Rice said in court documents released Wednesday. He was facing 158 counts of contributing to murder, one charge for each trainload of European Jews who were forcibly deported to Auschwitz, in southern Poland, between May and October 1944, according to court documents. Breyer's attorney was not immediately available for comment Wednesday. An exact extradition date had not been set. Breyer was arrested in Philadelphia last month and held without bail. He was awaiting the extradition hearing when his health deteriorated and he was transferred to the hospital on Saturday. He had lived in the United States since the 1950s, most recently with his family in a red brick row house in northeast Philadelphia. The U.S. case against Breyer dates to the 1990s, when federal authorities sought to strip him of his U.S. citizenship, arguing that Nazis were not eligible. Breyer maintained his citizenship, however, after he was able to establish that his mother was born in Pennsylvania and returned to Germany before World War I. After World War II, Breyer migrated to the United States in 1952 and claimed citizenship as a displaced person. Authorities alleged that he admitted to serving as a guard but deliberately made false statements to minimize his role in the Holocaust.

"(CNN) -- It's all out civil war at the top of world football. On the day FIFA, the sport's global governing body cleared Qatar and Russia of alleged corruption in bidding for the World Cup, the man who led the investigation has hit back. Michael Garcia, the man who spent 18 months scrutinizing the bids to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, has labeled FIFA's findings on his report ""incomplete and erroneous."" German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of FIFA's independent ethics committee published a 42-page summary of Garcia's findings which had stretched to 350 pages by its conclusion. And this comes on the day that the FBI stepped up up the pace of a corruption investigation into senior leaders of FIFA, according to U.S. law enforcement officials. Eckert's summary, published on Thursday, found that both Qatar and Russia were not guilty of any alleged corruption. Photos: Soccer-crazy Qatar ramping up for World Cup . But Garcia, the American lawyer, released a statement claiming he will appeal to the FIFA appeal committee. ""Today's decision by the Chairman of the Adjudicatory Chamber contains numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions detailed in the Investigatory Chamber's report,"" he said in a statement. ""I intend to appeal this decision to the FIFA Appeal Committee."" The report, which examined the behavior of nations bidding for the next two editions of the tournament, has cleared 2022 host Qatar and 2018 host Russia of any wrongdoing. ""The various incidents which might have occurred are not suited to compromise the integrity of the FIFA World Cup 2018/2022 bidding process as a whole,"" said the report. The report also confirms that there are no plans to reopen the bidding process for the tournaments. ""In particular, the effects of these occurrences on the bidding process as a whole were far from reaching any threshold that would require returning to the bidding process, let alone reopening it,"" stated Eckert. FIFA responded to the report by welcoming the ""degree of closure"" which has been reached. ""FIFA looks forward to continuing the preparations for Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022, which are already well underway,"" read the statement. ""For the sake of further closure, FIFA supports the independent Ethics Committee with respect to their preparedness to potentially open future cases against officials based on the information obtained during this investigation."" Qatar was criticized in the report for sponsoring the 2010 CAF congress in Angola for approximately $1.8m while it was also noted that there were ""certain indications of potentially problematic conduct of specific individuals"". A statement from the the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar welcomed the verdict. ""We have just received the Statement of the Chairman of the Adjudicatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee and intend to consider it thoroughly before commenting,"" read the statement. ""As we have noted in the past, we cooperated fully with the Ethics Committee's investigation and continue to believe that a fair and appropriate review will demonstrate the integrity and quality of our bid. "" Russia cleared . The report also examined the successful Russian bid, despite revealing only a limited amount of documents being made available to investigators. The reason for this, according to the report, was because the ""computers used at the time by the Russia Bid Committee had been leased and then returned to their owner after the bidding process."" According to the report, the owner of the computers confirmed that the machines had since been destroyed. ""We passed on all we could to the investigation,"" Alexei Sorokin, Director General of Russia 2018 organizing Committee, is quoted as saying by Russia's R-Sport news agency. ""You must understand that it's taken been four years, and some information simply gets forgotten about. ""We are confident that our application was transparent. We didn't allow any violations. We were always confident that nothing illegal would be found. This is something that FIFA decided they had to do and they did it. ""The nomination committee rented computers, and then, as they had to do, returned them. There was no point buying the equipment at that time because it was a short-term project. We even rented furniture. We cooperated fully with the investigation. They asked us questions, and we answered them. We didn't delete any emails, we rented the computers and then returned them, and then they were used by other people."" England accused . Meanwhile, the English Football Association has been accused of acting improperly during the bidding process. The FA has been accused of attempting to ""curry favor"" with former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner, who left his role in 2011 following allegations of bribery. The report claims that the England bidding team sponsored a $55,000 gala dinner for the Caribbean Football Union, allowed the Trinidad and Tobago under-20 squad to hold a training camp in the United Kingdom in 2009 and attempted to help a ""person of interest"" to Warner find a job in the country. A spokesman for the FA refuted the claims in a statement on the organization's website. ""We note the FIFA Ethics Committee has today published a 42- page report in relation to the bidding processes for the FIFA World Cups in 2018 and 2022. ""We were not given any prior notice of the report before publication. We do not accept any criticism regarding the integrity of England's bid or any of the individuals involved. ""We conducted a transparent bid and, as the report demonstrates with its reference to the England bid team's 'full and valuable cooperation', willingly complied with the investigation. We maintain that transparency and cooperation around this entire process from all involved is crucial to its credibility. ""We also note that after a lengthy investigatory process and assessment, the report has concluded that the 'potentially problematic facts and circumstances identified by the report regarding the England 2018 bid were, all in all, not suited to compromise the integrity of the FIFA World Cup 2018/22 bidding process as a whole'."" Simon Johnson, who was part of the England 2018 bid, told CNN that the report was a ""politically motivated whitewash"". ""Even before it was published, I had no confidence in the report,"" he said. ""Now Garcia has come out and told us there are inaccuracies why should anyone believe anything? ""Mr Garcia had limited powers and couldn't investigate everybody he wanted to. ""He didn't speak to a number of members form the executive committee.""","Qatar and Russia cleared of corruption allegations by FIFA .

"Abu Usama appears to be in his late 20s. With a neat ginger beard and a rifle slung over his shoulder, he addresses fellow Muslims back in Germany from his new home in northern Syria. In a 9-minute video released by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), he explains that he took his name from Osama bin Laden, because ""he hit the head of injustice, and he is the one who terrorized [the West] as they terrorized us. Since they did not stop doing this, we will treat them in kind."" He asks his audience: ""Are you happy with your life in Germany? Going to the nightclubs and having female friends?"" according to a translation of the video by SITE Intelligence. Abu Usama then appeals for Muslims to join the struggle led by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi. Addressing al Baghdadi, he says: ""The entire world is against you, because you are inviting to establish the Islamic State. Therefore, we love you and we stand beside you."" The message was recorded last November. There is no record of Abu Usama since then. German media have reported that he is a former pizza delivery driver from a small town in North Rhine-Westphalia. But just how many have beaten the same path as Abu Usama -- from Florida and France, Austria and Australia? And if they come home, will they bring terrorism with them? ISIS's ambitions are focused on creating an ""emirate"" in the parts of Syria and Iraq it now controls, as the first step toward the greater goal of a wider Islamic caliphate. But any U.S. military action to support the Iraqi government could change that. If it chose to, ISIS could unleash a tide of young men with ""clean"" passports, fighting or bomb-making skills and unshakeable belief on their home countries. In his video, Abu Usama said it was the Americans who were the terrorists. The task of counter-terrorism agencies is complicated by the fact that in many Western states it is not illegal to travel to Syria. After all, these governments are supporting the Free Syrian Army and many who do go are inspired by humanitarian concerns. A senior U.S. official, who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity, said last week that events in Syria and Iraq are dominating discussions in the counter-terrorism community. The official said ISIS was now focused on Iraq, but ""the big concern"" was that it will shift its attention to the West -- identifying, recruiting and training Western individuals to return to their homelands as hardened, combat-trained extremists. The signs are there. In January, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi blamed ""Jews and Crusaders"" for stoking infighting between jihadist groups in Syria, adding: ""Very soon you will be in direct confrontation—you will be forced to do so, Allah permitting."" A French-Algerian extremist, Mehdi Nemmouche, is accused of killing four people at the Jewish Museum in Brussels last month. When French police arrested him they also seized a Kalashnikov rifle wrapped in a flag bearing the ISIS insignia, according to prosecutors, who said Nemmouche spent about a year fighting in Syria. It is not known whether he joined ISIS. At best, Western intelligence has a worryingly incomplete picture of who has traveled to join ISIS and other jihadist groups, despite some success in ascertaining identities through electronic eavesdropping and monitoring social media. There is very little first-hand intelligence from Iraq or Syria; the majority of foreign fighters have traveled via Turkey. Authorities in France believe some 800 French nationals have travelled to Syria, or intend to.  Analysts believe as many as 100 American citizens have made the trek. One additional concern: most Europeans are able to travel to the U.S. without visas. French and German citizens have carried out suicide bombings in Syria this year. So has at least one American. Last month, 22-year old Moner Mohammad Abusalha from Florida became the first American suicide bomber in Syria, after joining ISIS rival and al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra. UK police say they made 40 arrests for Syria-related offences in the first three months of this year, almost double the number of the entire previous year. Richard Walton, head of Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism command, warned last year there were signs these recruits could be turned around to launch attacks in the UK. ""I don't think the public realizes the seriousness of the problem,"" he said. ""The penny hasn't dropped. But Syria is a game-changer."" FBI Director James Comey said last month: ""There's going to be a diaspora out of Syria at some point, and we are determined not to let lines be drawn from Syria today to a future 9/11."" Aaron Zelin, a fellow at the Washington Center for Near East Policy, estimates that almost 3,000 European citizens have travelled to fight in Syria. Many of these young men were drawn to the cause of overthrowing Bashar al-Assad and establishing an Islamic state in part or all of Syria. They see themselves as the foot soldiers of a fledgling Islamic emirate at the heart of the Arab world. But now it is ISIS -- not al Qaeda -- that is bringing the dream of a new Islamic Caliphate so tantalizingly close. If the group can retain even a few of its spectacular gains in Iraq, adding to the northern parts of Syria it already controls, the flow of foreign fighters from the Arab world and the West will likely be turbo-charged. ISIS has already proved adept at releasing a string of propaganda videos featuring foreign fighters. So far, the little evidence that has come to light -- mainly from ISIS's own announcements -- suggests that most suicide bombers in Iraq have been Arabs, including Moroccans, Tunisians and Jordanians. But in March, it celebrated the martyrdom of a Dane who had been involved in an attack against an Iraqi army base in Taji, north of Baghdad. Another Dane detonated a suicide car bomb against Iraqi troops south of Mosul, and a French citizen bombed a police headquarters in Mosul, the group said in May, in a statement translated by SITE Intelligence. The Frenchman, called Abu al-Qa'qa' al-Firansi, had come to Iraq through Syria. Al Qaeda in Pakistan taught many European and American recruits how to make high-explosive bombs out of readily available materials. To date there is no public evidence that ISIS or Jabhat al-Nusra have provided Western recruits with bomb-making training tailored for ""taking home."" Attacking the West has not been a priority for either group to date. But it would be naïve to think that overt U.S. military action -- such as air strikes -- against ISIS fighters in Iraq would not provoke a response. Laith Alkhouri, an analyst at Flashpoint says the United States would be crossing a red line: ""The risk of terrorist attacks in the West will increase because ISIS will see any U.S. intervention as the Crusaders trying to stop an Islamic state rising."" Al Qaeda operatives in the region, despite their differences with ISIS, may also step up attempts to hit the West in the wake of any U.S. strikes. Last month the U.S. Treasury department stated that Abd Al-Rahman al-Juhani, a high-ranking Saudi al Qaeda operative previously based in Pakistan was now operating in Syria and ""part of a group of senior al Qaeda members in Syria formed to conduct external operations against Western targets."" Many analysts expect retaliation would be against U.S. interests overseas, rather than the in homeland itself. It has been a growing focus of discussion on jihadist forums. U.S. allies in the region are already concerned about ISIS spreading its wings. In March, Saudi Arabia designated ISIS a terrorist group; hundreds of Saudis are said to have joined the group. The challenge posed by ISIS is compounded by the fact that it treats Iraq and Syria as one theatre of war. It has even declared the border as non-existent. Its fighters have great mobility, and may gain experience of a variety of combat situations. And as an organization it has depth. ""While observers tend to focus on the 'Syria foreign fighter issue,' the problem actually spans two countries. Iraq is now a key part of the same quandary that Western leaders have been attempting to figure out in Syria for some time,"" says Zelin. Additionally, ISIS has shown itself entirely independent -- and highly critical - of al Qaeda 'Central' under the leadership of Ayman al Zawahiri. It has set itself up as the real bearer of Osama bin Laden's legacy, and may be tempted to cement its growing reputation by announcing its reach far beyond Mosul or Raqqa, its ""capital"" in Syria. The senior U.S. official said ISIS was growing and making a huge name for itself. ""And what better way to capitalize on that than make a major attack in the West?"" he added.

"Five years after the financial crisis, the debate over whether some of the biggest banks in America are ""too big to jail"" is causing tensions among prosecutors and regulators. As federal prosecutors in Manhattan finalized their investigation of JPMorgan Chase & Co. for failing to blow the whistle on Ponzi-schemer Bernard Madoff, the question arose: What happens if federal prosecutors file criminal charges against the bank? The answer was stark at a meeting in recent weeks in Washington between prosecutors and the bank's chief regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Prosecutors asked for assurance that charging the bank wouldn't lead to regulators starting proceedings to revoke the bank's charter, according to people familiar with the discussions. Prosecutors thought forcing the bank to accept a guilty plea could serve as a deterrent. But they also feared that if regulators moved to pull the bank's license, it could lead to destruction of the nation's largest bank and potentially the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs. OCC officials said they could provide no such assurance, the people familiar with the discussions said. On Tuesday, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara announced a deferred prosecution agreement with JPMorgan, under which the bank would pay $1.7 billion in restitution to victims of the Madoff fraud. The bank agreed to improve its anti-money laundering practices and other changes over the next two years to avoid facing criminal charges. CNNMoney: JPMorgan's expensive Madoff reckoning . OCC officials also announced a settlement with the bank, levying a $350 million penalty -- money which goes to the U.S. Treasury. The regulator also ordered the bank to improve its internal programs that are supposed to flag suspicious transactions. Bryan Hubbard, an OCC spokesman, said, ""I can't comment on discussions between agency officials."" Spokesman for the U.S. Attorney for New York's Southern District declined to comment. Tensions between regulators and prosecutors . Prosecutors complain that when they push for tougher penalties, regulators warn of consequences that could mean damage to the U.S. economy. Regulators say they are required by U.S. law to pull banking licenses if banks are convicted of criminal charges. Hubbard said Tuesday that federal law requires the regulator to initiate proceedings that could lead to revoking banking charter if a bank is convicted of banking law violations. ""DOJ independently decides whether to pursue criminal charges and prosecution against a bank for criminal violations of [money-laundering] statutes.  The OCC does not make recommendations regarding criminal prosecution."" At the same time, there's public clamor for consequences against big banks blamed for reckless practices that led to the global financial crisis from which much of the world is still recovering. The result is that highly profitable banks pay large settlements and move on. JPMorgan alone is the subject of up to a dozen investigations by federal prosecutors. An official close to the discussions said the result is a ""conundrum where bad guys get away"" with crimes. Attorney General Eric Holder, in a moment of candor at a 2013 congressional hearing, said, ""I am concerned that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if you do prosecute, if you do bring a criminal charge, it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy."" After much criticism, he returned months later to another hearing and said he wasn't implying that some banks are too big to prosecute: ""Let me make it very clear that there is no bank, there's no institution, there's no individual, who cannot be investigated and prosecuted by the United States Department of Justice."" Criticism for settling cases . Holder's department came under criticism in 2012 when it settled for $1.9 billion in an investigation of British banking giant HSBC, which for years allowed drug cartels and countries subject to sanctions to launder money. The tension between regulators and prosecutors showed at a news conference in Brooklyn in which then-Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer spoke of fears of collateral damage to the U.S. economy as the reason for not charging HSBC. Thomas Curry, head of the OCC, told reporters his agency couldn't be tougher on HSBC because prosecutors weren't going after the bank. At Tuesday's news conference on the JP Morgan settlement, Bharara again took tough questions from reporters on why there wasn't a tougher stance against the bank and its bankers. ""You have to consider consequences such as employees being laid off, the bank failing. ... You have to consider consequences such as innocent shareholders losing substantial value. You have to consider the possibility that regulators will take action against the charter of the financial institution,"" Bharara said. CNNMoney: How JPMorgan shorted Madoff .

"Three weeks after four Americans were killed in an attack on the U.S. Consulate in eastern Libya, an FBI team arrived at the site as the investigation continued in other places, too, a Pentagon spokesman said Thursday. ""You should not assume that all we could do or have been doing is restricted solely to Benghazi,"" Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters in Washington. ""There are a variety of other places in country and outside the country where relevant things could be done and have been done. This is a matter that's been under active investigation almost since the time of the incident and I'm satisfied with the progress that we have made."" Holder said the focus of the Justice Department was ""to solve this matter, to hold people accountable. So that's what we will do."" Pentagon spokesman George Little said Thursday that a U.S. military support mission accompanied the FBI team, which was in Benghazi ""for a number of hours"" before it left the city. ""We have not been sitting around waiting, you know, for information to come to us,"" Little said, adding that U.S. investigators were ""actively chasing leads in various ways."" U.S. Special Operations forces were in Libya and nearby countries aiding in the collection of intelligence regarding the assault, a U.S. military official told CNN Thursday. The official declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the information. Read more: CNN finds, returns journal belonging to late U.S. ambassador .

The failure of investigators to visit the site in the immediate aftermath of the attack has raised questions about the integrity of the FBI investigation and concerns that sensitive documents may have been left unsecured. Three days after the attack, CNN Senior Correspondent Arwa Damon discovered Stevens' journal during a visit to the unguarded, abandoned compound. This week, a Washington Post reporter visiting the site found sensitive documents, including personnel records of Libyans who had been contracted to provide security, emergency evacuation protocols and details of U.S. weapons collection efforts. But a State Department official told CNN that no classified documents had been left on the premises. In the days after the assault, U.S. administration officials offered conflicting assessments as what may have led to the fatal security breach. Officials initially said the violence erupted spontaneously amid a large protest about a privately made video produced in the United States that mocked the Prophet Mohammed. But the U.S. intelligence community revised its assessment, saying it believes it was a planned terrorist assault. The intelligence community now believes it was ""a deliberate and organized terrorist assault carried out by extremists"" affiliated with or sympathetic to al Qaeda. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has said the attack was ""clearly"" planned and conducted by terrorists, and that it ""took a while"" for there to be information to reach such a conclusion. But a senior U.S. official told CNN that, within a day or so of the attack, the U.S. intelligence community had begun to gather information suggesting it was the work of extremists either affiliated with or inspired by al Qaeda groups.

"(CNN)These days, Silicon Valley is hot and Wall Street is not. There's a tech bubble and no one knows when exactly it will pop. We have sky-rocketing valuations like Airbnb ($13 billion), Uber ($41 billion), Snapchat ($10 billion), Dropbox ($10 billion) and so on. College students think tech is sexy and just about everyone seems to want to be called an entrepreneur. But there's one problem: The startup world is cluttered with ""wantrapreneurs"" who fail to recognize that success demands a tenacity, resiliency and energy unlike any traditional job short of combat infantry soldier or SWAT team member. Many enthusiastic founders who finish startup training and acceleration programs disappear quickly and quietly from the scene as customers yawn about their big bold ideas. These entrepreneurs aspire to be the next Mark Zuckerberg, and upon learning such a goal is as ephemeral as winning the lottery, their zeal wanes quickly. One top venture capitalist remarked that we see only about a dozen great companies emerge every year in the U.S. Too often, they're doing boring and un-techy things like preventing or curing diseases, or solving complex big data challenges that just aren't as sexy or well-publicized as the next hot-or-not dating app. As the job market recovers, hopefully, more of those wannabes turn to good old-fashioned W2 jobs, with predictability, stability and health insurance. It's a place where 99% of people belong. The lesser entrepreneurs should go out and find regular jobs, clearing the clutter for those with the idea, drive and overwhelming ambition to build truly great companies. Because really, we don't need more startups that are lame, same and tame. Lameness: Ready to work 90+ hours a week? If you're not a passionate, tenacious, driven entrepreneur willing to work 90-plus hours a week while confronting a high failure rate, update your resume and get a job. If you're dedicated and your startup is guilty of sameness, lameness or tameness, blow it up! Do something dramatic to differentiate your company and offer lasting value.  Recognize that virtually every good startup idea is ""out of the building"" -- between the ears of your customers who are the only people whose opinions matter. Embrace those people, talk to them, and build something really amazing that will be craved by the millions, not thousands, for years, not months. Sameness: Do we really need a gazillion game apps? How many digital games does a single planet need? The 1.3 million apps available in July 2014 on iTunes included over 200,000 game apps and more than 8,000 apps just to help create or save your favorite recipes. How can anyone get excited about the next food, personal finance, Web marketing or taxi dispatching tool with three or four cute new features? Scores of niche versions of LinkedIn, for example, have died painful deaths, trying to do just what LinkedIn does well, but for some subset of the business world. Too many startups offer little more than a tweak in an effort to distinguish themselves. Tameness: Is it just air behind massive valuations? Massive valuations were once the reward for unstoppable meteoric growth. Just think back on the very early days of Facebook, Google, Priceline and eBay. Sadly, very few startups sustain that kind of growth for anywhere near as long as they sustain their sky-high valuations. How quickly did Myspace come and go? Where went the rapid user growth of Twitter and Groupon and LivingSocial, among many others? When Groupon merchants and customers didn't return, the stock went from a peak of $30 to a recent close of under $8. Amazon recognizes that it can't forever be a leading retailer. Its remedy? New delivery systems, Amazon Web services, content, publishing platforms and more. Amazon will do what it takes to not be labeled tame. Google has seen a leveling off of its enormous search ad revenues, but the many businesses it has invested in or acquired will likely drive its growth for years to come. What about Uber -- the new kid on the block? Why would one of the world's most highly valued startups offer winter price cuts in 48 cities? Its low-end UberX is just as tame if not sadly unimaginative. ""Cheaper than a New York City taxicab!"" is hardly the mantra of a great company. But if you must ... According to the Kauffman Foundation, America's leading entrepreneurship advocate, in 2013 about 476,000 new businesses started per month, including everything from hair salons to tech startups backed by Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins. While new businesses help create jobs in the economy, the failure rate is high. Survival rate, as government data points out, drops dramatically after a few years. So for all the entrepreneurs out there: Here's a piece of advice, whether you're starting a pizza parlor or the next Amazon, truly great companies that endure are built on inventive solutions to significant problems confronted by at least millions of people. And those people -- not your investors, coaches, advisers or professors -- are the ones who hold the keys to unlocking a great business they want to spend time or money on. Far too few startups invest the sweat and blood to identify those opportunities and deliver a one-two punch of disruptive innovation and relentless execution.","The startup world is cluttered with ""wanrapreneurs,"" or wannabe entrepreneurs .

"President Barack Obama and John McCain are once again at odds over national security: this time, it's over the North Korean cyberattack on Sony Pictures. Sen. John McCain rejected Obama's characterization of the North Korean hack as ""an act of cybervandelism,"" instead calling it ""a new form of warfare"" on CNN's State of the Union. ""The President does not understand that this is a manifestation of a new form of warfare when you destroy economies, when you are able to impose censorship,"" McCain, a Republican from Arizona, said. ""It's more than vandalism. It's a new form of warfare that we're involved in and we need to react and we need to react vigorously."" A group of North Korean-backed hackers broke into Sony Pictures' servers last month and threatened to attack movie theaters screening the movie, ""The Interview,"" a satirical comedy depicting an assassination attempt against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Sony put off its plans to release the film after major movie theaters decided not to screen it. McCain called that attack an ""act of war"" in a radio interview on Friday and pledged to call a hearing on the matter in the first two weeks of the next Congress when he takes the helm of the Senate Armed Services Committee . McCain also (literally) laughed off the notion that Obama's actions are responsible for crippling the Russian economy, which is nose diving into a recession. ""We should be thanking the Saudis who have allowed the value of a barrel of oil to go to the point where it's affecting dramatically Vladimir Putin's economy,"" Putin said. ""It has nothing to do with any action taken by the President of the United States."" McCain added that he believes American sanctions, which have been the lynchpin of Obama's strategy in confronting Russia, have had little effect. In his interview with CNN's Candy Crowley that aired Sunday, Obama countered critics like McCain who have said Obama has been outmaneuvered by Putin and pointed to the Russian economic collapse as evidence. ""Right now he's presiding over the collapse of his currency, a major financial crisis and a huge economic contraction, "" Obama said. ""That doesn't sound like somebody who has rolled me or the United States of America."" McCain also joined the fray of Republicans -- including most prominently potential 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio -- who have criticized Obama's decision to ease sanctions and normalize relations with Cuba, claiming that Obama is rewarding Cuba for bad behavior. ""That in my view would encourage others,""  he said. Most Democrats and a few Republicans, including Sens. Jeff Flake and Rand Paul, have hailed Obama's agreement with Cuba since the 50-year embargo against the country has failed to alter the country's internal politics.","McCain dismissed Obama's characterization of the Sony cyberattack as ""cybervandalism""

"(CNN)After a siege at a Kenyan mall two years ago, the FBI started staging mock attacks in U.S. shopping centers during off hours to test their readiness, an official said. More than 60 people died when Al-Shabaab militants raided an upscale mall in Nairobi and held shoppers hostage for four days. The terror group  released a video Saturday calling for similar attacks in malls in the United States, Canada and the UK. Although Homeland Security and the FBI say they are not aware of  a specific, credible plot against U.S. malls, they've worked  to improve security in light of the attack in Kenya. Last year, the FBI teamed up with various malls nationwide to increase preparedness, a law enforcement official told CNN. It tested the readiness of SWAT teams by staging fake attacks at malls when they were closed, the official said. Since then, the FBI has had a program that works with malls to improve security, the official said. The Somalia-based terror group has limited past attacks to its home country and neighboring Kenya and Uganda. But as other terror groups such as ISIS have made vicious headlines, Al-Shabaab may be feeling left out, U.S. officials said. The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI say they believe the video was the militants' attempt to compete for attention and recruits with other terrorist groups, one official said. Al-Shabaab's strength is compromised, a U.S. law enforcement official said, and while the group has the desire to see a mall attack in the U.S., it probably isn't able to do so. Despite what some officials described as an attention ploy, security was beefed up in malls listed as potential targets. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said there's no credible evidence suggesting a U.S. mall attack is in the works. But shoppers should be vigilant nonetheless, he said. ""There will be enhanced security (at malls),"" he said Sunday. ""But public vigilance, public awareness and public caution in situations like this is particularly important, and it's the environment we're in, frankly."" Stressing that there is no known credible threat to any mall, Johnson cautioned that attacks can be unpredictable. ""I won't know about when the next bad actor is going to strike,"" he said. In Bloomington, Minnesota, home to Mall of America, one of the shopping centers named in the video, law enforcement agencies said they remain vigilant. ""Enhanced security measures to include additional personnel have been implemented and all information is being monitored,"" local police said in a statement Sunday. The mall said it  takes any ""potential threat seriously"" and has implemented extra security. ""We have protocols in place that as things happen we can ramp up and we've implemented some of those strategies,"" said Bloomington Police Chief Jeff Potts. ""Some of them are things that people wouldn't notice."" Michael Rozin, a security consultant to the Mall of America, said that dedicated explosive-detection dog teams patrol the mall. Officers are trained specifically in behavior-detection techniques, he said. The mall also has its own intelligence branch and a station where teams monitor chatter on social media, according to Rozin. The West Edmonton Mall  in Alberta, Canada, which was also named in the video, said it has boosted security and is working with federal and local law enforcement agencies. ""Canada will not be intimidated by threats from any terrorist organization,"" Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney said. The video also mentioned shopping centers in the UK. Westfield Corp. said there is no ""evidence of an imminent threat"" to its shopping centers, but it's taking steps to ensure safety. UK Metropolitan Police Counter Terror Command also said it is aware of the  video. Amano Dube, a leader in the Somali community in Minneapolis, said radicalization is a great concern. ""The root cause of the problem is poverty, identity crisis and a lack of education,"" he told CNN. ""We have to create projects and programs and opportunities for these young men to focus on the future and positive life-changing things."" The Somali community has met to discuss the video and to address it in a unified manner, he said, likening radicalization to a disease. ""We have to work hard for our community and families, to dismantle this; it's a grave concern,"" Dube said. ""With social media ... it has really given the best opportunities for this evil to affect all communities and ages."" Although Al-Shabaab's past attacks have been limited to East Africa, the militants have heavily recruited in Minneapolis, where young men have been slipping away to join the terror group. The city is home to the largest Somali population in the United States. In addition to Kenya and Somalia, Al-Shabaab has also struck in Uganda, where it killed dozens gathered to watch a World Cup soccer match in Kampala five years ago. Kenya and Uganda have sent their forces to neighboring Somalia to battle the extremists. As the attacks get more daring, the international community has rallied to fight the militants. Last year, a U.S. airstrike in Somalia killed the Al-Shabaab leader. The terror group later replaced him and vowed to avenge his death. Al-Shabaab started off with a goal of waging a war against the Somali government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia. It has since shifted focus to terrorist attacks in Somalia and beyond. CNN's Nick Valencia, Catherine E. Shoichet and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","The FBI says it's not aware of any credible plot against U.S. malls .

"It starts with a tweet. The recruit has been slowly and carefully chosen from his local community -- perhaps at a mosque, or gym, or cafe -- by an al Qaeda recruiter, aiming to send a Westerner to fight alongside radicals in Syria. According to a defector from the ranks of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) -- whose stronghold in the Syrian town of Raqqa punishes smokers and insists women wear a veil --  the jihadist group runs a series of internet welcome chat groups to begin the process of indoctrinating and filtering potential recruits from outside Syria. The defector agreed to an interview with CNN but wanted to hide his identity, but his story was ratified by a witness and his extensive knowledge of life inside Syria under the ISIS. He fled Syria when two of his relatives were killed in the violence, and is now hiding in Turkey. He said that European recruits were more sought after and treated in a different class by the recruiters. ""There was special treatment for the Europeans,"" he says. ""One British guy said he was called Ibrahim, then told me he was from Manchester. One asked my emir [his unit's head] if he should fight in his own country, or come to Syria. He was told if God doesn't give you martyrdom in Syria, then he could wage war in his own country."" Western officials have told CNN they are deeply concerned at not only the growing numbers of Western passport holders who have traveled to Syria to fight, but also the potential for more and more of these radicals to return to the West and continue that jihad through acts of domestic terrorism. Hundreds of British and French citizens have traveled to Syria, according to multiple official estimates, and several have returned. A Briton was recently convicted of terror offenses after spending time inside Syria with radical groups. U.S. officials have become increasingly concerned about American passport holders attempting the same, and anxieties have been amplified by the U.S. State Department confirming that Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, from Florida, became the first American citizen to die as a suicide bomber in Syria last month. Recruiters are the gateway from the West to ISIS. The first contact is made over Twitter, when the recruit might send a message to ISIS's Twitter accounts saying ""Can I talk to Hakim,"" for example, the source said. The Twitter account is then followed back, enabling a direct message to be sent with the e-mail address of the ISIS recruiter. The conversations that continue, the defector said, over Google Chat, Skype and Twitter, are extensively monitored by the emirs and supervisors of the recruiting unit. While the defector didn't speak English, he says he used online translating apps to talk to French and English recruits. ""There are questions I am allowed to answer,"" he said, ""and then things I must ask my supervisor. Specific questions about religion. I have to get their permission to message anyone. I can't talk on Skype, as everything is written down, so they can monitor everything."" The defector added his supervisor often dealt with the European recruits. He said the online chats, intended to provide basic information about life under the ISIS caliphate, or strict Islamist state, lasted about two weeks, and sometimes each chat could last hours. He said some of the potential recruits asked curious questions. ""I remember one guy asked me for a video of a public execution"", he said, ""but one that's not been put online before. Strange ones too about marrying Syrians girls. I got mad once when I was asked if someone could marry three or four girls."" When the recruit is ready to come to Syria, a different part of ISIS assists, and the defector said he was not supposed to meet those he helped recruit. He said the recruitment was first aimed at filling ISIS ranks inside Syria, and that the return of these radicals to their home countries was carefully regulated by the emirs, or senior commanders, of ISIS. Each recruit's passport was taken from him on arrival and the defector recalls seeing dozens of foreign passports held in the same office, and overhearing one foreign recruit discussing how he might return home to act as a recruiter. The defector was himself jailed for one day by ISIS for overstepping the permitted topics of conversation with recruits, and says he fled Syria with the clothes on his back after his relatives were killed. He says he still fears for his life and has given his phone number to only three people. ""I didn't think ISIS lied to me,"" he says, ""but they did play with my mind.""","Islamist defector says Twitter, Google Chat and Skype used to recruit foreign fighters .

"President Barack Obama will speak to the nation Tuesday, trying to build public support for a military strike against Syria. His request to Congress to endorse action reaches the House and Senate at an extraordinarily difficult moment. Vote counts suggest that the president might not win the support he is seeking. Democrats and Republicans are uncertain about backing the president. The public remains skeptical as well. According to one NBC poll, only 42% of the public endorsed using military force against Syria. After Afghanistan and Iraq, the nation is weary of war. The bar has been raised for further intervention. Although presidential speeches rarely are able to fundamentally reshape public opinion, Obama must give his strongest effort if he does not want to end up in an embarrassing situation for his administration and one that could undercut the military effort that he is proposing. If Obama is going to deliver a speech that matters, he must answer some basic questions about the Syrian intervention: . Why are we entering this conflict? For many Americans, the arguments behind American intervention in Syria remain murky. This is not just about Syria being a confusing and complex situation, but also has to do with a general uncertainty about the objectives of American foreign policy in 2013. In each era of foreign policy, policymakers have put forth strong ideological arguments that framed public policy about war and peace. Each period had substantial numbers of dissenters, but at least there was something concrete to argue about. During the 1930s and early 1940s, the fight against fascism was the driving force behind decisions about intervention. ""Yesterday, December 7, 1941 -- a date which will live in infamy -- the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan,"" President Franklin D. Roosevelt explained the next day, when asking Congress for a declaration of war. From the mid-1940s through the late 1980s, the fight against communism was the focal point of policy. Since that time, the objectives of American foreign policy have been less clear. When President Truman asked for congressional support to use military power in Korea in July 1950, he said that the conflict in Korea ""has made it clear, beyond all doubt, that the international Communist movement is willing to use armed invasion, to conquer independent nations."" In the early 1990s, policymakers turned their attention to rogue states such as Iraq that were said to pose dangers to the stability of key regions. After 9/11, attention turned to international terrorist networks like al Qaeda. On September 20, 2001, President Bush told the nation, ""The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends. It is not our many Arab friends. Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them."" The larger framework surrounding the Syrian intervention is less clear. The administration has offered a number of arguments as to why the United States needs to intervene, from the message it would send to Iran about nuclear weapons, to the urgency of responding to gross violations of human rights. The president must offer a compelling reason why a situation such as this deserves national resources. If humanitarian interventions are to become a new norm, the president should make the case and offer a set of coherent principles for future conflicts. What is the justification for this intervention and is it based on sound intelligence? One of the main sources of public cynicism about American foreign policy comes from the fact that presidents have often used incorrect information or purposely flawed data to justify military operations that result in huge human and financial costs. American history is filled with such examples. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964, which provided President Lyndon Johnson the blanket authority he needed to expand America's presence in Vietnam and the region, was based on spurious data about alleged attacks on U.S. Navy destroyers by the North Vietnamese. Congress gave Johnson wide-ranging authority to conduct military operations. It was ""like grandma's nightshirt, it covered everything,"" he later said. President George W. Bush's request to Congress for the authorization to use force in Iraq in 2003 was justified through incorrect intelligence about the presence of weapons of mass destruction and untrue reports of connections between Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. Obama, who ran his 2008 campaign based on criticism of all the problems with Bush's war, needs to demonstrate to the public that he has made a decision based on the soundest of evidence. The revelations about the National Security Agency have already raised public skepticism about the discrepancy between what Obama says in public and what he does behind the scenes. Without revealing sensitive information to the public, it is important that the president make a convincing case that the intelligence behind this decision is sound, that it has been examined and cross-examined, that the Syrian government did use chemical weapons and that the Syrians do pose a substantial threat to the region. He needs to explain why chemical weapons pose a threat that deserves a military strike as opposed to other weapons or mechanisms of mass destruction. Why act here, but not with regard to other atrocities or risks? The nation cannot afford another war based on false premises. What is the mission? Presidents have gone into many wars without a clear sense of what they hope to achieve. Once troops are sent into a war or even after the Air Force is sent in to strike targets, conflicts can take unpredictable turns and escalate quickly. If the administration doesn't articulate a clear sense of what it hopes to accomplish at the outset, it allows for open-ended possibilities for escalation. When President George H.W. Bush went to war with Iraq in 1990, the confusion over the objectives led to great frustration when Americans saw that Hussein remained in power after the celebrations of U.S. victory had taken place. Bush's son's war in Iraq proved even more frustrating, as there was growing awareness that the administration was entering into a much broader mission of nation-building than many Americans had anticipated. When the new government that emerged from the rubble in Iraq remained unstable and the U.S. seemed to be pouring endless resources into the country, many Americans were left with a sense that the operation had not been worthwhile. Obama can't afford to make the the mistake of leaving his objectives ill-defined. It is possible that quick and targeted airstrikes will destroy the chemical weapons capacity of the Syrians, though that would still leave in place a dictator whom the president has  characterized as inhumane and brutal. It is also possible that airstrikes would result in retaliation that would trigger a bigger conflict, which would in turn create greater pressure for regime change. The president did the right thing by engaging Congress in this decision rather than trying to circumvent the legislative branch. But in this case, with the memories of Iraq looming large, he won't have luck just asking for blind support. In his speech, the president must answer these questions in simple and direct terms. This would do a great deal to build confidence in the operation, and to build a foundation for longer term support of this intervention should it be needed.","Julian Zelizer: President Obama must answer basic questions to sell Syria move to the public .

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- French President Nicolas Sarkozy is pledging $730 million (€ 580 million) in economic aid to France's Caribbean territories in an effort to head off escalating protests, his office said Friday. French gendarmes face-off against Guadeloupe protesters. Sarkozy made the announcement after a meeting in Paris with leaders from French Caribbean territories. He also proposed adding €200 ($253) a month to the salaries of low-paid workers. The French territory of Guadeloupe has witnessed a month of sometimes violent demonstrations over low wages and living conditions. At least one civilian, a trade unionist, has been killed in riots. French Interior Minister Michele Alliot-Marie on Thursday announced the deployment of four state police units to Guadeloupe . ""We have the duty to listen to our countrymen and at the same time, we must bring law and order back as quickly as possible,"" Sarkozy said in remarks Thursday. ""Our countrymen expect the state to protect them. It's unacceptable that a trade unionist has been killed. This is murder. It's a hateful act that has nothing to do with the social crisis."" Hospitals and emergency services continue to function and the main international airport is open, but petrol stations, schools, and most businesses -- including supermarkets and car rental offices -- are closed, the British Foreign Office said in a travel advisory. Hotels are open, but the strike is causing daily cuts to electricity and water supplies, the Foreign Office said. French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said Thursday the crisis is linked to ""the lifelessness of the economy in the Antilles , aggravated by the global economic crisis.""

"(CNN)The nurse in Texas seemed to have taken all the precautions needed to protect herself from Ebola. She wore a mask, gown, shield and gloves. Her patient, a man who contracted the virus in Africa, was in isolation at the Dallas hospital where she worked. And yet the woman -- whose name has not been released -- still contracted Ebola, marking the first known transmission ever in the United States.  A nurse in Spain who also treated an Ebola patient also caught the virus.  She is in critical condition and being treated by 50 health care workers, Spanish authorities said Monday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday there was a breach in protocol in Texas, but officials haven't elaborated on what that breach was. Instead, they said the protocols laid out for American hospitals work. So what happened? How could a nurse at an American hospital contract the virus? Is the situation a one-off, an instance of human error, something that probably wouldn't occur again? Or could there be more to it? How it happened . On Monday morning, an official with direct knowledge of the Texas nurse's case told CNN that CDC disease detectives have several times interviewed the Texas nurse and think there are ""inconsistencies"" in the type of personal protective gear that she wore and with the process used to put the gear on and remove it. The nurse who tested positive for the virus worked at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden has said the agency is considering several possibilities as to how that breach may have happened, including whether the infection was spread when the protective equipment was removed or when the patient, Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan, received kidney dialysis or respiratory intubation. Those measures were ""a desperate measure to try to save his life,"" Frieden said. ""Both of those procedures may spread contaminated materials and are considered high-risk procedures."" ""When you have potentially soiled or contaminated gloves or masks or other things, to remove those without any risk of any contaminated material ... touching you and being then on your clothes or face or skin ... is not easy to do right."" Or the problem could have been something else entirely. CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen said precautions among health care workers can actually go overboard sometimes. The workers are supposed to double their gloves in some situations, she said. Triple gloving is a violation of CDC protocol and could make things worse. ""Then you need to take off three pairs of gloves ... gloves with infectious stuff on them,"" she said. How troubling it is . The CDC concedes the transmission is worrisome. ""It is possible in the coming days that we will see additional cases of Ebola,"" Frieden said. That's because others who provided care to Duncan could have had the same kind of breach as the infected nurse. The official who has direct knowledge of the Texas case told CNN that health authorities will make daily visits to dozens of Dallas health care workers who treated Duncan between September 28 and October 8 at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. The workers have been monitoring their own health, including taking their own temperature. They were previously not considered high risk because they were wearing protective gear, the official said. The CDC is still compiling a list of health care workers who came into contact with Duncan, the official said. The public areas of the nurse's apartment complex have been decontaminated and her neighbors have been notified. And the city of Dallas made a reverse-911 call to residents, notifying them of the city's second Ebola case. ""I think it needs to be put into context that ... you can't make an extrapolation that this is now a danger more so to the American people,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. But the fear is spreading. When a passenger on a flight from New York to Los Angeles fell ill Sunday, the biggest concern was Ebola. The plane was taken to a remote gate at Los Angeles International Airport. After a few hours, officials determined the woman did not appear to have Ebola, and other passengers were allowed to leave. And in Louisiana, Attorney General Buddy Caldwell is seeking a temporary restraining order to block the disposal of incinerated waste from Duncan's personal items at a Louisiana landfill. ""There are too many unknowns at this point, and it is absurd to transport potentially hazardous Ebola waste across state lines,"" Caldwell said Sunday. What is being done . President Barack Obama wants federal authorities to immediately take further measures to ensure health care workers are able to follow protocols for treating Ebola patients. Of the thousands of hospitals in the United States, only four have been training for years to deal with highly infectious diseases like Ebola: Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, The Nebraska Medical Center, the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, and Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Montana. ""They have the management, the processes, the implementation in place that if an Ebola patient comes in, just right away they know what to do,"" said Gavin MacGregor-Skinner, who teaches public health preparedness at Penn State University. But if someone with symptoms of Ebola shows up at any other hospital, as Duncan did, the hospital might not be ready. ""It may not be that every single hospital is in fact prepared for this,"" said David Sanders, associate professor of biology at Purdue University. ""We may have to think about regional centers that are best prepared to deal with Ebola patients."" Another step in the battle: screening. On Saturday, passengers arriving from the three countries hardest hit by Ebola started getting special screening, including having their temperature taken, at New York's JFK airport. Washington's Dulles, Newark, Chicago's O'Hare and Atlanta international airports will begin screening Thursday. 'The time to act is long overdue' The country's largest nursing organization, National Nurses United, surveyed 2,000 members. Of them, 76% said their hospital hasn't communicated any policy about how to admit Ebola-infected patients. And 85% said their hospital hasn't provided education on Ebola where the nurses can interact and ask questions. Nurses ""are alarmed at the inadequate preparation they see at their hospitals,"" said the group's executive director, RoseAnn DeMoro. ""The time to act is long overdue,"" she said.","Official: ""Inconsistencies"" seen in protective gear and the way it was put on and taken off .

"Even if the Senate backs President Barack Obama's call for military action against Syria, a wall of outright opposition or skepticism from Democrats and Republicans in the House makes approval there very difficult. House Speaker John Boehner, who backs Obama on the issue, welcomed news on Friday that the president would deliver a national address on Tuesday to try to sway public opinion, which now opposes such a step. But Boehner's spokesman signaled that the votes aren't in the House for passing a resolution authorizing force against Syria and the GOP is placing the burden squarely on Obama's shoulders. ""Only a president can convince the public that military action is required. We only hope this isn't coming too late to make the difference,"" Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said in a statement. Still, senior House Republican aides find it difficult to see a path for passage. Boehner's top deputy, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, also supports the president and is talking to members and urging them to review classified materials that administration officials say bolsters their case for military action. Cantor penned an editorial in his hometown Richmond paper explaining why he believes military action is needed. ""America has a compelling national security interest to prevent and respond to the use of weapons of mass destruction, especially by a terrorist state, and to prevent further instability in a region of vital interest to the United States,"" he said. 'Constructive' talks but little headway on crisis . But rank and file House GOP members have frequently ignored their leaders and the vote in favor of action is stalled in the single digits, including the support expressed by senior leadership, a CNN tally showed. One senior GOP House aide said prospects for meaningful additional Republican support is ""bad"" and ""momentum is with the 'nay' vote."" Congress is ending its summer recess and members formally get back to work next week. In a memo to House Republicans outlining the fall schedule, Cantor suggested the timetable for the vote, which Boehner initially planned for next week, could slip a week. ""Members should expect a robust debate and vote on an authorization of use of military force pertaining to Syria in the next two weeks"" Cantor wrote. But House GOP leaders are leaving open the possibility the House will not bring up the resolution if it fails in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid predicted on Friday that the necessary votes were in the Democratic-led chamber to pass a resolution calling for limited force. The House plans to wait to see if something passes the Senate  before making final decisions on the language or timing of any House vote, according to multiple Republican sources. One undecided GOP member, Rep Richard Hudson, a North Carolina Republican, returned for a briefing on Friday. He told CNN that he came back to hear details about the military objectives directly from the administration instead of through the media. Obama to address American people on Tuesday . Although his constituents are ""very opposed"" to military action, Hudson said he would base his vote on what he thought was best for the country and ""let the politics sort itself out later."" The lack of GOP support places enormous pressure on House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who was one of the chief critics of the Iraq war, and Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer. The two will need to persuade well over a majority of the 200 House Democrats to stand behind Obama, also a Democrat. Top House Democratic aides counter that it's too soon to predict defeat because most Democrats are reserving judgment until they hear details in a classified briefing on Monday evening. The administration is dispatching top officials to make a final push before Obama's speech. Secretary of State John Kerry; Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey will conduct the joint House-Senate session in the Capitol. ""We're not going to know until our members get back into town.  A lot of people haven't had access to the briefings or the classified documents,"" one of Democratic aide noted. But for many House members who already have attended classified meetings on Syria this week, the sessions seem to raise more questions. Syria's rebels: 20 things you need to know . Hawaii Democratic Rep Tulsi Gabbard, a former Iraq war veteran, told reporters she was undecided and then ticked off remaining questions she had after a two-hour session with top administration officials. ""What are the unintended consequences? What are the outcomes? What are the next moves that could potentially occur that would involve U.S. interests, U.S military, costs - both in human lives, as well as in resources?"" Gabbard asked. A senior administration official told CNN that top officials reached out to more than 125 House members through a variety of conference calls and one-on-one conversations over the past two weeks. But the ""flood the zone"" White House approach hasn't prevented a steady list of members from voicing outright opposition or criticism that the case for military action is thin. The fact that so many members in his own party remain undecided or publicly opposed illustrates that Obama's political capital in Congress is quite low. California Democratic Rep. Judy Chu participated in a conference call with White House chief of staff Denis McDonough on Wednesday and remains undecided. While she said there's no question that the al-Assad government used chemical weapons she outlined a laundry list of outstanding questions. She wants details about contingency plans if Syria retaliates, the lack of international support, reasons why diplomatic efforts can't be explored, and the direct cost to taxpayers. Chu says her constituents ""overwhelmingly ... want me to vote 'no' on this."" She described House Democrats as ""war weary. We just came from Iraq and Afghanistan wars.  We are war skeptical,"" Chu said. Rep Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat who remained undecided, highlighted the stakes for Obama to change minds or persuade Democrats to back him on Syria. He called it ""certainly one of the most important speeches in his career as the president of the United States.""","Opposition or skepticism dominates House sentiment on proposed Syria strike .

"U.S. and coalition warplanes pounded ISIS positions in eastern Syria on Wednesday, targeting what a Pentagon official described as mobile oil refineries being used by the so-called Islamic State terror group to help finance its operations. The latest round of airstrikes were aimed at cutting off money flowing to ISIS, which makes up to $2 million a day from oil produced by the mobile refineries, Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, told CNN. Fighter jets from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates flew alongside U.S. aircraft during the operation, hitting 12 locations, Kirby said. While the U.S. military was still assessing the outcome of the attacks, Kirby said initial indications suggest the strikes were successful. ""We are very confident we hit what we were aiming at, and we caused the damage we wanted,"" he said. The airstrikes came just hours after U.S. President Barack Obama called for united action to confront ISIS, also referred to as ISIL. ""It is no exaggeration to say that humanity's future depends on us uniting against those who would divide us along fault lines of tribe or sect; race or religion,"" Obama said in an address before the U.N. General Assembly. ""This is not simply a matter of words. Collectively, we must take concrete steps to address the danger posed by religiously motivated fanatics, and the trends that fuel their recruitment."" China, Russia raise questions . Obama's call for action comes as questions were raised over his decision to bomb terror groups in Syria without approval from the U.N. Security Council. Even as the Security Council adopted a resolution drawn up by the United States addressing the growing threat posed by foreign fighters, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the world must act -- but only with U.N. approval. Airstrikes get Bill Clinton's approval . Russia's foreign minister warned ""against any attempt to narrow down the problem"" to select groups, urging the world not to have ""double standards in dividing terrorists into good terrorists and bad terrorists."" China and Russia, both permanent members of the Security Council, have blocked a number of attempts to force Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down as a way to bring about an end to the civil war that has since seen the rise of ISIS and other terror groups. Still, while the U.S.-led military action in Syria hasn't been widely embraced, those involved in the international coalition in Iraq is growing. The Dutch foreign ministry announced Wednesday that its military will contribute six F-16 fighter jets and 250 troops to carry out airstrikes and train Iraqi and Kurdish forces. Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders said his country's parliament will weigh a request for six of its fighter jets to take part in the bombing campaign. Similarly, British Prime Minister David Cameron said he's recalling Parliament Friday ""to secure approval for the United Kingdom to participate in the Iraq air campaign. ""The U.N. Security Council has now received a clear request from the Iraqi government to support it in its military action against ISIL,"" Cameron said from U.N. headquarters in New York. ""... So it is right that Britain should move to a new phase of action."" More airstrikes . The latest airstrikes against the refineries followed another round carried out overnight Tuesday into Wednesday against five more targets: four in Iraq and one in Syria, according to U.S. Central Command. In Syria, U.S. and coalition fighter jets struck an ISIS staging area near the Iraqi border, northwest of al Qaim, damaging eight ISIS vehicles. In Iraq, two airstrikes west of Baghdad destroyed two ISIS armed vehicles and a weapons cache. Two airstrikes southeast of the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil destroyed ISIS fighting positions. Conceding that airstrikes so far haven't flushed out ISIS in Iraq, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said that American air power may nonetheless have prevented the fall of Baghdad and Irbil to the militants. ""What we've done is we've stopped the onslaught,"" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. The airstrikes in Syria have also targeted ISIS' proclaimed capital of Raqqa. Share your view on the airstrikes . Activist: ISIS fighters keep low profile . An activist from Raqqa, who uses the pseudonym Maher al-Ahmad, told CNN he'd gone back to the town after the airstrikes. ""It's the first time I didn't see ISIS in the streets, that I was able to walk around, because I am wanted by them,"" said al-Ahmad, who moves between Raqqa and Turkey's Gaziantep province. He said people who were there during the strikes described them as feeling like earthquakes. Some 20 to 25 vehicles filled with ISIS fighters, including people he believes were senior leadership because of the level of security around them, left the city within hours of the attacks, the activist said. After keeping a low profile during the day, the ISIS fighters were out in the streets again by Tuesday evening but in lower numbers than usual, he said. ISIS fighters began moving into the homes of civilians in the past two to three weeks, al-Ahmad said, raising fears that the civilians may be used as human shields or fall victim to future airstrikes. Hassan al-Halabi, an activist from Aleppo, voiced similar fears, saying residents there have two main concerns about upcoming strikes in Syria. ""The first is that they are afraid of having civilian casualties because ISIS members and fighters are among civilians,"" al-Halabi said. ""And the second concern is that what will happen after that? Who will replace ISIS, especially that the regime is ready to take control of ISIS' areas?""","British Parliament -- like Belgium's -- will weigh request to participate in Iraq airstrikes .

"How big of a threat is ISIS really? The White House wants to find out and is deploying as many as 300 military advisers to Iraq to assess the might of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The jihadi group's rash battlefield successes make it look extremely fierce. ISIS militants have surged from the border with Syria to blitz major cities in Iraq's northern Sunni region, taking Tal Afar and Mosul, then moving quickly south.  Hundreds of thousands of civilians fled from their path, creating a new refugee crisis. They have advanced on Baquba, just north of Baghdad, and are threatening to attack the capital. The Obama administration has said there will be no more American boots on the ground after the drawdown of all American troops -- tens of thousands of them. It's up to the advisers to help Iraqi security forces vanquish ISIS on their own. Washington officials have said little about what they'll actually be doing, and expert opinions on that and on whether they should be in Iraq at all are split. Who are they? They are high-ranking officers. They are Navy SEALs and Army Rangers, said retired Marine Sgt. Adam Banotai. Banotai, who scrapped through the brutal battle for Falluja during the Iraq war, thinks the term ""adviser"" is misplaced. ""It is political semantics,"" he said. ""We are calling them adviser now ... instead of combat troops or boots on the ground,"" he said. ""They are the most elite fighters we have,"" he added. ""So, if they aren't going to be combat troops, I'm not quite sure who the President is going to refer to as combat troops."" Where will they be? ""They'll be sitting in offices, not out on the front lines, and they'll be looking at the maps,"" said retired Lt. Col. Douglas Ollivant. ""So, they're sort of holed up, giving advice,"" he said. It would be unwise to put them on the front lines, where ISIS could capture them. How will they work? The plan is for the advisers to divide into small teams of about a dozen each and partner with Iraqis to form joint operation centers, senior administration officials said. What will they do? Their job will be to gather intelligence, in case President Barack Obama decides to pull the trigger on airstrikes, a possibility he's weighing. The advisers will also pass on intelligence to Iraqi forces, said retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, who commanded U.S. forces during operation Iraqi Freedom. Baghdad tense as military seeks to halt ISIS militants' advance . Should they be there? That depends on whom you ask. Ret. Col. Doug MacGregor says no. He says it's a largely meaningless gesture. ""They'll be at risk,"" he said. He says he thinks sending them was the least bad of a list of bad options presented to the President, who felt he had to do something. Maj. Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks disagrees. The United States has to push back against ISIS, he said. How dangerous are the militants? MacGregor calls them ""semi-illiteral (illiterate) thugs driving around in pickup trucks with machine guns."" They won't pose a military threat to the United States, he said. ""They're occupied with decapitating Shiites and trying to establish an Islamist state in vast open stretches of empty, irrelevant desert."" Picking up on MacGregor's term, Marks said that ""Illiteral (illiterate) thugs"" have struck the United States before and could come again. ""We can't allow that to occur any more than it is right now in Iraq,"" he said. The group has shown signs of sophistication, publishing complex reports on its finances. It has recruited fighters from multiple countries and bonded with professional ex-members of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's armed forces. And Sunni tribal leaders have also joined their ranks. ISIS also holds much of the northernmost region of Syria. Kerry: U.S. would communicate with Iran, not work with it, against ISIS . Will the advisers' presence help? That's yet to be seen. Obama has said that his goal is  to prevent Iraq from becoming a haven for terrorists. Some have criticized him for not leaving a residual force in the country to prevent the type of invasion ISIS has mounted. But Obama is quick to point out Iraq's role in that choice by not protecting U.S. troops from Iraq's justice system in the event of bloodshed. ""The Iraqi government and Prime Minister (Nuri al-Maliki) declined to provide us that immunity,"" Obama said. Retired Sgt. Banotai feels iffy about Iraqi soldiers' commitment. When the ISIS jihadis overran the northern cities, many Iraqi troops put up little resistance and fled. ""I had friends over there who had the exact opposite experience where over 50% of a unit would desert at a given time and a firefight would happen and they would drop their rifles and run.""

"Japan's deputy prime minister stirred controversy this week by appearing to suggest that the government could learn from the way that Nazi Germany changed its constitution. The remarks by Taro Aso, who is also the Japanese finance minister, provoked criticism from Japan's neighbors and a Jewish organization in the United States. Aso, a former prime minister who has slipped up with verbal gaffes in the past, retracted the comments later in the week but refused to apologize for them or resign, saying they had been taken out of context. Amid persistent talk in Japan about revising the country's pacifist post-war constitution, Aso set off the controversy at a seminar Monday, in which he said that discussions over constitutional changes should be carried out calmly. ""Germany's Weimar Constitution was changed into the Nazi Constitution before anyone knew,"" he said in comments widely reported by the Japanese media. ""It was changed before anyone else noticed. Why don't we learn from that method?"" Aso added: ""I have no intention of denying democracy. Again, I repeat that we should not decide [constitutional revisions] in a frenzy."" In 1933, Adolf Hitler's National Socialists turned the democratic Weimar Republic into a dictatorship using ""a combination of legal procedure, persuasion, and terror,"" according to the U.S. Library of Congress. Hitler used a fire that burned down the parliament building as a pretext to suppress the opposition through an emergency clause in the constitution. He then pushed through the Enabling Act, which allowed him to govern without parliament and vastly extend the Nazis' grip on power. Words that hurt . Aso's apparent reference to those changes drew expressions of concern from the governments of China and South Korea, two countries that suffered heavily under Japanese imperial aggression during World War II, a conflict in which Japan was allied with Nazi Germany. Beijing and Seoul are already wary of Japan's hawkish prime minister, Shinzo Abe. His campaign platform for elections last year included measures aimed at restoring Japanese national pride such as revising the constitution to give the country's self-defense forces the status of a regular army. Abe's party now has control of both houses of parliament. But it remains unclear if he will take on the difficult, controversial challenge of constitutional change, which would require a two-thirds majority in both chambers. Hong Lei, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said Wednesday that Aso's comments mean that other countries need to step up their vigilance over the direction in which Japan is headed. China and Japan are locked in a tense territorial dispute over a set of small, uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that has fueled nationalist sentiments in on both sides. South Korea, meanwhile, called for ""prudence"" from Japanese political leaders. ""Such comments definitely hurt a lot of people,"" Cho Tai-young, a foreign ministry spokesman, said Tuesday. And the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization based in Los Angeles, demanded that Aso immediately clarify his remarks. ""What 'techniques' from the Nazis' governance are worth learning — how to stealthily cripple democracy?"" asked Rabbi Abraham Cooper, an associate dean at the center. ""The only lessons on governance that the world should draw from the Nazi Third Reich is how those in positions of power should not behave,"" Cooper said in a statement Tuesday. 'Great misunderstandings' Aso responded Thursday to the criticism over his comments, which also came from opposition lawmakers in Japan, saying he regretted that the remarks had ""caused great misunderstandings despite my true intentions."" He said that he had referred to the Nazi takeover of power as a ""bad example"" of constitutional revision because changes were forced through ""in a commotion.""  They should be done through calm debates instead. ""I believe it is obvious that I feel extremely negatively about Nazi Germany, if you consider the entire context,"" he said. ""However, since these remarks have caused serious misunderstandings, I would like to retract them."" Japanese Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference the same day that ""the Abe administration definitely does not view Nazi Germany positively and I am sure Vice Prime Minister Aso himself does not either."" It's not the first time Aso's words have gotten him into hot water. At a meeting about social security reform and healthcare costs in January, he caused offense by suggesting it would be best for people on life support to ""die quickly."" ""Aso's comment about Hitler and the implication that his example should be followed are utterly unacceptable,"" the Asahi Shimbun, a daily newspaper, said in an editorial Friday. "" The remark is not something that Aso can get away with by simply retracting it.""","At a seminar, the deputy prime minister refers to constitutional change under Hitler .

"(CNN) -- Passenger Jasper Schuringa told CNN that with the aid of the cabin crew, he helped subdue and isolate Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who was charged Saturday with trying to destroy a plane. Schuringa of Amsterdam, Netherlands, said he was traveling to Florida to visit friends. The journey aboard Northwest Airlines Flight 253 had been mundane, he said. But as the plane neared its destination of Detroit, Michigan, he heard a pop that sounded like a firecracker going off, and someone started yelling: ""Fire! Fire!"" Then, there was smoke. ""Around 30 seconds later the smoke started to fill up on the left side beneath this person,"" he said. That's when Schuringa said he knew something was wrong. ""I basically reacted directly. I didn't think. When you hear a pop on the plane you're awake, trust me,"" Schuringa said. When he noticed that Abdulmutallab was not moving, he grew suspicious. ""I was on the right side of the plane and the suspect was on the left side, there were quite some seats in between."" He jumped over the passenger next to him and lunged over Abdulmutallab's seat, ""Because I was thinking he's trying to blow up the plane, and I was trying to search his body for any explosives."" Schuringa said he saw that Abdulmutallab was holding a burning object between his legs. ""I pulled the object from him and tried to extinguish the fire with my hands and threw it away,"" Schuringa said. ""Water! Water,"" he said he screamed. He heard fire extinguishers as he pulled Abdulmutallab out of his seat. ""Just to be sure I grabbed him with another attendant and we took him to first class and there we stripped him and contained him with handcuffs and we made sure he had no more weapons, no more bombs on him."" Schuringa said Abdulmutallab seemed dazed. ""He was staring into nothing."" Schuringa said the incident sparked panic aboard the flight. ""The whole plane was screaming. The suspect, he didn't say a word."" We were holding [him,] but we wasn't struggling."" Schuringa said other passengers applauded as he walked back to his seat. ""My hands are pretty burned. I am fine,"" he said. ""I am shaken up. I am happy to be here."" Schuringa said he wasn't the only hero. ""A lot of people were trying to help later on,"" he said.

"After an in-person briefing from the staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, President Barack Obama on Tuesday announced a ""major increase"" in the U.S. response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The United States will send troops, material to build field hospitals, additional health care workers, community care kits and badly needed medical supplies. Countless taxis filled with families worried they've become infected with Ebola currently crisscross Monrovia in search of help. They scour the Liberian capital, but not one clinic can take them in for treatment. ""Today, there is not one single bed available for the treatment of an Ebola patient in the entire country of Liberia,"" said Margaret Chan, the World Health Organization's director-general. ""As soon as a new Ebola treatment facility is opened, it immediately fills to overflowing with patients,"" the WHO said. Hospitals and clinics in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- the countries hit hardest by the outbreak -- are overwhelmed by what the WHO is calling the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history. Ebola Fast Facts: Everything you need to know . The virus has killed at least 2,400 people, and thousands more are infected. And there are now cases in Nigeria and Senegal. ""The number of new cases is increasing exponentially,"" the WHO said, calling the situation a ""dire emergency with ... unprecedented dimensions of human suffering."" ""Men and women and children are just sitting, waiting to die right now,"" Obama said. ""This is a daunting task, but here's what gives us hope. The world knows how to fight this disease. It's not a mystery. We know the science. We know how to prevent it from spreading. We know how to care for those who contract it. We know that if we take the proper steps, we can save lives. But we have to act fast,"" Obama said. ""We can't dawdle on this one. We have to move with force and make sure that we are catching this as best we can, given that it has already broken out in ways that we have not seen before."" The CDC already has hundreds of professionals on the ground in what the President described as the ""largest international response in the history of the CDC."" Maj. Gen. Darryl Williams, commander of the U.S. Army Africa, arrived in Liberia on Tuesday.  Liberian leadership asked that the U.S. military step in to help support civilian efforts there. Williams will coordinate the military's efforts to improve logistics, to build additional field hospitals and to create what the President called an ""air bridge"" to bring in additional supplies and health care workers. The effort will be called Operation United Assistance. The new treatment centers may house up to 1,700 additional beds.  American military personnel in the region could increase by 3,000, administration officials said. The U.S. will also create a new training facility to help prepare thousands more health care workers to handle sick patients.  U.S. medics will train up to 500 health care workers per week to identify and care for people with Ebola. USAID will give 400,000 treatment kits with sanitizer and other protective items like gloves to families to help them protect their own safety as they care for sick relatives. The President also called on Congress to approve additional funding his administration requested to carry on these critical efforts to stop the virus. Obama added that ""faced with this outbreak, the world is looking to"" the United States to lead international efforts to combat the virus. He said the United States is ready to take on that leadership role. ""Here's the hard truth. In West Africa, Ebola is now an epidemic of the likes that we have not seen before. It's spiraling out of control,"" Obama said. ""If the outbreak is not stopped now, we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people infected with profound political and economic and security implications for all of us."" Washington has already committed more than $100 million to combat Ebola, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development. Last week, USAID said it would spend $75 million to build treatment facilities and supply them with medical equipment. The Pentagon says it's working to shift $500 million of not yet obligated funds toward the Ebola effort. Airborne Ebola? A nightmare that could happen . Public health campaigns will be broadcast through existing networks in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. 'Hundreds turn into thousands' The President's visit to the CDC comes amid escalating criticism from health experts of the global response to the outbreak in West Africa. U.S. officials hope a more coordinated response on the ground, put in place by the United States, will encourage other nations to step up their efforts. ""This is a global threat and demands a global response,"" Obama said. He added that the international community needs to move faster. Next week, the U.S. will chair an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to maximize the response to the Ebola crisis.  The White House will also bring more countries together to talk about future health threats. Tuesday, WHO announced that China dispatched a mobile laboratory team to Sierra Leone to help test for the virus.  The team of 59 from the Chinese Center for Disease Control includes epidemiologists, clinicians and nurses. This team will join 115 Chinese medical staff already on the ground in Sierra Leone. Opinion: How not to handle Ebola . Nongovernmental organizations that have been fighting this outbreak since its start reacted positively to Obama's announcement. ""The multifaceted response to the Ebola crisis announced today by President Obama is what we have been hoping for and what is needed in Liberia and West Africa,"" said Bruce Johnson, president of SIM USA. Two of the three American workers who contracted Ebola in Liberia and were evacuated to the United States for treatment work for SIM. SIM and other organizations such as Doctors Without Borders that have been working on the Ebola outbreak since the beginning have been asking for additional international help for months. ""Three things are vital right now: More beds and equipment, more trained medical professionals, and more training of Liberians and West Africans,"" Johnson said. ""This current plan addresses these desperate needs."" One of the doctors who had been working with SIM's clinic in Liberia when he became infected with the virus testified Tuesday in front of a joint hearing in Congress to look at ways to stop Ebola. Dr. Kent Brantly urged Congress to provide the extra funds to fight the  outbreak.  Earlier in the day he met with President Obama, who told him about the expanded U.S. efforts. Brantly said he thanked the President, and urged Congress to back this plan up with ""immediate action."" Ebola survivor donates blood to infected American . ""As a survivor, it is not only my privilege, but it is my duty to speak out on behalf of the people of West Africa who continue to face unspeakable devastation because of this horrific disease,"" Brantly said. He told the story about a patient named Francis who he believes may have been saved had the world acted sooner. The patient became infected after carrying a neighbor sick with Ebola to a taxi to get him to a hospital. ""If someone had gone alongside Francis and given him a little education and given him the equipment he needed, his family would have a father,"" Brantly said. Instead his patient died and the world lost ""this good Samaritan."" Brantly went on to respond to the analogy some have used to describe Ebola as a fire burning out of control. He warned, it is a ""fire. It is a fire straight from the pit of hell."" ""We cannot fool ourselves into thinking that the vast Atlantic Ocean will protect us from the flames of this fire,"" Brantly said. Move quickly, he urged, as it is ""the only way to keep entire nations from being reduced to ashes."" Could the virus mutate? There is also a concern about the possibility that the virus could mutate into an even more dangerous form. Ebola currently transmits only though contact with bodily fluids; a mutation that allows the virus to spread through the air would pose a catastrophic threat to people worldwide, health experts say. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that there was still a ""very low"" likelihood the Ebola virus could mutate in a way that threatens the United States. Can Sierra Leone's economy survive Ebola? ""Right now, the risk of an Ebola outbreak in the United States is very low,"" he said, ""but that risk would only increase if there were not a robust response on the part of the United States."" The President noted a number of precautionary steps that are being taken in the United States to prevent the disease from spreading here. The government has stepped up screening at West African airports. It has increased education for flight crews to teach them what to watch for with people who may be sick. It has worked with hospitals and health care workers to prepare them in case there is a domestic Ebola problem. Will it be enough? Ebola is more than a health threat to West Africa; it could become a ""major humanitarian crisis,"" according to United Nations Under-Secretary-General Valerie Amos, if it is not stopped soon enough. The United Nations said that many millions more will be needed to fight the outbreak.  U.N. leaders estimate they need $1 billion to fight the epidemic, with about half needed for the worst-hit country, Liberia. Political systems and infrastructure are fragile in the countries where the virus is concentrated. Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea  are still rebuilding their economies after suffering through years of civil wars. ""Now their capacity to deliver the necessities of daily life for their people is on the brink of collapse,"" Amos said. ""The Ebola outbreak poses a serious threat to their post-conflict recovery."" More people are believed to have died in these countries from secondary diseases like malaria and tuberculosis and from chronic illnesses and pregnancies with complications than from Ebola because the health care systems are so strained. Heavy rain adds to the risk of waterborne diseases like malaria. Food security has also become a problem. Quarantines keep workers from their jobs and have slowed the delivery of food to certain areas, according to the U.N. ""We must act now if we want to avoid greater humanitarian consequences in future,"" Amos said.","Doctor who survived Ebola says: ""It is a fire straight from the pit of hell""

"Russia looks richer in the snow. Muscovites, as they always have, stroll the main boulevard, Tverskaya Street, in their fur coats and hats on snowy evenings, basking in the holiday lights and decorations, their capital transformed into an icy wonderland. Moscow's coffee shops are full of young Russians still willing to pay 300 to 400 rubles for a latte. But the foreign currency exchange shops I pass are an ominous sign. Just a few weeks ago, 300 rubles was worth about $10. Now, it's about half that. Thursday, I exchange dollars for rubles and get a rate of 54.20. By Saturday it's 57 rubles to the dollar. Consumer prices are up about 8% from a year ago. Inflation is growing at its fastest pace in three years. In the food store where I used to shop, I search in vain for my favorite imported cheese. It's fallen victim to Russia's ban on dairy, meat, fruit, poultry, fish and other products imported from the West -- Moscow's retaliation for U.S. and European economic sanctions over its actions in Ukraine. Even the price of bread, which holds a near-sacred place in Russian popular culture, is rising. The business daily Kommersant reported that bread prices will increase 5% to 10% in the near future due to the rising price of ""flour, grain, sugar, foreign raw materials, packing supplies and transportation costs."" Food wholesalers want to adjust consumer prices more frequently, once a week instead of every 45 days, according to the paper. In Moscow's working-class neighborhoods, the falling ruble is reawakening old fears and old methods of coping with economic uncertainty. Some middle-aged Russians, who lived through the economic chaos of the early 1990s, are beginning to put away reserves of salt, matches, macaroni, flour and other staples. Middle-class Russians are buying TVs, cars and household appliances, convinced that prices after New Year's will be higher. ""Russians live one day at a time,"" a 40-year-old woman who works for a livery service tells me. ""We never know what the future will bring."" A new Russian poll shows that Russians are losing confidence in the future and are making plans for only a few months in advance. In that poll, by VTsIOM, 51% of those questioned said they are confident in the future, down from 61% in the spring of this year. Nearly half said ""life is difficult, but bearable."" The U.S. and Europe imposed economic sanctions in response to President Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine and Crimea, but Putin blames the West for trying to weaken Russia. His fellow citizens, by and large, agree; Putin's latest public approval rating is an overwhelming 82%. But some, especially among Russia's beleaguered political opposition, see a silver lining in the economy's woes:  the end, sooner or later, of the Putin regime. ""My prognosis? In three years the situation will change,"" Dmitry Stepanov of the liberal RPR-PARNAS Party told me at an opposition conference in Moscow. ""The country is in economic crisis and no one in the government knows how to solve that."" The economy will tank, Stepanov predicted, ""and this will elicit mass dissatisfaction among the public. That will activate political battles, and that will lead to a peaceful change of power."" Several people I spoke with at the conference said there's a perfect storm brewing that could sweep Putin from office: low oil prices resulting in plunging profits for Russia, Western sanctions, and a faltering economy. But no one I spoke with wanted that ""perfect storm"" to end in revolution. The conference, ""Crisis in Russia-E.U. Relations: Causes and Ways Out,"" was held on December 12, Russia's Constitution Day, and brought together approximately 200 members of the opposition along with some liberal European politicians. It was co-sponsored by Russia's liberal opposition party, RPR-PARNAS -- short for the Republican Party of Russia/Party of People's Freedom -- and the transnational European party, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. One of the hosts: Mikhail Kasyanov, co-leader of RPR-PARNAS, who served as minister of finance from 1999 to 2000 and as Russia's prime minister from 2000 to 2004. Putin fired him, along with his Cabinet, shortly before running for and winning a second presidential term. The current Kremlin policy, Kasyanov told me, is ""leading nowhere,"" and he predicted growing economic and political problems. ""We want to force the present leadership of the country, using pressure from society, to change its aggressive course in its international as well as domestic policy and abide by the Russian Constitution,"" he said. Just where that pressure will come from, however, is not clear. Historically, the opposition has been divided internally, and so far, Putin has most Russians on his side. One participant in the conference, who works in a nongovernmental organization and did not want her name used, told me that Putin won't willingly leave power. """"He will never leave of his own accord,"" she said, ""so somebody will have to help him. And they will do that once they are frustrated enough."" His inner circle, she said, could turn on him. ""They are Russians like everybody else, so their patience is very, very long,"" she told me. ""One day, however, it will crack. That's what I think. What it will take to crack, I don't know.""","Consumer prices in Moscow soar, ruble falls, some Russians stockpile essentials .

"(CNN)Manchester City and Ivory Coast football star Yaya Toure has called on the media to be more respectful in its attitude towards religion after the Charlie Hebdo attack. Twelve people were killed by brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi at the French satirical magazine's offices last week, with the gunmen reportedly yelling, ""We have avenged the Prophet"" while carrying out the attack. While Toure -- a Muslim himself -- advocates freedom of speech, he feels news outlets also have responsibilities. ""As a Muslim I always believe in the way people can say what they want to say,"" he told CNN's Amanda Davies. ""But for me, the most important thing is that we know something that sometimes the newspaper is doing a lot -- and they're trying to do too much, and sometimes they do it not with respect."" ""Everybody has his point of view -- everybody has something to say about that,"" Toure added. ""Of course it's a newspaper trying to say something. But sometimes it hurts people."" Depicting Mohammed is offensive to many Muslims and the magazine's past cartoons of the prophet apparently motivated the attackers in last week's slaughter. The City midfielder says he was disappointed to hear of the attack on Charlie Hebdo -- and he now fears for the safety of his Muslim friends in the French capital. Currently on international duty with Ivory Coast ahead of the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations which begins this week, Toure spent a season playing in the French Ligue 1 with Monaco in 2006-07. ""When you hear something like that it's a bit disappointing,"" he said, referring to the attack on the Charlie Hebdo office. ""I feel very sorry for the families -- they lost their friend, father, or their husband, you know. ""Of course I have a friend in Paris, I have people who I work with. You get a bit confused, a bit afraid, because, as a Muslim, I have a friend and they are Muslim as well and I'm afraid of what is going to happen."" The latest Charlie Hebdo issue has also been highly controversial, largely because on its cover is an illustration of a tearful Prophet Mohammed, holding up an ""I am Charlie"" sign accompanied by the words ""All is forgiven."" The new cover was met with mixed emotions -- with some calling it a bold example of free speech and others criticizing it as needlessly offensive to Muslims.","Yaya Toure believes newspapers must depict religion in a more respectful way .

"(CNN)After the deadly shooting at Charlie Hebdo, the message from one of the most decorated athletes in U.S. sports history -- who is Muslim -- was clear. ""Most Muslims do not become Muslims to indulge in murder and mayhem,"" Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the leading point scorer in NBA history, told CNN's World Sport on Wednesday. ""It's not what Islam is about. ""We try to live lives of peace and harmony within ourselves and with our neighbors."" Abdul-Jabbar -- also a best-selling author who was in London promoting a pair of new books including a fictional work about Sherlock Holmes' brother -- was speaking a week after brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi killed 12 people at the French satirical magazine. French media reported that the gunmen yelled, ""We have avenged the Prophet"" while carrying out the attack, referring to the Prophet Mohammed. Amedy Coulibaly, who reportedly had ties to the brothers, killed four hostages at a kosher grocery store two days later. Abdul-Jabbar, in a column for the website of Time magazine last week, said he was looking forward to the day when ""these terrorists praising the Prophet (Mohammed) or Allah's name as they debase their actual teachings are instantly recognized as thugs disguising themselves as Muslims."" He added to CNN that poverty or lack of opportunities in education are factors in people committing such acts. ""They become radicalized by the lack of opportunity and anything in their future that has any promise,"" he said. ""They embrace violence. They try to use religion as something to justify that. But nothing justifies that."" As someone who was in the public eye through sports, Abdul-Jabbar feels sports can play a role in bringing people from different backgrounds together. ""Sport absolutely plays a part in that,"" he said. ""When you spend all of your time trying to develop the talent for a sport and you see people doing the same thing from a different culture and you have the same interests, there's common ground there. ""And you can go from that to find more common ground. I think sport has gone a great way to doing that. Look at the U.S.-China relationship -- ping-pong was the thing that opened the door. A sporting event."" But Abdul-Jabbar also said it was down to the media to understand Islam better. ""I'd just like to see a better understanding by the media as to what Islam is all about as opposed to what the terrorists say it's about,"" he continued. ""I think that is the key issue here. Once those things get cleared up, I think we can make some progress.""","Kareem Abdul-Jabbar says ""most Muslims do not become Muslims to indulge in murder and mayhem""

"(CNN)Carrots have long been credited with helping you see in the dark -- now one rider believes they can help win Olympic gold. Italian Luca Moneta is one of the world's leading show jumpers but has been labeled by his peers ""The Carrot Man"" for his novel approach to training horses. Last year he won the ""Puissance"" event at the prestigious Olympia Horse Show feeding his horse Quova de Vains a carrot after every successful jump. And this year, he will return to the London event, which gets under way on December 16, in a bid to defend his title with the same methods he's honed in recent years. Of his alternative approach, Moneta admits the reaction was mixed: ""When you want to change something and you're too far from what they're doing you make people scared. ""And they were like 'this is silly, stupid, crazy. He doesn't know what he's doing. It doesn't work'. People were complaining. I think 99% of people were 'oh, oh, this is not good.'"" So what exactly is the 46-year-old's approach to the animals he rides? It is based on Parelli Natural Horsemanship, a program designed by American horseman Pat Parelli that used natural equine behaviors to communicate with and, hence, train horses. This, in itself, is based on ethology, the scientific and objective study of animal behavior. For Moneta, the first sighting of this more novel approach to riding and training horses came from watching an unnamed British rider on a clip jumping a barrel without a bridle. The Italian himself has likened his own program to teaching humans a new language. And rather than treating the horse as a beast, he treats them as equals and gets them to take the lead. ""If you make me cook spaghetti for you with a gun,"" he says by way of an analogy, ""you put a gun here and say 'if you don't cook spaghetti for me, I will kill you.' ""For sure you will have spaghetti but the quality is different than when I become your best friend and say 'I really want to cook spaghetti for you because this is my favorite dinner and we will enjoy spaghetti with a good bottle of red wine.' This is the difference."" He appreciates his attitude seems little short of insanity on the surface but his on-going results speak for themselves. Moneta fully accepts he was ridiculed for a time but, as his success continues, he expects others to follow suit. ""When they [the horses] choose to do the right thing, I will use a lot of positive enforce (sic). They were calling me the carrot man, it's not because I have a sponsor that sells carrots but because the horses love it. ""I think it's time [for this approach] because it's like with kids. You remember 40 or 50 years ago they gave you a cane on the hands when you did something wrong. ""When I started with horses, people were just hard with them. 'This is the animal, it must listen, I must be the leader, it must follow what I say, the big man that dominates the horse'. Now it's totally different."" Olympic spirit . He modestly downplays himself as a less capable horseman than many of his peers, instead crediting his results in the saddle to his approach in training. Despite his humble attitude, is an Olympic gold at Rio 2016 attainable? ""Why not?"" he says. ""There's always one that wins. It's not so difficult, you just need to beat all the others. I am a dreamer, always in my life, and I never quit dreaming."" On a personal level, this horse whisperer of sorts has recaptured his love for all things equine with his techniques when previously it had been on the wane. For him, it is simple horse play with or without the results in competition.","Luca Moneta is known as ""The Carrot Man""

"(CNN) -- Tuesday will bring a spectacle in the night sky worth staying up for when the moon turns a burnt reddish orange. The moon will begin to change color at about 1:58 a.m. ET Tuesday as it starts to slide into the Earth's shadow until it becomes a ""blood moon"" at 3:07 ET, NASA says. The best part of the show, the total eclipse portion, will last through 4:24 a.m. ET. The height of the event will take place at 3:45 a.m. ET. The big problem for potential viewers in the eastern United States will be the cloud cover, which is expected to hide the show from half of the country, save for cities on the coastline, which might be able to peek through. But cities including Dallas, Denver and Los Angeles should have optimal viewing. NASA said the entire event can be viewed by people in the Americas, while observers in the western Pacific will catch the second half of the event. The moon will be setting in most of Europe and Africa during the eclipse, so residents there probably won't see much. This one is just the first in a series of four consecutive total lunar eclipses. Within a year and a half, North Amerisca will be able to see a blood moon a total of four times. The moon takes on this color during the eclipse as it passes through the Earth's shadow, into which red light from the planet's sunrises and sunsets shines. According to NASA, the exact color depends on what is in the Earth's atmosphere. The four blood moons will occur in roughly six-month intervals on the following dates: April 15, 2014; October 8, 2014; April 4, 2015, and September 28, 2015. With that frequency, one might be misled into thinking that they are commonplace. What's up with the 'blood moon' prophecies? There are about two lunar eclipses per year, NASA says. Some of them -- penumbral, or barely visible, eclipses -- are so subtle, they go greatly unnoticed. Other eclipses just cast a partial shadow on the moon but lend it none of that brilliant sunset hue. Lunar eclipses -- penumbral, partial or umbral -- occur in random order, NASA says. Getting four umbral eclipses in a row is like drawing a rare lunar poker hand of four of a kind. Just like the poker players, astronomers have a name for that lucky draw. It's called a tetrad, NASA says. ""The most unique thing about the 2014-2015 tetrad is that all of them are visible for all or parts of the USA,"" longtime NASA eclipse expert Fred Espenak said in a prepared statement. In the 21st century, there will be many tetrads, but look back a few centuries, and you'll find the opposite phenomenon, Espenak said. Before the dawn of the 20th century, there was a 300-year period when there were none, he said. Zero. That would mean that neither Sir Isaac Newton, Mozart, Queen Anne, George Washington, Napoleon, Abraham Lincoln nor their contemporaries ever had a chance to see one. So, we're in luck. For gazing geeks, NASA has set up a live web chat to answer questions about the eclipse starting at 1 a.m. ET. Tuesday's blood moon comes right on time for the Jewish holiday of Passover, which commemorates the ancient Israelites' exodus from slavery in Egypt. According to the Bible, God cast 10 plagues upon the Egyptians, the final plague being the death of the firstborn. The Israelites painted lamb's blood on their doorways so that this plague would pass over their homes. Timeline of events . 12:53 a.m. ET -- The eclipse will officially begin but there will not yet be anything to see with the human eye. 1:40 a.m. ET -- Observers should start to see some partial darkening along the left edge of the moon that will increase as the minutes pass. 1:58 a.m. ET -- Partial eclipse begins: People will start to see the dark disk of the Earth's shadow crossing the moon. The shadow will advanced across the moon throughout the next hour. 2:50 a.m. ET -- As more of the moon becomes covered in shadow, observers should start to see parts of the dark shadow turn dark red or orange. 3:06 a.m. ET -- Total eclipse begins with the moon completely in the shadow of the Earth and should appear reddish orange. The blood moon has arrived. 3:45 a.m. ET -- Great eclipse: The middle of the total eclipse; moon should appear dark red/orange . 4:24 a.m. ET -- Totoal eclipse ends: Moon will begin to reappear from the shadow and coloration will begin to disappear. 4:45 a.m. ET - As more of the moon emerges from the shadow, the color should be mostly gone. What is left will appear black. 5:33 a.m. ET -- Partial eclipse ends as dark shadow completely leaves the moon, which will return to its normal look over the next 10-20 minutes. 6:37 a.m. ET -- Eclipse officially ends. Send us your photos of the moon to CNN iReport. CNN's Elizabeth Landau contributed to this report.","Just before 2 a.m. ET, people will start to see the Earth's shadow crossing the moon .

"(CNN)Two Los Angeles police officers were shot at Sunday night while they drove their patrol car in the southern part of the city, police said. The officers returned fire, authorities said, and no one was injured. One suspect was arrested and two weapons, including a rifle, were recovered. Another remains at large, prompting a manhunt that lasted for hours and involved about 100 officers, LAPD Capt. Lillian Carranza said. Police warned residents to stay indoors in part of South Central Los Angeles. On Monday, police reopened access to streets inside a six-block perimeter they set up overnight. LAPD Detective Megan Aguilar told CNN that investigators have ""nothing to indicate that there's a nexus"" between the shooting and recent nationwide protests against police brutality that have fueled animosity toward police. And there was a second incident over the weekend in which police were fired at, this one in Florida on Sunday morning. Someone fired three bullets at two deputies with the Pasco County Sheriff's Office as they sat in their patrol car. ""Both deputies reported hearing the whizzing sound of each projectile as they flew by,""  the sheriff's office said. ""Deputies did not see the suspect or the vehicle from which the shots were fired."" Crime Stoppers of Tampa Bay is offering a $3,000 reward for information leading to the person or persons who fired at the officers. Pasco County authorities are also searching for someone who spray-painted, ""Shoot MP Cop"" on a road barrier in Meadow Pointe, a subdivision. The latest incidents of shots fired at police come after New York police Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were gunned down in their patrol car on December 20. The gunman, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, then shot himself at a subway station. Earlier, he had posted angry messages on social media against police and government, citing the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, two black men killed by police. On Saturday, more than 25,000 police officers from across the country and even Canada attended Ramos' funeral. Liu's funeral will be January 4. Rookie police officer killed in Arizona .

"The overall documented death toll in devastated Syria has reached 92,901, the United Nations said Thursday. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay announced the figure, saying it was a result of an updated analysis carried out by specialists and covers the period between March 2011 and the end of April 2013. ""Unfortunately, as the study indicates, this is most likely a minimum casualty figure,"" she said. ""The true number of those killed is potentially much higher."" The analysis shows a dramatic increase in the average monthly number of documented killings since the beginning of the conflict, from around 1,000 per month in the summer of 2011 to an average of more than 5,000 per month since July 2012, according to the U.N. report. ""This extremely high rate of killings, month after month, reflects the drastically deteriorating pattern of the conflict over the past year,"" Pillay said. Nearly 83% of the documented victims are male, while about 8% are female. The genders of the others were not indicated. The report also tallies the deaths of more than 6,500 minors. More than a quarter of them were under the age of 10, the report said. The analysis was not able to differentiate consistently between combatants and noncombatants, and around three-quarters of the reported killings do not record the victim's age, according to the report.","More than 5,000 people a month are dying in Syria, the U.N. says .

"Caen, France (CNN) -- ""See what I'll miss?"" Princess Haya has been ambushed. The 40-year-old leader of one of the Olympics' biggest sports finds herself fending off British paradressage rider Lee Pearson. Pearson wears around his neck the three gold medals he has won at the World Equestrian Games in Caen, Normandy. As he leans in, medals dangling above the seated Haya's left shoulder, he announces: ""Now ma'am, I know you were quite good at showjumping and you might not have enough golds, so I thought I'd let you have a feel of my gongs."" This is what the princess will miss when, in December, she reaches the end of her two terms leading the FEI, which governs world horse sport. One of very few women to occupy such a prominent position within the Olympic movement, Haya is the subject of a warm, impromptu tribute from Pearson. ""She's brought inclusion from many countries that thought equestrianism was kind of elitist,"" says the 10-time Paralympic champion. ""She's kept us in the Olympics by making sure London was such a success, and she's modernized it. We're not riders, we're athletes."" Her Royal Highness Princess Haya of Jordan carried her country's flag at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, where she competed as a showjumper at the age of 26. Four years later she married Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, an equestrian endurance racing enthusiast. By 2006, he had become the prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and she had been elected to lead the FEI. Since then, much of her role has been to ensure equestrian keeps its place at sport's top table. Like wrestling, equestrianism claims roots extending back to the original Olympics contested by the ancient Greeks. Hence, when wrestling had a scare last year -- being temporarily voted off the program for Tokyo 2020, before reinstatement at a later International Olympic Committee (IOC) meeting -- there may have been grounds for concern at the FEI. ""I believe there were very specific issues around the decision for wrestling,"" says Haya. ""But I believe no international federation can consider that their place goes without saying. ""Very much the reason I came to the FEI, to try to modernize, was not the fact that my sport had got worse or gone backwards -- but other international federations had moved a lot faster than us. ""That spirit of competition, that commercially cluttered landscape really does exist. The international federations compete for their place at the Games just as much as the athletes do, and you have to guarantee that you really do have top sport."" Haya points to the World Equestrian Games (WEG) as evidence that the FEI is doing its job. The latest edition of the quadrennial event boasted more than a thousand horses and riders, from 74 countries. The FEI claims more than half a billion people saw at least some action from the eight competing disciplines. ""We've never had a larger event than this,"" she says. ""The growth that's happened over the past four years has made a marked difference. ""There is a larger percentage of non-purist spectators in the stands and we are able to export our sport to a new public. Our digital numbers have rocketed. Our athletes are not just performing for the family any more, they are performing for the world."" All of that will be taken to the table by Haya's successor -- six candidates have come forward -- the next time the IOC calls on its constituent sports to fight for their future. Haya believes the IOC is most likely to look at removing one discipline from a large sport in order to accommodate a new, smaller sport in Tokyo and beyond. She thinks the FEI's battle lies in protecting its three Olympic disciplines of dressage, showjumping and eventing. Not that the Olympic disciplines have always dominated Haya's eight years at the FEI's helm. Endurance racing, a lower-profile form of equestrian sport immensely popular in the Middle East, has provided the biggest threat to her presidency. The sport, in which horses can race a hundred miles in a day, has been troubled by a succession of doping scandals and concerns over animal welfare given the immense distance involved. Haya's position was called into question when her husband -- an endurance racing champion, an influential horse breeder and also the ruler of Dubai -- received a six-month doping ban in 2009. She has since been accused of failing to vigorously pursue perceived shortcomings in the discipline's approach to the wellbeing of horses. Haya, who handed oversight of endurance sport to colleagues over the conflict of interest involving her husband, says the issues are now being ""managed very well"" by the FEI. ""The sport has mainly come under criticism -- or the FEI has -- because it hasn't moved fast enough,"" she admits. ""But on the other side of that, there are processes and procedures put in place for a good reason. ""You can't have a knee-jerk reaction. You have to go through a period of dialogue and examine the situation from every side. They have been strong enough to do that and I think they've done everything they can to protect the horses, and the integrity of the sport."" For her part, Haya says she wishes she had ""had a lighter hand in some situations"" in the earlier days of her time in charge. And as regards her unusual position as a leading woman in world sport, she believes examining gender equity only in the highest echelons of power means searching in the wrong place. ""I think a lot is done to help women get to these positions but for me, what is missing is the avenue to come up through the grassroots,"" she says. ""For me it was easy. I had my career as an athlete, I rode in an Olympic Games, then I had interaction with the national federations. I understood how it worked, and I went through a pathway. ""What's missing is that opportunity for women at grassroots level in other sports. While you had the opportunities at the top, there is still very much a vacuum in between. ""I think in many ways it's harmful that we have this permanent crusade, that we 'have to have women.' It makes it sound like you got the job because you're a woman, rather than being able to do the job properly. ""There's a big difference between a person who merits doing the job and happens to be a woman, and one who gets the job just because she is."" The FEI's vote to replace Haya in three months' time will determine the sport's course for at least the next four years. With organizations associated with the Middle East accounting for a number of equestrianism's major backers, brought in through Haya and her connections, there is uncertainty as to how the financial future will pan out if and when her influence wanes. She, however, has already promised herself more time for two other interests in her life. In a statement turning down the chance to stand for a third term, the mother-of-two listed first her family and then humanitarian work, in Gaza, as her new priorities. ""I felt the president should only have an eight-year term and I still feel that is important,"" says Haya, who had at one time announced her intent to seek a third term -- a move some considered ""undemocratic"" despite a majority of national federations backing the necessary rule changes. ""As president, you have to do a 12-hour day, it's a full-time job, and it's only really possible to do that for eight years until you do run out of ideas,"" she says. ""The sport is bigger than any international federation ever will be. Sometimes, you get the feeling the world revolves around you. I've always known that if we stop, the sport never will. It's worth knowing that.""","Princess Haya steps down as leader of world horse sport this winter .

"Mark Sanford is living proof that life is full of second chances. The former Republican governor of South Carolina, whose political career was left for dead along the Appalachian Trail after an extramarital affair, asked for, and Tuesday received, political redemption as he won a special election to fill a vacant House seat that he once occupied. ""I want to acknowledge a God not just of second chances but third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth chances, because that is the reality of our shared humanity,"" Sanford said at his victory celebration after defeating his Democratic opponent, Elizabeth Colbert Busch. ""I am one imperfect man saved by God's grace."" 5 things we learned from Sanford's win . And at a news conference minutes later, Sanford added that ""I think we're always on the search for redemption and I think this is certainly a degree of political redemption."" Sanford, who won 54% to 45%, according to an unofficial vote count in South Carolina's 1st Congressional District, made reference to his political baggage from his infamous affair. ""If it was just about market-based ideas and limited government, this campaign would have easily won a long time ago. But I had deficiencies that are well chronicled as a candidate and at the end of the day I was carried across the threshold, if you will, by an incredible team of volunteers."" Colbert Busch, an official with Clemson University's wind turbine drive testing facility who was best known nationally as the sister of satirist and Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert, said that, ""The people have spoken and I respect their decision."" But she added that ""We gave it a heck of fight"" and assured supporters that ""I will continue to fight for the people of South Carolina."" Sanford won all five counties in the district, including Charleston and Beaufort, home to Hilton Head, where some Democrats hoped that older voters would be turned off by Sanford's scandals and just stay home. In Charleston County, Sanford's home base but the Democrats' best hope as well, he narrowly edged out Colbert Busch. Colbert Busch won absentee ballots, but it wasn't nearly enough to carry her to victory. Sanford: Primary win was 'a big referendum' on comeback effort . ""Turnout was very large for a special election -- roughly a quarter of the 18-plus population voted, more than 140,000 votes total,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland, who analyzed the vote. ""That seems to have helped Sanford.  Low turnout would have meant a lot of Republicans who were reluctant to vote for him and wouldn't vote for a Democrat. High turnout turns that around: Plenty of Republicans who had misgivings about Sanford came out to vote anyway."" Sanford's oldest son Marshall and his now-fiancÃ©e Maria Belen Chapur were standing beside the candidate at his victory celebration. ""She flew a continent to be here last night. Whether I won or lost, she wanted to be here,"" Sanford said Wednesday mornign on CNN's ""Starting Point."" ""We certainly appreciate her willing to do so, and I think as folks get to know her, I think they're going to love her."" Sanford was in his second term as governor in 2009 when he disappeared from public view for several days. At the time his staff claimed he'd been hiking the Appalachian Trail. He later admitted that he was actually in Argentina, seeing Chapur, with whom he was having an affair. The episode sank any hopes Sanford had of making a bid for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination. Sanford and wife Jenny were divorced in 2010. He finished his second term as governor in January 2011, after being censured and fined tens of thousands of dollars for ethics violations, exiting to what many thought would be political obscurity. But he came back, beating out 15 other candidates earlier this year to win the Republican nomination in the race for the vacant House seat. From the start, Sanford was very open about the affair on the campaign trail and made it the subject of his first TV ad. And even with all his political baggage, he was considered the favorite in the race until last month, when court documents revealed his ex-wife had filed complaints against Sanford for trespassing on her property. Sanford told CNN that he didn't want to leave his sons home alone while their mother was away. He's scheduled for a court appearance two days after the election. Not long after the trespassing story broke, the National Republican Congressional Committee announced it was pulling out of the race and national Democratic groups announced they were throwing more money into the contest. And National Democratic groups jumped in. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and independent pro-Democrat House Majority PAC combined dished out nearly $1 million to defeat Sanford. The two groups, as well as Colbert Busch, highlighted the affair. At their only general election debate, Colbert Busch brought up Sanford's 2009 secret trip to Argentina to see his mistress. ""When we talk about fiscal spending and we talk about protecting the taxpayers, it doesn't mean you take that money we saved and leave the country for a personal purpose,"" she said sternly, looking directly at her opponent on stage. In South Carolina politics, two very different campaign styles . And her campaign went up with a TV commercial which slammed Sanford for using ""tax dollars to visit his mistress in Argentina, disappeared for a week leaving no one in charge, betrayed all who trusted him, then lied to cover it up. Mark Sanford, it's a question of character."" The DCCC and House Majority PAC have also spotlighted the affair in their final ads. ""I used to be for Mark Sanford, but not any more. He skipped town to be with his mistress on Father's Day. Sanford even asked his wife for permission to have the affair,"" said Mt. Pleasant Republican voter Jennifer Stark in the House Majority PAC commercial. But over the past month, another woman also entered the campaign spotlight: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Sanford and his campaign repeatedly tried to tie Colbert Busch to Pelosi, saying that a vote for Colbert Busch would also be a vote for Pelosi, who has high negatives with Republican voters and who most likely would become House speaker again if the Democrats run the table and regain control of the chamber in next year's midterm elections. Opinion: Zombie politicians find new life after disgrace . ""I've fought hard over the years to make South Carolina a better place to call home. But those efforts pale now against the larger battle for the direction of our country. Maybe that's why Nancy Pelosi and allies have spent more than a million dollars to defeat me. But this contest is bigger than them or me, it's about two different visions of how we restore America and reign in Washington spending,"" Sanford said, looking into the camera in a TV spot that started running district-wide last week. Two weeks ago he even debated a cardboard cutout of Pelosi to call out Colbert Busch for not accepting more than one debate. Sanford also repeatedly brought up the money that national Democratic groups have poured into the South Carolina race. ""What it says is, whose voice do you carry when you go to Washington D.C.?"" he said in the debate with Colbert Busch, pointing to the hundreds of thousands of dollars that national Democratic groups have spent on the race. Colbert Busch, responding to the Sanford criticism, sought to distance herself from Washington and from national Democrats. ""No one tells me what to do except the people of South Carolina's 1st Congressional District. So a victory for Elizabeth Colbert Busch is a victory for the people of South Carolina's 1st Congressional District,"" she told CNN Monday, adding that two-thirds of her contributions have come from within the Palmetto State. While Sanford touted his fiscal conservative record, Colbert Bush campaigned as an independent centrist who would buck President Barack Obama. In her CNN interview, she highlighted where she doesn't see eye to eye with the president. ""I respectfully disagree with his budget,"" she said, adding that ""we need to vote to repair"" the president's health care law. Even though they didn't support Sanford, the NRCC congratulated him Tuesday night, and said the results could prove troublesome for House Democrats in 2014. ""Democrats spent more than $1 million trying to elect a candidate who was backed by the Democrat machine, but at the end of the day, running on the Obama-Pelosi ticket was just too toxic for Elizabeth Colbert Busch,"" Rep. Greg Walden, NRCC chairman, said in a statement. But national Democrats see a silver lining in Colbert Busch's defeat. ""House Republicans' outreach to women voters now has Mark Sanford as the face. Republicans now have to defend him and stand with him until Election Day,"" Rep. Steve Israel, DCCC chairman, said in a statement. ""In this deep red Republican district that Mitt Romney won by 18 points, the fact that the Democrat made this competitive is a testament to the strength of Elizabeth Colbert Busch as a candidate and the Republican habit of nominating flawed candidates."" Sanford has a woman problem . The congressional seat became vacant when Rep. Tim Scott, who won re-election by 27 percentage points last November, was picked by GOP Gov. Nikki Haley to fill the Senate seat of Sen. Jim DeMint, who stepped down late last year to take over as the head of the conservative Heritage Foundation. No Democrat has held the seat in more than 30 years, and that streak still stands.","Sanford wins comeback race with about 54% of the vote .

"It's a brief reprieve for hundreds of Syrian civilians trapped for months in a besieged city. The Syrian government and opposition have agreed to extend a truce in Homs by another three days, the United Nations said. ""I hope this will allow us to evacuate yet more civilians and deliver much needed additional supplies,"" said Valerie Amos, the U.N. humanitarian chief.  ""The protection of civilians caught up in this horrendous conflict in Syria is the greatest priority for U.N. agencies and humanitarian partners."" More than 800 civilians have been given safe passage out of the city since the deal was put in place Friday, she said in a statement. Syria's Red Crescent tweeted that a group of around 300 people were taken to safety early Monday. Parts of Homs have been under siege since June 2012. Under fire in Homs . The U.N.-brokered truce has been violated several times. Vehicles from the Red Crescent and United Nations had a difficult time entering the city over the weekend as they were targeted by gunfire and explosives. Eleven people were killed as the operations were being carried out, said Amos. ""People seeking refuge and those carrying out humanitarian operations should not be fired on,"" Amos said in a statement . ""U.N. and Red Crescent workers told me that many of the people who left Old Homs were traumatized and weak. They also said that they witnessed terrible conditions at the field hospital in the Old City, where the equipment is basic, there are no medicines and people are in urgent need of medical attention."" Social media video from inside Homs captured some of the chaotic scenes as desperate people lined up for a chance to leave. One clip shows dozens of residents sitting or standing around several U.N. vans.

Another part of the same video shows a woman looking desperately for her lost son. ""How can I leave without him? He is my son,"" she says and screams out his name. Homs is just one of 40 besieged communities in Syria, according to the U.N.'s World Food Programme, which says about a quarter of a million people have been cut off from humanitarian aid for months. The conflict has claimed more than 100,000 lives and displaced millions more since it began in 2011, creating a major humanitarian crisis within Syria and for its neighbors. New Round of Peace talks . As the regime and opposition swapped accusations over the truce violations, Syria's warring sides began a new round of peace talks in Geneva. United Nations envoy Lakhdar Brahimi met with the Syrian opposition Monday morning before separate talks with government representatives. The second round of talks center around the formation of a transitional governmental body and the cessation of violence. The opposition delegation said each side would meet with Brahimi separately until the U.N. envoy decided there was common ground for joint discussions. The first round of talks ended some 10 days ago, with no firm agreements and bitter statements from both sides. The government insists that the talks focus on fighting ""terrorism"" -- its description of the uprising -- but the opposition says the priority should be the removal of President Bashar al-Assad. The opposition has insisted that the government commit in writing to the 2012 Geneva I communique, which called for the formation of a transitional government. Al-Assad's government has ruled out any transfer of power. Brahimi will meet with high-level Russian and U.S. diplomats in Geneva this week, the U.N. said Monday. He will meet with Russian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Gennady Gatilov and U.S. Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman on Friday, the U.N. said without providing more details. In a separate development, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons announced a third shipment of chemical weapons material from Syria had taken place. It said the material was on board a Norwegian cargo vessel accompanied by a naval escort from China, Denmark, Norway, and Russia.

"When I rode the No. 7 train to Citi Field last Sunday, I was one of the few women in a train car packed with Hasidic Jews. My knees were in full view, but I shielded my face behind a pair of shades and a copy of Christopher Hitchens' atheist bible, ""God Is Not Great,"" held conspicuously aloft. Toward the end of our shared journey, when it had become clear that the only people left on the train were headed to the same event, I looked up from my book, removed the sunglasses and asked the men sitting across from me if they were there to protest the Internet or the abuse. Taken aback, they looked at me for a moment before answering ""both."" They did not recognize me as Deborah Feldman, the author of the controversial memoir about the life I fled as a Hasidic woman. Some 60,000 ultra-Orthodox men had gathered to discuss the dangers that prurient elements of the Internet present to their community. They were probably unaware of the planned counterdemonstration, which was being organized by a good friend of mine named Ari Mandel. He's a fellow ex-Hasidic Jew, who, like me, felt compelled to protest the rampant injustice and abuse covered up within the Hasidic and ultra-Orthodox worlds, some of which we had seen or experienced firsthand. After exiting the train and lingering in the parking lot for a moment, persona non grata because of my female status, I was approached by an erudite-looking Jew, who asked what I was doing there. He claimed that I couldn't possibly understand what the rally was about, that the event was for men only. Reporters inched closer, extending mikes and cameras. People seemed to think something juicy was going to happen. I opened my mouth to talk, and suddenly I felt a surge of adrenaline, the kind that makes your knees all shaky, fuel my words. It was my first time standing face to face with a man who represented my former oppressor. What I said boiled down to this: I am horrified that religious Jews would spend millions of dollars on a rally to protest an unstoppable force such as the Internet instead of focusing their attention on the real problems their community is facing, such as the sexual abuse scandals that are now public knowledge. The Internet can never be stopped, but parents and kids can be educated as to how to use it, just like in the real world. Instead, I argued, the ultra-Orthodox were just trying to bury their heads in the sand and ignore the real problems by waving a giant distraction in front of it. I spoke with emotion because five minutes later I would join a group of people across the street, some of whom were formerly Hasidic or Orthodox, and others who were still part of the community, but had summoned the courage to speak for the voiceless, all of whom had suffered or witnessed some form of abuse at the hands of the religious leadership. We held signs that said, ""The Internet Is Not the Problem,"" or ""The Internet Didn't Molest Me,"" because we felt outraged that real problems were being ignored while the community spent millions on a gathering designed to deal with the ""evil"" of the Internet. The fact is that some Hasidic and Orthodox Jews continue to ostracize victims of abuse and support their abusers, and they offer no apology for doing so. They continue to deprive young men and women of vital education necessary for a successful and happy future.  And both insiders, who are afraid to speak out, and people who've left, feel that this is the case. It is no longer possible to pretend we don't exist. To those who remained across the street, both physically and metaphorically, we called, ""You're on the wrong side!"" Ours was the very power that the Orthodox rally was protesting, the power that the Internet gives to the lowly people and takes away from the rabbinic leadership. However, there is a new threat that the Hasidic community has to be concerned about, and this one is greater than the Internet.  The Hasidic community is endangered by their own members, for those who have been betrayed and abused are now brave enough to speak; they will no longer be bullied into silence. The discussion has begun, and it has begun publicly, in the media. Clearly, Hasidic communities feel threatened, as evidenced by the recent post in xoJane titled ""What Women's Media Needs to know about Chassidic Women."" This essay was ostensibly written by a Hasidic woman in response to the media attention focused on the Citi Field spectacle. It has sparked a controversy both in the comments section and on forums such as Metafilter, a backlash that I felt compelled to join (and blog about). The article enraged many of my peers, some of whom are religious, because it replaces what could have been a sensitive personal essay about Judaism with a whitewashed version of Hasidic life. Chaya, the author of this article, assures us that she is a media professional with a degree in women's studies from a liberal college. Sadly, Chaya omitted the most crucial details about her identity, namely that she is a member of the most liberal Hasidic sect (Lubavitch) and that she is a Ba'al Teshuva, which translates as someone who returned to the faith. So a woman who resided on the most liberal end of the spectrum in the most tolerant of all Hasidic sects, who had chosen this way of life after she had already had access to a secular education, wrote an essay on behalf of all Hasidic women across the global spectrum, telling women's media that all is glorious and wonderful in their world. She made sweeping claims on behalf of Hasidic women: They all love their husbands, enjoy following the laws of marital purity and are safer from cervical cancer as a result. She also reduced all non-Hasidic women to a coke-snorting and skinny jeans-wearing caricature. Words cannot adequately describe the depth of my disappointment regarding this woman's attempt at public relations. She said she felt compelled to write this in the wake of negative media attention, but she could have opted for a thoughtful essay on how she had come to choose her spiritual path and why it made her feel so fulfilled. She could have shared her personal journey without diminishing the pain and suffering of women who hadn't been consulted before she put pen to paper. If Hasidic women can summon the moral fortitude to face up to the cracks in the foundation of the lifestyle, they can perhaps work toward repairing it, and create a healthier, happier environment for their children to grow up in.","Some 60,000 Orthodox Jewish men gathered in stadium to discuss Internet's moral dangers .

"(CNN)Social media rode roughshod over traditional football transfer etiquette as Wilfried Bony completed his $42.5 million move to Manchester City from Swansea. Hours after pictures of Bony holding aloft a City shirt emerged on Twitter, the English Premier League champions have finally confirmed the signing of the Ivorian striker. Bony, who scored more EPL goals than any other player in 2014, is currently with the Ivory Coast national team preparing for the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations, which begins in Equatorial Guinea on Saturday. And it was the Ivory Coast Football Federation which prematurely broke news of the transfer by posting the picture on Twitter, sparking a spiky response from Bony's now former employers Swansea. The Welsh club insisted the deal had not been completed, but now its EPL rivals City have announced the capture of the 26-year-old on a four-and-a-half-year deal. ""It's a great feeling for me, it's a big honor to be here and it's a great challenge,"" Bony told City's official website. ""As a player it's always good to be part of one of the biggest clubs in the world and it's a good opportunity for me to be in that situation now -- I'm really proud. ""I felt excited to wait for this moment and now it's come, it's fantastic."" Bony joined Swansea from Dutch team Vitesse in 2013 and has forged a reputation as prolific goalscorer. He scored 15 EPL goals in his debut season and has found the net nine times in the current campaign, including one against his new team in November. The move sees Bony join forces with his international teammate Yaya Toure, who has been with City since 2010. ""I speak with Yaya every day on international duty and I think he will help me to become a better player and a more clinical striker,"" added Bony. ""I'll be playing with great players here at City and this is an opportunity for me to work hard and to take my chance."" City will be hoping Bony can produce the goals that will help Manuel Pellegrini's team maintain the Premier League crown and succeed in the European Champions League. Bony will be expected to fill the hole left in the team by Sergio Aguero, the Argentine who has scored 14 league goals for City this season but who is currently sidelined through injury.","Wilfried Bony joins Manchester City from Swansea City .

"President Obama denied an accusation on Sunday that he had misled voters about his signature health care law in order to get it passed in 2010. ""We had a yearlong debate. I mean, go back and look at your stories,"" Obama told reporters at the G20 summit in Australia Sunday. ""The one thing we can't say is that, 'we did not have a lengthy debate about health care in the United states of America' or that it was not adequately covered."" ""The fact that some adviser who never worked on our staff expressed an opinion that I completely disagree with ... is no reflection on the actual process that was run,"" Obama said. The comments the President referred to were made by Jim Gruber, an MIT health care economist, who noted in a 2010 speech that he ""helped write the federal bill"" and ""was a paid consultant to the Obama administration to help develop the technical details as well."" In a series of speeches that have recently regained attention, Gruber says that engineers of the law, including the administration, took advantage of voters' ""stupidity"" in order to get the measure to pass. ""Lack of transparency is a huge advantage,"" Gruber said in a panel discussion at the University of Pennsylvania in 2013. ""And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever. But basically that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass."" ""(I wish) we could make it all transparent. But I'd rather have this law than not,"" he said. In another video, Gruber calls the strategy an ""exploitation"" of the American voter. ""It's a very clever, you know, basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter,"" Gruber said at the Honors Colloquium 2012 at the University of Rhode Island. Obama vehemently denied Sunday that his administration was anything but transparent regarding the creation of the law and the debate that surrounded its implementation. ""I would just advise every press outlet here: Pull up every clip and every story. I think it's fair to say there was not a provision in the health care law that was not extensively debated and was fully transparent. It was a tough debate,"" Obama said. ""Now, there were folks who disagreed with some of these various positions. It was a tough debate,"" he added . The latest video is the sixth of its kind to emerge of Gruber detailing the political process behind the creation of the Affordable Care Act. In the video, Gruber explains how 'mislabeling' the law helped the administration get rid of tax breaks. ""It turns out politically it's really hard to get rid of,"" Gruber said at the Pioneer Institute for Public Policy Research in Boston. ""And the only way we could get rid of it was first by mislabeling it, calling it a tax on insurance plans rather than a tax on people when we all know it's a tax on people who hold those insurance plans."" On Friday, former White House press secretary Jay Carney told CNN's Jake Tapper that Gruber's remarks were generally ""very harmful politically to the president."" ""This is not good,"" Carney said. ""(He) speaks from the ivory tower with remarkable hubris about the American voter and by extension the American Congress."" Carney and his former boss aren't the only Democrats distancing themselves from Gruber's remarks. On Friday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said she didn't even know who Gruber was, despite having formerly cited him on her website when she was House majority leader. ""I don't know who he (Gruber) is. He didn't help write our bill,"" Pelosi said at a press conference. ""With all due respect ...  you have a person who wasn't writing bill our bill commenting on what was going on when we were writing our bill who has withdrawn some of statements that he made.""","President Obama: Administration was transparent with voters in Obamacare debate .

"For the first time in more than two decades, the United States has granted official recognition to the Somali government in Mogadishu. ""There is still a long way to go and many challenges to confront, but we have seen a new foundation for that better future being laid,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Thursday in a joint news conference with Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, who stood beaming at her side. Clinton praised Somalia's actions in reducing the level of extremism since she took office in January 2009, when ""Al Shabaab controlled most of Mogadishu and south and central Somalia, and looked like it would gain more territory."" Al Shabaab is a militant Islamist group with connections to al Qaeda. Somalia was plunged into chaos after dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991. Following his ouster, clan warlords and militants battled for control, sparking a civil war and mayhem nationwide. Somali Islamists kill French hostage . The nation since then has mostly been under shaky transitional federal governments. But the final transitional federal government made ""unmistakable"" progress, Clinton said, with Somali security forces supported by an African Union mission and troops from Uganda, Burundi, Kenya and Djibouti driving Al Shabaab from the nation's cities and towns. ""Al Shabaab has been driven from Mogadishu and every other major city in Somalia,"" she said. Even as they were fighting extremists, the country's leaders were working to create a democratic government, and have done so -- with a new president, a new parliament, a new prime minister and a new constitution, she said. Mohamud was elected president in September. Clinton noted that the United States supported the changes, providing more than $650 million in aid to the African Union mission in Somalia, more than $130 million to the country's security forces, nearly $360 million in emergency humanitarian aid over the past two years and more than $45 million in development-related assistance to help rebuild the economy. In addition, U.S. largesse has provided more than $200 million in aid for Somali refugees throughout the Horn of Africa, she said. With recognition, Somalia now can participate in certain foreign assistance programs, including military training and financing programs, the State Department said. Ship crew rescued after 1,000 days . Clinton, who is soon to step down from her job leading the State Department, vowed that the two countries will continue to work closely together as they confront the ongoing threat of extremism in the region. ""The terrorists, as we have learned once again in the last days, are not resting, and neither will we,"" she said. ""We will be very clear-eyed and realistic about the threat they continue to pose."" She said she looks forward to the re-establishment of a permanent U.S. diplomatic presence in Mogadishu. The news conference came shortly after President Barack Obama met with his Somali counterpart at the White House, a meeting that Clinton described as ""a very strong signal to the people of Somalia of our continuing support and commitment."" Mohamud acknowledged that his country is ""emerging from a very long, difficult period"" marked by instability, extremism and piracy, and is moving toward an era of peace and development. ""We are aiming to make a valuable contribution to the region and the world at large,"" he said. He described the past 22 years as ""difficult times"" during which ""the United States has always been the country that never left Somalia."" He credited U.S. intervention in the early 1990s with having saved more than 300,000 Somali lives. ""Had that intervention not been there, it would have been difficult and different today -- the situation in Somalia,"" he said. Clinton said Somalia's emergence as a democracy has changed its relationship with the United States: ""We have moved into a normal sovereign-nation-to-sovereign-nation position and we have moved into an era where we are going to be a good partner, a steadfast partner, to Somalia as Somalia makes the decisions for its own future.""","""The terrorists ... are not resting, and neither will we,"" Hillary Clinton says .

"Celeste Ng may want to prepare for a deluge of attention from the literary set. Her debut novel, ""Everything I Never Told You,"" just topped Amazon's list of the 100 best books of the year. ""We loved it,"" said Amazon editorial director Sara Nelson. ""This book is a gem. It's beautifully written, it's pitch-perfect. ... It's a bit of a sleeper, but a beautiful one."" ""Everything I Never Told You,"" which was released in late June, concerns an Asian-American family in Ohio. Their star student daughter Lydia has just died, found in the bottom of a nearby lake, and the family is torn apart trying to figure out what happened. In a rave review, The New York Times Book Review praised the book's freshness. ""If we know this story, we haven't seen it yet in American fiction, not until now,"" wrote Alexander Chee. There are a number of well-known authors on Amazon's list -- Stephen King's newest, ""Revival,"" came in at No. 6, and David Mitchell's long-awaited ""The Bone Clocks"" was No. 14 -- but Nelson recognizes that singling out Ng could make her book a best-seller as well. ""It's thrilling to see that picking a book like this can actually make a difference, that people now will know about it who did not know about it before,"" Nelson said. The selection was made by six people on Amazon's editorial team who lobbied one another furiously but tried not to let outside forces -- including reviews from major literary publications -- influence their choices, Nelson said. The site picks best books monthly, so with those winners, as well as others on their radar, the group started with about 150 choices. Nelson added that business politics are also kept away from the process. Amazon has been involved in a months-long dispute with Hachette, a major publishing firm that owns such imprints as Little, Brown and Grand Central Publishing. ""No one has said anything to me, ever, about choosing by publisher, even amidst this Hachette business,"" Nelson said. ""Nobody called me up and said, 'You're in trouble, you put Hachette's books on this list.'"" She added that she keeps an open mind. There are a number of titles on the list, including ""The Bone Clocks,"" Jodi Picoult's ""Leaving Time"" and Lena Dunham's ""Not That Kind of Girl,"" that have earned their share of brickbats from critics. Some choices are unanimous, Nelson said, and others benefit from some strong votes. ""A lot of this job is being able to evangelize for the books that you love. I've had people on my team that love something that I'm so-so on, and sometimes they speak about it so passionately that it makes me go back and read the book,"" she says. ""And sometimes I agree with them and sometimes I still don't agree with them. ""It's a democracy,"" she chuckles, ""but I sort of guide a little bit.""","Celeste Ng's ""Everything I Never Told You"" tops Amazon's 2014 best books list .

"(CNN)If Usain Bolt ever takes up figure skating, he will know how Kauto Star feels. The 14-year-old racehorse, one of the greatest steeplechasers of all time and a two-time Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, made his dressage debut at London's Olympia Horse Show on Tuesday. Dressage, which involves horse and rider working together to produce a complex ""dance"" routine marked by judges, is how Kauto Star has been spending retirement since his last National Hunt race in 2012. Laura Collett, a leading British event rider, has been helping the horse to learn the intricacies of a sport that rewards precision and poise above power and pace. ""He's changed shape a lot since we got him,"" Collett told Horse and Hound magazine in the build-up to Kauto Star's demonstration dressage test at Olympia. ""He hadn't done any flat work at all. But he's got a brilliant temperament and he's very willing. He got the hang of it very easily. ""He needed to soften his whole body -- he was just used to going in a straight line. So he's done a lot of gymnastic exercises and things to supple him up. ""He tries really hard. When you've taught him something once, he remembers it. The hardest thing for him was the canter -- he only really knew about going fast."" Having spent a career streaking past thousands of spectators lining a racecourse, Kauto Star appeared a little unprepared for an indoor arena crowd as he took his first, dainty dressage steps at Olympia. ""It's the crowds being up high and so close, it's quite intimidating,"" Collett told the BBC afterwards. ""He didn't show himself off to the best of his ability -- he got a bit of stage fright and shut down. ""Most horses who come into an arena like this have been doing it for eight or 10 years, and build up gradually. He's been thrown in at the deep end."" Kauto Star is not in contention for Rio 2016. Britain has one of the world's leading dressage teams and no matter his racing pedigree, there simply isn't the time to bring him up to the required standard. Instead, dressage is seen as a way to offer the horse an interesting retirement -- although that wasn't met with universal approval when the decision was made, two years ago. Owner Clive Smith sent Kauto Star to Collett's Wiltshire yard in December 2012, against the wishes of the horse's longtime trainer, Paul Nicholls. The dispute over the horse's future brought to an end a partnership responsible for almost a dozen major victories on the racecourse, a career bettered only by 1960s legends Arkle and Flyingbolt. Now, by contrast, Collett says there is ""no pressure"" on Kauto Star to perform to any standard in his new sport. ""The main thing is the horse is happy and relaxed,"" she said this week, ""and he has a varied lifestyle.""","Steeplechasing great Kauto Star shows off some moves in his new sport, dressage .

"(CNN)Japanese officials want to talk to ISIS. But can they get in touch with the militant group? And if they do, can they do anything to save the lives of two Japanese men being held hostage? Time is running out: ISIS put out a video Tuesday giving the Japanese government 72 hours to pay $200 million, or else Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa -- like other ISIS captives before them -- will be killed. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Wednesday that his government estimates the deadline will come at 2:50 p.m. Friday, Tokyo time (12:50 a.m. ET). Until then, he said, Japanese officials are trying to save them. Suga said his government will do its utmost to communicate with ISIS on the fate of Goto and Yukawa through a third party, such as another nation's government or a local tribe. He didn't say whether Japan would be willing to pay any ransom. Absent such a private back-and-forth, the Japanese official voiced his government's stance publicly, including its defense of a proposed aid package, also tabbed at $200 million, to help those who are ""contending"" with ISIS, according to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Abe has defended the aid package as needed to build up ""human capacities, infrastructure and so on,"" yet ISIS denounced it anyway in its recent video. ""Japan's measures are absolutely not intending to kill Muslim people, unlike what the hostage takers claim,"" Suga said Wednesday. ""We strongly urge them not to harm the two Japanese nationals and immediately release them."" Q&A: Harsh realities of ransom, kidnappings . Goto and Yukawa were last seen months ago, disappearing in the same part of the world. While they had different professions, the two knew and talked to each other, said Yukawa's friend Nobuo Kimoto. It was January 2014 when Kimoto met Yukawa, who told him about his dream of providing security for Japanese ships in dangerous areas, such as waters off Somalia sometimes plagued by pirates. Three months later, Yukawa headed off to Syria to gain combat and survival experience, Kimoto said. There, Yukawa met the man ISIS refers to as Kenji Goto Jogo (who goes by Kenji Goto on Twitter and in a photograph accredited to him). Goto is a freelance journalist who has worked for various Japanese news organizations, including reporting about the northern Syrian battleground city of Kobani, which for weeks has been under siege by ISIS, and other areas. Goto gave Yukawa insights on how to survive there, Kimoto said. He also introduced him to rebel fighters -- distinct from ISIS, even though both were fighting against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces -- some of whom talked about their need for ambulances to shuttle the injured. That plea spurred Yukawa to start raising money for this cause after returning to Japan, according to his friend Kimoto. ""I felt a chill when he said, after returning home, (that) he felt in Syria he was really living a life,"" Kimoto said. ""He seems to have felt satisfaction being there and living together with the locals."" He went back to Syria in July -- a trip that Kimoto said he didn't know about at the time. Kimoto said he had advised Yukawa to focus on building up his Private Military Company, which provided armed security services and posted videos online of his activities in Iraq and Syria. Yukawa, 42, went missing and was captured sometime after that. Goto met the same fate. While it's not known exactly when he became a hostage, his last Twitter post was on October 23. Alaaeddin Al Zaim worked as a fixer for Goto. Speaking to CNN in Turkey, he said the journalist had reached out to him about going into ISIS-controlled territory. ""I am not American, I am not British. I'm Japanese. I can go,"" Goto told the fixer. Fixers help reporters travel and connect with local contacts. Al Zaim refused, believing the trip was too dangerous. Another fixer agreed to take Goto to ISIS, Al Zaim said. Before he left, Goto made a short video -- which CNN saw -- in which he explained his decision to travel was his, and his alone. Goto gave Al Zaim his phones, and a list of numbers. ""He gave me this and asked me to call Japanese wife, his wife in Japan, his friends in Japan. After one week, if I don't hear any news of them or any connection, I have to call them,"" said Al Zaim, who remembers seeing Goto for the last time on October 25. After a week, he said, he hadn't heard from Goto and so he made the call to his wife.  Al Zaim, who described Goto as his brother, praised his reporting work. ""He is the best journalist I met him, and I work with him because he (doesn't) like military stories. He covered, every time, civilian and kids stories in Syria. ""And also he is very strong. Anytime he want to do his job very well ... Sometimes we are going to danger(ous) places, he (isn't) afraid. He tell(s) me: 'This is my job. I am journalist. I have to do that.'"" CNN could not immediately confirm the details of what Al Zaim said. What happens next for both men is up to ISIS. Unfortunately, it doesn't have a record of showing much mercy. The Islamist militant group has been behind mass killings and kidnappings during its years-long campaign to take over vast swaths of Iraq and Syria, attempting to justify its actions -- like enslaving and having sex with young girls -- as somehow consistent with its extreme, conservative faith. Taking hostages from outside countries has been part of its playbook. Not only has ISIS beheaded many of them, but it's made a show of it by recording their deaths and showing them online as propaganda, something that began in August with the killing of U.S. journalist James Foley. Those beheaded hostages were American and British, both from countries involved in a military campaign against ISIS. Japan is allies with both, though it is not participating in any airstrikes or the training or outfitting of those fighting the militant group. Tokyo's stance on the conflict, including the $200 million pledge that Abe made Sunday, was apparently enough to draw the ire of the group that calls itself the Islamic State. ""Although you are more than 8,500 kilometers away from the Islamic State, you willingly volunteered to take part in this crusade,"" said the masked man who stood over Goto and Yukawa in Tuesday's video, addressing his comments to Abe. Who is 'Jihadi John'? Abe has responded by defending the proposed aid and blasting ISIS' threat against two of his nation's citizens as ""unacceptable."" ""I feel angry about it,"" he said Tuesday. ""I strongly urge them to immediately release the hostages without harming them."" CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki reported from Tokyo, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this report from Atlanta. CNN's Will Ripley, Gul Tuysuz, Jethro Mullen and Junko Ogura contributed to this report.","Japanese official says Japan is trying to talk to ISIS through a third party .

"(CNN)Fox News firebrand Bill O'Reilly agrees. So does Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer. Even conservative kingpin Rush Limbaugh has something in common with the thousands of protesters flooding American streets with anger over the grand jury decision in the Eric Garner case. They all think the grand jury got it wrong. It was enough for the satirists at NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" to poke a little fun at civil rights icon Al Sharpton, who has found his world suddenly turned topsy-turvy will all the new allies in the Garner case. ""What the hell is going on?"" an actor portraying Sharpton said on Saturday's program. ""Last night I was sitting in front of my TV, and I found myself saying, 'You damn right, Bill O'Reilly.' I'm all messed up!"" And it's not just O'Reilly. In contrast with another high-profile case involving brutality complaints against police -- the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri -- a solid majority of Americans disagree with the New York grand jury that declined to charge Officer Daniel Pantaleo in Garner's death, according to a Bloomberg Politics poll released Sunday. 'Week of Outrage' gets underway . According to the poll, 60% of Americans feel the grand jury made the wrong decision. Twenty-five percent of respondents said they agreed with the decision. The backlash -- both from conservative commentators and the public -- is different from the reaction to the recent grand jury decision to forgo charges against the white police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, a much more widely reported incident. In that case, a majority of Americans agreed with the grand jury, although opinions were split firmly along racial, and often political lines. According to the Bloomberg poll, 52% of Americans -- including 64% of whites -- sided with the grand jury's findings. Thirty-six percent disagreed, including 78% of African-American respondents to the poll, which was conducted December 3 to December 5 and has a margin of error of three percentage points. A CNN/ORC poll found similar divisions in the Ferguson case. In that poll -- conducted before the grand jury decision was announced -- 54% of non-whites said Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson should be charged with murder. Among whites, 23% shared the same feeling. Washington Post writer Aaron Blake said the poll results in the Garner case show it is ""the turning point Ferguson never was."" ""In the Garner case, there is a video, leading to less debate about the particulars of precisely what happened,"" Blake wrote in a piece published Monday. ""As this poll shows, that is much more conducive to building consensus. And when it comes to taking action in response -- action of any kind -- that kind of bipartisan and biracial consensus makes it significantly more likely,"" he wrote. Not so fast, said Jason Johnson, a political science professor at Hiram College in Hiram, Ohio. ""Acknowledging something is wrong is not the same as doing something about it,"" he said. He said conservative pundits who have ""cherry picked"" the Garner case aren't likely to stand arm-in-arm with protesters demanding reforms. But what of the poll results showing more Americans take issue with the Garner decision? That's where Johnson sees change coming, but not with Garner's death as the catalyst. Political and demographic changes have been driving those changes for years, Johnson said, ever since the Rodney King case roiled Los Angeles and the nation after police officers were taped beating King as he rolled in agony on a Los Angeles street following a high-speed chase. Trust in police has fallen in recent years, he said, citing poll results that particularly show a decline in trust among African-Americans. Meanwhile, the country has become more diverse. Those changes will eventually force a change in how police do their work, Johnson said. What the Garner case could do, he said, is move the national conversation past what some consider to be the overly simplistic suggestion that police body cameras will solve everything. ""The changes we're going to see now, if there are any, are going to have to be much more substantive and much more on the ground,"" he said.","Polling, pundit reactions, suggest outrage over Eric Garner case is widespread .
Conservative icons join protesters in criticizing grand jury decision .
But political science professor says he doesn't think that means the case is a watershed ."
"It started with a baby. Within minutes, dozens of teenagers and children staggered into an emergency room on the outskirts of Aleppo, Syria. Rola Hallam, a British Syrian doctor, describes what she saw there in late August while working with the charity Hand in Hand for Syria. ""We had had, you know, over 30 who had arrived, all within about 10 or 15 minutes, all with just heartbreaking, extensive burns,"" she said. The patients were victims of an August 26 attack in Awram al-Koubra, outside Aleppo, where eyewitnesses described incendiary like devices being dropped from a government fighter jet onto a private residence, and then a school. Incendiary bombs are not chemical weapons, but their effects can be just as devastating. Syria: Chemical weapons team faces many dangers, says U.N. chief Ban . They are identified as ""any weapon or munition which is primarily designed to set fire to objects or to cause burn injury to persons through the action of flame, heat, or combination thereof, produced by a chemical reaction of a substance delivered on the target,"" according to the United Nations. British emergency doctor Saleyha Ahsan describes them in less clinical terms, in the terms of her patients. ""The descriptions were fire falling like rain, just falling like rain, plumes of flames and then balls of flames falling out of the sky,"" she said. ""Their clothes had just been stripped off them from the power of heat and the incendiary device, covered in burns and some of them very shocked and quiet, and not sure where they were and what was going on."" Read more: Refugees inside their own war-torn country . The day of the attack, she, Hallam and others treated about 40 victims, some of whom suffered burns over 80% of their bodies. By chance, the doctors were filming with the BBC's Panorama program to highlight medical conditions in Syria. The cameras kept rolling as patients poured in. 'I wanted their faces seen' The video is disturbing to watch. It shows people sitting on the floor, their skin peeled and hanging like ripped clothes. 'I felt like I was in a horror show or something on a movie set. It was so surreal,"" said Hallam. ""All walking in, with a really bewildered look on their face, an absolutely awful smell of burning flesh mixed with a very weird synthetic smell that I've never smelled before."" WMD: From A-bombs to pressure cookers . Eights students died in the attack and 50 other people suffered burns, according to the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry, which investigates alleged violations of human rights law in Syria. It will issue a report next month. The United Nations says more than 100,000 people, including civilians, have been killed since the start of the country's two-year-old civil war. Conventional, not chemical weapons, are believed to be responsible for the vast majority of those deaths. Both Hallam and Ahsan said they would expect very few of their patients to survive for any amount of time. ""I wanted their faces seen,"" Hallam said. ""I wanted the whole world to know that what is happening in Syria is happening, and I don't want anyone to say I never knew because you all know. And the world needs to act.""","Eyewitnesses of the attack: Incendiary like devices dropped from a government fighter .

"President Barack Obama exhorted Iraqi leaders to come up with a political solution to governing their nation because ""if they don't, there won't be a military solution to the problem,"" he told CNN in an interview Friday. Obama wants to see Iraq create a command structure that includes Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds, which are the country's chief groups, he told CNN's Kate Bolduan. ""We gave Iraq the chance to have an inclusive democracy,"" Obama said on the eve of U.S. military advisers arriving in Iraq to help the government besieged by militant extremists. Sunni militants have crossed over from northern Syria to blitz major Iraqi cities. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have fled from their path, creating a new refugee and political crisis. The militants, called the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, are an al Qaeda splinter group. Supported by many Sunni factions, the ISIS fighters continue their fierce advance in Iraq, threatening Baghdad. Senior U.S. officials say the Obama administration is of the belief that Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is not the leader Iraq needs to unify the country and end sectarian tensions. His government is dominated by Shiites. The first of up to 300 U.S. military advisers will arrive in Iraq as soon as Saturday, a senior defense official told CNN on Friday. This first group from outside Iraq is expected to be very small, the official said. Meanwhile, some U.S. military personnel already in Iraq at the security cooperation office in the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad will be reassigned and become the first of the advisers to go to work, Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said. The first group of advisers will begin work by conducting an initial assessment of Iraqi troop capabilities and on what may be needed for a larger group of U.S. advisers, including additional security measures where they may be deployed, a senior defense official said Friday. The Pentagon has identified two preliminary locations in Baghdad and northern Iraq for proposed joint Iraq-U.S. operations centers, but those locations are not being disclosed because of security concerns, the official said. The United States withdrew its final troops from Iraq at the end of 2011, nearly nine years after leading the invasion that ousted longtime leader Saddam Hussein. On Friday, fierce fighting continued between suspected ISIS fighters and Iraq security forces and their recruits in northern and northeastern Iraq, with casualties on both sides.","Obama says Iraq's leaders must come up with a political solution .

"(CNN)Michael Brown's stepfather consoled the dead teen's distraught mother after Monday's controversial grand jury announcement and then turned to the crowd of demonstrators, saying, ""Burn this motherf---er down"" and ""Burn this bitch down,"" according to a New York Times video. The comments by Brown's stepfather, Louis Head, came shortly before an eruption of rage by some protesters over the decision not to indict police Officer Darren Wilson in the August shooting death of 18-year-old Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. A row of businesses on West Florissant Avenue, a major thoroughfare in the St. Louis suburb, was engulfed in flames Monday night. Police cars and vehicles at a nearby dealership were turned into fireballs. There were so many blazes that firefighters couldn't reach every one. In The New York Times video, Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, is visible in the crowd Monday night in Ferguson. McSpadden speaks to the crowd briefly, saying she has lived in the community her whole life and never experienced anything like this. ""I don't do nothing to nobody,"" she said, crying uncontrollably and placing her hands over her face. Head comforts her before his outburst. Shouts of ""F--- the police"" can be heard from the crowd. CNN is trying to reach Head for comment. His words were markedly different than those of Michael Brown Sr., who recorded a public service announcement last week, saying that ""destroying property is not the answer."" And Monday night the family released a written statement that read, in part: ""We respectfully ask that you please keep your protests peaceful.  Answering violence with violence is not the appropriate reaction. Let's not just make noise, let's make a difference."" St. Louis Alderman Antonio French told CNN Tuesday that he was nearby when Head made the statements. ""I think he was expressing a sentiment that a lot of folks in that crowd felt and when he said those words, the mood did change and things got a little bit out of control,"" French said. ""There is such anger and emotion around this case."" But French questioned what he said was the ""incredibly poor choice"" by authorities to announce the grand jury's decision at night. He said there were no police officers or National Guardsmen patrolling one of the hardest-hit stretches on West Florissant Avenue. At a news conference Tuesday, an attorney for the Brown family, Benjamin Crump, said the Times video captured the couple's  ""desperation and frustration"" over the grand jury decision not to indict Wilson. Crump said videotaped remarks by Michael Brown's stepfather were inappropriate. But Crump said not to condemn him for being human. ""God forbid your child was killed ... and then they get that just devastating announcement in the manner it was announced, and somebody put a camera in your face,"" he said. ""What would be your immediate reaction?"" The family ""understands we all have a responsibility to protect the community,"" Crump said. ""Nobody is going to condone violence,"" he said. Ahead of the announcement about the decision, the Brown family had urged people not to react with violence and destruction. Their attorney said the violence that took place on the streets of Ferguson overnight was ""completely inappropriate."" Brown's parents were expected to speak at Tuesday's news conference but later decided not to do so. Crump said Brown Sr. ""doesn't want to misspeak because of such emotions that are going through him that will later be used against him.""

"(CNN) -- Most horses at this month's World Equestrian Games could clear the water jumps. Not Norman. Plunging head-first into a water feature he hadn't even seen, Norman lost an entire hoof in the accident. Luckily, the eight-foot mascot -- Norman was named after Normandy, the French host province of the Games --had a spare hoof on hand. Norman's soaring popularity may have outstripped his jumping capabilities, with replica plush-toy versions almost impossible to find by the end of the two-week Games in Caen, but there were plenty of contenders ready to demonstrate how water should be handled. Driving is the sport to pick if you want to see horses navigate water. The sport, not seen at the Olympics, sees teams of four horses pull an old-fashioned carriage through a series of tests to determine a winner. The most visually appealing of those tests is the marathon, in which the driver and horses must face a time trial across a course involving miniature mazes, lakes, hills and other hazards. The driver is by no means alone: in the marathon, two teammates ride on the back of their carriage, shifting their weight as though riding a superbike rather than a souped-up stagecoach. Nobody drives a carriage quite like Boyd Exell. The Australian has now won three world titles in a row, mastering not only the marathon but also the driven dressage (fancy moves determine how harmonious your horses look) and the obstacle test (steer your team through sets of cones, losing marks for any you hit). You cannot fault the World Equestrian Games for the variety on offer. Take a stroll for 10 minutes from the carriage driving and you come to the Games village, an array of shops and stalls with an equestrian theme. Ambitious spectators could be found heaving saddles around the village having been inspired to impulse buy, while local horses bustled between the shoppers, offering rides or even helping to transport equipment. These are the literal workhorses of the World Equestrian Games -- toiling in the comparative shadows while illustrious cousins, some worth tens of millions of dollars, strutted to the beat in packed adjacent venues. Music is surprisingly integral to much of horse sport. Dressage, the discipline which tests how well a horse and rider work together through a series of intricate moves, has long culminated in a freestyle routine where rousing music, pitched perfectly and matched meticulously in every movement, can win you a world title. But vaulting, too, makes the most of a melody. Vaulting is gymnastics on the back of a horse, a sport where athletes clad head-to-toe in spandex perform handstands, leaps, cartwheels and more on top of a horse cantering in a 20-metre circle. ""Music choice is really difficult,"" said Britain's Joanne Eccles, who defended her vaulting world title in France this past week. ""I had quite a struggle trying to find something I could work to, that looked good when I did it."" Eccles ended up settling for a selection from famed French stage show Les Miserables, with musical numbers a common theme among competitors. ""With it being from a French musical, for me it brings together the fact that I'm here in France, and I can be a bit emotional and bring together all of my vaulting,"" said Eccles. The atmosphere after she finished? Anything but miserable, as organizers married the finesse and delicacy of equine gymnastics with a bombastic sound system and frenzied announcers. Hundreds of schoolchildren screamed in unison to welcome each vaulter. France's Anne-Sophie Musset could barely contain her pride as dozens of French flags waved jubilantly back at her, following her final routine. Patrice Delaveau knows that feeling, too. The French showjumper shouldered the hopes of the host nation on the final day of the Games. Showjumping takes on a rare format at the World Equestrian Games -- the Final Four, a contest in which the leading four athletes must master their rivals' rides to win the gold. First, you ride your own horse around a shortened set of jumps, aiming to do so within a specified time limit. Then, unusually, you must complete the same course on each of the other three finalists' horses. Perhaps one of the most embarrassing fates in equestrian sport -- aside from being Norman the mascot, stepping soggily from a water jump-- is to mess up the showjumping on your own horse, only to see someone else do a better job of riding the same animal. Step forward Sweden's Rolf-Goran Bengtsson, who clattered into a fence on his own ride (Casall Ask) then had to watch Dutchman Jeroen Dubbeldam horse whisper his way to a clear round on the same horse. The last gold medal of the Games came down to a straight fight between Dubbeldam and Delaveau, who had overcome the sudden death of his brother Stephane, earlier in the year, to reach the highest level of showjumping in the world. The stage had been set for an emotional victory for the Frenchman, in front of a deafening crowd inside Caen's soccer stadium. Yet one time fault -- the narrowest possible margin -- denied Delaveau the win. His fractionally tardy round aboard Casall Ask (again the culprit) saw Dubbeldam, who went clear on all four horses, add individual gold to his earlier team title. A dominant week for the Dutch ahead of the Rio 2016 Olympics. If we began with Norman, the final word goes to another surprising candidate on four legs: a dog named Journey, who set a record at an event for a different species. Sydney Collier, a paradressage rider from the United States, brought Journey on the journey as her service dog. Journey required a special pass to head inside venues with Collier, hence becoming the first accredited canine in World Equestrian Games history. Happily, Journey avoided the water jump.","The FEI Games took place in Normandy, France .

"An Emirati woman arrested on suspicion of fatally stabbing a U.S. teacher in a bathroom at a United Arab Emirates mall also is accused of placing a handmade bomb in front of an American doctor's house, the country's interior minister said Thursday. Police arrested the woman, identified only as in her 30s and a UAE national, Interior Minister Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan said. More details about the arrest weren't immediately available. According to a diplomatic source, the woman arrested was of Yemeni origin and had traveled back and forth to Yemen ""multiple times."" The woman was arrested about 48 hours after the attack. She is being interrogated by Emirati authorities and the investigation into the incident is ongoing, the source said. Police said a veiled woman stabbed American schoolteacher Ibolya Ryan, 47, during a fight in a restroom at the high-end Boutik Mall on Reem Island on Monday. The alleged attacker was fully covered, donning an abaya -- a black, full-length gown traditionally worn by Emirati women -- black gloves, a face cover and a hijab, or head scarf, police said. She fled the mall after the attack. Police believe Ryan, who was the mother of three children, did not know the attacker, Al Nahyan said. The U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi issued a statement, back in October, warning U.S. citizens of an anonymous Internet post that encouraged attacks against teachers at American and other international schools. The embassy was unaware of any specific, credible threat at that time, but called on citizens to be vigilant about their personal security. Teacher remembered for compassion, dedication . Just a few months after her arrival in Abu Dhabi, Ryan offered enthusiastic advice to other teachers considering working abroad. ""I would say be positive, open minded, flexible and take every challenge as a learning experience,"" she wrote on the website of Footprints Recruiting, which placed her in Abu Dhabi. ""Also be thankful that you are able to have the experience of working abroad; I think at the end it makes you not just learn about others but also about yourself."" Ryan was born in Romania, held Hungarian and American citizenship and had been a dedicated teacher for 17 years, according to a Footprints Recruiting profile of her. In September 2013, she began teaching in Abu Dhabi, where she lived with her 11-year-old twin boys. Before that, she taught special education students in Colorado, Footprints Recruiting CEO Ben Glickman said. Ryan, known as Iby to her friends, was very enthusiastic about the UAE and her work at an Emirati public school, Glickman said. ""She was getting immersed in the culture and talking about learning Arabic,"" he said. ""She thought this was a good experience for her children and she was having a good experience as well."" Glickman, who described her as a ""compassionate and warm person,"" said employees in the UAE were ""shaken"" over Ryan's death, but waiting for the results of the investigation. ""People obviously want answers, but are withholding judgment until we get further information,"" he said. Interior minister: Attacker wanted to create chaos . Surveillance video released by police shows the moments before and after the mall stabbing.  A veiled figure that police identified as the attacker walks calmly in through a parking lot entrance, speaking to security guards, picking up a paper and disappearing around the corner out of sight. The video later shows the suspect running to an elevator and then leaving the mall through the same parking lot doors. Reem Island is a newly developed area of Abu Dhabi where many Western expatriates live. Later Monday, the suspect placed a primitive bomb in front of a house where an American Muslim doctor lives, said Al Nahyan, adding that authorities had video of the event. The doctor's son saw the object and called police, Al Nahyan said. Police defused the device. Investigators believe that the attacker wanted to create chaos and spread fear, Al Nahyan said. He didn't discuss possible motives beyond that or say what led police to the suspect.","Slain American teacher is remembered for compassion and dedication .

"The National Institutes of Health admitted a patient with exposure to the Ebola virus to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland Thursday afternoon ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the NIH said. The patient -- an American nurse who volunteered at an Ebola treatment unit in the West African nation of Sierra Leone -- ""has been admitted to the NIH Clinical Center's special clinical studies unit that is specifically designed to provide high-level isolation capabilities and is staffed by infectious diseases and critical care specialists,"" the federal medical research agency said in a statement. ""NIH is taking every precaution to ensure the safety of our patients, NIH staff, and the public. This situation presents minimal risk to any of them."" The NIH hospital outside Washington is one of a handful in the United States specially equipped to treat patients with highly infectious diseases like Ebola.  NIH said that it wouldn't be divulging any additional details about the patient at this time. U.N. 'concentrating' on Sierra Leone . The vast majority of the more than 18,000 confirmed and suspected cases, and the more than 6,500 deaths, in the latest Ebola outbreak have been in West Africa, according to the World Health Organization. And at more than 8,000 cases, Sierra Leone has had the most cases of any country. The United Nations' point man on Ebola briefed reporters Thursday on his recent trip to the stricken region. ""In Sierra Leone, in the east of the country, transmission has reduced,"" said Dr. David Nabarro. ""(But in) the west of the country, there is intense transmission and we're concentrating on that area."" Overall, however, Nabarro was encouraged by the improvements he saw since his visit in September. ""(I'm) confident that we're going in the right direction."" Several people who have been treated at American hospitals were first diagnosed with the virus in the region. There have been some exceptions, like Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan, who was diagnosed at a Dallas hospital, where he died. One of the nurses who treated Duncan, Nina Pham, caught Ebola and underwent treatment at the National Institutes of Health facility in Maryland. The NIH declared her Ebola-free in late October. Nabarro said he was ""delighted"" by Time Magazine naming Ebola fighters as the publication's 'Person of the Year.' ""People working on this response -- thousands of people, from the region and outside -- really are amazing,"" he said. ""Putting their lives on the line, continuing the effort, sometimes they just want to stay because they feel they can't stop until the job is done.""","The NIH admits patient who was exposed to Ebola .

"The United States says it has carried out airstrikes and dropped humanitarian aid in the Iraqi town of Amerli to protect an ethnic minority that one official says faces the threat of an ""imminent massacre."" The town of Amerli, which has been besieged by ISIS fighters, is home to many of Iraq's Shiite Turkmen. To help the trapped people, the United States has carried out humanitarian airdrops, Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said late Saturday. Australia, France and the UK also participated in the aid drop. The U.S. military conducted ""coordinated airstrikes"" against ISIS targets as part of an effort to support the humanitarian operation, Kirby said. Video released by the Iraqi Ministry of Defense was strikingly similar to the scenes of the dire situation faced by the Yazidis, who were trapped on the Sinjar Mountains by ISIS, earlier this month. Dozens of people crowded helicopters, hoping to be rescued. Scores more awaited the arrival life-saving supplies in the scorching summer sun. ISIS fighters have surrounded Amerli, 70 miles north of Baquba, since since mid-June. The town's fewer than 20,000 residents are without power. ""Residents are enduring harsh living conditions with severe food and water shortages, and a complete absence of medical services -- and there are fears of a possible imminent massacre,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said last week. ISIS has called the Shiite Turkmen heretics and vowed to push them out. Turkmen are descendants of a Turkic-speaking, traditionally nomadic people, who share culture ties with Turkey. There are Sunni and Shiite Turkmen in Iraq, and they account for up to 3% of Iraq's population. Turkmen have been subjected to violence before at the hands of Sunni extremists. A truck bomb explosion in 2008 Amerli killed more than 100 people --  an attack that was considered one of the single deadliest attacks of the Iraq War at the time. Report: ISIS selling Yazidi women in Syria . Hundreds of Yazidi women abducted by ISIS have either been sold or handed out to members of the Sunni extremist group, according to an organization that monitors the crisis. In the past few weeks, ISIS has ""distributed"" to its rank and file about 300 female members of the persecuted religious minority, says the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group aligned with the opposition in Syria. Those women were initially kidnapped in Iraq before being taken to Syria. In ISIS' eyes, the girls and women are ""captives of the spoils of war with the infidels,"" the Syria monitors said, claiming that some had converted to Islam so ISIS fighters can marry them. SOHR says it could confirm at least 27 cases in which women were ""sold and married"" for about $1,000 each to ISIS militants in Aleppo and Raqqa suburbs and Al-Hassakah. Who are the Yazidis and why does ISIS want to kill them? Tens of thousands of Yazidis fled to Mount Sinjar in northern Iraq as ISIS fighters made deadly advances on their villages. They became trapped on the mountain, leading to air drops of water, food and other supplies, and eventually airstrikes to dislodge ISIS from the area. Peshmerga forces managed to help most of the Yazidis escape into Iraqi Kurdistan. U.S. President Barack Obama declared an end to the ISIS siege at Mount Sinjar on August 15, citing the success of the airstrikes. Since early August, nearly 122,600 people in the Sinjar district -- mostly Yazidis -- have taken refuge in Kurdistan, according to USAID. A U.N. report warned of increasing kidnappings by armed groups in Mosul and the area of Mount Sinjar. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that some of the victims reportedly have been forced to convert to Islam and have been trafficked by the terrorist groups inside and outside of Iraq. A number of villages in Sinjar remain besieged by ISIS and other armed groups, the refugee agency reported. ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, was previously referred to as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Who are ISIS? Attacks across Iraq . At least three Iraqi soldiers were killed Saturday in a suicide car bombing south of Iraq's capital, police said, dealing a blow to the military in that area for a second straight day as government forces fight ISIS militants across the country. Seven other soldiers were injured in the attack, which happened at an army checkpoint in Yousifiya, a predominantly Sunni Muslim area about 35 kilometers (22 miles) south of Baghdad, police in Baghdad said. It wasn't immediately clear who conducted the bombing. The blast came a day after nine Iraqi soldiers and Shiite Muslim militiamen were killed in clashes with suspected ISIS militants in nearby Mahmoudiya, a Sunni Muslim community about 29 kilometers south of Baghdad. During the height of Iraq's insurgency last decade following a U.S.-led invasion, Yousifiya and Mahmoudiya, along with the town of Latifiya, made up the Sunni area known as the ""Triangle of Death"" because it was an al Qaeda stronghold and a lair for criminals. Iraqi forces under a Shiite-led regime, as well as ethnic Kurdish forces, have been battling ISIS, which this year took over large portions of northern and western Iraq and eastern Syria for what it calls its new caliphate. Well before ISIS made gains, Iraq was beset for years by sectarian violence, with Sunnis feeling politically marginalized under a Shiite-led government since the U.S.-led ouster of longtime leader Saddam Hussein in 2003. More U.S. airstrikes . U.S. forces conducted more airstrikes against ISIS targets near the Mosul on Saturday, according to the U.S. military, destroying a militant fighting position and armed vehicle. ""The strikes were conducted under the authority to support Iraqi security force and Kurdish defense force operations, as well as to protect critical infrastructure, U.S. personnel and facilities, and support humanitarian efforts,"" U.S. Central Command said in a press release. CENTCOM said it has carried 115 strikes across Iraq. Kerry: 'The cancer of ISIS will not be allowed to spread'","U.S. begins aid drops to Iraqi town surrounded by ISIS, the Pentagon says .

"U.N. weapons inspectors are expected to report their findings regarding a chemical attack in Syria early next week, sources said Wednesday, but a leading human rights group is already pointing its finger at government troops. The inspectors collected evidence from the site of the August 21 attack outside Damascus, and laboratories have been processing the material for more than a week. A diplomatic source told CNN that the findings would be presented on Monday, while another source said the report would ""likely"" be presented Monday or Tuesday. Earlier Wednesday, U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters that there was no timeline for the inspectors' report. ""They are going about their work now,"" Haq said. ""Once they are done, they will present it to the secretary-general."" U.N. report: Abuses on both sides of Syrian civil war . In addition, the report could be delayed amid diplomatic efforts to forestall threatened U.S. military action against Syria. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is headed for a two-day meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Switzerland over Moscow's plan to put the Syrian chemical weapons arsenal under international control. Washington accuses Syrian government troops of using the nerve gas sarin in a large-scale attack in the suburbs of Damascus, killing more than 1,400 people -- including hundreds of children. President Barack Obama told Americans on Tuesday night that he would put off punitive strikes on Syria to pursue the diplomatic opening from Russia. Syria's government has denied using chemical weapons, arguing its troops came under chemical attack by rebel fighters. The U.N. team that investigated the attack is tasked with confirming whether chemical weapons were used, but its mandate doesn't include assigning blame for the attack. But the American position got some support this week from Human Rights Watch, which concluded that government forces ""were almost certainly responsible"" and suggested U.N. inspectors saw some of the same evidence it did. The U.S.-based human rights group said its experts reviewed video and photos from the scene, including pictures from one source who photographed and measured remnants of rockets left at the scene. The weapons included Soviet-era 140mm rockets and an apparently Syrian-built projectile capable of holding up to 60 liters (16 gallons) of chemical agents, a Tuesday report from the group noted. Human Rights Watch used video uploaded to the Internet and photos provided by Syrian activists as part of their review. Some of those photos included detailed measurements of a 330mm rocket so far seen only in the hands of government forces -- a model ""compatible, and perhaps specifically designed, for the delivery of chemical agents."" ""U.N. inspectors were also videotaped inspecting some of the same rocket remnants during their on-site visit, further confirming that the rockets are located at the scene of the attacks,"" the report notes.

"(CNN)Monday's announcement by Malaysia's Prime Minister acknowledging that missing Flight 370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean opens the door to a big question: How did new number crunching confirm the Boeing 777's path? Now we know for sure ""there's no way it went north,"" said Inmarsat Senior Vice President Chris McLaughlin. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Monday that the plane was last tracked over the middle of the Indian Ocean, west of Perth, Australia. Malaysian Airlines has informed passengers' relatives that ""all lives are lost,"" a relative told CNN. Monday's announcement brings new questions about the mystery that has captivated the planet for more than two weeks. It also provoked a call that all airliners be constantly tracked. The mathematics-based process used by Inmarsat and the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) to reveal the definitive path was described by McLaughlin as ""groundbreaking."" ""We've done something new,"" he said. Here's how the process works in a nutshell: Inmarsat officials and engineers were able to determine whether the plane was flying away or toward the satellite's location by expansion or compression of the satellite's signal. What does expansion or compression mean?  You may have heard about something called the Doppler effect. ""If you sit at a train station and you listen to the train whistle -- the pitch of the whistle changes as it moves past. That's exactly what we have,"" explained CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers, who has studied Doppler technology. ""It's the Doppler effect that they're using on this ping or handshake back from the airplane. They know by nanoseconds whether that signal was compressed a little -- or expanded -- by whether the plane was moving closer or away from 64.5 degrees -- which is the longitude of the orbiting satellite."" Each ping was analyzed for its direction of travel, Myers said. The new calculations, McLaughlin said, underwent a peer review process with space agency experts and contributions by Boeing. It's possible to use this analysis to determine more specifically the area where the plane went down, Myers said. ""Using trigonometry, engineers are capable of finding angles of flight."" What could wreckage tell us about Flight 370's fate? No surprise . Experts said they weren't surprised by the news that the flight traveled along the southern track -- one of two possible paths revealed by satellite data last week. The possible northern track toward Pakistan would have been heavily monitored by radar. Pakistan had said it found no evidence of Flight 370 on its radar systems. ""It was very difficult to believe that no watch captain"" along the possible northern path ""would've seen a burning or distressed aircraft in the sky during the course of their watch,"" said McLaughlin. Is the more pinpointed flight path now focused enough to increase the chances of finding wreckage from the plane? If the flight definitely ended far from land, does that support the theory that the plane was not hijacked? It's just one question of many that investigators likely will be pondering in the coming days. Hours before the Prime Minister's announcement, Australian officials said they had spotted two objects in the southern Indian Ocean that could be related to the flight, which has been missing since March 8. One object is ""a gray or green circular object,"" and the other is ""an orange rectangular object,"" the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. ""This is obviously a major tragedy,"" McLaughlin said. ""The only thing you can hope is that from this, just as the Titanic resulted in (new safety legislation), that from this, there will be a mandate that all aircraft should be constantly tracked.""","Satellite experts use ""groundbreaking"" process to track Flight 370's final hours .

"Kurdish fighters from Iraq have finally arrived in Kobani in northern Syria to reinforce Syrian Kurds in the battle against ISIS for control of the town. A Kurdish activist in Kobani said late Friday he saw more than 100 Kurdish fighters known as Peshmerga cross over the Turkish border with their vehicles to the embattled city's west, near a key hill called Tal Shair. Another witness said he saw a large convoy of armed vehicles pass his house, headed toward the unofficial border crossing on the city's western side Friday evening. They were accompanied by Turkish military, as they drove on the Turkish side, he said. This is the largest reported crossing of reinforcements to help the the Syrian Kurds defending the besieged Kobani. It's unclear whether more help is on the way. ISIS, the Sunni Muslim extremist militant group, has been fighting to take Kobani for about six weeks, hoping to add it to the territory it already captured in parts of Syria and Iraq for what it calls its new independent Islamic nation. Word of the Peshmerga's arrival follows complaints from Syrian Kurds, accusing Turkey of causing delays in the fighters' arrival. The Peshmerga were supoosed to arrive Thursday night or Friday morning, according to Polat Can, spokesman for Syrian Kurdish fighters, part of the People's Protection Units, or YPG. ""We do not know why it is delayed. We think the delay is caused by Turkey,"" Can said Friday morning. ""ISIS has been focusing its attacks on the border gate for the past five days to prevent Peshmerga and other support from coming, but they have not made progress. We have taken back some areas,"" Can added. Syria has been embroiled in a three-year civil war, with government troops battling ISIS and other rebels elsewhere, leaving Kobani's ethnic Kurds to defend the city, with U.S. airstrikes -- part of a larger U.S.-led coalition effort against ISIS in the region -- intermittently taking out ISIS targets in the area. Meantime, the airstrikes against those targets continued Thursday and Friday as part of Operation Inherent Resolve with four more carried out in Syria and Iraq, Central Command said in a Facebook post. ""Separately, U.S. and partner nation military forces conducted four airstrikes in Iraq Thursday and today using fighter and remotely piloted aircraft against ISIL terrorists,"" Central Command said.","Peshmerga are now inside Kobani proper .

"The deadly Ebola virus has been contracted by someone inside the United States for the first time. A nurse who had worn protective gear during her ""extensive contact"" at a Dallas hospital with an Ebola patient who died tested positive during a preliminary blood test, officials said Sunday. The woman had on a gown, gloves, mask and a shield during her multiple visits with Thomas Eric Duncan, but there was a breach in protocol, health officials said. The patient is a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, an official who is familiar with the case told CNN. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta conducted testing on the blood sample, and confirmed the results Sunday, marking the first known transmission of Ebola in the United States and the second diagnosis in the country. She was involved in Duncan's care after he was placed in isolation -- his second trip to the hospital after coming to the United States from Liberia --  said Dr. Tom Frieden, the director of the CDC. The nurse is in stable condition, Texas Health Resources chief clinical officer Dan Varga said. Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, died Wednesday. What's a hospital supposed to do if an Ebola patient shows up? The nurse had ""extensive contact"" on ""multiple occasions"" with Duncan, Frieden said. ""At some point, there was a breach in protocol, and that breach in protocol resulted in this infection,"" he said at a news conference Sunday. ""The (Ebola treatment) protocols work. ... But we know that even a single lapse or breach can result in infection."" Also, Varga said that someone who is a ""close contact"" of the nurse has been ""proactively"" placed in isolation. The hazardous materials unit of the Dallas Fire Department has cleaned up and decontaminated the public areas of the health worker's apartment complex, Mayor Mike Rawlings said. Police are keeping people out of the area and are talking to residents nearby. ""We have knocked on every door on that block,"" the mayor said. Hazardous materials units have also cleaned out the nurse's car and will work on her apartment Sunday. ""This development is understandably disturbing news for the patient, the patient's family and colleagues and the greater Dallas community,"" the CDC said in a statement, announcing the nurse's test results. It sought to play down a wider risk. ""The CDC and the Texas Department of State Health Services remain confident that wider spread in the community can be prevented with proper public health measures, including ongoing contact tracing, health monitoring among those known to have been in contact with the index patient, and immediate isolations if symptoms develop,"" the CDC said. Complete coverage on the Ebola outbreak . Case was anticipated . ""We knew a second case could be a reality, and we've been preparing for this possibility,""  Dr. David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, said in a statement Sunday morning. ""We are broadening our team in Dallas and working with extreme diligence to prevent further spread."" The nurse reported a low-grade fever Friday night and was isolated, the health department said. The preliminary test result came in late Saturday. President Barack Obama received two briefings Sunday on the second Dallas Ebola case, including one from Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell. According to a White House statement, the President wants federal authorities to immediately take further measures to ensure health care professionals are able to follow protocols for treating Ebola patients. 'A sign the system is working' The news that a health care worker might have the disease is not completely unexpected, an infectious disease specialist told CNN's ""New Day."" ""I think we've always expected that there may be another individual who will come down with the Ebola from the transmission of this one particular person, and we always felt that it was going to likely be one of his close contacts or one of the health care workers, because that's the way this virus works,"" Dr. Frank Esper said. For Ebola caregivers, enormous fear, risk and bravery . Esper said Texas officials have been keeping a close eye on people who had contact with Duncan. ""I will tell you that the fact that we identified this individual so quickly is actually to me a sign that the system is working,"" he added. Globally, the disease has wrought catastrophic consequences. The World Health Organization estimates more than 8,300 people have contracted Ebola during this year's outbreak. Of those, more than 4,000 have died. Ebola not very contagious . Ebola is actually difficult to catch. People are at risk if they come into very close contact with the blood, saliva, sweat, feces, semen, vomit or soiled clothing of an Ebola patient, or if they travel to affected areas in West Africa and come into contact with someone who has Ebola. Those stricken with Ebola suffer ghastly symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, fever and internal bleeding. Three countries -- Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia -- have been hardest hit. And many of those who care for the ill have also come down with the disease. The World Health Organization estimates at least 416 health care workers have contracted Ebola, and at least 233 have died. In Liberia, health care workers are threatening to strike if their work conditions don't improve. The first infection outside of Africa happened in a nurse's aide in Spain, Teresa Romero Ramos. She became sick after she helped treat an Ebola-stricken Spanish missionary. Her case has prompted questions from fellow medical professionals about whether they are properly equipped to safely treat Ebola patients. Spanish Ebola patient's condition worsens, doctor says . Another search begins . For weeks, health officials have been monitoring those who had contact with Duncan before he was hospitalized and isolated. Duncan left Liberia on September 19 and arrived in Dallas on September 20. Four days later, he began feeling ill; the following night, he went to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. But despite telling a hospital worker that he had arrived from Liberia, Duncan was sent home with antibiotics. He returned a few days later and tested positive for Ebola. And now, the search begins for all the contacts whom the nurse came in contact with. ""We need a whole new crew of people to do contact tracing,"" said Elizabeth Cohen, CNN senior medical correspondent. Because Ebola's incubation period can last up to 21 days, the health nurse's contacts will have to be monitored for three weeks. The Texas health department said officials have interviewed the patient and are identifying any contacts or potential exposures. ""This is not an easy thing,"" Cohen said. ""Keeping track of large numbers of people, taking their temperature twice a day, making sure they don't ... leave town, all of that is a lot of work.""","A ""close contact"" of the nurse is being monitored, says CDC .

"Ben Affleck's appearance on Bill Maher's ""Real Time"" on Friday turned into a somewhat heated discussion when Maher and author Sam Harris voiced their opinions on Islam. ""Gone Girl"" star Affleck took umbrage at the pair's contention that Islam is, in Harris' words, a ""mother lode of bad ideas"" and that liberals are squeamish about criticizing Islam for stances on women and LGBT issues because people ""have been sold this meme of Islamophobia, where every criticism gets confused with bigotry toward Muslims as people."" Affleck said Harris -- a neuroscientist known for works criticizing religion -- and Maher were guilty of using a broad brush themselves. ""It's gross. It's racist,"" Affleck said. ""It's like saying 'shifty Jew.' "" Affleck added, ""How about more than a billion people who are not fanatical, who don't punish women, who just want to go to school, have some sandwiches. ... It's stereotyping."" Maher disagreed, questioning Affleck on his stance: ""You're saying that the idea that someone should be killed if they leave the Islamic religion is just a few bad apples?"" ""That's horrible,"" Affleck replied. ""(But) the people who would actually believe in an act that you murder someone if you leave Islam is not the majority of Muslims at all."" After some crosstalk, Harris chimed in with his view that ""we're misled to think that the fundamentalists (in Islam) are the fringe,"" as Maher added that moderate Muslims are afraid to speak out. Affleck responded that a better idea would be to criticize the Muslims who hold such views, not the whole religion. ""What is your solution? To condemn Islam?"" Affleck asked. The actor, who also directed the Oscar-winning film ""Argo,"" set in Iran and shot partially in Turkey, has received some positive response from viewers who appreciated his perspective.

"Running for president takes blood, sweat and tears, literally. Especially the sweat. Recalling his own campaign and debate experiences, Mitt Romney sympathized with Florida gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist on Tuesday, saying that he knows why the former governor insisted on using a fan during his debate in October. ""You may have read that one of the candidates for governor of Florida this year put a fan under his podium when he debated,"" Romney said. ""I sure know why: debating can be sweaty business."" Speaking to students at his alma mater -- Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah -- on Tuesday, Romney said that debating on a national level is harder than it looks. ""You may find it hard to imagine what it is like to debate an opponent on national TV. I was not a high school debater,"" Romney said. ""In fact, until I got into politics, the only person I had ever debated was my 5-year-old son, Matt. And he usually won."" ""My 2012 campaign had 23 televised debates, 20 with fellow Republicans and three with President Obama. These guys were no debate slouches. Newt Gingrich had been Speaker of the House. And President Obama, well, he had been President for four years. He kind of had his facts nailed down by that point."" Inspirational reminders . To combat the stress, Romney developed a strategy to keep his nerves cool and his mind centered. ""Before every one of my debates, I did something to keep things in perspective,"" Romney said. ""At the top of the sheet of paper that was placed on my podium for me to make notes, just before the debate kicked off, I wrote at the top one word: 'Dad.' I also drew a small image of the sun."" ""Throughout the debate, when I'd glance down at that paper, I was reminded of my father's fearlessness in fighting for what he believed was right. And the sun? That reminded me of the familiar scripture, 'Let your light so shine ...' ""Win or lose a debate, I hoped I would never do anything that would dishonor or discredit the things I hold most dear."" One would assume that after two unsuccessful runs for the White House -- with millions of dollars spent, hundreds of days on the road and lots of critical press -- Romney would feel deflated, overcome and disheartened. He doesn't. In fact, the former Massachusetts governor says that running for president was ""the most remarkable"" of his life's journeys. ""Despite my loss, the experience was extraordinary and revealing,"" Romney said. ""I come away more optimistic about the future of the country."" From English major to White House candidate . An English major, Romney said that growing up, he had no idea what he was going to do with his life, let alone run for president. ""Almost nothing I've done in my career was planned in advance,"" Romney said. ""I could hardly have predicted I would get into politics."" Of course, the notoriety that comes with running for the highest office in the United States can be exhausting. And although ""Mitt Romney"" is now a household name, the former businessman does relish the time when that wasn't always the case. ""One evening in a Marriott Hotel in San Francisco, I had arranged for a massage to loosen my tight back,"" Romney said, recounting one of his favorite moments from the campaign trail. ""Believe it or not, the hundreds upon hundreds of handshakes that day had given me a backache. After the massage, the masseuse, obviously unaware of my political career, remarked to my assistant: 'Mr. Romney has strong legs; he is a dancer, is he not?'""

""It's up to the people on Mars to decide what to do with their dead."" Still, the company said it has received more than 10,000 e-mails from interested would-be spacefarers. The one-way ticket makes the mission possible because it greatly reduces costs, and the technology for a return flight doesn't exist, according to Mars One's website. At a news conference, Lansdorp maintained that ""no new inventions are needed to land humans on Mars."" NASA: Yes, Mars could have hosted life . The biggest obstacles, he said, are financial. The company has revealed some of its sponsors and hopes to gain more via media coverage. It's not clear whether enough money will be collected in time. There are also practical issues: Can the kinks in having a sustainable system for people to survive in such a harsh environment be worked out by 2023? ""Questions of reliability and robustness have to be answered before we leave Earth,"" said Grant Anderson of Paragon Space Development Corporation, which builds life-support systems and is joining the Mars One effort. Anyone may apply, for a fee . The company announced a casting call for candidates at a news conference in New York City. Anyone 18 or older may apply via video but there is an application fee -- $38 for U.S. applicants. The money will fund the mission. Mars One wants to build a colony that will be able to grow with an ever-expanding crew. The group has a plan for testing the technology that would transport people and things. The group wants to launch a supply mission that will land on Mars as soon as October 2016. A ""settlement rover"" will land in 2018. The landing systems will be tested a total of eight times before they're used to transport humans, which Lansdorp says would make this ""much safer than moon missions."" The colony's budget comes in at ""about $6 billion,"" Lansdorp said. ""The $6 billion is for the first crew that goes there."" By comparison, NASA's rover Curiosity, the most advanced and biggest robot to ever traverse Mars, is a $2.5 billion mission. Where exactly the $6 billion will go remains a mystery. Lansdorp said he didn't want to release an itemized budget because of competition. Mars One intends for a second crew to join the first one in 2025, and more will follow regularly. Each flight will carry two men and two women, so reproduction on Mars would be feasible but not intended. ""We will certainly not send couples,"" Lansdorp said. At the news conference, Lansdorp said he'd like to go to Mars himself, but he isn't because his girlfriend won't come along. ""I have a really nice girlfriend, and she doesn't want to come with me, so I'm staying right here."" 501 days in space with your spouse: Could you handle it? Are they for real? The idea of starting a colony on Mars in 10 years seems so out of this world that CNN contacted one of the mission's potential suppliers to check on Mars One's credibility. ""I don't think they deserve to be dismissed,"" said a spokesman for an aerospace company that contracted for NASA's current Mars mission. The spokesman did not want his company named because he didn't want to damage the company's relationship with Mars One, but he felt he should talk to CNN to help put the Dutch start-up into perspective for a news audience, he said. With space opening up to the private sector, many companies large and small are trying to get in on the game, he said. Mars One's idea is one of the most audacious ones. Strange, dangerous mission . As far as getting to Mars, Lansdorp said his organization is in discussions with SpaceX, the company that has now completed two commercial cargo missions to the International Space Station. The idea would be to use a slightly enlarged version of the Dragon capsule and land with retro-propulsion, not by parachute. If they get there, Mars astronauts will face a lonely life of danger, subsisting for extended periods on dried and canned food. They will get some of their water by recycling their urine. They will have to take care of sickness and injuries themselves. ""There will be emergencies and deaths,"" Lansdorp said. ""We need to make sure that crew members can continue without those people."" Mars astronauts will have to be mentally fit to deal with the unusual stresses, he said. ""Their psychological skills will be the main selection criteria we will use,"" he said. Once selected, a group of 40 astronauts will undergo seven years of training. The flight to Earth's neighbor, with its barren red desert landscape and thin carbon dioxide atmosphere, sounds almost worse than a lifetime on it. The crew of four will be cooped up on a rocket for seven months with a limited supply of food and water. It also might smell bad. ""Showering with water will not be an option"" on the journey there, according to Mars One's website. Mars, the greatest show on Earth . Mars One plans to fund the mission partly from the sale of technology developed during the mission, Lansdorp said. It will share it with potential suppliers, which Mars One lists on its website. Media coverage will provide the main funding for the mission, Mars One said. Publicity is key, and the media event begins now with the casting of the astronauts. ""Not unlike the televised events of the Olympic Games, Mars One intends to maintain an ongoing, global media event, from astronaut selection to training, from liftoff to landing,"" it says. How much money will that yield? It's tough to say, but the NCAA projects it will take in $700 million for television broadcast rights for its 2013 college sporting events. Lansdorp said that after consulting with media experts and ad agencies, he's confident life on Mars will remain a hit for decades on Earth and will be able to weather any financial crisis or war on Earth. ""If humans land on Mars, everyone will want to watch,"" he said. ""It will be bigger than the Olympic Games."" If all goes well, Earthling television viewers can look forward to a decades-long reality show, though Lansdorp said the astronauts will be allowed to turn the cameras off at times. It's not just about the hype . The spokesman for the aerospace company credits Mars One for creating a media spectacle and marrying it to technology. ""They very aggressively seem to be pursuing the reality-TV angle,"" he said. It has gotten the small company to a stage that it can begin feasibility studies with aerospace companies, he said. It's also allowing scientists to work on ideas they otherwise might not have been able to pursue. ""It may fund development that would otherwise not get funded,"" he said. The aerospace spokesman is hopeful Lansdorp and his team may one day say, ""Mission accomplished."" Even if they don't, though, they will likely reach other milestones. ""We can't predict how far they'll get,"" he said. If the mission flops, Lansdorp has  ideas about what the nonprofit would do with any leftover money: Donate it to organizations that support space travel, such as the Planetary Society. You might be thinking that $6 billion would be better spent on Earth, but Lansdorp says the money won't mean much on our planet. Besides, he said, ""I don't have a business case to solve the problems on Earth. I have a really good business case to get humans to Mars.""

"CNN has learned that U.S. intelligence agencies have identified three Russian amphibious warships in the eastern Mediterranean that are believed to be carrying weapons shipments that might be used to resupply the Syrian regime, according to a Pentagon official. The official declined to be named due to the sensitive nature of the information. The United States has been tracking the ships since they left Russian ports several days ago. U.S. satellites were able to see some indications of containers being loaded onto the ships. Although it's not confirmed, it's believed the ships may be carrying some components of the controversial Russian S-300 air defense missile system and other weapons for the regime. The United States has been pressing the Russians for weeks to not deliver that system to Syria because of the threat it would pose by upgrading Syria's already robust air defense system.  The United States believes it would give the Syrian government a much greater ability to target U.S., Israeli, NATO or other aircraft that may try to strike targets on the ground in the future. The official said the United States  did not see any military helicopters being loaded;  it is  believed the Syrians want to add the helicopters to their inventories. The Russians have kept a regular naval presence in the eastern Mediterranean so they can move in and out of the port of Tartous, where they have facilities. Several sensitive military assets are in the region this month as well. In the next two weeks, the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower will also be in the region on a scheduled rotation as it returns to its home port on the East Coast.  A U.S. Patriot missile battery and F-16s are heading to Jordan for a training exercise, though the Jordanians have asked for the Patriots to remain after the exercise concludes at the end of the month.","U.S. intelligence: Three Russian warships in the Mediterranean may have weapons for Syria .

"Sen. Rand Paul is trying to shed the perception that he's an isolationist and that he thinks the United States should retreat from intervention in other countries' affairs. But members of his own party are making it hard for the Kentucky Republican to escape that image. Sen. John McCain, one of the most hawkish members of the Senate, told Fox News host Neil Cavuto on Tuesday night that Paul has ""a fundamental lack of understanding of the situation and the threats we face"" from ISIS. Referring to Paul's evolving position on ISIS, McCain said the libertarian-leaning senator ""has obviously been doing somersaults"" since the Sunni militant group gruesomely killed two American journalists and a British aid worker. Paul, who is seriously considering a presidential run in 2016, responded to his critics in an interview released Wednesday in The Federalist, telling the conservative Web magazine how ""frustrating"" these labels are for him. ""I spent the past five years in public life telling everyone that 'hey, I'm not an isolationist' ... and when they find out I'm not, they say I've switched positions, because I'm not the position they were saying I was. You know what I mean? So for five years they've been accusing me of being something that I say I'm not."" But McCain apparently doesn't buy this explanation. He said Paul has ""dramatically shifted his positions on national security. He said we shouldn't intervene, no matter what, anywhere. And now obviously he wants to take out ISIS."" ""I think it's kind of a desperation kind of trying to find some footing here as he slides down a very steep slope of credibility."" Former Vice President Dick Cheney has also been critical of Paul's foreign policy stance. On ABC's ""This Week"" in June, Cheney described him as ""basically an isolationist. That didn't work in the 1930s; it sure as heck won't work in the aftermath of 9/11."" Facing such vocal opposition in the Republican Party, Paul continues to battle the image of an isolationist with shifting views. Paul told CBS ""This Morning"" earlier this week that his perception of ISIS has evolved as world events changed, adding that the killings of Steven Sotloff, James Foley and David Haines ""influenced"" his position. Paul has said he doesn't back arming Syrian rebels, a position McCain has supported since Syria's civil war broke out three years ago. But Paul has been noncommittal on what the United States should do except that the Congress should determine the path forward. In The Federalist interview, Paul didn't deny that he's skeptical of U.S. intervention. ""We have to be very wary of intervention and that there are often unintended consequences,"" he said. ""At the same time, I've also said all along that I'm not for no interventions."" McCain, however, remains skeptical. When Cavuto asked him if Paul would be a good commander in chief, he replied, ""Not on national security. No."" War against ISIS: What does Rand Paul's 'yes' mean?","Sen. John McCain insists Sen.

"Malta cannot afford to continue supporting migrants from war-torn countries in its over-crowded detention camps, the country's foreign minister has told CNN. Speaking with CNN's Isa Soares, George Vella said that while he didn't want to blame the migrants, they ""do not help themselves"" in the immigration enclosures as they ""break toilets"" and ""smear the place."" When asked what the government can do to improve living conditions in the detention camp, Vela responded: ""They don't care for the facilities they have... we cannot afford to carry on looking after all these numbers, and utilizing our resources."" Vella continued: ""We cannot offer these people the opportunities for which they left their countries and risked their lives to get a better life, many of them don't want to come to Malta, they come by chance as the boat drifts."" Watch more: Stark reality for Malta's asylum seekers . The minister called on European Union member states for ""solidarity"" in the face of increasing numbers of asylum seekers crossing the Mediterranean, particularly from North and East Africa. He said: ""When these individuals qualify for protection, asylum seekers and they become refugees, they are protected. Then there would be a system where they would be relocated proportionally, possibly among the other European Union member states."" Read more: Which countries take in most refugees? Not the West . Between January and September of last year, 31,000 migrants are believed to have entered the European Union illegally by crossing the Mediterranean to land on Italian soil or the island of Malta, according to the European Union border agency Frontex. ""We sincerely believe that given our size and our density of population, if you compare, we are taking a bigger strain proportionally than all the other countries in the European Union,"" Vella said. Read more: Pope prays for lost refugees on visit to Mediterranean island . Malta gets assistance from the European Refugee Fund to deal with the influx of asylum seekers. In 2013, the Mediterranean island received 4.8 million euros [$6.5 million] from the fund, established in 2007. European nations such as Germany and Sweden have already opened their doors to refugees fleeing war in the home nations, particularly in the face of civil war in Syria. Read more: Scores dead after boat sinks off Lampedusa island . But Vella believes that measures to manage border control do not go far enough and said more needs to be done to tackle the root of the problem in troubled countries. He added: ""The problem is manning the border on the eastern side of Libya, which borders Sudan, which takes you to Eritrea and Somalia, from [where] most of them come."" On Thursday, more than 200 migrants were rescued from an overcrowded boat in rough waters in the Mediterranean Sea, according to the Italian navy. The boat was spotted about 80 miles south of the Italian island of Lampedusa, another refugee hotspot. The migrants, from Eritrea, Nigeria, Somalia, Pakistan, Zambia and Mali, were all moved safely. Vella said: ""You've got to look at the help you can give the countries of origin, you can look at the problems in the transfer of these people through countries where they fall prey to criminal gangs that make money in human trafficking.""","Malta receives a subsidy from the European Refugee Fund to deal with the influx of asylum seekers.

"At least 40 fighters on both sides were killed as Syrian Kurdish fighters and ISIS militants clashed in the northern Syrian city of Kobani, a monitoring group said Saturday. Kurdish fighters belonging to the People's Protection Units, known as YPG, have been locked in a death struggle with ISIS fighters for the border city, in the shadow of Turkey, with 100,000 desperate Syrian Kurds fleeing to Turkish territory. Five ISIS suicide bombers blew themselves up using cars and explosive belts near the besieged Kurdish city, according to the London-based opposition group, Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Clashes also erupted west of Kobani, with ISIS using tanks to advance and firing at least 110 shells on various areas of the city,  the monitoring group said Saturday. At least 10 YPG fighters and 25 ISIS militants were killed during the clashes, according to the SOHR. YPG fighters also carried out several operations in the neighborhood of Botan Sharqi on the southern outskirts of Mashtah Nour hill near Kobani, the monitoring group reported. The U.S.-led coalition, meanwhile, conducted five airstrikes in Kobani, including one against an ISIS tank west of the city, the SOHR said. The coalition started operations in September. ISIS, the Sunni Muslim extremist militant group, has been fighting to take Kobani for more than two months, hoping to add it to the territory it has already captured in parts of Syria and Iraq for what it calls its new independent Islamic nation. Syria has been embroiled in a three-year civil war, with government troops battling ISIS and other rebels elsewhere, leaving Kobani's ethnic Kurds to defend the city. Airstrikes by the U.S. and its allies, part of a larger U.S.-led coalition effort against ISIS in the region, intermittently take out ISIS targets in the area. The Syrian Kurdish fighters, part of the People's Protection Units,, have ties to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has fought a 30-year guerrilla war against the government of Turkey, where about 20% of the population is Kurdish. Turkey, the European Union and the United States consider the PKK a terrorist organization.","At least 10 Syrian Kurdish fighters and 25 ISIS militants reported killed in clashes in Kobani .
