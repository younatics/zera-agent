"The wait is finally over for disgruntled car owner  Ashton Wood who has said goodbye to the most hated possession he has ever owned - his Jeep Chrysler. Years of campaigning the car manufacturer to refund or replace his 'lemon' car - he bought from a Sunshine Coast dealer - proved fruitless, so the Queenslander decided to employ a different strategy to get the message across. He invited the public along to a rural property, at Bli Bli an hour north of Brisbane, where 300 people watched and took part in the car's demolition derby by wielding bats, and sledgehammers and shooting bow and arrows at it. Scroll down for video . The wait is finally over for disgruntled car owner Ashton Wood who has said goodbye to his Jeep Cherokee . Years of campaigning the car manufacturer did no good so he smashed it to smithereens . Mr Wood still owed $29,000 in total, so he was out of pocket close to $10,000 before smashing his Jeep to smitherines . This is the feeling of satisfaction according to Mr Wood . Saturday's momentous comes four years after Mr Wood bought the 'lemon' car for $49,000 and months after he started planning the demolition derby. An auger was used to rip a whole through the top of the rood and bring the car to its knees . The footage was streamed live on the internet capturing the varied moments people took to help bring the car to its knees. Saturday's momentous occasion comes four years after Mr Wood bought the 'lemon' car for $49,000 and months after he started planning the demolition event. He said his feeling of satisfaction could not have felt sweeter: 'It's fantastic, I'm here celebrating at the pub eating chicken wings. Mr Wood took the extreme measure to destroy his car - using augers, crow bars, bow and arrows and sheer man power - after years of frustration with his 'cursed' Jeep Cherokee. The footage was streamed live on the internet capturing the varied moments people took to help bring the car to its knees. After the car was destroyed a fire was lit to bring the rubble to nothing but scrap metal . The left over parts of the car were buried beneath the ground . For four hours they shot arrows at it, sledged windows and tore tyres while an auger ripped through its roof lifting it off the ground. 'The car was spinning in the air with the auger through the top of the roof,' Mr Wood said. 'The whole car lifted two, maybe three foot off the ground before we crushed it and lit on fire.' He said the 'Pièce de résistance' was putting a flame to it and watching it burn before burying the scrap heap and laying flowers at the head of its makeshift burial plot. 'We buried it six feet under, where it belongs.' Mr Wood started an online kick-starter campaign to recoup the losses on his $50,000 vehicle. He raised $18,000 through the crowd-funded project for people to bid on parts of the car they wanted to smash to smithereens. After four years of repayments he still owed $29,000 in total, so he was out of pocket close to $10,000, but by Saturday that no longer mattered. Baseball bats, arrows and sledgehammers were used in the very public destruction . More than 300 people turned out to either witness the public smashing or to take part in it . One avid participant used a baseball bat to take to the front side panel . Ready, aim! An archer  lines up his arrow before firing. It was originally proposed that people could shoot bullets at the vehicle but it didn't happen . Part of the grill of the car finally comes unstuck in the demolition derby . The main impetus behind the idea was to raise awareness around 'lemon laws' and to try to stop big companies from selling cars that should never be put on the road. 'The serious side to it is that I shouldn't have had to destroy a $50,000 car,' he said. 'If the law was there today and if Chrysler group respected and looked after its customers then it wouldn't have had to happen.' Mr Wood said plenty more jeep owners that have come forward with complaints that they are taking to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. A Tasmanian, who won a bid for the scrap heap on Ebay where he bough the metallic wreck for $257, was given the choice of what to do with the heap so he decided to 'bury the bastard.' In the four years since Mr Wood bought the car, in 2010, he claims it has provided him all sorts of problems, including the fuel line falling off, coolant leaks, the rear strut leaking oil, ongoing ignition failure, and the turbo inlet manifold cracking. Chrysler offered Mr Wood a settlement of $22,500 for the car, for which he originally paid $49,000, and he knows that if he sold the car himself he could get $28,000 for it, but he said he felt uncomfortable with both options. 'Why would I have wanted to sell it on to someone else?' They'll just have the same problems.' Now that the destruction of the Jeep has taken place, Mr Wood says he just wants to put this chapter behind him. He will have to buy a replacement car and while he is not certain which model he'll purchase he does know one thing. 'It won't be a Jeep.'

"A leading health academic has called for fat people to be 'shamed and beat upon socially' in order to halt the obesity crisis. In a controversial article, Daniel Callahan, the 82-year-old president emeritus of The Hastings Center a New York think-tank specializing in health policy ethics, calls for increased stigmatization of obese people to try spur weight-loss across America. The senior research scholar says fat people should be treated like smokers who have become increasingly demonized in recent years and thus 'nudged' by negative attitudes of those around them into giving up the unhealthy habit. Experts in eating disorders and obesity dismissed his calls for the 'edgier strategy' as ignorant and damaging to MailOnline today, saying such a perspective advocates the 'playground bullying' of children. Weighty issue: Former senior lecturer at Harvard's medical school, Daniel Callahan, left, has caused debate about attitudes to the overweight with his paper published by The Hastings Center think-tank in New York, right . 'The obvious target would be the large number of people who are unaware that they are overweight,' he writes in the paper printed in the center's first periodical volume of the year. 'They need, to use an old phrase, a shock of recognition. Only a carefully calibrated effort of public social pressure is likely to awaken them to the reality of their condition. 'They need to be leaned upon, nudged, and—when politically feasible—helped by regulations to understand that they are potentially in trouble. They should not want to be that way, nor should others.' he writes. Callahan, a former senior lecturer at Harvard Medical School, acknowledges that the causes of obesity are manifold and more needs to be done to encourage healthy eating but says driving up negative public opinion may be the only way to bring the quick results necessary to halt the crisis. 'It is hard to imagine that much . progress can occur toward solutions for obesity unless we bring some . form of social pressure to bear against it,' he writes. Shame: Daniel Callahan's views that obese people should be shamed by society were met with widespread condemnation from health experts today . Bullying: Daniel Callahan advocates shaming obesity like smoking. However experts claim he is ignorant of the problem and promoting dangerous behavior . He goes on to argue stigmatization already takes place in much of public life - using the example of criticism of New Jersey governor Chris Christie's weight when there was talk of him being a possible presidential candidate. He argues it is public health officials who are reluctant to harness this negative public opinion and cause offense when it would help drive down the epidemic. However, health and obesity experts have criticized Callahan's paper branding him ignorant and irresponsible . Dr Yoni Freedhoff, an assistant professor at the University of Ottawa and an author on obesity, told MailOnline: 'The one thing that’s not lacking in society is the stigmatization of people with obesity. 'If guilt and shame were sufficient to fuel long term weight management, the world would be a very skinny place indeed. Obesity is mulch-factorial and driven by the world in which we live.' Peggy Elam, a Nashville clinical psychologist specializing in eating disorders and a publisher of 'healthy body image' books said Callahan's views were ' horrifying' 'It is mind-boggling and on many levels ignorant of actual research,' she said. 'Smoking is a behavior, fatness is a body condition. 'This kind of bullying has a tremendous impact on peoples lives. We've seen in the past decade or two a rise in the hospitalization of children under 12 with eating disorders. On a humanitarian level it is shocking he is encouraging such bullying.' Laura Discipio, of the Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, backed up that position: 'Weight is a . complex issue that involves many things including genetics,' she said. 'His proposal is just providing . ammunition to hurt the self esteem of children on every playground . around the country.' Deb Burgard, of The National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance said: 'Callahan is obviously utterly out of touch with the real world.  He is also woefully ignorant of the social science research that shows that stigma leads to a higher risk of self-harm, poorer health, and social isolation, for people with, as well as people threatened with, the stigmatized characteristic. 'As a clinician who treats eating disorders across the weight spectrum, I see the fallout from our culture of weight stigma.  Callahan admires thin people for successfully winning the war on obesity, but this is like looking at the bank accounts of the rich and imagining they work harder than everyone else.'","Daniel Callahan, President Emeritus of a health ethics think-tank The Hastings Center, says fat people should be 'shamed and beat upon socially'

"More than two decades ago, he forced his way into the England team. But now, David 'Syd' Lawrence is bossing the over-40 bodybuilding scene.

"Leighton Baines is not letting himself think too much about Everton's chances of winning the Europa League yet but admits he is excited about the way their continental campaign is shaping up. Ahead of Thursday's home clash with Lille, the Merseysiders - playing in Europe this term for the first time in five seasons - are top of Group H and unbeaten after three rounds of matches. A 4-1 victory over Wolfsburg at Goodison Park was followed by two away draws, 1-1 at FK Krasnodar and 0-0 at Lille, and three more points on matchday four would see Roberto Martinez's men take a significant step towards the knockout stages. Everton defender Leighton Baines (right) is hopeful of making the Europa League knockout stages . Baines (right) chats with midfielder Darron Gibson (left) during training at Finch Farm on Wednesday . Toffees full-back Baines was part of the club's run to the last 32 of the Europa League in 2009-10. And asked if he believed Everton could go all the way this time in a tournament that now has a route into the Champions League as a reward for the winners, the 29-year-old said: 'It's a really long competition so you don't want to look too far ahead. 'But we are excited about where we are at at the moment. 'We will look to consolidate our position with a good result against Lille, and there are going to be some really exciting ties if we can get out of this group. So that is the focus at the moment. 'I think we may be better-equipped this time with the strength in depth we have got. Everton's players train ahead of their Group H clash at home to French side Lille on Thursday . Ross Barkley (left) and Tim Howard (right) should start for the Toffees under the floodlights at Goodison Park . 'We're also probably in a tougher group than before in terms of the standard of the teams. 'So, with that in mind, we have gotten ourselves into a good position, and we have two of the last three games at Goodison, where we will expect to win.' Although they have impressed in Europe, Everton made a shaky start to the season domestically, but their results have picked up of late. With the Toffees having lost only one of their last seven games in all competitions, Baines feels the club are getting back to the levels they were at last term, when they came close to claiming Champions League entry via the Barclays Premier League, finishing fifth. And on a personal level, the England defender is in no doubt that playing well in Europe for his club is important for his international career. Everton boss Roberto Martinez has admitted he could make up to six changes against Lille . Toffees striker Romelu Lukaku, who is expected to start on Thursday, laughs during training . Asked if he thought he is playing the best football of his career at the moment, Baines said: 'It is always difficult to judge, but I am certainly enjoying my football. 'We've picked up our form as a team and are getting back to the standards we had set previously. I've enjoyed being part of that for sure. 'Playing in Europe has definitely been a good bonus for us this season and I think being a part of that stands you in good stead on the international stage. 'It gives the manager (Roy Hodgson) the assurances you can play at that level.'","Everton host Lille at Goodison Park on Thursday, kick-off 8.05pm .

"Nathaniel Clyne is discussing the possibility of making his England debut at Wembley this weekend when he appears to give the game away. ‘Growing up in an estate with lots of flats there were a lot of people around, so tickets are in demand for the game on Saturday,’ he admitted. ‘It’s a good feeling for me to be here. 'I’m buzzing. It’s a great achievement. I’m buzzing, my family are buzzing and my friends are buzzing. I’m just looking forward to my first cap.’ Southampton right-back Nathaniel Clyne has admitted he is 'buzzing' at the prospect of an England debut . Clyne: 'I’m buzzing. It’s a great achievement. I’m buzzing, my family are buzzing and my friends are buzzing' At Wembley on Saturday, when England face Slovenia in a Euro 2016 qualifier, there is a chance he will start ahead of Arsenal defender Calum Chambers. This has been some journey for the Southampton defender, forcing his way into the England squad after making steady progress at St Mary’s. He is proud of his Stockwell roots, plastering his arms with reminders of London landmarks — Big Ben and a London phone box among them — plus another of him holding a football as a young boy. ‘The tattoo is of me as a baby holding a football — it’s a picture of me in my mum’s house and I thought it would be good to get it written on my arm,’ he added. ‘I was about three at the time. I always wanted to be a footballer and I followed my brother because he was always playing in the park. I’m proud of where I’m from. I grew up in Stockwell, which wasn’t bad. Clyne's arms are smothered in London-themed tattoos and him holding a football as a young boy (pictured) ‘My mum has always been there and she took to me games when I was younger. She follows my progress now. She comes to every single game, wishes me luck and gives positive feedback. ‘She was happy. She was so delighted. I think she cried when I told her I got a call-up. I am happy to do my family and friends proud. She’d be over the moon if I made my debut. She’s my No 1 fan.’ Clyne’s journey into the professional game began when he joined Tottenham, via the Afewee Academy in Brixton, at the age of 11, but the long journeys across town on school nights became too much. ‘The Afewee Academy gave young kids the chance to play football and show what they could do,’ added Clyne. ‘They explained to me that I was really good, better than the other kids, and that’s when I realised I could be a professional. ‘I loved playing football so always went there after school. I just loved playing so didn’t really think much of it until the coach, Steadman Scott, got me a trial at Tottenham. In the end it just got too much travelling to Essex after school each day.’ Uncapped Clyne pictured during training with England ahead of their international matches this week . Clyne on being supported: 'My mum has always been there and she took to me games when I was younger' Clyne can make his England debut under manager Roy Hodgson at Wembley against Slovenia on Saturday . Clyne moved to Crystal Palace, his local team, and made rapid progress through the youth ranks before making his debut for the club under Neil Warnock in his first spell at Selhurst Park. His progress was smooth, and he made a name for himself there before his move to Southampton in 2012, when they were promoted to the Barclays Premier League. Last month he forced his way into Roy Hodgson’s squad for the first time. Here at St George’s Park he is competing with Chambers, the man who traded positions with him last year at Southampton under Mauricio Pochettino, to start against Slovenia. Clyne was picked for the last squad, taken along for the ride for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and the trip to Estonia. He has displaced Liverpool defender Glen Johnson and is regarded by Hodgson as a player with immense potential. Clyne (right) gets instructions from England manager Hodgson with Jordan Henderson (left) and Theo Walcott . He added: ‘I was disappointed not to play last month, obviously. As Calum was called up from the Under 21s most people would have expected me to play, as I was always in the senior squad. 'But I can’t let that affect me. I’ve just got to concentrate on the next games and try to get into the team. The manager hasn’t explained anything to me at all. ‘The manager obviously thinks highly of me and I’m being credited for my performances from Southampton. If you play well you get called up. I’m not that surprised I’ve kept Glen Johnson out of the squad. I feel like I’m playing really well, and if I get a chance to play I’ll try and prove it.’ After three impressive years at Southampton, he has certainly earned it.

"A Queensland man fed up with his 'lemon' car has started an online campaign to raise funds to destroy it. Ashton Wood has started a Kickstarter campaign to raise $22,500, the amount Chrysler offered to him to buyback the car, and allows those who donate the chance to be involved in the car's destruction. For $12 supporters can have their name written in permanent marker on the car before it is smashed up, $22 will buy someone a go at the car with a sledge hammer, $250 will enable someone to destroy the engine and $5,000 grants someone the right to set fire to the Jeep at the end of the process. Scroll down for video . Ashton Wood and his wife Ness have had 20 car problems, including four that required a tow truck, since they bought it in 2010 . One of the most popular items so far is the chance to shoot the car with bow and arrow - a privilege that will set you back $55. So far the campaign, Destroy My Jeep, has 39 backers who have pledged more than $1,600 between them . Mr Wood said he is taking extreme measures after years of frustration with his 'cursed' Jeep Cherokee, which in the four years since he bought it in 2010 has had all number of problems, including the fuel line falling off, coolant leaks, the rear strut leaking oil, ongoing ignition failure, and the turbo inlet manifold cracking. 'Things happen with cars, but you shouldn't have 20 things wrong with it, requiring four tow trucks and a push [when the car broke down before he even got it out of the showroom],' he told MailOnline. Mr Wood insists he has never driven it off-road and that the car has only done 12,000km, a number disputed by Chrysler who say it has driven 30,000 to 40,000km. Mr Wood said he 'tried everything possible the right way' to get a resolution from Chrysler, contacting the dealer, importer, Office of Fair Trading and the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal. Mr Wood is hoping that people will pay for the fun of destroying his car, which he says is 'cursed' and a 'lemon' Mr Wood said he wanted to shoot the Jeep with guns but that's illegal in Australia and so people will have to settle for bow and arrow assaults on the vehicle . The Destroy My Jeep project was started after Mr Wood felt he had exhausted all formal options of communication with Chrysler . Chrysler offered Mr Wood a settlement of $22,500 for the car, for which he originally paid $49,000, and he knows that if he sold the car himself he could get $28,000 for it, but he says he feels uncomfortable with both options. 'It's become a matter of principle for me, if I take their money, they're going to on-sell the car at a profit and someone's going to end up with my lemon and I just don't think that's right. 'I might as well try and find some lighter side to the whole thing.' The Kickstarter campaign is a way of doing just that, as well as putting pressure on big companies who think they can bully unhappy customers into giving up, he said. 'I'm just really disappointed in their lack of want to resolve this issue and I certainly tried all the formal ways to resolve this. 'I guess in this day and age of social media it puts pressure on companies to do the right thing by their customers and I'm really hoping they review their policies.' Mr Wood adds that he has 'never done anything like this before' and does not think all Jeeps are faulty. 'I don't think it's all Jeeps, it's just there's something systemically wrong with this one.' Once the destruction of the Jeep has taken place, Mr Wood says he just wants to put this chapter behind him. He will have to buy a replacement car and while he is not certain which model he'll purchase he does know one thing.

"An Australian man looking to exact revenge on the worst car he has ever owned is offering-up the demolished product on Ebay. Queenslander Ashton Wood, who set about on a mission to destroy his Jeep Cherokee earlier this year, has less than two months until he and some complete strangers smash it to smithereens. After four years of fruitless car dealer and court negotiations, The Daily Mail revealed that Mr Wood had decided to take the less orthodox approach of smashing the $49,000 vehicle to pieces. Now, in another twist to his ambitious bid to send a message to Chrysler, he is selling the wrecked heap on Ebay. Scroll down for video . Mr Ashton will film the whole demolition process and upload it online. An auger will start the demolition process by drilling a 'sunroof' into the top of the dodgy Jeep . There are plans to also set the car on fire - but Mr Ashton has assured it will be done in the safety of 4 hectares of private property . Once  Mr Ashton has destroyed the car - he will get rid of the scrap heap on Ebay . A hammer and crow bar will be among the tools used in the destruction of the Jeep . Listed under 'Cars, Passenger Vehicles' is the details of the very frank and forthright ad, which according to Mr Ashton, does not hide any nasty secrets - unlike the Sunshine Coast dealer who sold it to him. 'Destroy My Jeep - you're buying the wreck,' the ad says, with a description that reads: 'We are about to totally DESTROY our $49,000 2010 Jeep Cherokee Limited, as we refuse to pretend everything is OK and sell this onto someone else, so you are bidding on the wreck!' Mr Wood is well into a second Kickstarter campaign to re-coup some of the cost of the $49,000 vehicle, after the first one failed to raise the $22,500 amount Chrysler offered to him to buyback the car. He has since dropped the price to $18,500 and those who donate will have the chance to be involved in the car's destruction. The ad continues: 'We intend on hitting it with hammers, shooting arrows into it, smashing out headlights, windows and mirrors.' 'Next comes the 34-tonne excavators that will have a drill attachment fitted to drill a 2-foot-wide 'sunroof' into the top and another large hole in the back to pin down the car, while another excavator fitted with a claw 'removes' the engine by tearing it out through the front grill. People have 53 days to pledge their cash to smash the Jeep which has been the bane of Mr Ashton's existence ever since he drove it out of its Sunshine Coast dealership. Once finished, the pieces will be sold-off on Ebay where the bidding for the scrap heap has already begun. Mr Wood is hoping that people will pay for the fun of destroying his car, which he says is 'cursed' and a 'lemon' So far there has been 57 bids for the demolished product and there have been 65 pledges for people to help him show the vehicle who is boss. 'I don't know who or why would want to bid on it ..  Maybe Chrysler are bidding for it and trying to bury it,' Mr Ashton told Daily Mail Australia. He said there is a point to his particularly crazy idea. 'There's two things,' he said. 'I don't want to have to sell this car to somewhere else, because that's not fair, and I can't afford to just tear it apart and lose $28,000.' He has already paid off about half the cost of the original price. The other reason -  he hopes the demolition job will raise awareness to change consumer law in Australia and send a message to Chrysler about its dodgy dealings. For $12 supporters can have their name written in permanent marker on the car before it is smashed up, $22 will buy someone a go at the car with a sledge hammer, $250 will enable someone to destroy the engine and $5,000 grants someone the right to set fire to the Jeep at the end of the process. The car is now littered in signatures from the people who have pledged money. Everyone, providing it is within reason, will get to choose their weapon of choice. Mr Ashton needs to raise another $13,000 in 53 days on Kickstarter before the Jeep gets demolished . Among the more outlandish requests to demolish the car include parking it on a rifle range and firing bullets at it, and using an auger to drill a hole through the car's roof. The second request, Mr Ashton has accepted. 'It is a machinery company and they are providing the equipment to smash it,' he said. 'So we will begin with an auger drilling a hole through the roof of the car.' Mr Wood insists he has never driven the car off-road and that it has only done 12,000km less than the average Four-Wheel-drive for its age. Mr Wood said he is taking extreme measures after years of frustration with his 'cursed' Jeep Cherokee, which in the four years since he bought it in 2010 has had all number of problems, including the fuel line falling off, coolant leaks, the rear strut leaking oil, ongoing ignition failure, and the turbo inlet manifold cracking.

Police say they have accepted that 28-year-old Australian plumber Matt Lockely made a genuine mistake when he banged on the cockpit door of the Virgin plane, believing it was where the toilet was located. After carrying out blood and urine tests, they have also concluded that he was not drunk and have accepted his explanation that he had only consumed soft drink because he was on medication. Scroll down for videos . Arrested in his flip-flops:  Matt Christopher Lockley is dragged off a Virgin plane by Indonesian Air Force . He has told police that he was flying from Brisbane to Bali in an attempt to save his fractured marriage to an Indonesian woman. 'He has not been charged,' said a police spokesman. 'He is free to leave.' Lockley . told questioners he had taken four Panadol tablets, two . Voltaren (used as a painkiller or to treat inflammation) and drunk only . two cans of Coca Cola at Brisbane airport before boarding flight VA41 to . Bali. He also insisted he . had been asleep for most of the flight, but when he was woken by the . crew for a meal, he believed he had lost his bag. Detained: Lockley was handcuffed by the crew mid-air and placed in a seat at the back of the plane before being arrested when the jet touched down at the Indonesian island's Denpasar airport . He had started talking to a woman in the neighbouring seat before deciding he needed to go to the toilet. 'He . thought the cockpit was the toilet and was making quite a bit of a . racket trying to get in,' said police spokesman Hery Wiyanto. It . was that incident that had resulted in the pilots, named by Bali police . as Captain Neil Cooper and co-pilot Ryan Stockwell, reportedly raising . the alarm about a hijack attempt - although there have been suggestions . that the wrong alarm button was pressed. This . swung into action a major police and military operation, with armed . officers waiting for the plane to land - while Lockley was grabbed by . crew members, handcuffed and made to sit on a seat at the rear of the . aircraft. Planes were prevented from leaving Denpasar airport, while others were put in a holding pattern or diverted to other cities. Was acting 'paranoid': Matt Lockley is led down the steps from the plane by Indonesian Air Force soldiers . When the plane landed, the armed officers boarded and dragged Lockley out. Other armed men kept rifles trained on him as he was led down the aircraft steps and into the terminal. There . were suggestions that if Lockley had been found to have been drinking . and had genuinely tried to break into the cockpit he would have been . charged with causing an affray on an aircraft and could have faced . several years in jail before being deported. Mr . Wiyanto said the plumber, from Brisbane in Queensland, had slept for . most of the flight and was moved to the back of the plane after talking . to a passenger. Fun times: Matt Lockley (left) drinks Indonesian beer Bintang with an unidentified friend in a picture posted on Facebook . Mr Lockley has repeatedly told investigators he was not drunk, but suffering from depression due to family problems. Mr . Lockley's claims emerged just hours after Australian comedian Dan Ilic . tweeted: 'Drunk Bogan Hijacker thought ""cockpit"" was just a fancy . aeroplane name for ""toilet"" #boganhijack'. Looking . bewildered and wearing flip-flops, Matt Christopher Lockley was dragged . off the Boeing 737-800 after the jet was forced to make an emergency . landing in Bali. The .

Lockley was . handcuffed by the crew mid-air and placed in a seat at the back of the . plane before being arrested when the jet touched down at the Indonesian . island's Denpasar airport. Police said they were told by a flight . attendant that Lockley looked 'paranoid' and was demanding medicine. Lockley gave blood and urine . samples to police to be tested for alcohol and . drugs. 'The police are having difficulty . digging up information on what he intended to do because he is still in . an unstable condition,' a police official at Bali airport told media straight after his arrest. Officials said his identification included a driving licence issued by the . Queensland government, a licence to perform high-risk work and a . Plumbing Industry Council card.

Mr Prapto said the plane was directed to park at the end of the runway in case explosives or weapons were involved. Scores of troops surrounded the jet. Transport . ministry official Herry Bakti said the alert was triggered when the . pilot sent a signal to Bali airport that the plane had been hijacked en . route from Brisbane to Bali at at 2pm local time (7am BST).

'Bali . airport seems to be in lockdown, we've been told no planes will be . departing or arriving. The pilot's not allowing anyone off our plane.' But Heru Sudjatmiko, a Virgin . Australia official on the Indonesian resort island, later said: 'This is no . hijacking, this is a miscommunication. Armed and ready: Indonesian military officers stand guard after the Virgin Australia plane was forced to land . Heavyweight response: An Indonesian armoured vehicle arrives on the scene after the airport received reports that the plane had been hijacked . The 137 passengers and six crew members were unharmed. 'The aircraft landed safely and at no point was the safety of passengers in question,' an airline spokeswoman said in Australia.

"Lewis Hamilton believes he is now perfectly equipped to handle the pressure that will come with his latest Formula One title-decider. Hamilton heads into the all-or-nothing clash with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg in Abu Dhabi on November 23 - with the scrap being dubbed 'The Duel in the Desert' - with a 17-point advantage. The introduction this season of double points for the final race has added a touch of controversy to proceedings, and offered Rosberg a more significant lifeline than he might otherwise have had. Lewis Hamilton has revealed he is not worried about his important showdown with Nico Rosberg . Both Hamilton and Rosberg finished on the podium alongside Felipe Massa at the Brazilian  Grand Prix . Rosberg claimed first spot at the Brazilian Grand Prix ahead of his Mercedes team-mate . VIDEO Brazil boost for Rosberg as he edges out Hamilton . 1. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) - 334 . 2. Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) - 317 . 3. Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull) - 214 . 4. Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) - 159 . 5. Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) - 157 . Hamilton, however, is not planning to let any issues overshadow his judgement going into the clash at the Yas Marina circuit. Now in his eighth season, his experience will prove vital, a quality he lacked in his two previous last-race title fights in his rookie year of 2007 and subsequent campaign in 2008. In 2007, Hamilton let slip a 17-point lead - when there were only a maximum of 10 points for a win - with two races remaining. In 2008, only an overtaking manoeuvre on the final corner of the last lap allowed him to become champion. Comparing then to now, Hamilton said: 'In those two years, as far as I can remember, I definitely felt the tension more over those two weekends. 'I know I am more prepared now than I have ever been. I am stronger now than I was then, both mentally and physically. 'It is different now and I hope that experience counts for something. 'Going into this last one, I don't think there is a special recipe for it. I just have to go and do what I have been doing. Hamilton has revealed he will spend time with with his family and girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger before the race . 'I have to drive the way I have been driving in recent races because generally it has been good.' Hamilton maintains all he can do is follow simple routines, as he has over many years, and not let any negative thoughts or distractions impinge on his focus. 'What will be, will be,' added Hamilton. 'There is no point dwelling on it. It is going to happen one way or another. 'All I can do is make sure I do the best I can over the whole weekend and the rest will follow in whichever direction. 'Immediately before the race I'll do the same stuff I always do - go and take a pee, then stand for the national anthem and then get on with my driving. 'That's what I have done at every race this year.' In terms of his build-up ahead of flying to Abu Dhabi, Hamilton aims to keep calm and relaxed. 'I'll spend some time with the family, with my dogs, my girlfriend, as well a day or two at the factory,' added Hamilton. 'I won't be thinking about racing, that's for sure.'","Lewis Hamilton heads into the final race with a 17-point advantage .

"Police were called to an elementary school in Pennsylvania after police found several packets of heroin in the boy’s first grade class on Friday. According to court documents, Pauline Bilinski-Munion, 56, told police she ‘lost track’ of the heroin at her house while she was babysitting the boy and a one-year-old baby on Thursday. She was taken into custody on Sunday after a teacher at Caln Elementary found the drugs on her grandson. Grandmas stash: Pauline Bilinski-Munion, 56, is facing child-endangerment and drug charges after her 7-year-old grandson brought heroin to his elementary school, authorities said . Teachers spoke with the little boy and found nine bags in his pants pocket, officials said. The heroin was stamped ‘Victoria Secret.’ The child initially claimed he’d found the drugs in the school yard, but later admitted he brought the drugs from home, police said. The child told investigators that he found the heroin by a washing machine where his mother, father and grandmother live. Bilinski-Munion admitted to investigators that she is an active heroin user, and told them that she found the drugs outside her home on Thursday, according to court documents. Found: The heroin was found in the pockets of a seven-year-old boy who was a first grader at Caln Elementary School . The documents say the grandmother admitted that she didn't call authorities and instead kept the heroin 'in case of an emergency.' The school told parents that a 'dangerous and illegal' substance was found in the grass and parents should check to see if their children had any. Detectives then interviewed the boy with his relatives, at which time they learned he usually stays with his aunt in Coatesville, but recently had been living with his mother, father, and grandmother. A search warrant was executed at the residence on Saturday evening, and detectives allegedly located heroin bags in the home, as well as an empty heroin bag in a pair of children's shorts. Quantity: A search warrant was executed at the residence on Saturday evening, and detectives allegedly located heroin bags in the home, as well as an empty heroin bag in a pair of children's shorts .

Did not freeze all the kids in place. Did not call emergency personal to see if the kids were okay.' The School District released the following statement: . 'Caln Elementary School administrators contacted the Coatesville Area School District Police Department within minutes of discovering an unknown substance within the possession of one of its students.

"A rare diary which was the first hand account of one of the victims of the brutal Khmer Rouge in Cambodia was used to bring its last remaining leaders to justice. School inspector Poch Younly kept the secret diary nearly 40 years ago, which vividly recounts the horrors of the radical communist regime. Their experiment in social engineering claimed the lives of 1.7million people through overwork, medical neglect, starvation and execution. Scroll down for video . Poch Younly, pictured in 1955, with his family before he started writing a diary which vividly recounted the horrors of the Khmer Rouge . Mr Poch's diary, pictured, which was used in evidence to convict Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea of crimes against humanity . Mr Younly hid the dairy inside  inside a clay vase as anybody educated was deemed a threat to the regime . It is thought Mr Poch wrote his entries while hunched on the floor of the wood and leaf hut as he was forced to live away from his family and hid the diary inside a clay vase as anybody educated was deemed a threat to the regime and executed. In one of the spiral bound notebook's last pages, he wrote: 'Why is it that I have to die here like a cat or a dog ... without any reason, without any meaning?' Now it has emerged that Mr Poch's diary was part of the vast case file, which helped to convict the only two surviving Khmer Rouge leaders, 83-year-old former president Khieu Samphan and 88-year-old Nuon Chea, the right hand man of the group's infamous late leader Pol Pot. Last Thursday, a UN-backed tribunal sentenced both men to life in prison for crimes against humanity - a verdict that many believe was too little, and far too late. Written in Khmer, the diary fills about 100 pages and is divided into two sections. Nuon Chea former second in command of the Khmer Rouge, left and Khieu Samphan, former head of state of the Khmer Rouge, right, who were convicted of crimes against humanity at a tribunal last Thursday . The first summarises Mr Poch's family history, an era spanning French colonial rule, the Japanese occupation during the Second World War and his arranged marriage to his then 15-year-old wife. The rest, written as a letter addressed to his children, describes life under the Khmer Rouge and is dated only at the start and the end - February 9 and July 29, 1976, with a final post-script entered a few days later. When Khmer Rouge forces seized Phnom Penh on April 17, 1975, Mr Poch and his wife were living with eight of their children in a rural town called Kampong Chhnang. Three days later, the guerrillas arrived and residents - including Mr Poch - cheered, relieved the war was finally over, his 86-year-old widow Som Seng Eath recalled. But within hours, the Khmer Rouge were emptying Cambodia's cities, marching millions of people into the countryside to work as manual laborers. Mr Poch said how he 'didn't believe what was happening' and kept saying, `Don't worry, we'll be back soon, don't pack much,' his widow said. Poch Younly's daughter Visethneary reads her father's diary, which details his experience of the brutal Khmer Rouge regime . His widow, Som Seng Eath, left, pictured with her daughter and grandchildren says the diary is still too painful to read . His notebook recounts how he was marched through forests and mountains for nearly two weeks. Along the way, most of his possessions were confiscated, including four of the notebooks and a prized camera he had bought during a government visit to inspect schools in the United States in 1961. Ominously, he began hearing talk of execution sites ahead - what would later become known as Cambodia's killing fields. In his diary he wrote: 'We worked day and night clearing wood to make arable land, uprooting the trees, digging canals, building roads and dikes, planting vegetables and digging ponds. 'We worked 10 to 13 hours a day.' Food supplies dwindled, and Mr Poch and his wife grew so desperate they traded clothes and a treasured family locket for salt, sugar and medicine. The following month, he fell ill and he could not work, but he had the privacy to write. But months later, he began sensing his end was near. An exhumed mass grave reveals the skeletons of people executed by the Khmer Rouge during their rule in Cambodia . Corpses found in 1979 at a prison run by the former Khmer Rouge government, about 18 miles north-west of Phnom Penh . A Khmer Rouge fighter stands guard as he watches forced labourers dig a water canal near Battambang . 'By now, my body resembles a corpse, thin with only skin and bones,' he wrote. 'I have no energy, and my hands and legs tremble. No power, no strength. I cannot walk far or do heavy work. Everyone works like animals, like machines, without any value, without hope for the future.' At one point, he writes of his regret at not being able to see all of his children as his two oldest sons were elsewhere in the country. The rest were forced to live in other parts of the village, working in mobile children's work units. 'Let me die,' he continued. 'Let my destiny take me wherever it goes ... My children, I miss you; I love you.' Mr Poch wrote until there were no pages left to write on, his wife said. On August 1, 1976, he wrote a postscript on the final page, asking his family to take care of the diary. A tourist looks at human skulls of genocide victims at the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, formerly the most notorious Khmer Rouge prison, in Phnom Penh . A wall of pictures, showing prisoners of the Khmer Rouge regime line one of the museum's walls in what was formerly Tuol Sleng prison . Hours later, he was taken away by the regime to help lift a palm tree that had fallen in a paddy field. However, it was a lie as authorities had come to arrest him because one of his sons had attempted to exchange an Omega watch Mr Poch had bought in America 15 years earlier for fermented fish. Mr Poch died several weeks later, in a nearby prison where he was kept chained to the ground. His widow says the diary is too painful to read now and says she didn't understand its importance at the time. She kept the diary safe for two decades, then passed it on to one of her daughters. It was the daughter's husband who suggested giving the notebook to a documentation centre to protect the fragile, yellowed pages of history. It is 'the story of all of us who survived,' said Youk Chhang, who runs the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, which has amassed millions of documents, photographs, films and verbal testimonies from the Khmer Rouge era. 'When the Khmer Rouge were in charge, everything belonged to the revolution, he added. 'You owned nothing. Not even your life story.'","Poch Younly kept a diary recounting the horrors of the Khmer Rouge regime .

"Paul Gascoigne has been sectioned and placed on a three day emergency detox after his latest alcohol binge. The 47-year-old was rushed to hospital at 3am yesterday morning after police were called to his home in Poole, Dorset. Medics had been called just hours earlier and carried out an assessment where his condition was considered to be stable, however, he reportedly worsened over the next 12 hours. Scroll down for video . Paul Gascoigne pictured last week with Mandy Thomas, who is rumoured to be his new girlfriend. The 47-year-old was rushed to hospital at 3am yesterday and sectioned under the Mental Health Act . The former England and Tottenham Hotspur footballer has suffered a long battle with alcoholism and was previously sectioned six years ago. Close friend and former teammate Gary Mabbutt told The Sun: 'He has been detained for his best interests. Paul has had a relapse and hasn't been well for a couple of weeks now. 'The best support available is being given to Paul. Hopefully he can get on the road to recovery.' A source also told the paper that Gascoigne had not been in a 'good state' and police and doctors were 'really worried about him'.

Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne, pictured fishing in Hampshire last month, was previously sectioned six years ago and has had a long battle with alcohol and drugs . Gascoigne during his days playing for England, when he made 57 appearances for his country . The star, who made 57 appearances for his country, has been in rehab seven times and was first sectioned under the Mental Health Act in 2008, following an incident at a Newcastle hotel. His seventh stint in rehab was in January this year when he checked into a £6,000-a-month treatment clinic in Southampton. The most recent binge comes just months after he was hospitalised for an alcoholic breakdown. In August he was found collapsed outside his home clutching a bottle of gin and was taken to Poole Hospital where he was treated for four days. Last month the star was pictured cradling a chicken whilst enjoying a pint and speaking to locals in a pub beer garden. But things for the troubled footballer appeared to be on the up after he was spotted with walking hand-in-hand with a woman who he is reportedly dating. Friends had said last week that they hoped Mandy Thomas, a public services worker, would save him from his battle against alcohol after she stayed by his side during his most recent relapse. Ms Thomas, who is separated from her husband and has two children, is said to be 'besotted' with the star with whom she has become 'inseparable'. A spokesman for his former club Spurs told the newspaper: 'We are aware of the situation with Paul and continue to offer our support.' Gascoigne's agent Terry Baker told MailOnline that the star 'is not very well' but refused to comment on his condition any further.","The 47-year-old rushed to hospital at 3am yesterday morning from home .

"Alice Powell, a 21-year-old racing driver from Chipping Norton, is in contention to drive alongside the likes of Lewis Hamilton at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after her grandfather said he would pay to turn her dream into reality. Powell, whose Formula One aspirations are supported by the Prime Minister, would become only the sixth woman ever to take part in a Formula One weekend. Her opportunity has come about in extra-ordinary circumstances, after Caterham went into administration at the end of last month. The administrators have since launched a ‘crowd-funding’ project whereby the public can contribute towards a target of £2.35million that would allow the team, who have missed the last two races, to compete at the championship decider in Abu Dhabi on Sunday week. Alice Powell could be given a chance to make her Formula One debut for Caterham . The 21-year-old's grandfather could pay £35,000 for her to race at the Abu Dhabi first practice session . Powell is hoping to line up alongside fellow Brits Lewis Hamilton, Jenson Button and Max Chilton . Maria Teresa de Filippis: The Italian became the first female to race in F1 at 1958 Belgian Grand Prix. Lella Lombardi: Another Italian, raced 17 times in 1974-76 and only female to achieve a top-six finish. Divina Galica: The Brit was multi-talented, captaining women’s Olympic ski team in 1968 and 1972 and driving in three grands prix. Desire Wilson: Qualified 16th for home grand prix in South Africa in 1981, but retired after her car was damaged. Giovanna Amati: Rose through F3 and F3000 ranks, though she never qualified for F1 grid. Since opening on Friday, the scheme has secured more than half the required money. In return for contributing, the fans are given ‘rewards’ — including bits of old chassis, steering columns and sundry unneeded bits lying around the closed factory in Leafield, Oxfordshire. Powell’s grandfather, Jim Fraser, a retired Royal Air Force sergeant, saw an opportunity to get Powell her Formula One debut. He wrote to the administrators, Smith & Williamson, offering to pay £35,000 in exchange for Powell driving in the first practice session on the Friday of the grand prix weekend. ‘I am really hoping the administrators come back with a positive response,’ said Fraser, an aviation lover who passed his helicopter pilot’s licence seven years ago aged 66. ‘It would give the whole sport a great lift and open people’s eyes to see a woman in an F1 car again. ‘A lot of women might not want to watch a race with their husbands when all they see is a list of men. This could focus their attention, just as it did when Danica Patrick raced in America. Audience figures there went up by 15 per cent overnight. ‘Alice is the best woman driver in the world and I believe she could run in midfield in a good Formula One team. But for now we are just trying to get a drive in one practice session.’ Mark Ford, an associate director of Smith & Williamson, confirmed they had ‘received the offer and have spoken to Alice’s backers’. I understand that Ford sought an assurance from Powell’s grandfather and manager that she meets the criteria for an FIA super-licence, a prerequisite for Formula One. She should comfortably qualify for the paperwork such is her pedigree in lower formulas. At 16, she was the youngest ever driver in Formula Renault UK before becoming the first female winner of a Formula Renault series in 2010. She has driven in GP3 and Renault 3.5, arguably the toughest series outside Formula One. David Cameron has backed Powell to become the sixth female driver to take part in a Formula One weekend . F1 driver Button and British track and field athlete Jessica Ennis are among Powell's sporting heroes . But despite her success, Powell, who left school after her GCSEs to pursue her driving career, works as a labourer — steel-fixing and driving diggers — when she is not racing. Fraser says he is not cash-rich and fears his plan may be scuppered by rival bidders with deeper pockets. One driver available after his team Marussia folded is Britain’s Max Chilton, who is backed by hefty investors led by his multi-millionaire father Grahame. But Fraser said: ‘Even if the administrators get someone else for the race, qualifying and the two other practice sessions, there is no reason not to include Alice for the first session. It is important that they make up their minds soon because she needs to get on the simulator from now until Abu Dhabi.’ Powell is no stranger to the limelight, having accompanied David Cameron on a trade delegation to India two years ago. The PM strongly supports her quest, saying: ‘Alice has my full backing in her desire to compete at Formula One. ‘No woman has raced in Formula One for nearly 40 years and not only would it be great for Alice and great for Britain but it would be great for Formula One.’ By taking part in two practice sessions this season Susie Wolff, of Williams, became the first female participant since Giovanna Amati failed to qualify for the Brazilian Grand Prix on April 4, 1992. And only two women have started a race: Maria Teresa de Filippis and Lella Lombardi, in the 50s and 70s respectively. Speaking to Sportsmail last year, Powell, whose sporting heroes are Jenson Button and Jessica Ennis, said: ‘I don’t think there is anything stopping a female getting into Formula One, but I don’t think a female should be there simply because she is female.’ VIDEO Brazil boost for Rosberg as he edges out Hamilton .","Alice Powell could be given the chance to take part for Caterham .

"'Psychopath' burglars brutally clubbed nearly 1,000 chickens to death with golf clubs after breaking into an industrial farm in California's Central Valley, police have revealed. Workers showed up at Foster Farms near Fresno on September 20 to find 920 chickens bludgeoned to death. Detectives discovered a piece of a golf club that the burglars had left behind. 'Psychopathic behavior, it’s sick behavior. And people who will do this, it can definitely lead to other things,' Fresno County sheriff's deputy Chris Curtice told KPIX-TV. Scroll down for video . Massacre: Sick burglars practiced their golf swing at Foster Farms last month, hitting a birdie and bludgeoning some 920 chickens to death . Foster Farms said the birds were worth about $5,000. The company said it was furious about the cruelty to the chickens and have offered a $5,000 reward for information that leads to the suspects. 'This appears to be a random act of violence. It is the express policy of Foster Farms to treat its birds humanely and with compassion. Any intentional act to the contrary is unacceptable,' the company said in a statement. Workers say they were horrified by the mess left  from the mutilated birds. 'It’s crazy that someone would break into the chicken shed to kill them.

"Kieron Dyer and Titus Bramble have slammed the Rooney Rule, saying they don't want to be shortlisted for a coaching job just because they are black. The Ipswich Town coaches, back at the Championship side where they once played, believe they should be judged on their merits, not their skin colour. The Rooney Rule is a practice in which every NFL franchise is required to shortlist and interview at least one black or ethnic minority candidate when looking for a new head coach. Kieron Dyer (centre), currently a coach at Ipswich, says the Rooney Rule should not be used in football . Bramble, a former England defender and now Ipswich Under 11 coach, told The Telegraph: 'At the moment, I think the Rooney Rule is a disgrace. 'I think it’s disgraceful that someone might be shortlisted for the job just because of their skin colour. 'You could say it’s just as bad being given a job because of your skin colour as it is not being given a job.' Titus Bramble (left) and Dyer in their Ipswich days; both also had long stints at Newcastle United . Dyer, another former England player who made a name for himself at Newcastle, also strongly believes the Rooney Rule wouldn't work here, despite it being a relative success in America. He said: 'I want to be interviewed because the chairman wants to interview me. 'I don’t want to be interviewed because it’s filling a quota. I don’t want to be on a shortlist because football clubs are told I have to be because I’m black. Keith Curle, manager of League Two Carlisle United, is one of only two black bosses in the top four divisions . Huddersfield boss Chris Powell, formerly of Charlton, is the only other black manager working in England . 'I don’t agree with the Rooney Rule either. That’s me personally, it doesn’t mean it hasn’t worked in America, but I don’t like the idea here.' Only 19 out of the 552 senior coaching positions at England's 92 league clubs are held by black and ethnic minority (BME) coaches, according to new report by the Sports Person's Think Tank.

"A multi-million pound sports super-centre backed by Judy Murray and Colin Montgomerie could affect archaeological remains from the Jacobite Campaign, it emerged today. The proposed Park of Keir development promises to create jobs and includes a hotel, a tennis and golf super-centre, and 100 homes near Stirling in Central Scotland. A planning application for the sports club, which would be built on greenbelt land between Bridge of Allan and Dunblane, was lodged in July. Sports centre: The full proposal for Park of Keir includes plans for a new tennis and golf centre; a museum and visitor centre; indoor and outdoor tennis courts, pictured above in a concept design . Training: An artist's impression of inside the Park of Keir leisure centre shows indoor tennis courts. The group behind the project have been told that planned work will have a 'negative impact on archaeological remains' Sprawling: A birds-eye view of the site shows plans for hotel, a tennis and golf super-centre, and 100 homes near Stirling in Central Scotland. National and local sports clubs have supported the application . Backing: The Park of Keir Group is led by Judy Murray, left, and supported by golfer Colin Montgomerie, right . It has been publicly backed by the Lawn Tennis Assocation, the Professional Golfers Association, and Tennis Scotland. Local sporting clubs such as Dunblane Soccer Club also support the plan as they state there is a need for more facilities in the area. But the Park of Keir Group, led by Judy, the mother of Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, was met with opposition earlier this year when 200 residents who have objections with Stirling Council. Now the project, which is also backed by Scottish golf star and former Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie, has been told that it will have a 'negative impact on a series of known archaeological remains' if the plans go ahead. A series of maps and drawings of Roman archaeological sites in Scotland highlight the area where the development is planned as a route where troops passed through in the Jacobite Campaign. In a consultation document, Murray Cook, Stirling Council's archaeologist, said: 'There are a number of existing and emerging policies relevant to this application with regard to Archaeology. The Jacobites were the supporters of King James VII (of Scotland) and II (of England) and his heirs. James VII and II ruled Britain from 1685 to 1689 but because he was a Roman Catholic he was replaced by his daughter Mary and her husband, the Dutch Prince William of Orange. Those who continued to support the exiled James  became known as ‘Jacobites’. In 1689, the Jacobites were opposed by the Williamites, or Whigs, those Britons who supported the Protestant cause and would not tolerate a Catholic kingdom. The first of the three main Jacobite uprisings was the 1689 rising, which was led by ‘Bonnie Dundee’, John Graham of Claverhouse, and quickly quelled. The second was Mar’s Rebellion, or the ‘Fifteen’, which took place between 1715-16, was provoked by the death in 1714 of the last Stuart monarch, Queen Anne, and the accession of King George I. The third Jacobite uprising was the ‘Forty-Five’, that took place from 1745 to 1746. The 'Forty-Five' was when Charles Edward Stuart - the famed ‘Bonnie Prince Charlie’ - led a Scots army against the Hanoverian dynasty. It is remains of this third campaign that experts said will be disturbed by the current plans for Park of Keir. Source: Educating Scotland . 'There is no doubt that the proposed development will have a direct and negative impact on a series of known archaeological remains for example the Stirling to Crieff military road used in the Jacobite Campaign on 1745, which is likely to be associated with objects dropped by both Government and Jacobite troops.' The group's full proposal includes a new tennis and golf centre; a museum and visitor centre; indoor and outdoor tennis courts as well as a golf course with clubhouse and practice areas. There are also plans to build a hotel with leisure and conference facilities and multi-user sports pitch and outdoor play area. The super-centre will be accessed via a combination of cycle trails, footpaths and new access roads. Mr Cook noted that he had 'no objection' to the development, but recommended that if plans go ahead, an archaeological contractor should carry out a survey in order to scan for any hidden remains. He said that there should be a heritage trail designed around the proposed development that identified key features of interest. Mr Cook added that should excavation be necessary, developers should fund the work. But, despite its findings, the report concluded that 'The development represents an opportunity to improve the management, accessibility and interpretation of the hillfort and any impact on setting would be more than compensated for by such general improvements'. The plans hit trouble last month when the council's principal planning officer, Claire Milne, said that the economic benefits of the scheme were outweighed by its detrimental costs to the environment. Ms Milne reported: 'Although it is accepted [that] the tennis, golf, tourism and recreational element of this development proposal may provide a degree of social as well as economic benefit to the local area, what is proposed is essentially a private commercial venture. 'The submitted business case is not sufficiently convincing to warrant approval of the proposed housing. 'The net economic benefits of the proposed development are considerably outweighed by the significant detrimental costs to the environment and the lack of physical and social infrastructure to support the development. Benefits: While the report identified the impact Park of Keir could have on the remains, it concluded that it also represented an opportunity to 'improve' the hillfort. Above, an artist's impression of one of the buildings . Heritage trail: A council archaeologist suggested that there should be a trail around the site that identifies key interest points relating to the Jacobite uprising of 1975. Above, a concept design of Park of Keir . 'On this basis the development cannot be supported in policy terms.' If the plans are given the green light, it will result in the building of the second hotel linked to the Murray family. Earlier this year, Andy opened a five-star resort in Perthshire, north of the proposed Park of Keir development site. Five-star Cromlix, which was crowned Scottish hotel after opening in April, boasts 10 bedrooms and five suites which overlook manicured grounds and tennis courts. Councillors will consider the Park of Keir application at a later date, and it is likely to end up with Scottish ministers making the final decision. The Park of Keirs partners said in a statement: 'The Park of Keir partners are committed to ensuring that any development at the site is handled sensitively and this is confirmed in detail in the accompanying Environmental Statement submitted with the planning application earlier this year. 'We remain confident that our proposed development represents sufficient benefit to the people of the local area to allow members of the planning committee to approve our application.'","Park of Keir development features 12 tennis courts, six-hole golf course .

"Germany's FIFA member believes the 2022 World Cup will be moved from Qatar due to the extreme temperatures. Theo Zwanziger, who sits on FIFA's all-powerful executive committee, believes the threat of legal action may force the World Cup to be moved. FIFA has always stressed the World Cup will be in Qatar but is currently looking at moving the dates to the winter. Organisers in Qatar insist cooling technology in stadiums, training bases and fan zones would enable them to hold the tournament at any time of year including the summer. Theo Zwanziger (left) does not believe it will be possible to have the World Cup in Qatar in 2022 . Zwanziger told Sport Bild: 'I personally believe that in the end the 2022 World Cup will not take place in Qatar. 'Medical experts say that they cannot accept responsibility for a World Cup taking place under these conditions. 'They may be able to cool the stadiums but a World Cup does not take place only (in the stadiums). Fans from all around the world will be coming and travelling in that heat and the first life-threatening case will trigger an investigation by a state prosecutor. Zwanziger believes the extreme hot weather will make it impossible for FIFA to stage the tournament in Qatar . 'That is not something that FIFA executive committee members will want to be responsible for.' No decision has yet been made on the timing of a winter World Cup but there has already been opposition from leagues and clubs. Meanwhile, a British MP who has campaigned for FIFA reform has written to the Serious Fraud Office asking that it demands a copy of FIFA ethics investigator Michael Garcia's report into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. FIFA President Sepp Blatter has come under fire over the decision to host the competition in Qatar . Damian Collins believes the SFO has the right to be given a copy as it has previously investigated corruption allegations made by former Football Association chairman Lord Triesman. Hans Joachim-Eckert, the German judge who is the head of the ethics committee's adjudicatory panel, stated last week that the report's contents would not be made public. Collins says in his letter to the SFO: 'I am writing to ask if you would request from FIFA a copy of Michael Garcia's report. FIFA seems to believe it is a self-governing body that operates outside the jurisdiction of international and national law enforcement agencies. 'I do not believe this is the case and that if they hold information that indicates that offences may have been committed this must be shared with the relevant law enforcement agencies.'

"Nick Hancock almost sold Sir Stanley Matthews’ 1953 FA Cup winner’s medal for £50,000 three months ago. Instead, he put it up for auction on Tuesday and it went for £220,000. The TV presenter, who bought the medal in 2001 for £20,000, received a staggering profit at Sotheby’s in London. The sale price made it the most expensive sports medal in British history. ‘I felt it might be my lucky day,’ said Hancock, who went straight out to buy 10 lines on the Euro-Millions afterwards. ‘It really is one of those moments, I had no right to expect it.’ Television presenter Nick Hancock put the Sir Stanley Matthews' 1953 FA Cup medal up for sale . Matthews' 1953 FA Cup medal has sold for a massive £220,000 at Sotheby's . Matthews poses with his famous FA Cup winners medal after the final in 1953 . The 1953 match is known as the 'Matthews final' after the stunning display from the Blackpool star (left) Matthews receives his medal from Queen Elizabeth II after dazzling Wembley in the FA Cup final . Matthews' family have expressed their delight at the sale. His daughter Jean Matthews Gough said in a statement: 'It's wonderful news, and shows the passion and remembrance the public still have for Pop. 'It would have made Pop so happy; when you consider he thought the medal was originally lost, only to discover it had been found in the attic of a house he had lived in 40 years previously.' Next year is the centenary of Matthews' birth and his foundation, run by volunteers, has pledged to help more than 10,000 youngsters gain access to a high-class sporting experience in their local schools and sports clubs by raising £100,000. On a day when Ray Wilson and Jimmy Greaves’ 1966 World Cup medals sold for £136,000 and £44,000 respectively, Matthews’ gong from the Blackpool-Bolton final stole the show. It prompted a frantic bidding war, which started at £50,000 and ended three minutes later, going for almost a quarter of a million pounds to a private buyer.

Ray Wilson's 1966 World Cup medal (left) sold for £136,000 while Jimmy Greaves' fetched £44,000 . Greaves tries his luck in the 1966 World Cup group game against France before picking up an injury . May 2: The nation was desperate for Stanley Matthews to win the 1953 FA Cup final. Twice he had been a runner-up and his third attempt was following a similar path, with Blackpool 3-1 down against Bolton with 53 minutes played. But the Wizard of the Dribble conjured up one of the performances of his career on the right wing to set up three goals and turn the tie for victory. June 2: The Queen’s coronation took place at Westminster Abbey. June 6: Sir Gordon Richards was the star jockey of his generation and finally won the Derby, at the 28th attempt, on Pinza. He was congratulated by the Queen, whose horse Aureole came second. August 19: England’s cricketers won the Ashes for the first time in 19 years, beating Australia 1-0 on home soil. November 25: England suffered their first defeat at Wembley against a non-British side, losing 6-3 to Hungary. Five telephone bidders and the packed Book Room at Sotheby’s contested the much sought-after item. But the frenzy to purchase it shocked everyone after the guide price of £30,000-£50,000 was eclipsed. One Blackpool businessman was prepared to spend £100,000 and was left stunned when it went for double that sum. Graham Budd, whose company was in charge of the auction process, put the figure into context, saying: ‘The most expensive piece of memorabilia we’ve sold was a set of Victorian gates from Ascot Racecourse, which went for £280,000.’ Matthews’ medal — lot 742 — was due up at 11am and the room quickly filled five minutes before. It was standing room only as the medal was shown to the audience. There was a moment of hush before Budd kicked off the show and the bidding exploded. The first person to call Hancock, who watched the auction at home via the internet, when the medal sold was Matthews’ grandson Matt Gough. That was quickly followed by a call from the England legend’s daughter Jean. ‘It was lovely,’ added Hancock, who used to host BBC show They Think It’s All Over. ‘They rang to say how happy they are. I’m really glad. For them it’s a real endorsement of who their grandfather was that it would sell for so much.’ Perhaps it was the story behind the medal which prompted such interest. Matthews won the FA Cup with Blackpool in 1953 after twice finishing runner-up between 1948 and 1951. In front of a 100,000 crowd at Wembley — in the first FA Cup final shown live on the BBC — he starred as Blackpool came back from 3-1 down against Bolton to win 4-3 in injury-time. Although Stan Mortensen netted a hat-trick, the game became known as the ‘Matthews final’ following a magical display on the right wing, from where the Wizard of the Dribble set up three goals. Greaves did not play again in the tournament after featuring against Uruguay, Mexico and the French . Greaves, scoring in 5-1 win over Wales in 1960, helped himself to 44 England goals in 57 games .

Then Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, presented Greaves with his medal in 2009 after a campaign . Auction houses add a buyer’s premium to the hammer price when calculating sales figures, so Matthews’ medal comes in even higher than the £220,000 received by Nick Hancock… . Stanley Matthews: 1953 FA Cup (Blackpool) — £258,000 . Nobby Stiles: 1966 World Cup (England) — £188,200 . Alan Ball: 1966 World Cup (England) — £164,800 . Ray Wilson: 1966 World Cup (England) — £159,800 . George Best: 1968 European Cup (Man Utd) — £156,000 . Gordon Banks: 1966 World Cup (England) — £124,750 . Hancock will give some of his earnings to The Sir Stanley Matthews Foundation, which gives financial assistance for young people to play sport. ‘The original money I paid for the medal was a springboard for the charity to start,’ Hancock explained. The bidding frenzy did not last, with Wilson’s 1966 medal, handed to the England left back after the 4-2 World Cup final win against West Germany, going to collector Nigel Wray for £136,000. Its guide price of £120,000 had far exceeded that of the Matthews medal. Greaves’s medal, up next, was less prized because it was only handed to him in 2009. Up until 1974, only players who featured in the final received a medal. Greaves was left out by Alf Ramsey in favour of Geoff Hurst.","Stanley Matthews won the FA Cup with Blackpool in 1953 .

"Unable to see the stage and blocked in by other fans, five-year-old Isabelle Nixon was less than impressed with the Invictus Games closing ceremony - until, that is, Prince Harry came to the rescue. After spotting the little girl, the prince, 30, hoisted her on to his shoulders and then stayed to dance with her as the Foo Fighters took to the stage. Isabelle, whose father Adam, 31, from Hereford, captained Team GB's wheelchair basketball team to victory on Sunday, had previously met Prince Harry on several occasions and regards him, according to her mother, as one of her heroes. Scroll down for video . Party prince: Harry picked up Isabelle Nixon, five, put her on his shoulders and danced for the rest of the gig . Isabelle said: 'I was completely over the moon. I was chuffed to bits.' Mr Nixon, a former Gunner in 26 Regiment Royal Artillery, lost his one of his legs following an IED explosion in Basra in Iraq in March 2004. His left leg had to be amputated while his right was badly damaged, leaving him confined to a wheelchair. Despite . his injury, Mr Nixon, who has four children, daughter Abigail, 11, . Jayden, eight, five-year-old Isabelle and three-year-old Lilyana, . continued to play his basketball. 'Prince .

'He came up, shook my hand and said: ""You are a legend"" and I asked him for a photo with him and my family. 'Then later, after his speech, Foo Fighters were on the main stage. He came to listen to the music.' But when Harry, who had earlier told Mr Nixon that he just wanted to 'chill out' and watch the show, spotted the tearful Isabelle, he swung into action. 'He recognised her from earlier in the day and saw she was getting upset because she couldn’t see the band,' adds Mr Nixon. 'He approached us and smiled at me and just literally picked her up and just started to dance so she could see the stage.

'She just danced along to the Foo Fighters with him and hasn’t stopped smiling since.' Harry, who is now planning next year's event as well as working on other projects such as the Rugby World Cup, certainly made an impression. 'Isabelle now says . she's a princess and tells all her friends she danced with ""Uncle . Harry"",' said her mother Taryn.

"Over 200 young men have been forced to flee their homes in Derry over the past year, due to a campaign of violence being carried out by republican vigilantes. Shootings and beatings are now becoming more commonplace in Northern Ireland's second biggest city, which will become Britain's City of Culture in 2013. Punishment attacks by Republican Action Against Drugs (RAAD), have also led to at least 85 men being shot, according to police figures. City of fear: A picture released by Derry vigilante group Republican Action Against Drugs showing two of their members standing over a man who has been hooded, who they claim is a leading drug dealer . Attacks: Over 200 young men have been forced to flee their homes in Derry over the past year, due to a campaign of violence being carried out by republican vigilantes . The young men, who are usually in their teens or early twenties, have been forced to turn up at an appointment with a relative or parent, reported the Guardian. They are then attacked for reasons such as alleged drug dealing. Last week RAAD claimed one of the north west’s leading drug dealers has taken advantage of its ‘amnesty’ and stopped selling drugs. They released a photo showing two of their members standing over a man who has been hooded. The group claimed that the man was 'very close to being executed' on two occasions but has 'given an undertaking never to be involved in drugs again.' The escalating violence has now led to Martin . McGuinness, the Provisional IRA ex-chief of staff turned deputy first . minister of Northern Ireland, urging the public to hand over names of republican paramilitaries responsible. He described the republican vigilantes as 'the new oppressors of the people of Derry'. Strong words: Martin McGuinness, deputy first minister of Northern Ireland, has urged the public to hand over names of republican paramilitaries responsible such as those who killed former Derry boxer  Andrew Allen . Last February, RAAD gunmen shot dead a former Derry boxer, Andrew Allen, 24, just . across the border in a relative's house in Co Donegal. Republican Action Against Drugs (RAAD) is a vigilante group active mainly in Derry and the surrounding area. It targets those whom it claims are drug dealers. The group's methods include: . punishment shootings - these often involves kneecapping . pipe bomb or arson attacks on the property of alleged dealers. In 2008, the group formed, offering an amnesty to all drug dealers. Since then the group has widened its targets to include anyone it deems guilty of anti-social behaviour and domestic violence. In an interview with the Derry Journal in August 2009, the group's leadership explained: 'We would monitor the actions of those who have come forward and, given an adequate period of time, interest in those drug dealers would cease and they could start to lead normal lives.' He had been warned a few weeks later that he would be shot if he remained in Derry, accused of dealing in drugs - a claim rejected by his family and untested in a court of law. Mr Allen's mother, Donna Smith, has become a figurehead in the campaign against RAAD and said she had lost faith in the peace process. She said that families who are being threatened by teh group now live in a 'city of fear.' 'How can they call this the City of Culture when they (RAAD) are going around butchering children? Something has to be done, it has to be stopped before another family is sitting in the situation that we are in: me without a son, my other children without a brother and two small children without a father,' Ms Smith told the newspaper. Although the police have vowed to prosecute those responsible, there . have been no prosecutions for the 'punishment' attacks' and no one has . been charged in connection with Mr Allen's murder. In April more than 200 people attended a rally in Guildhall Square in Derry to protest against RAAD. The same month RAAD was blamed for shooting a man in both legs in Creggan. The organisers of the protest claimed the attack was deliberately timed to coincide with the rally. The mother of the 18-year-old victim described how she had been ordered to bring him to an alleyway close to Creggan shops. She waited a short distance away while the punishment attack was carried out and heard her son being shot twice. The woman, who did not want to be named, said her son had been targeted because of his involvement in drugs. Some RAAD members are ex-IRA members, but McGuinness still issued a stern condemnation yet of the vigilante . campaign. City of fear: Martin McGuinness, deputy first minister of Northern Ireland, has urged the public to hand over names of republican paramilitaries responsible . 'RAAD are a tiny group of people. They are not representative and are not accountable to anyone but themselves. They are driven entirely by ego not by any desire to tackle drug abuse in Derry or anywhere else. 'There is also a very strong perception that some individuals associated with RAAD have profited financially from those involved in the drugs trade.  Shooting young people who have become addicted to drugs or threatening them from their homes does nothing to tackle this very serious issue.' He said he hoped as a direct result of the public informants that RAAD members would be imprisoned in the near future.","At least 85 people have been shot in past year by the Derry vigilante group .

"A police chief's daughter and two male friends have been charged for allegedly brutally beating a gay couple in Philadelphia after internet sleuths helped cops identify them. Kathryn Knott, the 24-year-old daughter of Chalfont Police Chief Karl Knott, Philip Williams, 24, and Kevin Harrigan, 26, turned themselves into Philadelphia Police early on Wednesday. Prosecutors said the trio face criminal conspiracy, aggravated and simple assault and reckless endangerment charges for their alleged part in the vicious beating. They were allegedly part of a group that approached a gay couple, aged 26 and 28, in Center City on the evening of September 11 and said to one of the men: 'Is that your f***ing boyfriend?' Scroll down for videos . Surrendered: Kathryn Knott, the daughter of a Philadelphia-area police chief, has turned herself into cops for allegedly being part of a group that viciously beat up a gay couple two weeks ago . The Philadelphia Police Department took this mugshot of Kathryn G. Knott and released it late Wednesday . The Philadelphia police also released these mugshot of Philip R. Williams, left, and Kevin J. Harrigan, right, on Wednesday . The group then proceeded to beat up the men, leaving them bruised and hospitalized. One of the men needed to have his jaw wired shut. The case gained national attention when police posted a video of the well-dressed suspects and online sleuths identified them by matching the footage with photos taken in nearby restaurants and shared online. On Wednesday, Williams' attorney Fortunato Perri Jr. told reporters that the case was not related to sexual orientation, but was instead a 'mutual confrontation' in which his client 'was not the aggressor'. Heading to police: Philip Williams pictured hearing to a police station on Wednesday with his lawyer. He was one of three 20-somethings who turned themselves in today . Hurt: One of the victims shared this photo of his injuries. One of the men needed his wire sewn shut . Knott's attorney Louis Busico has also denied that the dispute was motivated by anti-gay bias and said his client neither threw any punches nor hurled any insults. 'My client played no role in this,' Busico told reporters on Wednesday. As well as the three suspects, each of whom was photographed in a mugshot released by the police, another allegedly member of the group - who has not been arrested - has been fired from his job as a Catholic high school basketball coach. Fran McGlinn, 25, was said to be among the dozen men and women when the group launched the attack on the couple. Kenneth Gavin, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, told the Daily News that McGlinn has been fired and prohibited from working at any archdiocesan school. Daddy's girl: Kathryn Knott's father, Karl Knott, left, is the police chief for Chalfont, Pennsylvania . Party-goer: Knott's attorney said she did not throw any punches or yell anything at the men during the fight . Night out: The group were caught on surveillance footage the night they allegedly beat up the two men . Gavin said that McGlinn had been serving as a coach on a 'contract basis' at the high school and was not a teacher. District Attorney Seth Williams said on Tuesday in announcing the charges that the case 'shocked the entire country'. 'An assault on people because of their sexual orientation has no place in Philadelphia,' he said. Police had previously thanked members of the public for helping them track down suspects after they posted surveillance footage of the group online. One internet sleuth posted an image of the group he had received from a 'friend of a friend of a friend' showing the group dining out at a restaurant that evening. Caught: Internet sleuths then uncovered this photo of the same group out at a restaurant, leading them to identify some of the members. Cops thanked the internet users for working so swiftly . Kicked out: Fran McGlinn, 25, pictured left and right, has been fired from his job as a basketball coach at a Catholic high school after he allegedly featured in the video. He has not been arrested . Others identified the restaurant as La Viola and then another member of the public found out who had 'checked in' to the restaurant on Facebook - and matched the profiles with the group picture. He then contacted authorities with a list of names. Pennsylvania's hate-crimes law does not cover crimes motivated by a person's sexual orientation. Under current law, a hate crime includes incidents motivated by race, ethnicity, or religion. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, along with openly gay state Rep. Brian Sims of Philadelphia and others, have said the case illustrates the need for a change in the law.

"It's widely accepted that not knowing your biological parents can be psychologically damaging. There have been documented cases of how not knowing who your biological parents can damage your sense of identity and heritage. Damian Adams, from Adelaide, Australia, was conceived using an anonymous sperm donation in the 1970s. Now Mr Adams is hoping to remove some of those psychologically harmful feelings he has felt since discovering he was conceived by a sperm donation. But rather than tracking down his biological father, something which he is legally forbidden from doing, Mr Adams hopes to address a less acknowledged hurdle. Damian, pictured (middle) with his mother and social father. The current practice for the birth certificate of donor conceived children is for the receiving couple to be listed as parents on the birth certificate . Mr Adams believes his birth certificate is inaccurate and that it is having a dehumanising effect on his life . ‘The current legal practice for donor conceived children is for the receiving couple, or commissioning couple, to be listed as parents on the birth certificate,’ Mr Adams told Daily Mail Australia. ‘This means my birth certificate is technically inaccurate. It creates a sense of deception in my life.’ If he is successful, Mr Adams will be the first Australian to have his birth certificate amended so his his father is listed an 'unknown'. 'I'm doing this because I want a factual record of my birth. I'm a firm believer in truth, it's how I was raised. I'm sure my (adopted) father would support me in this decision. I don't need a piece of paper to tell me how much I loved my  father, or how much he loved me.' Mr Adams explained that donor-conceived children suffer from a lack of identity. 'We are are already denied access to their heritage and associated kinship. We are denied our medical history. Many animals have have a more accurate birth record than I do and I find that completely dehumanising.' Mr Adams said that his profession was instrumental in the pursuit. 'I work as a medical researcher. It means I am exposed to a vast range of social and scientific research into adoption and donor conception, which played a role in my decision to pursue this.' Mr Adams said that his profession of medical researcher has exposed to a vast range of social and scientific research into adoption and donor conception, in turn influencing his current pursuit . Mr Adams says he has received support from groups like donor conception Australia, as well as  the full support of my friends and family . Mr Adams filed his his application with the Magistrates Court in Adelaide two weeks ago, but he says that this is something he had resolved to do several years ago. 'I have wanted to do this for a long time, but my family and professional life ended up prolonging the process.' If Mr Adams is successful, he only be second person in the world to have corrected their birth certificate in this way. In July this year, 26-year-old donor-conceived British woman Emma Cresswell became the first person to have achieved the feat, albeit after a six year legal battle. Mr Adams said he wasn't initially influenced by Mrs Creswells plight, but that it was vastly assuring. 'I had decided to do this before I heard about her, but it was very assuring to know that someone had achieved this. Somebody had to take the plunge. It was also opportune timing. If I do get to take this to a Magistrates courtroom, I will certainly be able to use her case to my advantage. The legal system in UK is largely similar to that in Australia.' Mr Adams believes there is no certainty in the outcome of his case to amend his birth certificate, however he believes the case of Emma Crosswell, the only person to have successfully achieved the same pursuit, will assist in his case . However in another sense it proved how difficult the process will be. 'The fact that it took six years, and that it has only ever happened once before-it means I have no certainty of a successful outcome.' Mr Adams says he has received a torrent of support for his cause. 'I've been approached by individuals, as well as support groups like donor conception Australia. There are people in a likewise position who hope to pursue the same path now. I also have the unbridled support of my friends and family, which I'm very grateful for.'","Damian Adams has his adopted father listed on his birth certificate .

"A nurse accidentally disposed of a kidney from a living donor this month at an Ohio hospital, and doctors tried unsuccessfully for at least two hours to resuscitate the organ in what medical experts describe as a rare accident. Administrators are now investigating what went wrong, after a man donated a kidney to his sick, older sister at the University of Toledo Medical Center in Ohio. 'Human error rendered the kidney unusable,' University of Toledo Medical Center spokesman Toby Klinger said on Saturday, but he declined to give more details, citing the hospital's investigation into what happened and its respect for the privacy of the patients involved. Disastrous error: An investigation is underway at the University of Toledo Medical Center after a nurse . accidentally disposed of a kidney a man donated for his sick sister . But one of the doctors involved told Dr . David Grossman, a Toledo-Lucas County health commissioner, that a nurse . disposed of the kidney improperly. Two nurses have been placed on paid administrative leave while the hospital reviews what happened, Klinger said. Grossman told the Blade newspaper in . Toledo that both the . donor and the intended recipient have been released from the hospital. The hospital has voluntarily suspended the live kidney donor program while they review what happened and determine how to prevent errors in the future, according to Dr Jeffrey Gold, the medical center's chancellor and vice president for biosciences and health affairs. Humans do not need two kidneys to live, the body can support life with only one. If one functional kidney is missing from birth, the other kidney can grow to reach a size similar to the combined weight of two kidneys . He said that doctors tried to save the kidney, but 'the physician in consultation with the family decided to not take the risk knowing there was a good chance for another highly compatible donor.' Grossman's office is not involved in the investigation or connected to the medical center, Klinger said. Grossman could not be reached for comment on Saturday. The Toledo-Lucas County Health Department was closed, and Grossman's home telephone number was not available. 'This is unfortunately what medicine is like - it is not perfect' This kind of accident is unheard of in organ transplant centers and it was a good decision not to use the kidney, Dr William Harmon, director of kidney transplantation at Boston Children's Hospital, told the Blade. 'This is unfortunately what medicine is like - it is not perfect, and there have been far worse cases where the donor has died,' Harmon said. Officials at the United Network for Organ Sharing, an agency that oversees the nation's transplant programs, could not be reached for comment on Saturday. There were 16,816 kidney transplants nationwide last year from live donors and from those who consented to organ donation through state registries should they die from an illness or accident, the newspaper reported. Last year, 136 people in Ohio died waiting for a kidney, and 4,711 people died nationally waiting for a kidney, the newspaper reported.","Hospital has shut down kidney donation program and suspended two nurses, pending an investigation into the egregious error .

"It has come under fire in recent months for becoming ever-more intrusive into the lives of the people who use it. However Facebook's most revealing revamp yet will unveil the lives of its millions of users like never before as it delves into people's histories and publishes the information in a 'magazine-style' format. Mixed reaction has met the social networking site's impressive new revamp, with some labelling it as 'creepy but beautiful' and other critics raising concerns about privacy. Facebook's new 'timeline' feature - a . new, deeper profile which allows you to 'fill in' more of your life . pre-Facebook - was announced with some fanfare in September. The 'timeline' view will give your Facebook page a more 'magazine-like' feel - and will, Mark Zuckerberg promises, 'tell the story of your life' Timeline allows you to organise your life into a chronological view - and you can even add the years 'pre-Facebook' Today, the company announced, 'Starting today, timeline is now available everywhere.' Mark . Zuckerberg described timeline as letting you 'tell the whole story of . your life on a single page'. At present, the 'new look' is voluntary - . but a company spokesperson said it will become compulsory in 'a few . weeks'. PaidContent described the makeover as . 'creepy but beautiful', adding: 'Facebook appears to have gained at . least a minor awareness of how intrusive the site can feel. 'With timeline, it is letting users . have a week grace period to tweak and review the page before they spring . their entire life on the rest of the world. 'I strongly recommend everyone use this one week to understand how timeline works before hitting the ‘Publish Now’ button.' In a move which appears to try and reassure users of the timeline feature, both Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg and pop idol Britney Spears both now boast the new-look format on their profiles. The redesigned pages have a more magazine-like photo-heavy feel, with a large 'cover photo' at the top of the page. On . the right of the page there will be a timeline that breaks down all . posts from a person's time on Facebook and allows viewers to jump back . to people's earliest posts with a break down month-by-month. Facebook's new 'timeline' profiles highlight pictures from years ago - but deleting pictures you don't like may be no defence . Facebook's creator Mark Zuckerberg led by example by opting-in to the new profile feature . Tech site CIO.com commented, 'Facebook's . new timeline has the potential to expose status updates and wall posts . from years ago,' and published a guide to 'Important Privacy Settings to . Adjust Now.' You can choose to 'feature' or 'hide' posts that you particularly want highlighted or hidden - but from the . moment you opt in, you only have seven days to do so. 'When you upgrade to timeline, you'll . have seven days to review everything that appears on your timeline . before anyone else can see it,' the site says. 'If . you decide to wait, your timeline will go live automatically after . seven days. Your new timeline will replace your profile, but all your . stories and photos will still be there.' The all-inclusive, show-everything . approach has clearly made some users nervous, 'Time to untag some old . photos,' commented one user via Twitter in the minutes after launch. The redesigned Facebook 'timeline' has also been popular with users - although not with privacy advocates . Exposed: Even people's hobbies, such as film interests (left) and which games they enjoy playing (right), will be revealed for all to see as part of the new-look site . Connections: Facebook's links with music site Spotify will also reveal exactly what bands you are listening to . American business magazine Forbes commented, 'This is going to force users to do some privacy housekeeping. Limiting items to just your friends seems like a good privacy control, but that depends on how liberal you’ve been in friending people.' A technology class at Yale has already created a quiz called 'What's Her Face-book' to work out exactly how well they know people who they are connected to via the site. The new look is much more 'picture-heavy' - and your profile suddenly becomes a showcase for everything you have ever posted. Friends become big pictures, and the site also posts much larger versions of pictures you've taken, shared or been tagged in. Timeline . will also be open to app developers, so that the information can be . used to supercharge apps such as music-sharing application Spotify. Timeline . has been available to a million developers in an early test version . already - but so far has only been available to the public in New . Zealand, chosen as a test bed, presumably, because it has a relatively . low . population - just 4.4 million - and is English-speaking, allowing . Facebook to iron out early problems with the service. One of the new features is 'Cover' - a big picture that you pick to represent yourself, and which forms the top of 'timeline', which replaces your old profile . Facebook are keen to trumpet the fact you can 'hide' features from your 'timeline' You can also edit your timeline for specific Facebook users - but the site only gives you seven days to edit before 'going live', so this feature may be too fiddly for many . The Activity Log lets you review and manage everything you share on Facebook . The . new-look format may prompt many to re-evaluate how much they want to . share on Facebook, with some users proclaiming this latest change is one . step too far. Early reactions suggest this . development could drive users away from the site, with some fearing the . privacy settings could be so confusing it might be easier to leave . Facebook altogether. The biggest piece of advice . offered so far on the changes is make sure you understand how timeline . works before hitting the 'publish now' button. This may force many to carry out some privacy housekeeping on the site. When . profiles migrate to the timeline magazine format, users will have seven . days to scrutinise and approve its content before it is published . online. But it will be up to you to decide who sees this information. To friend or not to friend? The What's Her face-Book quiz helps users establish how many of their connections they truly know . Users are advised to use this . week-long grace period to study the contents meticulously and to make . the necessary privacy adjustments to ensure their life history is not . published for the world to see. After seven days, the timeline format . will automatically be published to your profile. Every . picture, comment and piece of information contained within timeline . will feature a privacy drop-down menu, asking who you want to view it, . whether it be the public, close friends, colleagues or any other . sub-group of users on Facebook. Many . users might think they are being cautious by limiting their information . to only their 'friends' list, but this throws up another dilemma: How . many of your Facebook 'friends' do you actually know? If . you have been too liberal in adding and accepting 'friends' on . Facebook, there's a chance you'll be sharing information with people you . barely know. A new quiz called What's Her Face-Book . tests users on how many people they really know on the site by showing . them randomly-selected pictures of their 'friends' and asking them to . identify them. Based on . your score at the end of the quiz, users will be advised on whether to . keep friends or delete them before allowing them unrestricted access to . personal pictures and other information in the timeline feature.","Update fills in life 'pre-Facebook'

"Kelsea and Andy Hoskins were just like any excited young couple expecting their first baby when they received some shocking news that changed everything. During a routine ultrasound at around the five month mark of Mrs Hoskins' pregnancy, a doctor informed the Quincy, Illinois pair that their unborn son was developing organs outside of his body, a birth defect  known as an Omphalocele. The condition mean that Hayden, as they would soon name him, was growing part of his abdominal organs in a protective sack near his umbilical cord. Scroll down for video . Miracle: An Illinois couple are celebrating the birth of their baby boy this month after he was born with a portion of his abdominal organs outside the body . Perfect: Hayden Hoskins was born to parents Kelsea and Andy at Barnes Hospital in Missouri where he now has his sack of external organs wrapped for protection in bandages . As they listened to their doctor explain the complications and potentially fatal effect on his lung development, neither parent could believe their ears. 'I heard the word Omphalocele and had no idea what that meant,' recalled Mr Hoskins. Happiness: Mr and Mrs Hoskins (pictured with Hayden) learned of the birth defect known as an Omphalocele, at her five month ultrasound when they also discovered the sex of the baby . Survivor: An Omphalocele birth defect happens form as the fetus is growing in the mothers uterus.  Some of the abdominal organs protrude through an opening in the abdominal muscles in the area of the umbilical cord . Luckily for the nervous father-to-be, his wife was in good hands, being taken care of at the Fetal Care Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St Louis, Missouri where obstetricians have delivered many babies with similar complications successfully. Mrs Hoskins' doctor, Dr Allison Cahill described the baby's prospects before his birth to Fox 2 St. Louis KTVI:  'It looks like, on ultrasound, that there are some loops of his bowel and intestine in there but also some portion of his liver.' The concern with these types of defects, she explained to Fox, is that until delivery, there is no way to know if the baby's lungs have been able to grow to capacity. Medical mystery: A medical drawing shows how an Omphalocele baby is born with a transparent sack on the outside of the body carrying the organs . Brave: Kelsea Hoskins (right) walks to the delivery room ahead of her C-section as doctors and family silently hope that the baby's lungs have not been critically impacted by the defect . Warmer: The baby was promptly slipped into a type of sealed plastic bag so as not to lose his body heat or any fluids . But remaining upbeat before her February C-section, smiling mother-to-be Mrs Hoskins told cameras: 'I am nervous but it'll be a good day.' Heading to the delivery room ahead of schedule due to high blood pressure, she and her husband were surrounded by a team of doctors and nurses ready to ensure the baby's survival. To everyone's relief, Hayden let out a few strong screams as he exited the womb showing no signs of the potential heart and kidney trouble that can have fatal results for a newborn Omphalocele at birth. Moving on: Hayden is transferred to the NICO at Children's Hospital nearby for monitoring . Sweet: But not before a tender moment with his mother . 'Really the test is when he's here how he does, so it's always very reassuring when babies come out and they cry,' Dr Cahill said. 'Once he got over here he needed a little bit more help with his breathing so he has a tube down his windpipe.' Hayden was immediately slipped into a medical zip-lock bag to preserve body heat and fluid and after a tender moment between mother and child, he was rushed to the NICU at nearby Children's Hospital, where he will be monitored. Write caption here . Friends forever: The couple's dog Tucker waits patiently for his new roommate . 'We have every expectation that he'll be the little boy that we're soon to discover. Really no anticipated downside to him,' Dr Cahill reassured. In about a year, Hayden will have the sack of organs tucked back into his body and his life will resume as normal. 'Amazing, absolutely amazing,' a proud Mr Hoskins gushed post-labour when asked how he felt. 'Just so relieved,' he added.","Hayden Hoskins was born with a birth defect known as an Omphalocele .

"A second sinkhole has opened in Pasco, Florida next door to the home where a car was swallowed after a 10-foot-wide crater opened in the ground on Monday. Geologists have been called in to survey the hole which initially opened at a width of five-feet, but by mid-afternoon on Tuesday had expanded to the same size as the first depression. One resident has been evacuated bringing the total number of homes evacuated to seven after the first sinkhole developed outside the mobile home park and swallowed a black Hyundai. Sunk: The ground outside another residence in Pasco, Florida has turned into a crater - one day after a 10-foot wide sinkhole opened . Evacuated: The owner of the home was evacuated and later on Tuesday afternoon the hole expanded to the same size as the hole next door . The first hole was barely 4ft wide by 4ft deep when fire crews arrived at the mobile home in Holiday, Florida, at around 10.45am on Monday - but by 11 am it had grown to 10ft by 10ft. The family living at 1728 Torch St, where the hole opened up, have been told their house will be condemned - while five neighboring families were also evacuated. Seven  families were evacuated after the first sinkhole opened up on a driveway in Florida, starting at just 4ft wide by 4ft deep, but growing to 10ft by 10ft in just a matter of minutes . The family who live in this mobile home have already been told their house is unsafe and will have to be pulled down, while other families on the street are staying in hostels for fear of returning . The Red Cross was called to provide temporary shelter for the residents while experts assess the damage to their houses. Heather Furlani, who arrived in Florida just last week with her husband and dog Coco, told WFLA she was given just minutes to leave. She said: 'I ran in and grabbed my purse and here I am. That's all I got – and my dog.' Because the hole is on private property it will be up to the home insurance company to fill in the hole and repair the building, according to a Pasco County Spokesman. Authorities are investigating the cause of the sinkhole and say it is too early to rule anything out as residents blamed nearby construction works . One resident said she was given just minutes to leave, and made it out with just her purse and her dog . Yesterday afternoon the five families were told it was safe to return home, but many said they would spend the night in a hostel for fear of going back. Larry Pickering, a property agent who lives nearby, speculated that construction works could be the reason the hole opened up. Authorities are investigating the cause, and say it is too early to rule anything out.","Second 10-foot-wide sinkhole opens up in Pasco, Florida .

"Thailand police have offered a £13,000 reward in their hunt for the killers of two British tourists. The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on the island of Koh Tao on September 15. A bloodstained garden hoe, believed to be the murder weapon, was found nearby. The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on Koh Tao on September 15 . The last known picture of the pair, together with a group at the sports bar called Choppers - they also went to the AC bar where a group of amateur footballers were celebrating the end of a tournament . The murders – and Ms Witheridge's suspected rape – were the work of a group of at least three 'attackers', two of whom are Asian men, police have claimed, citing analysis of DNA and other evidence . Post-mortem examinations showed that Miss Witheridge, from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, died from head wounds, while Mr Miller, from Jersey, died after severe blows to the head and drowning. Around 150 police officers were posted to Koh Tao as part of the murder investigation but detectives are apparently no closer to finding the killer. Thai police have been criticised for leading a chaotic investigation into the deaths of the tourists in which the line of inquiry has changed several times. More than 170 DNA samples have so far been taken, the Bangkok Post reported on Thursday. Dressed in a pink top and white skirt, Hannah Witheridge looked happy and relaxed as she strolled past fruit stands and in and out of bars on the night before her murder . The movements of David Miller and Miss Witheridge are not known afterwards though some locals claim to have seen them in a bar arguing with an Asian man . A group of Thai footballers are the latest people to be questioned by police amid fears that the hunt for the killers has stalled. A spokesman for the Royal Thai Police confirmed that DNA samples were taken from 'more than eight' footballers - who reportedly threw a late-night party at the AC nightclub where the victims spent their final hours - and officers were awaiting the results. The amateur footballers were allegedly at the nightclub celebrating the end of a tournament while the British backpackers were there. Police have been taking DNA swabs and footprints of people on the island in a bid to find the killers . A police diver searches clues close to where the pair's bodies were found. Local police have come under fire for their handling of the case . Police colonel Kissana Phathanacharoen said a reward of 700,000 baht - roughly £13,300 - was now being offered for information which leads to the arrests of the culprits. Speaking to reporters, he insisted police were doing everything they could to find the killers. He said: 'We're working around the clock. We're trying to narrow our enquiries and collect more evidence. We're encouraging the public who many have information to come forward. 'We're checking DNA but this is not the only thing we are looking at to prosecute the suspects.' Mr Miller's father, Ian, said earlier this week that he believes his son stepped in to help Miss Witheridge during an altercation. He said: 'It has become clearer and clearer that it is quite likely David was stepping in to help a girl who was in trouble.' A group of Burmese migrants who were interviewed by police after bloodstains were found on their clothes have been eliminated from enquiries. No matches were found between them and DNA found on Miss Witheridge and a cigarette butt at the scene. The murders – and Ms Witheridge's suspected rape – were the work of a group of at least three 'attackers', two of whom are Asian men, police have claimed, citing analysis of DNA and other evidence. There is nothing to suggest any of the Thai players at the AC Bar were involved in the crime. However, the perpetrators are believed to be Thai nationals or migrant workers who are around 5ft 7ins tall and have UK size seven feet, according to reports in the Thai media.","Royal Thai Police offer £13,000 reward in hunt for killers of British tourists .

"The return of the England v Scotland fixture next week seems to have captured the imagination of football fans far more north of the border. The friendly at Glasgow’s Celtic Park on Tuesday is on course to be a sell-out apart from the England section of the stadium. The FA were given an allocation of 7,200 for their official supporters’ club but have sold only 5,077 — and hundreds of those have been cancelled after the insistence that the tickets were collected in person in Glasgow before the match, for security reasons. England have not sold their full allocation of tickets for their friendly clash with Scotland in Glasgow . Wayne Rooney takes instruction from Roy Hodgson as England prepare for their forthcoming internationals . England are set to play a Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia before facing Scotland in a friendly . Jack Wilshere stands with his bib over his head as England train at St George's Park . Wembley will be pleased that their security arrangements have rooted out potential troublemakers plus touts looking to sell seats in the English end to the Scottish market. But the empty spaces among the travelling support reflects the match taking place on midweek and England fans’ continued upset that watching games at Wembley is now worth double the loyalty points for Euro 2016 tickets compared to going to away matches. And like in Switzerland and Estonia, that grievance will be the subject of numerous chants by the England fans who do travel to Scotland. The problem with overseas TV feeds of 3pm Saturday Premier League matches being beamed into UK pubs and clubs — prevalent at the start of the season — has been resolved to the extent that beIN Sport, the biggest offenders, will be allowed to show confiscated Saturday afternoon games across their Middle East territory after the international break. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was at Wembley to watch the recent NFL game starring the Dallas Cowboys . Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea owner satisfied Jose Mourinho’s relentless team are on course to becoming No 1 in the country, has charged new commercial chief Christian Purslow with replicating that success off the field. But Manchester United are way ahead of Chelsea in the commercial table. Meanwhile Mourinho, who was at Wembley to watch the American Football, had a pre-match touchline conversation with Jerry Jones, singular owner of the Dallas Cowboys who takes on the NFL authorities in much the same manner Jose does over here. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, who doesn’t look like he’s been near a gym recently, is nevertheless going to attempt to revolutionize the busy fitness market. Ashley’s Sports Direct are opening 200 gyms nationwide, starting in Liverpool. They will have a joining fee of £10 and just £5-a-month membership. This compares with the RFU owned Virgin Active Classic gym at Twickenham where 3,000 members pay £40-a-month for facilities that include an indoor pool. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley (right) cuts an unlikely figure to try and revolutionize the UK fitness market . Horne’s sponsor woe . Alex Horne, general secretary of the FA, claimed a few weeks ago that there would be a sponsor signed up for the FA Cup third round. And the clock is ticking with no backer in sight, according to Wembley insiders, and just four weeks until the draw for the third round is broadcast live. Horne is leaving anyway but heads will have to roll if no sponsor is attracted for this marquee endorsement. Meanwhile, the FA are understood to have agreed to use headhunters to find Horne’s replacement when chairman Greg Dyke had wanted to explore the option of doing the search in-house to save money. That would certainly have left Dyke open to accusations of cronyism in filling one of football’s most important roles. Arsenal invited members of their 1970 winning European Fairs Cup side to their Champions League match against Anderlecht whom they beat 4-3 on aggregate 44 years ago. But bizarrely UEFA do not recognise the Fairs Cup competition as they did not run it and there is no reference to it anywhere on their website or official records. Arsenal invited their former Fairs Cup winners to watch them lose a three goal lead against Anderlecht . The murky backdrop to Massimo Cellino’s ownership of Leeds is that former managing director David Haigh has now been locked up in a Dubai jail for six months without facing a criminal charge. Haigh’s latest move is for his lawyers to write a 78-page legal letter to the PR representatives, Woodstock Leasor, of his former employees GFH Capital alleging they have leaked information to the media about Haigh’s private life. Haigh’s PR representatives have also received heavy legal letters in return.","England have not sold their full allocation for friendly against Scotland .

"It has been another difficult week for Liverpool. A last-minute equaliser conceded in the Merseyside derby followed by a Champions League defeat to Basle has put the club in the spotlight. Since losing in St Jakob-Park, players have been questioned and Brendan Rodgers has been scrutinised, as have Liverpool’s dealings in the transfer window just gone. Amid all that gloom, though, is one shining light: Raheem Sterling. So on Friday morning, when I saw the back page of this newspaper, I was sent into a rage. A headline reading ‘Kop fight to keep Sterling’ was not what was needed before a game of huge significance for Liverpool. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Raheem Sterling nutmeg Rickie Lambert during training . Raheem Sterling (right) shares a smile with Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers in midweek . Sterling's performances have been a rare high point for Liverpool during a stuttering start to the season . The Daily Mail back page on Friday . Do not underestimate the importance of the showdown with West Brom. If Liverpool fail to win again, the international break will be an absolute nightmare and the mood will worsen. Now, before we go any further, I want to make it clear I have no issue about a journalist unearthing a story. Nor, on a separate matter, do I have a problem with agents trying to get the best possible deal for their clients. In both circumstances, people are just doing their respective jobs. The reason for my fury was the timing of this particular story. Whoever has let it be known that Sterling is in no rush to commit his future to Liverpool has made a massive mistake. No thought has been given to the big picture. If anyone around me had put out a story like that about me during my career, never mind the day before a game, our relationship would have been over. My agent, certainly, wouldn’t have done anything like that and I would never have allowed that, even if he had wanted to. No matter what your job, we all like to see our wages increased but in the 18 years I played for Liverpool, I never put pressure on them or went asking for a new contract, as the club were renowned for rewarding those who made progress quicker than anticipated. They still do it now. Daniel Sturridge’s new deal  is evidence of that. Video courtesy: R Buxton / @RichardBuxton_ . Daniel Sturridge has committed to the club with the England forward penning a new five-year deal . Sturridge has endeared himself to Liverpool fans since joining from Chelsea last year . I regularly signed four-year deals that were ripped up within 18 months, either by Peter Robinson — Liverpool’s fabled former chief executive — or his successor Rick Parry, when the club felt my performances had improved. That was the way it was done. Had I found myself central to a story like that, I would have been mortified having to face my manager, so how would Sterling have felt on Friday morning when he walked into Melwood and saw Rodgers before training? What particularly frustrates is that it isn’t the first time we’ve seen stories about Sterling — who has been linked with Real Madrid — and his contract. He is one of Europe’s finest young players, a star in the making, but he is old enough to have his own voice and put a stop to things like this happening. Whoever believes it is a good idea to put pressure on Liverpool has failed to understand the emotion of fans. There is never a good time for these stories to appear but when your team is losing, the last thing you want to read about is potential problems for your star player. It also creates a perception that a player is more interested in money than football, which in turn creates an image. Part of an agent’s duty, after all, is to portray his client in the best light whenever he can. Rodgers and Sterling talk in training this week as Liverpool prepare for a vital fixture with West Brom . Sterling (right) ghosts past Everton's James McCarthy in trademark fashion during the Merseyside derby . They have also not grasped just what Liverpool have done for Sterling since he signed as a 15-year-old in 2010. He and his family have been looked after; Rodgers, meanwhile, has protected and nurtured him, providing him with the platform to showcase his talents. Young players should concentrate on playing games, not get distracted by what is going on off the pitch. That is why it was heartening to see another young star across Stanley Park sign a new contract in the summer without any fuss, how it should be done. Ross Barkley, who is only 20, may have been linked with Manchester City recently but he has committed to Everton and he should not be giving any thought to leaving Goodison Park until after the next World Cup in 2018. That message would also apply to Sterling. If, in the future, both players feel they want to try a new adventure, it should be when they are 24 or 25 and a team will be formed around them. If they were to leave too early, they would simply become pieces in a jigsaw rather than the main building block. Alongside Sterling, Ross Barkley (right) is one of England's brightest stars for the future . Barkley signed a new four-year deal with Everton in July and is recovering from a knee injury . Sterling and Barkley are the two most exciting young players in England and now is the time for them to repay the clubs that have given them such fantastic opportunities and will continue to guarantee them regular starts. Continue as they have been and Liverpool and Everton will have no hesitation about paying them what they are worth. Indeed, Brendan Rodgers has said that it is only a matter of time before Liverpool ‘reward’ Sterling, who has three years remaining on his current deal. This, to be clear, is not a criticism of the money these young players are being paid — I was on the receiving end of such comments from old pros when I was starting out — and I appreciate we all maximise what we can earn. There are, though, ways and means of doing things. The best is behind closed doors. This week I'm looking forward to: Watching Danny Welbeck take another test . The game of the weekend is at Stamford Bridge and you can be certain that both John Terry and Gary Cahill will know they have been in a battle. When Danny Welbeck moved to Arsenal from Manchester United on transfer-deadline day, I thought it was a good signing but not necessarily one that would take them to the title. It looked more like a buy that was made with the future in mind. Welbeck, however, was outstanding in the Champions League win over Galatasaray and the good news for Arsenal supporters is that Arsene Wenger has a track record in nurturing promising young forwards into world-class front men. The evidence is provided by Thierry Henry and Robin van Persie. Danny Welbeck became the 11th Englishman to score a Champions League hat-trick against Galatasaray . Arsene Wenger has a history with raw but talented strikers, such as Thierry Henry (left) and Robin van Persie . To look at Welbeck’s physical attributes, he ticks all the boxes. He has power and pace, a relentless work-rate and he is the type of forward who will never give a defender a moment’s rest. He will be at Terry and Cahill from the start. What he needs to show now, though, is that he has composure in front of goal. Wednesday night was a positive step. His finishing was impressive but holding your nerve when Terry and Cahill are trying to hunt you down is different. Another big performance, though, and Welbeck will be moving in the right direction. Here’s to game's Marvellous characters . It was a treat last week to sit and watch the fittingly named BBC Two drama Marvellous about a man called Neil Baldwin. He was, among other things, Stoke’s kit man under Lou Macari and, if you have not had the chance to see it, I would strongly recommend that you try and view it on catch-up TV. It provides a reminder to all football fans that there is more to clubs than just the players. Characters like Neil Baldwin make clubs what they are. Since I retired, I have been asked numerous times about what I miss most. The first answer, of course, is running out every week at Anfield and winning big games for Liverpool. The story of Stoke kitman Neil Baldwin (right), played by Toby Jones, is a tremendous tale . A close second, though, is not seeing people behind the scenes at Melwood every day: Kenny and ‘Big Jimmy’ on the gate, Anne who worked on reception, Graham, our kit man, and Paul Small the masseur. You see these people every day and then, in a flash, it stops. Every club will have people who work away from the spotlight and get no public credit, but they help create the atmosphere and are worth their weight in gold. That’s why it was enjoyable to see Neil Baldwin get that recognition.","Raheem Sterling is one shining light in the gloom surrounding Liverpool .

"A Baltimore Orioles fan got an unexpected surprise when he stopped to help a motorist trapped in an overturned truck and realized the man helping him was one of his sporting idols. Diehard Orioles fan Mike Soukup was driving southbound on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway on Monday afternoon when he saw the accident and decided to pull over and help. Soukup, 55, started to help one man try to push the truck back on its wheels and after four or five others joined in they were able to get the truck upright. Baltimore Orioles fan Mike Soukup, right, got an unexpected surprise when he stopped to help a motorist trapped in an overturned truck and realized the man helping him was his sporting idols, Chris Davis . When Soukup turned to congratulate the achievement with the man next to him - the one who was the first on the scene - he recognized him as Orioles corner infielder Chris Davis. 'I turned to high five the guy for a good job done getting this truck up, and I thought to myself, ""Man, that looks like Chris Davis,""' Soukup told The Baltimore Sun. Davis received a 25-game suspension on Friday for a second failed drug test for an amphetamine that he later revealed was Adderall. 'When I said, ""Chris?"" and he said, ""Yeah,"" back, he did it as if I was saying it to my best friend Bob,' said Soukup. Soukup posted about the chance meeting with one of his sporting idols on his Facebook page . 'He was a real nice guy. He talked to everybody. He talked to the EMTs. But he should wear the No. 19 all the time just so we can tell.' Medics transported three individuals to Maryland Shock Trauma Center and a 61-year-old man was transported to Shock Trauma with serious injuries that were not considered life threatening. Soukup, a local musician who lives in Severn, also told Davis he thought he got 'screwed' by Major League Baseball, and he said Davis told him he appreciated his sentiment. 'He’s pretty much my favorite Oriole. He seems to be a real nice humble guy who just happens to hit a ball really far. 'I was supposed to make more stops on my way home, but I thought, I can’t. I’ve got to go home and tell my wife about this because my cell phone wasn’t working.' A spokesman for the Orioles confirmed that Davis was listed as a witness in a police report and signed a statement about what happened.

"Clubs who consider signing convicted rapist Ched Evans should take fans’ feelings into account first, according to Oldham Athletic director Barry Owen. Owen brought Lee Hughes to his club in 2007, who had been jailed for causing death by dangerous driving. Now debate has risen over whether Evans, who has been linked with a return to Sheffield United, should be allowed back into the game. ‘We were very mindful of the fans’ thoughts,’ said Owen. Ched Evans did not have his contract renewed at Sheffield United when it expired in 2012 . ‘One of the major points for us was that Lee had shown a lot of repentance for what he had done. That played a big role in our thinking. ‘A lot depends on the public perception of the crime and the type of offence. ‘It’s up to Sheffield United what they do. What I would say is that the law states that this man can be employed again.’ Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister has warned club bosses they cannot ‘wish away’ the Evans’ rape conviction and must remember that the players are not just a footballers but role models to millions of fans. An online petition against Evans return to Sheffield United had attracted 90,000 supporters at the weekend, but by last night, more than 145,000 had put their names to it. The petition, set up by feminist campaigner Jean Hatchet, calls on Kevin McCabe, chairman of Sheffield United, where Evans played until he was jailed, to ‘refuse to reinstate Ched Evans as a player’. It argues: ‘To even consider reinstating him as a player at the same club is a deep insult to the woman who was raped and to all women like her who have suffered at the hands of a rapist.’ Lee Hughes signed for Oldham after he was jailed for causing death by dangerous driving . Today Mr Clegg, an MP in Sheffield, appeared to suggest that he thought the club was wrong to offer Evans a way back. Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in, Mr Clegg told LBC: ‘I think the owners need to think really long and hard about that fact that when you take a footballer on, you are not taking just a footballer these days you are also taking on a role model. ‘You are taking on a role model, particularly for a lot of young boys who look up to their heroes on the football pitch on a team like that, and he has committed a very, very serious crime.’ Mr Clegg repeatedly insisted it was a decision for the club and not for politicians, but added: ‘I really do think that footballers these days, they are major public figures who have a public responsibility to set an example for other people. ‘My opinion is this; rape is an incredibly serious offence, unbelievably serious offence. Evans challenges Germany's World Cup-winning captain Philipp Lahm in an international in 2010 . ‘He has done his time but I just don’t believe that the owners of the football club can somehow wish away the fact that that has happened. ‘And that is what he will be known for and that is something which, particularly for the youngsters following that team they will always be aware of. ‘I think football players these days, they get paid a lot of money, they are public figures and you can’t ignore that.’ Rather than sack Evans when he was jailed, Sheffield United instead chose not to renew his contract when it expired in 2012 . And boss Nigel Clough says bringing him back to Bramall Lane should be a decision taken by the owner and not at football level. ‘We have had one or two discussions, we are awaiting a decision and the owners will make that in good time.’ Clough said. Sheffield United manager Nigel Clough said the decision lies entirely with the club's board . ‘I have been involved in decisions, but it is very much a decision for the owners and when the time is right to say something as a club we will do that. ‘It is that sort of decision - it’s above football level. ‘It’s my decision whether to put him in the team if he comes back, it’s not my decision whether he comes back in the first place - that’s theirs. ‘Until the decision is made there is no point talking about it. ‘It’s not been distraction within the camp. First of all he’s not out yet and secondly the club haven’t made a decision and until those two things happen it is irrelevant.’","Former Sheffield United striker Ched Evans convicted of rape in April 2012 .

Craigcrook Castle, which dates to the 16th century, is up for sale for £5million and could become Scotland's most expensive home . Literary giants like Alfred Lord Tennyson, Hans Christian Andersen, Charles Dickens, George Eliot and Sir Walter Scott have stayed here . Rory Ballantyne, of Ballantynes Estate Agents, which is marketing the property with Sothebys, said: 'Properties like this are very rare. We would expect to pass through that £5 million figure and beyond, by a significant margin. 'It is so enclosed and private that many don't know that it is there and that may attract celebrities and those who value their privacy. 'The lure is the possibility of owning a castle without having thousands of acres to upkeep. 'It really could be described almost as a lock-up-and-leave, and is therefore great for someone who has houses elsewhere.' The literary link was established in the 19th century when Archibald Constable, the publisher, occupied it until 1815. Afterwards it became the home of the lawyer and literary critic Francis Jeffrey. Sir Walter Scott visited the castle frequently under both tenancies. Another 19th century tenant was the writer and politician William Stirling who, in 1855, offered the use of the grounds to the English poet Gerald Massey, then in Edinburgh as an editor on the Edinburgh News. Massey wrote the poem Craigcrook Castle while he was there.

"Pep Guardiola will spark a fresh scramble to secure his services among Premier League clubs after a close confidante reveals that he expects his next job to be in England. Guardiola is under contract at Bayern Munich until 2016 but a new book on his life at the German club reveals he is planning a short, intense career at various club and that England is his preferred next destination. Manchester City would be favourites to recruit Guardiola, given his friendship with Txiki Begiristain, his former Barca team-mate, who is now Director of Football at City and held that role at Bareclona when Guadiola was coach. A close confidante of Pep Guardiola says the Bayern Munich manager expects his next job to be in England . Pep Confidential: The Inside Story is out now . But Pep's preference for England will put Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gatzidis on alert, given the contortions Arsenal went through last season waiting for Arsene Wenger to renew his contract. Wenger, aged 65, signed a three-year deal only at the end of the season but the need to plan for a succession was a prominent theme of last week's Annual General Meeting at the club. Journalist Marti Perarnau had year-round access to Guardiola in the authorised book of his first season at Bayern, Pep Confidential, and wrote: 'Guardiola says: 'I'm a Barça man and always will be.' This doesn't mean, however, that he'll ever be back training Barcelona. In fact, if I were a betting man, I'd say that his future is going to be Bayern and then England. 'Who knows? He may end up in eight-to-ten years taking a curtain call by coaching a national team. He isn't planning a very long career and the family agreement seems to be just that: a limited but intense career span. 'What he would really love to do is manage the youth programme – train young players, oversee their development, teach them the fundamentals and get everything he can out of them. Perhaps he'll do it one day, although it certainly won't happen any time soon. He has three years in Munich and, if he doesn't extend his contract, possibly a stint in England.' Ivan Gazidis would be interested in bringing Guardiola in to replace the possibly departing Arsene Wenger . Txiki Begiristain (right) worked closely with Guardiola at Barcelona and could also be targetting the Spaniard . Begiristain came close to persuading his former colleague to joing City in 2012 whilst Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich was desperate to appoint Guardiola, before Guardiola eventually opted for Bayern. Another close friend, Mallorca coach Miquel Soler, also expects Guardiola to leave Bayern in 2016 and come to the Premier League. 'Will Pep be able to keep this up for more than three years?' said Soler. 'I really doubt it. The guy uses up so much energy. He lives everything at 1000 miles an hour. I think the same thing will happen here as happened in Barça. He'll be exhausted after three or four years and he'll have to take another break. Then he'll be off to England and more of the same.'

The office administrator’s perverted boyfriend would sedate her and often paint her nails and dress her in jewellery before taking photographs of his revolting acts and saving them on his computer. Terrified: Naomi Hampson, 27, only found out she had regularly fallen victim to sick Robert Fryer when police raided the couple's home . Miss Hampson told the Sunday People: . 'I'm disgusted when I think about what he did. It makes me feel dirty . and completely violated. Not remembering anything makes it worse. 'It is so sinister all that time I was . living with someone capable of that. He has no emotion. He is evil. And . if the police hadn't found out I could have still been living with him. It's terrifying.' Fryer, 30, admitted raping her three times between 2008 and 2011 and pleaded guilty to a . separate charge of sexual activity. He was jailed at Nottingham Crown . Court for eight years in September. Policeman's son Fryer has the rare . condition somnophillia - also known as 'sleeping princess syndrome' - . where people get a sexual thrill from others who are asleep, the court . was told.

'I'm disgusted when I think about what he did. It makes me feel dirty . and completely violated. Not remembering anything makes it worse' Naomi Hampson . Miss Hampson was drinking more than . usual but would wake up on the sofa or in bed without any knickers on . and sometimes wearing nail polish or jewellery - but had no memory of . falling sleep. The woman had been single for three . years before meeting Fryer - a spectacle technician with no . previous convictions who even went to her father’s funeral while the . abuse continued. Fryer was arrested after he told a . friend about his despicable attacks, with officers later showing the . pictures to Miss Hampson and explaining that they believed he had . sedated her. Jailed: Fryer admitted raping Naomi three times between 2008 and 2011 at Nottingham Crown Court .

"Oracle says Larry Ellison, 70, is stepping aside as CEO of the company he founded. The business software maker promoted Safra Catz and Mark Hurd to replace him as co-CEOs. Ellison, who co-founded the company in 1977 and is now worth $51.3 billion, will reclaim the title of chairman at Oracle and is also taking the role of chief technology officer. Oracle says Ellison wants to focus on product engineering, technology development and strategy and gave no hint that this is a form of retirement for the New York native. Stepping down: Oracle says Larry Ellison is stepping aside as CEO of the company he founded. The business software maker promoted Safra Catz and Mark Hurd to replace him as co-CEOs . Jeff Henley, Oracle's chairman since January 2004, is now its vice chairman. Catz and Hurd were co-presidents of the Redwood Shores, California, company. Catz will be in charge of the company's manufacturing, finance and legal functions. Hurd will be in charge of sales, service, and other global business units. He  turned 70 in August and many took note that he nonetheless showed no signs he intended to retire. However, the world's fifth richest person made clear in a statement on Oracle's website that he has no intention of letting go of the wheel completely. 'Safra and Mark will now report to the Oracle Board rather than to me,' the billionaire said in a statement. 'All the other reporting relationships will remain unchanged. Soemthing from nothing: Ellison co-founded Oracle in 1977 with $1,200 of his own money and is now the world's fifth richest man with an estimated worth of over $50 billion . Promotion: Company presidents Safra Catz (left) and Mark Hurd (right) will replace 70-year-old Ellison as co-CEOs . Welcome to Ellison Isle: Larry Ellison owns all but a tiny fraction of Lanai, Hawaii's smallest publicly accessible island . Larry Ellison has long been known as an avid collector of the finer things in life. He's even been called a real estate collector, including hundreds of millions worth of property in elite Malibu, California. The software magnate quietly purchased up to  mansions for $250 million, including 12 homes along the coveted Carbon Beach - known locally as 'billionaires beach,' MailOnline reported in May 2013. Buying out the neighbors: Ellison purchased this modern mansion in 2012. It was his ninth property on the Malibu beach called 'Billionaire's row' The only man in the neighborhood: The Malibu 'billionaire's beach' properties dotted in red are believed to owned, or previously owned, by Ellison . All to himself: The homes on 'billionaire's beach' come with their own private ocean front, void of plebians . Ellison also owns all but a tiny percentage of Lanai, Hawaii's smallest accessible public island. Just this summer, he clenched a deal making him the owner of all the islands hotels. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported the deal to buy the historic Hotel Lanai that closed in July made Ellison the owner of every hotel room on the island. Finer things: Later purchased by David Geffen, the 138-meter yacht The Rising Sun was custom built for Ellison in 2004 . Mary Charles’ business owned and operated the hotel in Lanai City since 2007. She tells the Maui News that she believes most of the 28 hotel staffers remain employed at the 10-room hotel. Ellison’s company Pulama Lanai confirmed the deal but declined further comment. The sale price is undisclosed. The Oracle Corp. CEO purchased 98 percent of Lanai in 2012, including the two other hotels on the island. Hotel Lanai is less expensive than the two upscale resorts. It was built in 1923 for Dole Plantation executives. Moving out: Ellison sold this stunning Lake Tahoe home for $20.35million this past July, property records show . 'The three of us have been working well together for the last several years, and we plan to continue working together for the foreseeable future. Keeping this management team in place has always been a top priority of mine.' The shake-up nevertheless opens a new phase in Oracle's history. The Redwood Shores, California, company is trying to adapt to the technological upheaval that is causing more of its corporate customers to lease software applications stored in remote data centers instead of paying licensing fees to install programs on machines kept in their own offices. Before their promotions, Catz and Hurd were Oracle's co-presidents and had been working closely with Ellison for years. Catz is a former investment banker, while Hurd is best known as the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard Co. Hurd stepped down from HP four years ago after that company's board raised questions about his expense report. Ellison ridiculed HP for its treatment of Hurd, a close friend, and hired him at Oracle. Buddy system: Mark Hurd stepped down from Hewlett-Packard four years ago after that company's board raised questions about his expense report. His friend Ellison then brought him on at Oracle .","Current co-presidents at the tech giant Safra Catz and Mark Hurd will step up to become co-CEOs .

"Scene of The Beatles' last ever live concert in 1966 as well as home field for both the Giants and 49ers, San Francisco's Candlestick Park is closing later this month after more than half a century. The cold and windy workhorse stadium has over the years been host to a wide range of memorial events, from countless sporting triumphs to a mass for 70,000 people held by Pope John Paul II in 1987. But the 'Stick' was also a fierce place, where whipping winds and fog from San Francisco Bay often made for chilly conditions for fans and players. After more than a half century of hosting sporting and cultural events, including the Beatles final concert on Aug. 29, 1966, Candlestick Park in San Francisco is officially closing later this month . San Francisco Giants staff gather at Candlestick Point to promote where the new home of the Giants will be built in this 1957 stock image . The city-owned stadium is now set to be demolished for a planned housing, retail and entertainment development. Here are 10 defining moments in its history: . OPENING DAY - 1960 . Richard Nixon was vice president. Willie Mays was a Giants slugger. Both were on hand for Candlestick's opening day April 12, 1960, with Nixon throwing out the first pitch. The reinforced concrete stadium was built for the Giants, who had moved from New York two years earlier and initially played at Seals Stadium. BEATLES LAST LIVE CONCERT - 1966 . The Beatles held their last live concert at Candlestick in 1966. Paul McCartney apologized to the crowd for the weather, noting it was 'a bit chilly.' MAYS' 3,000TH HIT - 1970 . Giants center-fielder Willie Mays joined an elite list of players with his 3,000th hit in 1970. Mays finished his career with 660 home runs, fourth on the all-time list, behind Barry Bonds, Hank Aaron and Babe Ruth. The San Francisco Giants play the Pittsburgh Pirates in this 1999 file photo. In a bow to historical symmetry, the Stick's finale will be a performance on Thursday by Paul McCartney, 48 years after the Beatles' last scheduled concert lit up the venue . The Candlestick's opening day was April 12, 1960, when then Vice President Richard Nixon threw out the first pitch, with Giants slugger Willie Mays also in attendance . San Francisco Giants's Willie Mays connects with the 3,000th hit of his career, a single to left, in the second inning against the Montreal Expos at Candlestick Park in San Francisco in this July 1970 file photo .

The catch: Dwight Clark of the 49ers makes the touchdown catch on a pass from Joe Montana in January 1982 to send the team to their first ever Super Bowl . THE CATCH - 1982 . Quarterback Joe Montana lofted a touchdown to Dwight Clark to win the NFC championship game in January 1982 and send the 49ers to their first Super Bowl. The 49ers won that year's NFL title and four more through 1995. PAPAL VISIT - 1987 . Pope John Paul II held a mass in 1987 for more than 70,000 people. WORLD SERIES QUAKE - 1989 . The 6.9-magnitude Loma Prieta earthquake hit as millions of TV viewers took in Game 3 of the Bay Bridge World Series between the Oakland Athletics and the Giants in 1989. The quake caused up to $10 billion in damage, but the park sustained only minor damage. After a 10-day postponement, the Athletics finished a sweep of the Giants. A FOOTBALL RECORD - 1994 . 49ers wide receiver Jerry Rice caught two touchdown passes from Steve Young during a 1994 game to break Jim Brown's long-held record of 126 career touchdowns. A woman sits in a 1960 Chevrolet Corvette, with the then half-built stadium behind her. The city-owned stadium is now set to be demolished for a planned housing, retail and entertainment development . Pope John Paul II held mass for 70,000 people at Candlestick Park on September 18 1987 . Ground was broken in 1958 for the stadium and the Giants selected the name of Candlestick Park, after a name-the-park contest the next year . One of the most inspirational moments in the history of Candlestick Park was in August 1989 when an Francisco Giants pitcher Dave Dravecky made his return to baseball after having a cancerous tumor removed from his pitching arm . San Francisco Giants' Barry Bonds celebrates on top of the Giants dugout after they beat the San Diego Padres to win the National League West title in 1997 . GIANTS MOVE ON - 1999 . In the early 1990s, the Giants appeared set to move to Florida. But an ownership group committed to keeping the team in San Francisco persuaded voters to approve a new, largely privately funded park. The Giants played their last game at Candlestick in September 1999 and moved into what's now called AT&T Park the following season. 49ERS MOVE ON - 2014 . Despite multiple renovations, Candlestick's age began to show. The 49ers complained about rusty light towers, clogged concession stand drains and other maintenance problems. Unable to reach a deal on a new stadium in San Francisco, the team looked 45 miles south to Santa Clara, where the team will play in the new Levi's Stadium in Silicon Valley starting this year.

"Stuart Pearce points out that grappling, holding and shirt-pulling in the penalty area is simply bad defending - and insists only harsh action will get rid of it. The former left back, now Nottingham Forest manager, is adamant that until referees start awarding penalties for every single instance which ends up deciding the results of matches, the practice will never stop. In 17 matches this season he has not seen a single penalty awarded to his side or the opposition for the offence. Stuart Pearce believes referees must start awarding penalties to eradicate grappling in penalty areas . The issue has come to the fore once more following Manchester United's 1-1 draw against Chelsea on Sunday . Stoke's Ryan Shawcross (right) conceded a penalty for this grapple with Swansea's Wilfried Bony in October . Liverpool's Martin Skrtel (centre) has also been penalised in the past for penalty area blocking and holding . HANDS OFF IN THE BOX is Sportsmail's new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box. Whether it is wrestling, grappling, shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the Manchester United vs Chelsea match - the area has become a free-for-all for cheating. And that means fewer goals in the Barclays Premier League. For too long, referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring. It's time to end that. So join us in our campaign to say Hands Off In The Box to players and referees. We’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it. ‘It has become a part of the game at the moment,’ Pearce (right) said. ‘Part of me thinks it’s poor defending, I see players not even looking at the ball. That can’t be right. ‘We’ve got to understand when you’re holding someone in the box, it’s bad play, because you’re actually giving a penalty away. ‘The only way it will get outlawed is if the officials start giving penalties for every individual hold that there is in the box. ‘You either ignore it in both boxes, which really seems to be what’s going on at this moment in time, or alternatively you stamp down on it and you might get three or four penalties and it might decide the result of games.’ It was never a tactic Pearce employed as a defender. He won 78 caps for England and made more than 700 appearances in English football. The 52-year-old claims that barely any grappling and holding happened in the area when he was a player. ‘I’ve got to say when I played there wasn’t anywhere near as much grappling in this country that I’m seeing in the game at the moment,’ he explained. ‘I think we only ever really saw it on the international stage, if I’m being honest. ‘But it has come into our game and myself as a manager and a footballing person would be quite happy to see the officials stamp on it a little bit more than they are at present. ‘It’s difficult for officials. If you isolated every individual one-on-one marking situation in the box, you’d probably see three or four penalties at every corner or free kicks.’ As a manager, this is not an aspect of the game Pearce encourages amongst his own teams. He added: ‘You certainly don’t coach your team at set plays and say just ignore the ball and grapple hold of your striker. That’s common sense. You watch the ball, you watch your man and you deal with the ball and you attempt to head it before he does if it comes into your area. It’s as simple as that.’ Pearce’s playing career spanned 24 years, starting at Wealdstone in 1978 and ending in 2002 at Manchester City. He believes this scourge on the game has been brought on by the high demands placed on players and managers to get results. ‘The game’s become very clinical in this day and age, in regards to the organisation of teams and the pressure that’s put on the teams and the managers,’ Pearce said.

"Nottingham Forest have completed the loan signing of Hull midfielder Tom Ince. Reds boss Stuart Pearce was in talks with the  Premier League club for several days and on Thursday morning an agreement was reached for the 22-year-old winger to move to the City Ground on a deal until December 28. Pearce is keen to breathe new life into his side's promotion push, following a seven-match winless run in the  Championship, and Ince will go straight into the Forest squad for Saturday's trip to Huddersfield.

Ince, who Pearce knows well from his time as England Under 21 manager, joined Hull from Blackpool in the summer but has found first-team opportunities limited at the KC Stadium and has not been involved in Steve Bruce's squad for the past month. Ince is a proven quality at Championship level, having scored 18 goals for Blackpool during the 2012/13 season - a campaign which saw him named the Football League Young Player of the Year. Forest haven't won a game in over a month, falling off the pace in the Championship after a good start .

"A multi-million pound visitor centre at one of Scotland's most famous beaches has been rejected - after fears that the sight of it would irritate golfers at St Andrews iconic Old Course. The trust behind the plans behind the visitor centre which was to look like dunes said councillors had turned down the opportunity to replace 'third-world facilities' for the public in favour of the 'golfing elite'. A building described as 'iconic' and 'radical' would have housed a visitor centre, new cafe and toilets on the West Sands in St Andrews. An artist's impression of how the proposed multi-million pound visitor centre would have looked . The existing facilities on West Sands includes this rather unappealing cafe . The toilets at West Sands are in desperate need for improvement - but now this might not happen . A new lifeguard station, recreational area and boardwalk were also to be created. Fife Coast and Countryside Trust was denied planning consent for its ambitious development, resulting in the loss of cash promised from several sources, including £1.3m from the Coastal Communities Fund in the last year such funds were available. The Coastal Communities Fund's deadline for applications has now passed. Chief executive of Fife and Coast Countryside Trust, Amanda McFarlane and Tom Morton, the architect behind the design deemed unacceptable, hit out at councillors. Mr Morton, of Arc Architects, said the debate focused on how the development might disturb the view of golfers even though it would have been hidden behind a five-metre dune. The facilities at St Andrews golf course - a far cry from what's outside the gates . The new visitor centre would have 'irritated' golfers on St Andrews' Old Course, allegedly . Plans for re-development of the public area at West Sands have fallen through because of golfers' complaints . He said: 'There was no discussion of the benefits of the project in improving management of the beach and public safety, the educational facilities for schoolchildren, the support it would have given to local volunteer groups and businesses and the new jobs created by a £1.6m improvement in public facilities for visitors to the beach. 'This decision means that St Andrews is destined for the foreseeable future to have extensive luxury facilities for the golfing elite looking out over decrepit, third-world facilities for the general public.' CEO Amanda McFarlane said she was 'gutted' by the outcome. She added: 'We now have to go back to our funders and tell them we don't want their £1.6m.' The new visitor centre would have added jobs as well as excellent public amenities to West Sands . The 32ft double bowl-shaped centre was designed to look like overlapping waves or dunes. The design and size of the proposed visitor centre was deemed unacceptable, partly because of the impact on views for golfers on the adjacent Old Course - the oldest golf course in the world. In an objection penned to Fife Council, St Andrews Links Trust CEO Euan Loudon said: 'Aspects of this development have the potential to damage the authenticity and reputation of the golf course experience.' The final say fell to St Andrews councillor and former Fife provost Frances Melville, as the committee was split 50-50 and her casting vote blackballed the 9.5 metre-high building, which planning officers described as striking, unique and iconic. While the Old Course will continue to have luxurious facilities... Despite being a major attraction in the popular tourist town, the beach - which starred in the opening scenes of the 1981 Chariots of Fire film - has run-down toilets and a cafe open only on a seasonal basis. Mrs McFarlane said: 'The project would have created eight new jobs, 22 indirect jobs and helped to safeguard over 1,400 tourism related jobs.' Cupar councillor Bryan Poole tried to persuade the committee to approve the 'radical' design. Mr Poole said: 'The mistake would be to look at it from the point of view of golfers because it is for the people using the beach. ...the general public will have to settle for more simplistic amenities . 'I really think it is a radical design. It will replace two pretty decrepit buildings which are of no value at all.' He was backed by Councillor Donald Lothian, who said a 'leap of faith' was required. Although she admitted there was a need for new facilities, Mrs Melville highlighted the many tournaments staged at the Old Course, which is due to host the British Open again next year, and said other buildings in the 'flattish' landscape were 'not very high'. She said: 'There are too many issues. Due to the design, height and visual impact, I'm uncomfortable with it.' Several councillors abstained from the vote due to a conflict of interests, leaving the decision to eight members.","Development was to begin on Scottish beach West Sands .

"When Rajo Devi Lohan made headlines around the world by becoming the world's oldest first-time mother, critics said she was putting her health at risk and condemning her daughter to the agony of losing her parents at a young age. She gave birth, following controversial IVF treatment, at the age of 69, then nearly died from complications with the delivery. But now, five years later, the 74-year-old says having her daughter, Naveen, has made her stronger and helped her live longer. You're only as old as you feel: Naveen, five, hugs her 75-year-old mother, Rajo Devi Lohan, at their home in the remote village of Hissar, India. Rajo says that having her daughter has helped her live longer . Following her bout of ill health, the frail mother believes her desire of seeing her little one marry is giving her the strength to fight on and live to see the special day. Rajo, who lives in the remote village of Hissar, India, with Naveen, her husband Ballo and his second, younger wife Umi, said: 'The only reason I am still alive in spite of my illness is Naveen. She is a gift to me from God and until I get her married I cannot afford to die. 'I will get her married when she turns 15-years-old, but until then I simply cannot die.' At the time of Naveen's birth, many questioned whether it was morally right for a pensioner to have children, while also suggesting it is detrimental to the health of an OAP. And their doubts appeared to be justified when Rajo fell gravely ill, almost dying from post-birth complications related to her IVF treatment. But after battling back, Rajo has even outlived her doctor who guided her through the process, and she puts it all down to having something to live for - daughter Naveen. Hard work: Rajo was 69 when she had Naveen. At the time of Naveen's birth, many questioned whether it was morally right for a pensioner to have children, while also suggesting it is detrimental to the health of an OAP . The best part of parenthood... Naveen takes a nap, giving Rajo a no doubt well-needed break . Rajo said: 'When Naveen was born the . Doctor had asked me to take complete bed rest but I did not listen to . him and that's why my health got so bad. 'I . am not used to resting and that's why I could not help myself but work . even after she was born. For me work is what I have done all my life. 'But . I am feeling much better now. The doctor took very good care of me, but . unfortunately he has since died. He spent a lot of money on my medical . expenditure, to help me get a child. 'When . I used to look around and see children, my heart felt sad that I . couldn't have one - I desperately wanted to have a child of my own. 'Every one celebrated when she was born. The villagers were very happy and every one came to see her.' Raison d'etre: After a spell of ill-health, Rajo has now even outlived her doctor who guided her through her controversial IVF treatment, and she puts it all down to having something to live for - daughter Naveen . Plenty of support: Rajo lives in the remote village of Hissar, India, with Naveen, her husband Ballo, left, and his second, younger wife Umi - her sister. Many more of the family's relatives live in the close-knit village . Despite entering her twilight years, Rajo isn't worried about Naveen's future when she dies. 'Naveen does not need to worry about her future, she has her other mother, Umi, her uncles, relatives and father to look after her,' she said. 'As Naveen is the my only child she will inherit all my property which includes 566,280 sq/ft of land. Her future will be secure.' Well looked after: As Rajo's only child, Naveen stands to inherit all her mother's property when she dies . Naveen's step-mother Umi, who is Rajo's sister and married Ballo when he thought Rajo was unable to bear him a child, added: 'Naveen is very dear to me, I can't have her away from me for long. 'I will make sure that after her mother passes away, she will not miss out on that love and affection Rajo provides her. 'Rajo is still the one who prepares her for the school in the morning - Naveen does not let me do it, she insists her mother will do it. She is very proud of Rajo and loves her dearly.' Energetic Naveen has begun attending the local village primary school. She is proud of her mother, despite the old woman's evident struggle to keep up at times. Naveen said: 'I love my mother very much. I also love my father but I love my mother more than him.'","Rajo Devi Lohan became pregnant after controversial IVF treatment .

"President Barack Obama has a veto pen, and he will use it to block GOP-passed legislation if necessary, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said on Thursday. But, Earnest, said, Obama would rather work with Republicans instead of against them. 'So if that means another round of golf with Speaker [John] Boehner....then he's willing to do that. If it means sittin' down at the table and enjoying some Kentucky bourbon with Mitch McConnell, if that's going to advance our ability to find common ground among' he said, then Obama's willing to do that, too. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Obama would rather work with Republicans instead of against them. 'So if that means another round of golf with Speaker [John] Boehner....then he's willing to do that. If it means sittin' down at the table and enjoying some Kentucky bourbon with Mitch McConnell' then Obama's willing to do that, too. Earnest's suggestion that Obama may bond with McConnell over bourbon was in reference to a comment the president made on Wednesday during press conference. In response to a question from a reporter, Obama said he 'would enjoy having some Kentucky bourbon' with the Republican leader as a show of good faith. The joke harkens back to the 2013 White House Correspondents Dinner. At the annul roast Obama told the audience, in jest, 'Why don’t you get a drink with Mitch McConnell!' The dis was in response to critics of the president who had said he he needed to extend a hand across the aisle to the opposition. McConnell responded to the jab by posting a picture of himself with a beer at a bar sitting next to an empty chair and a glass of red wine. At yesterday's presser, in which Obama addressed the GOP gains in the House and Senate, ABC News' Jon Karl reminded the president of the dig, at which point Obama said he'd welcome a drink with McConnell. 'I don’t know what his preferred drink is,' Obama said to laughter, adding that McConnell 'has always been very straightforward' with him. 'To his credit, he has never made a promise that he couldn’t deliver,' Obama admitted. 'And he knows the legislative process well. He obviously knows his caucus well -- he has always given me, I think, realistic assessments of what he can get through his caucus and what he can’t. 'And so I think we can have a productive relationship.' Obama seemed open on Wednesday to engaging the GOP leaders through less combative means than has typically been employed by both political parties since Republicans took control of the House in 2011. 'If the ways that we’re approaching the Republicans in Congress isn’t working, I’m going to try different things - whether it’s having a drink with Mitch McConnell or letting John Boehner beat me again at golf, or weekly press conferences,' he said. 'I don’t know if that would be effective,' he added amid laughter from the press corp. Since Obama's press conference yesterday McConnell and Boehner came out with a list of Republican sponsored legislation they'd like to see approved by Congress and sent to the president's desk next year. Among those were bills that would gut Obamacare, the president's legacy-making law. When Republicans take a majority of both chambers beginning in January they will have enough votes to pass legislation repealing the health care reform act, forcing Obama to wet his ink straight out of the gate. 'The president does have a pen on his desk. I’m confident that he’ll be in a position, where he’ll have to veto some legislation where Democrats and Republicans are not able to find some common ground,' Earnest warned on Thursday in an interview on MSNBC show Morning Joe. 'The president's eager, however, to actually sign pieces of legislation that have strong bipartisan support.' The bourbon bonding joke harkens back to the 2013 White House Correspondents Dinner. At the annul roast Obama said in jest, 'why don’t you get a drink with Mitch McConnell!' while referencing criticisms that he hadn't tried hard enough to find common ground with the GOP leader . McConnell responded to the dig by posting this picture of himself sitting in a Kentucky bar with a beer next to an empty chair and a glass of wine on twitter . In an interview at Fox News on Thursday morning Earnest said the president is fully aware that he and Republican leadership are not 'gonna to agree on everything.' 'There are things that the president's gonna do that Republicans won't agree with. There are bills that Republicans are gonna pass that the president doesn't agree with,' he said. 'The question really is, are we gonna to focus on the disagreements, or are we gonna to focus on those areas' where Republicans and Democrats can work together. Policy disagreements are no 'excuse' not to work together to make the country better, Earnest told reporters during his daily briefing on Thursday. Finding middle ground will be the  'focal point' of the White House in the weeks and months ahead and the topic of 'ongoing' conversations with Capitol Hill leaders, starting with a bipartisan luncheon at the White House tomorrow, he on Thursday. Playfully asked on MSNBC if McConnell and Obama would finally grab that bourbon together during tomorrow's meeting, Earnest said, 'I think tomorrow will be focused on business. I don't know that there will be a lot of drinking.' At the meeting Obama and congressional leadership will also discuss a request the president put forward for additional funding to fight Ebola. Earnest said on Thursday. If the president and McConnell do 'share a glass of bourbon,' he said, it will be in a private setting, not a public one, like tomorrow's meeting. Earnest told ABC reporter Jon Karl today that a date has not been set for the get-together 'but stay tuned.' 'I think the fact of the matter is the president is interested in trying to build some relationships with members of Congress to try to advance some of these priorities,' Earnest said Thursday morning when he was asked about the anticipated bourbon summit while on Fox. Let's be clear, though, he said, voters 'aren't just looking for the president to sit down and have a drink with Mitch McConnell and play a round of golf with Speaker Boehner.They actually want results. 'And if there are things that the president can do differently, he said, to make sure that we're getting results for middle class families for the American people, then he's willing to change his tactics to do exactly that,' Earnest said. At his briefing today with reporters Earnest struck a similar tone. It's not as if 'an extra cocktail party or another round of golf would have substantially changed the outcome' of the last few years, he said. 'But what will substantially change the outcome is a re-dedication on the part of this administration' to work with Republicans, he said, and 'a different political calculation' by the GOP that would make them more inclined to work with the president to put into law legislation that both sides agree on.","Obama has a veto pen, and he will use it to block GOP-passed legislation if necessary, Josh Earnest said on Thursday .
But Obama would rather work to find 'common ground' with Republicans than fight with them .
'If it means sittin' down at the table and enjoying some Kentucky bourbon with Mitch McConnell' then Obama's willing to do that, Earnest said .
Obama said Wednesday he'd have a drink with McConnell if the GOP leader wanted to; joke goes back to jab Obama made at the senator in 2013 ."
"The Vatican put its former ambassador to the Dominican Republic under house arrest Tuesday after opening a criminal trial against him, the first time a high-ranking Vatican official has ever faced criminal charges for sexually abusing youngsters. Josef Wesolowski had already been defrocked in June after the Vatican's canon law court found him guilty of abuse and imposed its toughest penalty under church law: laicization, or returning to life as a layman. On Tuesday, the Vatican City State's separate criminal court opened a preliminary hearing into his case and ordered him to be placed under house arrest. The Vatican put its former ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Josef Wesolowski (pictured), under house arrest Tuesday after opening a criminal trial against him . Wesolowski had already been defrocked in June after the Vatican's canon law court found him guilty of abuse . A Vatican statement said Wesolowski presented medical documentation detailing health concerns that presumably prevented a more restrictive type of detention. The Vatican has a few small detention rooms inside its police barracks, but no long-term facilities. The Holy See recalled the Polish-born Wesolowski in August, 2013, after the archbishop of Santo Domingo told Pope Francis about rumours that Wesolowski had sexually abused teenage boys in the Caribbean country. Dominican authorities opened an investigation, but declined initially to press charges since the Vatican had said Wesolowski enjoyed diplomatic immunity. Polish prosecutors opened an investigation as well. A Santo Domingo court, though, took the first steps toward possibly charging him last month after the Vatican said he had lost his immunity when he was defrocked and could be prosecuted elsewhere. The office of the Dominican Republic's attorney general said Tuesday it was requesting specifics from the Vatican about how it came to its decision to put Wesolowski under house arrest and open a criminal trial against him. Spokeswoman Tessie Sanchez said Attorney General Francisco Dominguez Brito wanted more details from the Vatican before commenting further on the latest developments in Wesolowski's case. In an August interview with The Associated Press, Dominguez welcomed the Vatican announcement that Wesolowski had lost his diplomatic immunity and could be tried by Dominican or other courts. Wesolowski could face jail time if found guilty by the Vatican criminal court, which has jurisdiction over crimes committed within the tiny Vatican City State or by any of the Holy See's diplomatic personnel. It is unclear where he would serve any possible term: inside the Vatican or in an Italian prison. Pope Francis, pictured in St Peter's Square on Wednesday, has said no prelate, whether a priest or a cardinal, has any privileges when it comes to sex abuse . The case against Wesolowski has been closely watched, given the grave nature of the charges and the fact that the Vatican had faced criticism that it had shielded Wesolowski from Dominican jurisdiction by recalling him last year. In fact, many countries would have done the same with diplomatic personnel facing possible criminal charges abroad. The case has also been a test of Francis' willingness to sanction even a high-ranking Vatican official for a crime the Holy See has long sought to blame on wayward priests, not direct representatives of the pope. Francis has said no prelate, whether a priest or a cardinal, has any privileges when it comes to sex abuse.","Josef Wesolowski was defrocked in June after being found guilty of abuse .

"A Chinese school boy spent six days sleeping at an IKEA store and living off free food samples after he got in trouble with his mother when he didn’t do his homework. Peng Yijian, from Shanghai in China, was sent home from school last Monday morning after his mother received a phone call by a teacher saying that he hadn’t done his maths assignment. But the 12-year-old ran away from his Binnan Road home about 12.15pm following an argument with his mother, known as Liu. Peng Yijian, from China, ran away from home and spent six days sleeping at IKEA . Mrs Yijian told Shanghai Daily that her son only had 1.5 yuan (28 cents AUD) in his pocket when he left and reportedly survived off free food samples from the supermarkets. The student from Longyuan Middle School was spotted by police on Tuesday afternoon at the IKEA outlet in Xuhui District and was taken to hospital for treatment. Mrs Yijian said her son was ‘very weak with hunger’ when he was found near an escalator on the ground floor and has since received an intravenous drip. The parents said they were grateful for all the help from everyone and promised to have better communications with their son in the future. The 12-year-old was sent home from school for not completing homework and ran away from home following an argument with his mother, known as Liu . After the seventh grade student was reported missing last Tuesday, police found CCTV footage of the boy at Shanghai South Railway Station and Carrefour outlet. ‘We thought there might be other places he likes to visit, so we asked his mother,' police officer Sun Miao told Shanghai Daily. ‘She gave us eight or nine names, including Caoxi Park, Nanfang Shopping Mall, In Center and IKEA.' Mrs Yijian also added that her son had previously run away before but was never gone for this long.","A Chinese boy was sent home from school for not completing homework .

"Lionel Messi has revealed he is more focused on winning titles with Barcelona than competing with Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo for individual honours. The La Liga duo, who have between them won the last six Ballon d'Or awards, are often compared to each other due to their fine goalscoring records in Spain and Europe.

"The death of a University of Louisville cheerleader this summer has been ruled a drug overdose, with police confirming she was found in the apartment of a popular freshman footballer who has since left the college. Danielle Cogswell, 22, was found dead July 28 in the off-campus Kentucky apartment of wide receiver Cameron Polk,  who was later kicked off the team for an unrelated drug charge. Autopsy results have now shown Cogswell died of a lethal mix of heroin, amphetamines and the prescription drug Xanax, according to the police report obtained by WAVE3. Cogswell's sister said she star athlete had battled a drug problem for the last two years and had, as far as the sister knew, smoked heroin two weeks before her death. Autopsy: Dani Cogswell (right) died in July of a lethal mix of heroin, amphetamines and the prescription drug Xanax, according to the police report . Overdose: Cogswell, described as an 'elite athlete', went to sleep in the apartment of freshman footballer Cameron Polk (not pictured) on July 28 and never woke up, police said . A witness told police she seemed high and 'slow' the night before her body was found. She had been watching a movie with Polk in the bedroom of his apartment. Polk told police Cogswell fell asleep early in the morning and he left the bedroom, falling asleep himself in the living room. When he returned to bedroom about 9am, Polk said he found Cogswell unresponsive. He panicked and had a roommate call 911, WAVE3 reported. Police reported no foul play in the death of Cogswell during their initial investigation. On October 7, about 11 weeks after Cogswell's death, campus police entered Polk's apartment and found marijuana, hydrocodone pills and codeine syrup. Polk received a citation for trafficking a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of school as a result and was released by the school. Student housing: Dani Cogswell died in an apartment at Cardinal Towne north of the University of Louisville campus. Police have since confirmed it was the apartment of freshmen Cameron Polk . Dismissed: Wide receiver Cameron Polk, who was with Cogswell the night before she was found dead, has since been released from the university on a separate drug charge. He has not been charged in Cogswell's death . Disbelief: Friends of Cogswell, seen here with Drew Malone, are still in shock at her death . Beloved: Social media was flooded with messages of disbelief and grief at Cogswell's sudden death . Cogswell, who tranferred from the University of Arizona a year ago to be a part of the University of Louisville's cheerleading program, was described by the university's sports information director Kenny Klein as an 'elite athlete.' The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) requires regular drug testing for college athletes, but cheerleading is not part of the association and therefore team members do not undergo drug screenings, Klein told the Louisville Courier-Journal . 'Obviously we're devastated at the loss of Dani,' Klein said at a media conference.'She . was clearly, as you've seen from the photographs that are circulating, . beautiful on the outside but that paled in comparison to her inner . beauty. She was incredibly talented.''At . the University of Louisville, as most people know, our spirit program . is nationally and world-renowned. And Dani absolutely fit the bill for . one of our elite athletes. She is definitely at an elite status within . an elite program. She was on the upper echelon of our program here.' Troubled: Cogswell had issues with drugs dating back at least two years, her sister told police . Using the hashtag #RIPDani, countless friends, teammates and acquaintances expressed their sorrow at her death. 'My other half is gone. I know she will be watching over me,' wrote Daria Daspin. The university was unable to confirm any further details surrounding Cogswell's death. 'The University of Louisville spirit program is devastated to lose one of our beautiful and talented team members,' spirit coach Todd Sharp said in a statement. 'Dani had a contagious smile and a spirit that would ignite the room. She will be greatly missed.'","Cheerleader Danielle Cogswell was found dead in an apartment near the University of Louisville campus in July .

"As one of Hollywood's greatest sex symbols, she was known to have a turbulent private life. Now, Marilyn Monroe's love letters - and bizarrely, one of her bras - are being put up for auction in Beverly Hills, California. The letters, penned by the actress and her lovers, including playwright Arthur Miller and baseball great Joe DiMaggio, are among 300 items to go on sale as part of 'Marilyn Monroe's Lost Archives'. Other artifacts include a 19-minute reel of a movie made for Monroe after her final picture, 1961's 'The Misfits', in which the star is seen frolicking happily at the beach with her co-star, Clark Gable. Scroll down for video . For sale: Marilyn Monroe's love letters - and bizarrely, one of her bras (pictured) - are being put up for auction as part of 'Marilyn Monroe's Lost Archives' at Julien's Auctions in Beverly Hills, California, next month . Personal: The letters, penned by the actress and her lovers, including playwright Arthur Miller and baseball great Joe DiMaggio, are among 300 items to go on sale. Above, a 1954 letter from DiMaggio to Monroe . Couple: One letter, written by DiMaggio (seen with Monroe) when the star said she was filing for divorce, reads: 'I love you and want to be with you. There is nothing I would like better than to restore your confidence in me' They also feature the actress's white bra, a framed letter from costume designer Cecil Beaton, a Dior black silk dress and a fawn-colored silk overcoat with a black velvet collar. With regard to the love letters, one written by DiMaggio when Monroe announced she was filing for divorce after a matter of months in 1954 reads: 'I love you and want to be with you'. It continues: 'There is nothing I would like better than to restore your confidence in me.' DiMaggio, a famously stoic and private man, was pictured crying at Monroe's funeral in 1962 and for the following two decades, had flowers placed at her crypt several times a week . Never before seen: Another letter (pictured) in the collection - which will go on sale at Julien's Auctions next month - is from Monroe to her third and final husband, Miller, in which she muses about her insecurities . Romance: 'Please, if I've ever made you cry or made you even more sadder, ever for a second, please forgive me, my perfect girl. I love you,' Miller (pictured with Monroe) wrote in a  P.S. in one letter back to Monroe . In his letter, addressed to 'Mrs Joe DiMaggio and mailed special delivery, he wrote that he learned Monroe was leaving him only when he saw her make the announcement on television. 'My heart split even wider seeing you cry in front of all these people,' he penned. Another  letter in the collection - which will go on sale at Julien's Auctions in Beverly Hills next month - is from Monroe to her third and final husband, Miller, in which she muses about her  insecurities. Others are from Monroe's friends, such as Clark Gable, Cary Grant and Jane Russell; with the latter imploring the actress in 10 handwritten pages to give her marriage to DiMaggio another chance. Elegant: Other artifacts include a framed letter from costume designer Cecil Beaton and a number of items of clothing, including this fawn-colored silk overcoat (pictured) with a black velvet collar and apricot satin lining . On display: A Dior black silk velvet dress worn by Monroe (left) and an Oster 'Osterizer' chrome beehive blender with an original glass jar (right), which was used by the star, are seen on display at Julien's Auctions . 'It really gives you the chills when you read some of the stuff and see the intimacy and the personal nature of it,' said auction curator Martin Nolan, who spent nine months organizing  the collection. Auction owner Darren Julien said the pieces could fetch more than $1million, citing a watercolor that Monroe painted with the aim of giving it to President John Kennedy. The artwork sold for $80,000 at an estate auction nine years ago. Monroe's 'collectability' has skyrocketed in recent years, driven in part by deep-pocketed Asian and European collectors with a fondness for American pop-culture artifacts, Mr Julien said. The fact that the centerpiece of this collection is not just celebrity tchotchkes but deeply personal artifacts is also expected to fuel interest. 'We anticipate a lot of fans will be here. They'll fly in from all over the world,' said Mr Julien, who will display the items at his gallery for four days before they go on the block on December 5 and 6. Monroe, who died of a drug overdose at age 36 in 1962, willed 'The Lost Archives' to her mentor, the legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg. He gave it to a friend he trusted would take proper care. That friend's family, which Julien said wants to remain anonymous, obviously met Strasberg's expectations. Many of the letters look as pristine as the day their authors wrote them. Old: This photo shows a three-page handwritten letter and original envelope that was sent from DiMaggio to Monroe postmarked October 9, 1954. It is among 300 items to go up for sale at the auction in Beverly Hills . 'Please, if I've ever made you cry or made you even more sadder, ever for a second, please forgive me, my perfect girl. I love you,' Miller wrote in a pencil-scribbled P.S. at the bottom of one letter. In a reply to one of his missives, Monroe takes issue with what the author of 'Death of a Salesman' had called her nobility in handling a difficult childhood followed by public adulation that nearly crushed her. 'In other words, there was no choice to make, the same road was always before me,' she wrote. 'So for you to speak of my nobility, it really wasn't so noble.' She went on to say: 'It's doubly difficult to understand that you, the most different, most beautiful human being, chose me to love.' Never sent? This single-page handwritten letter  is presumed to have never been sent from  Monroe to  Miller . Speaking of the many letters Monroe received from her admirers, Mr Nolan said: 'It's fantastic to see how loved she was.' He added: 'Like you thought she was vulnerable and not loved and she craved love and she needed that reassurance. But she had it. She had it with Joe DiMaggio. She had it with Arthur Miller.' And, so it seems, she still has it with much of the rest of the world.","300 Marilyn Monroe items will be auctioned in Beverly Hills next month .

"A Chinese firm claims it is getting closer to allowing parents to pick the embryo most likely to succeed. Researcher believe that 50-80% of what determines IQ could be inherited. Now a Chinese firm is mapping the genes of people who are gifted in maths in a bid to isolate the genes that make them smarter that the average person. Babies in a Chinese nursery: Researcher believe that 50-80% of what determines IQ could be inherited, and are developing tests to screen for those who are good at maths . Shenzhen-based BGI is mapping the genes of math geniuses, and appealing via its web site for more to take part in the controversial study. B.G.I., formerly called Beijing Genomics Institute, is the world’s largest genetic-research center, and already has an initial batch of 2,000 DNA samples from high-IQ subjects. Researchers then plan to compare these against a sample from the general population - and hopefully isolate what makes them special. In theory, this knowledge could then be used to allow parents to pick 'smart embryos'. Other divisions of the Chinese giant already offer genetic testing, leading some to speculate it could eventually launch a screening programme for prospective parents. Researchers believe most children are within 13 IQ points of their parents’ combined average. However, two or three out of every hundred children turns out to be significantly more intelligent, Stephen Hsu, a researcher on the project, told Wired magazine. A graphic from the controversial firm showing how IQ can affect life outcomes. The slide was shown at a recent talk at Google, where the project was explained. ”People believe it’s a controversial topic, especially in the West,'  Bowen Zhao, head of CG, told the Wall Street Journal. 'That’s not the case in China.' In fact, China Development Bank, a state bank that lends to government pet projects, has given BGI $1.5 billion, although the firm says it will not turn over its data. 'Imagine what a couple might pay to ensure that they get the best out of 10 or 50 possible offspring, optimizing over their choice of heritable attributes,” he wrote on his blog, comparing the cost of a Harvard degree or private school with the few thousand dollars it takes to fertilize and implant embryos. 'There are going to be countries that say this is part of our national health-care service and everyone is doing it,” he told the New Yorker. “And eventually it would become unstoppable, because the countries that initially outlawed it would have to come around. How could they not?”","Shenzhen firm appealing for maths genius to get in touch to be genetically mapped .

"U.S. President Barack Obama today struck a landmark deal with China that would see both countries significantly reduce their greenhouse gas emissions over the next three decades. Under the agreement, America pledged to cut between 26 and 28 per cent of the level of its carbon emissions set in 2005 by 2025 as part of the global fight against climate change. But Chinese President Xi Jinping simply said he would aim to  cap his country's emissions by 2030 - still an unprecedented move by a nation that has been reluctant to box itself in on global warming. In order to successfully accomplish this,  20 percent of China's energy needs will come from alternative sources, such as solar power and wind energy, by that year, the politician said. Scroll down for video . Deal: U.S. President Barack Obama (left) today struck a landmark deal with  Chinese President Xi Jinping (right) that would see both countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions over the next three decades . Speaking beside Xi in Beijing today, Obama declared: 'This is a major milestone in the U.S.-China relationship. It shows what's possible when we work together on an urgent global challenge.' Despite the agreement, many have called into question the feasibility of the presidents' goals - with Obama's pledge likely to confront tough opposition from ascendant Republicans in Congress. Republicans signaled  they would seek to thwart Obama's efforts once the GOP controls the Senate next year, pointing out that the president was saddling future leaders with a tough-to-meet goal. 'This unrealistic plan, that the president would dump on his successor, would ensure higher utility rates and far fewer jobs,' said incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. However, a senior White House official called the deal both 'ambitious and achievable' - with Obama ultimately aiming to 'achieve deep economy-wide reductions on the order of 80% by 2050'. 'Congress may try to stop us, but we believe that with control of Congress changing hands we can proceed with the authority we already have.' the official told CNN. World leaders: Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping making the announcement today . Shaking hands: Under the agreement, made in Beijing today, America pledged to cut between 26 and 28 per cent of the level of its carbon emissions set in 2005 by 2025 as part of the global fight against climate change . 'Milestone': Speaking beside Xi in Beijing today, Obama (pictured) declared: 'This is a major milestone in the U.S.-China relationship. It shows what's possible when we work together on an urgent global challenge' 'This is really the crusade of a narrow group of people who are politically motivated and have made this a cause celebre, but we believe we will be successful.' The official did not say whether Obama would propose legislation or use his executive powers to enact changes without lawmakers. Still, these orders could be changed under a new president. The agreement, which aims to inject fresh momentum into the climate change battle ahead of make-or-break climate talks next year, was unveiled on the last day of Obama's trip to China. Many claimed it reflected both nations' desire to display a united front that could blunt arguments from developing countries that have balked at demands that they get serious about global warming. Global fight: The agreement, which aims to inject fresh momentum into the climate change battle, was unveiled on the last day of Obama's trip to China. Above, cooling towers emit steam in Pottstown, Pennsylvania . Reviewing honor guards: Chinese President Xi Jinping  said he would aim to cap his country's emissions by 2030 in an unprecedented move. Above, Xi (second left) and Obama (third left) review guards in Beijing . The U.S.'s target to reduce its emissions of heat-trapping gases by 26 percent to 28 percent by 2025 is a sharp increase from Obama's earlier vow to cut emissions by 17 percent by 2020. However, China, whose emissions are still growing as it builds new coal plants, did not commit to cut emissions by a specific amount. Rather, Xi set a target for China's emission to peak by 2030, or earlier if possible. He also pledged to increase the share of energy that China will derive from sources other than fossil fuels. 'This is, in my view, the most important bilateral climate announcement ever,' said David Sandalow, formerly a top environmental official at the White House and the Energy Department. Ceremony: Despite the agreement, many have called into question the feasibility of the presidents' goals - with Obama's pledge likely to confront tough opposition from ascendant Republicans in Congress . A landmark deal: Republicans signaled they would seek to thwart Obama's efforts once the GOP controls the Senate next year, pointing out that the president was saddling future leaders with a tough-to-meet goal . 'It sends the signal the two largest emitters in the world are working together to address this problem.' Obama's target, expected to serve as the U.S. contribution to a worldwide treaty to be finalized next year in Paris, came months before it had been expected. The U.S. has sought to show aggressive action on climate change in order to spur other nations to offer ambitious contributions, too. For China, the commitment to cap emissions marked a turning point in China's evolution on global warming and its responsibility to deal with the problem. In good spirits: Obama's target, expected to serve as the U.S. contribution to a treaty to be finalized next year in Paris, came months before it had been expected. Above, Obama and Xi smile as children wave flags . China accounts for around 30 percent of global emissions, but has only gotten serious in recent years as the level of emissions has been exacerbated by smothering smog in Beijing's skies. Above, traffic in Beijing . China accounts for around 30 percent of global emissions, but has only gotten serious in recent years as the large-scale impact on health and quality of life in China has come into focus, exacerbated by smothering smog in Beijing's skies. Environmental advocates in the U.S. heralded the announcement as a game-changer that would undermine opposition. If China can get serious about emissions, they said, surely others can, too. Al Gore, former vice president and a leading advocate for limiting climate change, called the announcement 'a major step forward in the global effort to solve the climate crisis'.

He said more will be required — 'including a global agreement from all nations — but these actions demonstrate a serious commitment by the top two global polluters.'

If it was the person, think about the circumstances of your life at the time. You can't compare dating John in humdrum, daily life to sex with Jake on holiday in Bali. Put Jake in your real life and sex would seem just as mundane. Convinced it was a case of chemistry? If it's that important to you, wait until the sparks fly before settling down with someone else. But if you're pining over what you did during sex, what's stopping you doing it with your new partner? Being 'faithful' to the sexual memory of the two of you, could be what's keeping you stuck. According to Tracey one in 12 of us never get over our past loves but there are five things we can do to try and move on . Reason two: The relationship drifted apart for no apparent reason . If you're not quite sure what caused the break-up, you can't help but keep dwelling on it. Apart from not being able to learn from your mistakes, curiosity alone can drive you crazy. Solve it: . Contact your ex. Explain you're having trouble moving on because you don't have a clue why you split. Ask them to tell you, straight out, without sparing your feelings, what it was that caused them to leave. Take it on the chin, analyse it for a week, then drop it. If you can't contact them, ask a friend to be brutal: Say you want their take on what happened without sparing your feelings. If they won't or can't help you, go to a therapist for help to make sense of it all. Reason three: The break-up was your fault and could have been prevented . The relationship was going wonderfully well and you had a one-night stand and got caught. Or the timing was wrong for you. You can't stop thinking, If only I'd done this or that. Solve it: . Give it a second go, if you can. If you honestly think it could work if you changed your behaviour, call your ex and ask for another chance. Explain the reason why it didn't work last time for you and your reasons for thinking it might now. If you cheated, chances are they'll hang up in your ear. If it was something forgivable, they still might hang up in your ear (their new lover is listening). Or they'll agree to try again. Whatever happens, you'll get rid of that 'if only I tried harder' feeling. Both Lauren Goodger and Mark Wright (left) and Peter Andre and Katie Price (right) are famous for long, drawn-out break ups . Reason four: Reminders are everywhere . You're still living in the house you bought together. They're still best friends with your best friends and you run into them constantly. Even worse, you work together. Solve it: . Take drastic measures. Remove any reminders you can. If it seriously is ruining your life, it's worth changing jobs, selling the house, even changing cities if you have to. Drastic but necessary if it finally gets you over them and into a fresh, new life. Reason five: You can't stop spying on them . You know it's ridiculous but you find yourself parked outside their flat, watching the window. You walk three miles at lunch time to watch them eat a sandwich in the park. Every time you see them, the pain hits you again. Solve it: . Keep a diary. Write in it before you're tempted to play Sherlock and - if you can't resist - when you get back again. One of three things will have happened: a) you've seen something that's upset you (that is, they've found someone else); b) they caught you and you feel like a complete idiot; or c) nothing happened and you just feel empty and lonely. Record all these feelings and when you're tempted again, use the old smoker's trick of putting it off for five minutes. Spend that five minutes reading about how awful you felt after the last episode.

"Stephen Fry has admitted in his soon-to-be-released third autobiography to having spent an 'enormous amount' of time and money on cocaine. The actor, presenter and celebrity has revealed the extent of his  drug use in his book 'More Fool Me', which follows on from his two previous autobiographies released in 1997 and 2010. The revelation was made in the Sunday Times in anticipation of the release of his new book in four days' time. Scroll down for video . Presenter and actor Stephen Fry reveals the extent of his cocaine use in his latest autobiography . He wrote: 'The only point of writing an autobiography, or so at least it seems to me, is to be honest. 'And in this book I have been utterly candid about a period of my life in which I spent an enormous amount of time and money on cocaine powder. 'I know how stupid that is, but I also know better people than me have found themselves on the same path.' Fry has previously gone public with a number of tumultuous incidents in his life. The actor and presenter, who has a history of depression, admitted last year for the first time that he was in a hotel room abroad when he tried to kill himself in 2012. In an interview with fellow comedian Richard Herring for the Leicester Square Theatre Podcast, Fry said that as president of mental health charity Mind, he felt he should talk about his own episodes of depression. Fry, pictured last year, has in the past spokenly openly about his battles with bipolar disorder . 'I am the victim of my own moods, more than most people are perhaps, in as much as I have a condition which requires me to take medication so that I don't get either too hyper or too depressed to the point of suicide,' said Fry, who first disclosed contemplating killing himself 19 years ago. 'I would go as far as to tell you that I attempted it last year, so I'm not always happy. This is the first time I've said this in public, but I might as well.' Fry, who hosts panel show QI, has long been open about suffering from bipolar disorder, also known as manic depression. The illness is characterised by episodes of mania and depression, with extreme episodes often lasting for several weeks. About one in every 100 people are diagnosed with bipolar disorder, with between 25 and 56 per cent of sufferers making at least one suicide attempt. Talking about his experience with the illness, Fry added: 'If un-medicated, there are times when I am so exuberant, so hyper, that I can go three or four nights without sleeping and I'm writing and I'm doing stuff and I'm so grandiose and so full of self-belief that it's almost impossible to deal with me. 'I can't stop speaking, I'm incredible, I go on shopping sprees.'","Stephen Fry reveals the extent of his cocaine use in third autobiography .

"Arsene Wenger has hit back at criticism of his team’s capitulation against Anderlecht in the Champions League, when they conceded three goals in the final 30 minutes to throw away a 3-0 lead. Arsenal were booed off the pitch and several of their former players lambasted Wenger’s approach — prominent among them Paul Merson, who repeatedly labelled the tactics ‘clueless’. But Wenger, whose team take on Swansea on Sunday, made an impassioned defence of his commitment to attack — saying just because a team is 3-0 up, it is no reason to focus on defending. VIDEO Scroll down for Arsene Wenger hits back at criticism of his management . Arsene Wenger cannot bear to watch as his Arsenal side give up a 3-0 lead at home to Anderlecht . Paul Merson, who played under Wenger briefly at Arsenal, described his old club's defending as 'clueless' Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had put the Gunners three goals up, and it seemed they would win comfortably . Wenger said: ‘You have to defend well and attack well. Why should you stop playing one of the aspects of the game? 'These debates that I hear are a joke, a farce. People who have managed zero games, they teach everybody how you should behave. It’s a farce. Honestly, I cannot even be upset about it.’ Merson was the foremost critic and he has in fact managed briefly, if unsuccessfully, at Walsall between 2004-06, but Wenger was cutting about his analysis. Aleksandar Mitrovic headed home the equaliser in the last minute of the game to deny Arsenal three points . The Arsenal players trudge back to the half-way line after throwing away their comfortable lead . The Anderlecht players celebrated at the Emirates, but Arsenal were booed off the pitch . ‘Honestly, it does not matter to me. You say what you want. You are free. I managed him. I tried. I’m not interested in Paul Merson.’ Merson was an early casualty of Wenger’s reign when he was sold to Middlesbrough in 1997.","Gunners threw away a 3-0 lead against Anderlecht in Champions League .

"A deeply worrying trend, known as ‘slut-shaming,’ has taken flight in recent years, fuelled by microblogging sites such as Tumblr, as well as Facebook. In these posts, teenage girls – and sometimes boys – criticize certain body types or wardrobe choices, often being ruthless in the process. In one such post, a blogger writes with accompanying pictures: ‘Hey girls, uhm did you know – open books, NOT legs?’ Slut-shaming: This image, uploaded to a Tumblr account last summer, started a new slut-shaming meme called Hey Girls, Did You Know? Girl on girl: The Hey Girls, Did You Know Facebook page is full of posts like this, where girls will ridicule other girls for the way they dress or look . Mean girls: In another post, a teenager tells girls that Nutella is for spreading, not legs . The image that started one particular meme of slut-shaming was the ‘Hey Girls, Did You Know’ post, when Tumblr user officialsabrina_xo uploaded a photo of her with captions saying, ‘Girls, did you know, that uhm, your boobs go inside your shirt?’ According to Know Your Meme, the image was removed shortly after it was uploaded, but the damage was done. Starting on June 18th, 2012, the image of the brunette was reblogged across the internet, sparking the meme. A week later, the Hey Girls, Did You Know Facebook page was formed. As of this year, it has nearly 37,000 ‘likes.’ While a majority of the photos are simply innocuous memes like SpongeBob SquarePants or pictures of cats or other harmless memes, others point out what they perceive to be as shortcomings of their peers. Advice: One girl garnered thousands of 'likes' on Facebook because of this photo . Retribution: In response to some photos, teenage boys offer their responses . Cruel: This photo, also from Hey Girls, Did You Know's Facebook page plays on the normally-snarky Some Ecards . One girl posted: ‘Hello citizens, did you know? This is deodorant. Use it,’ which was accompanied by various expressions with a stick of Dove, followed by a picture of her frowning. The image, posted on December 2, 2012, was shared 33 times and liked by 1,335 people. In 2011, male model Cole Mohr was pictured with an outer-space background holding a sign that read: ‘Dear Girls, don’t be insecure, you don’t need make-up and nice clothes. You’re all f****** beautiful.’ In response, Tumblr user einsteinonacid posted a photo in response that read: ‘Dear boy in outer space: Don’t tell me what to do.’ Shaming or inspiring? Top, model Cole Mohr created a stir by posting this photo telling girls they're beautiful without makeup; below, not everyone was so inspired . As Buzzfeed notes, what is interesting about the former meme is that it was one created by girls, who seek to shame other girls, perhaps because of low self-esteem or because they are bullies with the veil of the internet to protect them. ‘Slut shaming’ has been around in many incarnations in recent years. Last December, Swedish high school students staged a riot after a photo was posted on Instagram requesting that all ‘sluts’ were identified. In response, some 200 pictures were posted, mostly of 13-year-old girls. Outraged, students in Gothenburg took to the streets in protest.  In total, 27 young people were arrested in the riots, according to Swedish news site The Local. While initial reports said that the original photograph was posted by a 17-year-old girl, police now have a new suspect. The girl is in a safe location, and has maintained her innocence.","Hey Girl, Did You Know meme going strong after one teenager posted picture last summer shaming other girls for wearing revealing clothes .

"Urban Outfitters' recent claim to be the leading seller of vinyl has been found to be false. Billboard says that the title actually belongs to Amazon, after surveying music labels, distributors and wholesalers that account for roughly 80per cent of the U.S. market. Last week, the retailer's Chief Administrative Officer Calvin Hollinger said in a meeting of Wall Street analysts: 'Music is very, very important to the Urban customer … in fact, we are the world’s number one vinyl seller.' Negative spin: Urban Outfitters' recent claim to be the leading seller of vinyl has been found to be false . According to Billboard's analysis, Amazon is actually the largest vinyl seller in the U.S. with a 12.3per cent market share, while Urban Outfitters trails behind with an 8.1per cent share. Hastings Entertainment has a 2.8per cent share, while Hot Topic follows with 2.4per cent of the market. Alliance Entertainment, a wholesaler that sells to chains such as Best Buy and Barnes & Noble, also has a significant share of the vinyl business. And in the U.S., independent record stores account for approximately 50per cent of all vinyl sales. Second place: Amazon is actually the largest vinyl seller in the U.S. with a 12.3per cent market share, while Urban Outfitters (pictured) trails behind with an 8.1per cent share . 'Independent retailers are still the backbone of vinyl's growth, and they are still selling tons of it,' one major label distribution executive said. 'Indies are driving the format's growth and everyone else is picking up on what they do.' Urban Outfitters has been the subject of other recent controversies. In September, the store was forced to apologize for selling a blood-stained 'vintage' Kent State sweatshirt, in what appeared to be a reference to the massacre of 1970. In July, the store pulled a duvet cover featuring the religious deity Lord Ganesh from its stores after observant Hindus took offense at the item, saying its design was not meant to be slept on. And in June, critics blasted the retailer for stocking pens shaped like heroin-filled needles.",Billboard found that Amazon is actually the largest vinyl seller in the U.S.
"Arsenal have opened discussions over a £6.4million deal for Dinamo Zagreb midfielder Marcelo Brozovic. The player's representative Miroslav Bicanic said he was to hold talks with Arsenal in November when Brozovic is expected to be in the Croatia squad to face USA at Craven Cottage.

The 21-year-old played for Croatia at the World Cup as he sees a shot blocked by Brazil's David Luiz . Inter have already offered £3.5million which is well short of Zagreb's valuation and Arsenal hold the upper hand.

"A 15-year-old girl, who was allegedly raped by her stepfather, has had her sentenced quashed after it caused a global outrage. She was due to receive 100 lashes for having pre-marital sex with another man. The sentence for 'fornication' back in February sparked a petition by global campaing network, Avaaz, and anger from the country's opposition and women's rights groups. 15-year-old girl's sentence quashed: Nine out of 10 sentences for flogging in the Maldives in 2011 were given to women (woman pictured outside a shop in the Maldives) The petition to have her sentence commuted was signed by two million people worldwide. Last week, the Maldivian High Court overturned the sentence, which was hailed as a victory by Avaaz. There were calls for a moratorium on all flogging sentences in the Maldives, which is under he Islamic government of President Mohammed Waheed Hassan. Paradise island: Local campaigners urged tourists, including many British honeymooners, to consider the damaging effect on women's rights such a sentence would have . The 15-year-old, who cannot be named . for legal reasons, is free but was put under house arrest on an island . near the capital Male following her sentence. The . sentence was overturned, according to the High Court, because the girl . denied 'confessing' to consensual sex outside marriage. Campaigners . are now calling for her to continue her education and be looked after . by the state rather than returned to her family where she could face . more abuse. Alaphia Zoyab, who led the campaign on behalf of Avaaz told The Independent on Sunday: 'This is great news that her flogging sentence has been overturned and that she no longer faces house arrest. 'The . reason this is a big deal is that we are talking about a 15-year-old . child. She is a child. A lot of people have said she knew what she was . doing, but she is a child.' The girl and her step-father were first . arrested after the body of a baby she had given birth to was found . buried outside their house on Feydhoo in June 2012. Pressure: Two million people worldwide signed a petition calling for her sentence to be commuted (Maldivian women in traditional dress) Her stepfather, who had allegedly been abusing the girl for years, is reportedly facing 25 years in prison for the rape and allegedly killing a baby conceived from it. He has been charged with sexually abusing a minor, possessing pornography, and murder, while her mother has been charged with concealing a crime and murder. The Maldivian government had reportedly urged the court to show leniency describing the girl as having been 'traumatised' by the rape. Amnesty International had described the charges against he girl as 'outrageous'. And campaigners from Avaaz had launched a poster appealing to the 500,000 tourists travelling to the 'paradise' island each year, including British honeymooners, to consider the damaging effect on women's rights such sentences have. Nine out of 10 sentences for flogging in the Maldives in 2011 were given to women, while no one has been convicted of rape in the past three years.","The girl had reportedly been abused by her stepfather for years .

"It's the controversial  diet that encourages higher fat consumption and has scientists claiming it can reverse the obesity and diabetes epidemics. South African sports scientist, Professor Tim Noakes, says there's absolutely zero nutritional value in eating carbohydrates and people should stick to a diet full of fatty goodness. His claims form part of a Catalyst investigation to air on the ABC on Thursday and he is backed by several high-profile Australians including celebrity chef Pete Evans and cricketer star Shane Watson. Scroll down for video . Catalyst reporter Dr Maryanne Demasi investigates the controversial diet that encourages higher fat consumption and limits the carbohydrates . 'What this diet does is it's high in fat and protein… that reduces your hunger and that is the key to this whole process because if you can reduce your hunger, your calorie consumption goes down,' Professor Noakes told Catalyst. 'If you follow this diet we can reverse obesity and type two diabetes.' Professor Noakes' low-fat advice is a far cry from the food group pyramid many have followed for decades, which encourages a high proportion of carbohydrates. He believes the surge in carb consumption has contributed to obesity because they stimulate insulin hormones, which increases the body's fat stores. Celebrity chef Pete Evans has thrown his support behind the low-carb diet and says people should consume more unfamiliar animal meats including liver, marrow, hearts and brains . Australian cricketer Shane Watson details taking up the low-carb diet after initially having a 'fat phobia' because people had told him to consume a low-fat diet as an athlete . Australian cricketer Shane Watson said he used to have a 'fat phobia' because people had told him to consume a low-fat diet as an athlete. 'I stayed away from butter, cheese, nuts, avocado - all the foods that are high in fat and high in energy. But in the end I was always hungry because I was cutting all the fat out of my diet and was just loading up on carbs,' he told Catalyst. He took up the low-carb diet when sports scientist Dr Peter Brukner started working with Cricket Australia and instantly dropped the weight. Catalyst host Dr Maryanne Demasi says in the program that there's scientific evidence that people with obesity and diabetes would benefit from a low-carb diet - something Dr Brukner agreed with. 'These people don't metabolise carbohydrates well, that's what diabetes it – a failure to metabolise carbohydrates. Yet we've traditionally give these people high carbohydrate diets and it just doesn't make sense,' he said. Watson (middle) took up the low-carb diet when sports scientist Dr Peter Brukner (left) started working with Cricket Australia. They both feature on Catalyst on Thursday with reporter Dr Maryanne Demasi (right) The low carbohydrate diet encourages higher fat consumption and limits the intake of carbohydrates. The diet includes the consumption of foods full of fatty goodness including meats, fish, butter, cheese, nuts and avocado. But according to the Dietitians Association of Australia, reviews of the diet show that they are successful in cutting down body weight for up to six months. This suggests that for some people, the low-carb diet may be more effective in the short term. But the association says there are some concerns with the diet as it encourages a high intake of saturated fat. This may boost health risks such as heart disease and damage to blood vessels. The association says regular physical activity and a healthy diet is the most effective in the long term. The Catalyst episode is packed full of experts weighing in on the low-carb diet, but Melanie McGrice of the Dietitian's Association of Australia warns not everyone should follow it. 'I don’t believe that everyone with diabetes should be going on a low carbohydrate diet,' she tells the program. 'People don’t just come with diabetes, they come with a whole range of medical conditions, they come from different back grounds, they have different lifestyles. 'People who have medical condition such as diabetes really should be going and seeing their accredited practising dietician for that personally tailored advice.' Celebrity chef Pete Evans, who is renowned for his support of the Paleo diet, chimes in with a low-carb spaghetti recipes including animal liver, marrow, hearts and brains. 'The best thing about this diet is you don’t have to calorie count. Fat equals flavour,' he said.

"Two senior nurses at the centre of one of the worst hospital scandals in living memory have been struck off. Sharon Turner, 48, and Tracy White, 52, stood accused of ruling the A&E unit at Mid Staffordshire ‘with fear’ by bullying other nurses into covering-up the appalling neglect of patients. They are the first two nurses from the trust to be struck off. Up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died there unnecessarily between 2005 and 2009. Disciplined: Tracy White, left, and Sharon Turner, right, faked patient records to meet targets at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital. Today, they were struck off . This year a damning report into the . scandal concluded that ‘appalling and unnecessary suffering’ was . inflicted on hundreds of patients who were left ‘unwashed, unfed and . without fluids’. But until now, not a single doctor or nurse had been . struck off or even lost their job over the failings, to the dismay of . grieving families. Yesterday the Nursing and Midwifery . Council banned the two nurses from ever practising again for undermining . the public’s faith in the profession. The panel ruled they had conspired to . fiddle the figures on waiting times ‘with sheer dishonesty’ and had . ‘coerced and frightened’ other more junior nurses to do the same. Horrific: Up to 1,200 people died unnecessarily at the 'horror hospital' as managers put benchmarks above patient care . Mrs Turner, who lives in Cannock, . Staffordshire, admitted to the three-strong panel she had once said she . ‘did not give a flying f***’ about one of her patients. When told by other staff that a patient had requested something, she said: ‘They want to get f****** real’, the panel heard. Mrs Turner, who qualified as a nurse . in 1993, also allegedly branded Asian junior doctors ‘suicide bombers’ and ‘Osama’s mate’, in a reference to the late Al Qaeda leader. The former ward sister, who worked in . the A&E department between 2003 and 2009, also vowed to make one . male nurse’s life ‘living hell’ leading him to take an overdose – which . he survived. Mrs White, who has been a registered . nurse since 1992, bullied staff into lying about the length of times . patients waited in A&E to meet the Government’s maximum four-hour . target. Astonishingly she is still working at . the hospital and since leaving the A&E unit in 2009 had been . promoted to one of the most senior management positions. She is currently clinical site manager . – in charge of allocating patients to beds – on a salary of up to . £47,000, about £10,000 more than her previous nursing role. Whistleblower:  Helene Donnelly said Sister Turner - along with Sister White - would demand junior nurses falsify the times recorded for when patients were discharged . Whistleblowing nurse Helene Donnelly . revealed Sister Turner – along  with Sister White – would demand junior . nurses falsify the times recorded for when patients were discharged. She . recalled: ‘They would frequently lie about discharge times, and . pressurise members of staff to lie. They would speak nastily and swear . at people who did not change the times, or would change the times . themselves. ‘The drive for targets was obviously a huge thing at the time. We were told that jobs might be on the line if we didn’t do it.’ Stephen Redmond, who chaired the . hearing at the Old Bailey, told the two nurses that they had failed to . put patients and their care first. ‘Instead you made the achieving of . statistical targets, by honest or dishonest means, your primary aim. This was not a one-off failing, rather it was at the heart of the way . you worked over a sustained period.’ He said they had resorted to ‘sheer . dishonesty’ by altering paperwork and said they had ‘coerced and . frightened other, often junior, members of staff into doing the same. You shouted and swore at them if they did not comply when you should . have been setting an example.’ Julie Bailey, who helped expose the . appalling neglect at Mid Staffordshire following the death of her mother . in 2007, said: ‘This is the start of accountability in the NHS. We’re . all very pleased at the outcomes. But there is clear evidence these . nurses should have been suspended long ago by the trust.’ She also said it was ‘frightening’ that despite being struck off, the pair could still work in hospitals as . healthcare assistants. The cases began in March but had been repeatedly adjourned and had only begun considering evidence against the pair this week. Another five nurses from Mid . Staffordshire are having their cases considered by the NMC including the . former chief nurse, Jan Harry. Maggie Oldham, chief executive at Mid . Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘Tracy White is still employed . by the trust. We will need to take some time to consider the Nursing . and Midwifery Council panel’s findings.’ Among the most repellent examples of the behaviour of Tracy White was her lack of care and respect for an elderly woman in her final 24 hours. She reprimanded the seriously ill patient by calling her a ‘naughty little monkey’ for not taking her laxatives, and refused to help lift her from a wheelchair to a bed, saying: ‘I’m not doing this. I’m not hurting my back.’ Whistleblowing nurse Helene Donnelly said the woman, who died the next day from a pulmonary oedema, or fluid on the lungs, had been given ‘a very uncared-for and undignified last 24 hours’. Another patient, who arrived at A&E suffering from bleeding after having an abortion, was refused immediate treatment by Sister White, who said: ‘She can wait, if you can do that to your baby.’ The whistleblower also claimed: ‘Sister White would deliberately make patients wait. Black patients were being made to wait.’ When junior nurse Mrs Donnelly was scathingly told off by another manager for faking a discharge time, she said she looked at the paperwork and recognised White’s handwriting. But the senior nurse did not come forward to admit the forgery and was later promoted to her current role as clinical site manager. On the wards, Sharon Turner sent waves of fear through junior staff afraid to challenge her expletive-ridden diktats. When one bullied male nurse took an overdose in despair, she said he ‘should have taken a few more and done the job properly’. The Nursing and Midwifery Council was told Sister Turner had vowed to ‘make his life hell and get rid of him in six months’ and ‘drive him to drink’ so that ‘he would be out of here’. When a colleague was taken to hospital with  a head injury, the mother of two is said to have told staff: ‘I don’t care if she lives or dies.’ Asian junior doctors had to put up with appalling racist abuse from the senior nurse. She asked one, ‘What have you got in your rucksack doctor, is it a bomb?’ and referred to others as ‘him in the turban’ and ‘her with the yashmak [veil]’.","Sharon Turner and Tracy White falsified .

"Appearances: 3 (plus 2 off the bench) Goals: 1 (against Everton in Premier League) Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal is already concerned that loan signing Radamel Falcao may not be physically capable of sustained action in the Barclays Premier League.

United cannot afford to commit to a long-term contract that would cost them more than £1million a month in wages on a player who will be 29 in February unless they are sure he is up to it. They are keen to recruit a world-class goalscorer in the summer, but will not have the budget to sign Falcao full-time and then pay big money for another centre forward.","Falcao has scored just once since moving to Old Trafford on loan .

"Off button: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is planning an end to Britain's 'holiday camp jails', with plans including no Sky TV in cells, uniforms and less pocket money . An end to Britain’s ‘holiday camp’ jails, with a ban on Sky TV, fewer televisions, more prison uniforms, less pocket money for inmates and a ban on gay couples sharing cells is planned by the Government. The return to ‘spartan’ jails marks the biggest prison regime shake-up for 60 years and is designed to signal a tough new approach to law and order by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling. Mr Grayling believes prisoners do not deserve the kind of lifestyle and ‘frills’ that are beyond the reach of families on low wages. The move will provoke fierce opposition from prison reformers, but Mr Grayling says that making prison life tougher is a vital part of his war on crime. ‘I want prisons to be spartan, but humane, a place people don’t have a particular desire to come back to,’ he said in an interview with The Mail on Sunday. In his new ‘no-frills’ prisons: . And in a toughening-up of sentencing policies, Mr Grayling wants to stop people who carry knives for violent purposes from being let off with cautions. Spartan: He said that he wanted prions to be 'spartan but humane' and said he didn't want it to be a place people had a 'desire' to come back to . Rape and violence should be prosecuted wherever possible, he says. Speaking in his Commons office, Mr Grayling, 50, said: ‘It isn’t reasonable for prisoners to enjoy things that those outside on low incomes would struggle to have. My idea of prison is not sitting watching the Sky Sports Sunday match. I accept that, given they are locked up for a long time, prisoners should have access to a TV set,  but it is a privilege that should be earned, not given automatically. They should not get all the frills. ‘I don’t approve of prisons buying state-of-the-art entertainment kit when most people have to make sacrifices to buy them.’ Soft-spoken MP for leafy Epsom in Surrey, Chris Grayling is anything but brutal by nature. A former Channel 4 business reporter and ex-member of the Social Democrat Party, a forerunner of the Lib Dems, he is not from the Tories’ old-style hang ’em and flog ’em brigade. But his new ‘spartan’ jails policy is final proof that David Cameron’s ‘hug a hoodie’ phase is well and truly over. He appointed Grayling to succeed Tory veteran Ken Clarke after Tory MPs complained Hush Puppy-wearing Clarke’s softly-softly stance on crime was losing votes. Arguably, the harsher prison regime is the most significant change since hard labour and flogging were outlawed in British jails in 1948. Change: He said that 'all aspects of prison life' were being considered as part of the shakeup . Not that Grayling intends to copy US prison chain gangs. ‘I would much rather someone was in a workshop learning a skill than breaking rocks to no purpose,’ he tells me. The first change will be a ban on Sky Sports and other subscription satellite TV. Grayling chuckles as he recalls checking to make sure prisoners were not using it to watch pornography. ‘I asked, “Do they have access to Red Hot Dutch?” And no, they don’t.’ In addition to being able to watch Sky TV, prisoners are allowed TVs in their cells in return for good behaviour. Now, some prisoners face having them removed as  the ‘good behaviour’ threshold is increased. Similarly, the right to wear their own clothes and the right to buy treats in prison shops are likely to be restricted. ‘We are looking at in what circumstances should they have access to a TV set, wear their own clothes, things like that,’ says Grayling. ‘Prisoners get extra privileges and resources through good behaviour. We may tighten that regime. We are considering all aspects of prison life.’ And he is not prepared to tolerate  the practice, said to be growing, whereby some gay inmates live as couples in cells, allowing them to have sex regularly. Limit: Grayling also wants governors to do more to stop prisoners getting hold of drugs and mobile phones, which give them access to Facebook, allowing them to threaten those outside who have given evidence against them . ‘It is not acceptable to allow same-sex couples to effectively move in together and live a domestic life. If such a thing happened, I would want those prisoners put in separate prisons.’ Grayling also wants governors to do more to stop prisoners getting hold of drugs and mobile phones, which give them access to Facebook, allowing them to threaten those outside who have given evidence against them. ‘It has been a revelation to me the means people use to get these things into prisons,’ he says. ‘A dead bird was thrown over a prison wall with drugs in and a prisoner came along and picked it up on the other side.’ Grayling also wants to ban trouble-making prisoners from having jail terms automatically slashed. ‘I have a problem with the idea that someone who does not co-operate in prison gets early release.’ And he wants to cut the police  use of cautions, seen as a ‘let-off’ by Tory critics. ‘I have serious misgivings about the number of people cautioned for carrying a knife – and I’m not talking about someone on their way home after buying a Stanley knife at B&Q.’ Rapists and violent thugs should also be prosecuted wherever possible, he says. His disciplinarian views are mirrored by the ‘regime’ he and wife Susan adopted towards their two children, now 20 and 16. He says when they misbehaved they knew they could get a smack from dad. ‘You chastise children when they are bad, as my parents did me. I’m not opposed to smacking. It is to  be used occasionally. Sometimes it sends a message – but I don’t hanker for the days when children were severely beaten at school.’ Since entering the Commons in 2001, Grayling has got into trouble more than once for his hardline views. Learning: The MP said he would much prefer if prisoners were in a 'workshop learning a skill than breaking rocks to no purpose' He was branded the Tory ‘attack dog’ for accusing Cherie Blair of making money from living at Downing Street and he was forced to apologise after rashly comparing Manchester’s Moss Side area to ‘urban war’ in the American TV crime drama The Wire. He was also branded ‘bigot of the year’ after  saying Christians who ran bed-and-breakfast businesses should have the right to turn away homosexuals. The gaffe cost him dearly. When David Cameron became Prime Minister, Theresa May, not Grayling, was made Home Secretary, and he had to settle for being a lowly number-cruncher for Iain Duncan Smith at Work and Pensions. He won Cabinet promotion last year after Mr Cameron finally lost patience with Mr Clarke as Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor and gave the job to Grayling. He says his main aim is to stop the vicious circle in which no sooner have prisoners been released than they commit another crime and  go back inside. Spartan jails and humane rehabilitation go hand-in-hand, he insists. ‘We have a good number of evil Mr Bigs in our prisons, but many prisoners are badly messed up and we have to help them. Whether you are the hardest hardliner or the woolliest liberal, every one of us has an interest in preventing reoffending.’","Marks the biggest prison regime shake-up for 60 years .

"AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd attempted to hire a hitman to kill two people, a New Zealand court has heard. The 60-year-old said nothing during a brief, shoeless appearance in Tauranga District Court on Thursday afternoon. He is charged with attempting to procure murder, threatening to kill and possession of methamphetamine and cannabis, following a police raid on his North Island home on Thursday morning.

He is also accused of threatening to kill a complainant on September 26. Details of the complaints and the names of the alleged intended targets and hitman were suppressed by Judge Louis Bidois. At the request of defence lawyer Tony Rickard-Simms, Rudd was remanded on bail until November 27 when he will reappear in court. His bail conditions include that he lives at his Bureta home and not contact any of the complainants.

"Innovative website Hello Sunday Morning (HSM) is creating a new mobile app funded by one of the world's leading mobile telecommunications companies, the Vodafone Foundation, to help combat alcohol problems amongst Australia’s young people. HSM encourages individuals to take a break from drinking and recreate the drinking culture within Australia. Since 2010, over 32,000 people have signed up to go three months or more without alcohol, and blog about their journey. The introduction of the new app is the organisation’s latest initiative and HMS founder and CEO, Chris Raine, believes it can help even more those battling the booze. Scroll down for video . Since 2010, over 32,000 people have signed up with HSM to go three months or more without alcohol . HSM founder and CEO, Chris Raine, sees huge potential in the new app . 'What we’re building now with the support of the Vodafone Foundation is a mobile app that will distil the essence of what our process is, and make it accessible to a much larger group of people who are determined to change their lifestyle,' he said. Dr Nick Carah, who is a lecturer in communications at the University of Queensland, also felt the app will work as it'll help promote HSM's way of changing individuals’ alcohol consumption behaviour. 'When HSM builds tools like this mobile app it will get people to interact with their smartphone and use HSM’s programme as a support mechanism for themselves,' he said. 'Participants currently document their on-going journey on the HSM blog, giving advice and support to others. 'This is where the new app will make a difference, because it’ll become integrated more in people’s every-day lives. Rather than having to sit down and write a blog post people can more easily share with each other. 'It’s a much more seamless support network that can be used in everyday life. It’ll always be there when they need it.' Those currently benefiting most from HSM are younger, female drinkers. A huge binge drinker from the age of 16-29, Nicole Cliff, knew that she had to make changes in her life. She found HSM online two years ago and it immediately made a big impact. 'I used the site for motivation and support. I also set myself a goal, which was to make the Melbourne ice hockey team,' the 31-year-old said. 'So I actually used the time not drinking positively, and I made the team. From then on my life has completely changed for the better.' Cliff said that the new app would be the perfect way to help young people dealing with alcohol problems. One-on-one counselling used in conventional treatment programmes is not for everyone . Chris Raine meets Julia Gillard while on his mission to promote the HSM programme . 'Everyone has their phones on them these days so the app would be perfect. If you are at a party and feel tempted you only have to get straight on your phone and use the app to seek some support. People need to feel supported for change to happen,' she said. Four years ago Raine, 27, was working in advertising and drinking heavily. But instead of using the likes of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) to get over his problem he decided to not drink for a year and write a blog every week called Hello Sunday Morning to share his experiences and deal with his issues. 'It gradually grew a following of people who got encouragement from it and decided it was something they’d also like to do,' he explained. 'It was then I quit my job, set up an NGO and developed this free online programme that has grown organically each year to help breed a better drinking culture. 'The big idea behind it is that one-on-one counselling is not for everyone, so we provide a community-based peer-to-peer process where people can support each other. We've now surpassed AA in terms of the number of people in their programme in Australia.' Many young drinkers are too embarrassed to speak with a doctor or a healthcare professional . HMS has been successful partly because it established a platform technically that’s very accessible and straightforward for young people. It also doesn't have the stigma of going to a doctor or a healthcare professional, you can do it privately. The other element is that unlike other treatment programmes where people have to say they are an alcoholic or have a drinking problem, HSM gets individuals to nominate a goal that has nothing to do with drinking. This gives participants something to focus on and a story to tell that does not revolve around alcohol. After stopping drinking Chris Raine (left) set himself other goals to focus on such as keeping fit .","Hello Sunday Morning site to join forces with Vodafone Foundation .

Scroll down for video . Teenager Raymond Frolander pleaded not guilty to sexual battery on a child under 12 in Florida on Thursday. The alleged molester is pictured left on July 18 after being beaten by his alleged victim's father and right, ten days later on July 28 . Mr Browning and his family attended court today. He told Click Orlando: 'Our family is ripped apart. My daughters don't even know how to hug or kiss their brother anymore.' Frolander is scheduled for a pretrial hearing in September before his trial begins in November. According to a Facebook post by the child's grandmother, Norma Jean Browning, the alleged victim will have to testify at Frolander's trial. She asked friends to remember her grandson in their prayers. Browning admitted he 'just snapped' when he allegedly walked in on Frolander naked with his son. Shortly after beating the teen unconscious, he went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife, he said. 'I was going to kill him,' Browning admitted but said that his son's pleas stopped him. Frolander later admitted to Florida police that he has been molesting the boy for three years. The 18-year-old was considered family by the Brownings and often spent time with the 11-year-old boy, the father said. 'There was nothing uncommon to let the kids go in the bedroom and play video games together and now I have to wonder why the door was shut,' Mr Browning said. The father was not charged with a crime and police appeared to understand his reaction. 'Dad was acting like a dad. I don't see anything we should charge the dad with,' Daytona Beach Police Chief Mike Chitwood told WFTS last month. This picture was posted on July 28 on a Facebook page called 'Raymond Frolander Is Innocent'. The individual who posted the picture claims that it was taken by Browning while he beat Frolander for allegedly assaulting his son on July 18 . Jason Browning beat Frolander into a pulp after allegedly finding him performing a sex act on his son last month. He said outside court today that his family's life had been 'ripped apart' 'You have an 18-year-old who has clearly picked his target, groomed his target and had sex with the victim multiple times.' A subsequent mugshot showed Frolander had been badly beaten around the face, leaving him with swollen lips and eyes, bruising and lacerations. At the time of the 911 call in the early hours of July 18, the dispatcher asked Browning if any weapons were involved in the assault he had called in. Browning responded: 'My foot and my fist.' He told the dispatcher: 'I just walked in on a grown man molesting [name redacted]. And I got him in a bloody puddle for you right now, officer.' Police arrived at the Daytona Beach home in Florida to find Frolander unconscious. 'He is nice and knocked out on the floor for you, I dragged him into the living room,' the father said. 'Send an ambulance. He is going to need one.' The dispatcher asked: 'Is he still unconscious?' to which the father responds: 'Yes... I hit hard, sir.' He said that Frolander was a 'damn lucky boy that I love my God'. The father added: 'He stood up and his pants were around his ankles and nothing else needed to be said. I did whatever I got a right to do except I didn’t kill him.' The father had left his home around 1am to pick up some food and when he returned, heard a strange noise coming from the bedroom, police said. He pushed open the door and allegedly found Frolander with his pants down performing a sex act on the child. The boy told investigators he had been playing video games with friends but when they left, Frolander took him to a back room and pulled down his pants. He also said Frolander had been abusing him for three years. Daytona Beach police chief Michael Chitwood told MailOnline that Frolander had a close family connection to the alleged victim. The chief said he believed that Frolander lived next door to the boy and his father. The suspect was living with the victim's biological mother. Frolander's stepmother is also engaged to the victim's father. The police chief said the young boy was intimidated and told by Frolander that terrible things would happen if he revealed the abuse. Chief Chitwood said: 'He's 11 years old, he should be running around outside and playing video games, not dealing with something like this.'","Teenager Raymond Frolander pleaded not guilty to sexual battery on a child under 12 in  Florida today .

"Diego Maradona is recognised as one of the best ever footballers but he now appears to be trying his hand at singing. The 54-year-old's on-off relationship with 24-year-old Rocio Oliva has taken a positive turn as the former Barcelona and Napoli forward was filmed serenading his girlfriend in Dubai. Maradona's decision to take to the microphone during a product launch comes just two weeks after a video emerged appearing to show the 54-year-old physically assaulting his girlfriend. Diego Maradona interrupted a product launch to serenade his 24-year-old on-again girlfriend . Maradona decided to pull the bizarre stunt while on stage in the UAE to promote a sports drink, claiming afterwards it was ‘part of the show’. Maradona, whose infamous Hand of God goal helped Argentina knocked England out of the 1986 World Cup, then looks lovingly at Ms Oliva, whom he has been dating on and off since the beginning of last year. The serenade follows the disturbing 30-second video which allegedly shows Maradona hitting the 24-year-old after becoming upset over her using her mobile phone. Ms Oliva secretly filmed the 53-year-old walking towards her spluttering: 'You still looking at your phone.' She retorted: 'Can't I look at it?' before begging him: 'Stop Diego, calm down, stop hitting,' as he allegedly tried to strike her twice with his right hand. The 54-year-old seemed to have patched things up with his young love following the release of a video where Ms Oliva secretly filmed what appeared to be Maradona assaulting her . Maradona decided to pull the bizarre stunt while on stage in the UAE to promote a sports drink, claiming afterwards it was ‘part of the show’ The serenade follows the disturbing 30-second video which allegedly shows Maradona hitting the 24-year-old after becoming upset over her using her mobile phone . The video was broadcast on a lunchtime TV programme in Argentina, after which Maradona insisted he had only knocked the phone out of her hands. He told a journalist: 'I sent the phone flying but I swear I've never hit a woman. The story starts and finishes there. 'I admit I knocked the phone out of Rocio's hands but there's nothing more to it. The situation didn't continue.' Maradona and Ms Oliva have broken up and reunited several times during the course of their relationship, and the couple were even engaged for a short time before breaking it off. In May last year Maradona allegedly had a row with her on an airplane that got so heated that fellow business class travellers and air stewardesses allegedly had to step in to try to get him to calm down. In July this year, Ms Oliva was arrested in Brazil after Maradona accused her of stealing watches and jewellery worth nearly £250,000 from his mansion in Dubai. Maradona's 'hand of God' ensured his side knocked out England in the quarter-finals of the 1986 World Cup .

"The Los Angeles Lakers have confirmed that a man shot and killed in Philadelphia over the weekend was the father of player Wayne Ellington Jr. Ellington Jr. said in a Tuesday statement 'My family and I are devastated by the news of my father’s murder on Sunday night in Philadelphia. We appreciate everyone’s support and ask that you respect the privacy of our family during this very difficult time.' Police say the 26-year-old basketball player's father, 57-year-old Wayne Ellington Sr., was found shot in the head in the driver's seat of a car in the Germantown section just after 8 p.m. Sunday, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. 'Devastated':  Los Angeles Lakers player Wayne Ellington Jr. released a statement mourning his father Wayne Ellington Sr., who died in Philadelphia over the weekend . Father: Wayne Ellington Sr. is seen with his family, including son Wayne Ellington Jr., in this Facebook photograph . Ellington was transported to Einstein Medical Center and pronounced dead Sunday evening, according to the newspaper. No arrests have been reported. The Lakers wrote online that Ellington Jr. was been granted an indefinite leave of absence. The team said there is no set time for his return. Ellington Sr.'s mother Betty Ellington told The Philadelphia Daily News 'I'm devastated. I couldn't even believe this.' Two parked cars were hit by Ellington Sr.'s car, Chief Inspector Scott Small told the newspaper. The only ballistic evidence police have uncovered was the bullet hole in Ellington Sr.'s passenger-side door - and investigators believe the bullet likely entered via his driver's-side window, the newspaper reported. 'It was his whole conversation, about his son playing in the NBA,' Betty Ellington told The Philadelphia Daily News, revealing her son was a father to two daughters as well as a grandfather to two granddaughters. Mitch Kupchak, the Lakers General Manager, said in a Monday statement 'Our players are upset for their friend and teammate. Additionally, ownership and all Lakers employees are also saddened by this tragedy.Those of us who work with and have gotten to know Wayne have come to know what a wonderful and caring person he is. Our hearts go out to Wayne and his family, as do our thoughts and prayers.' Byron Scott - the coach of the team - told ESPN on Tuesday 'It was just very sad news, obviously, and all of us have to give him space to grieve and deal with this with his family and we'll welcome him back with open arms when he decides to come back.' The Lakers have said that Ellington Jr. has been granted an indefinite leave of absence, with no set time for his return . During a walk to his vehicle, Ellington Jr. found out about his father, Scott told the sports website. Scott told ESPN 'I got the news when I was with my family in the hallway about to go to my car. I obviously kind of dropped everything and went straight to him, spent a few minutes with him. A lot of his teammates were there, as well as his fiancé. [Charlotte Hornets player] Gerald Henderson, who he grew up with, was there. He had a lot of support.' 'Again, this is our livelihood, but it's still just a game,' he also told ESPN. 'This thing that's happening with Wayne is real life. It kind of puts everything in perspective, too. 'As a team, we'll obviously keep going on and trying to win games, but I think all of us, every now and then - during the game, after the game, before the game - will have Wayne on our mind.'","The Los Angeles Lakers confirmed that a man shot and killed in Philadelphia over the weekend was the father of player Wayne Ellington Jr.

"Scottish voters are set to narrowly reject independence today, according to the last poll published before the result is announced tomorrow morning. The ‘No’ campaign goes into today’s referendum six points clear of the Alex Salmond’s nationalists – with 53 per cent of those certain to vote telling pollsters they will opt against separation. Among those certain to vote, 50 per cent say they will vote No, with 45 per cent saying they will back independence. A further 4 per cent are still undecided, according to the pollsters Ipsos MORI. Scroll down for video . The 'No' campaign holds a narrow lead going in to today's referendum, according to the last poll carried out before the result  is announced tomorrow . Just under half - 46 per cent – of Scottish voters believe the Better Together campaign will win the referendum, compared with just 30 per cent who think the Yes campaign will win . Today’s poll for the Evening Standard, shows a small increase in support for the ‘No’ campaign. A series of surveys released last night showed the battle over independence going down to the wire – with the Better Together campaign ahead by just four percentage points. But Ipsos MORI found that women were dividing conclusively against independence – swinging the balance to the ‘No’ campaign. Men favoured independence 53-47, but women were splitting 42-58. Those aged 25 to 34 were the most passionate separatists – with just under three quarters backing independence. But those aged over-55 were split two-to-one in favour of No. Ipsos MORI interviewed 991 over-16s in Scotland by telephone yesterday and the day before. In a survey published by the same pollsters yesterday - among those who said that they are ‘absolutely certain’ to vote tomorrow – 49 per cent said they intended to vote No, with 47 per cent backing independence. Five per cent remained undecided. Gideon Skinner, Head of Political Research at Ipsos MORI, said: ‘These results confirm the picture from other polls before polling day – the referendum looks extremely close, and although No seems to have a small lead much will depend on turnout on the day. 'Meanwhile there is a clear difference in the motivations for voters on the two camps – Yes voters saying they are motivated more by hope for the future if their side wins, while No voters say fear for the future if the No side loses has been more important to their vote.' Polling booths opened across the country at 7am this morning, with turnout expected to hit 90 per cent .

Polling booths opened at 7am this morning for fifteen hours of voting which will decide the future of the UK.

US President Barack Obama intervened again for the union side, posting a signed tweet on his White House account which read: ‘The UK is an extraordinary partner for America and a force for good in an unstable world. I hope it remains strong, robust and united.’ But tennis star Any Murray, who has for weeks refused to take sides, came off the fence in a tweet saying: ‘Let’s do this!’ He said he had been turned away from the ‘No’ campaign because of its ‘negativity’. He wrote: ‘Huge day for Scotland today! No campaign negativity last few days totally swayed my view on it. excited to see the outcome. lets [sic] do this!’ The independence campaign is set to go down to the wire today - with the public split down the middle over whether to stay in the UK or become 'an independent country'.

"Revolting French farmers dumped hundreds of tonnes of manure and rotten vegetables on the streets as well as spraying a council water treatment office with slurry in a major day of protest. Members of the French Farmers Union (FNSEA) and the Young Farmers Union (YA) held demonstrations over worsening food prices as well as increases in the cost of fertiliser. Farmers complain that sanctions with Russia over the ongoing Ukrainian crisis has led to collapse in the price of cereal, milk and grain. Scroll down for video . One French farmer sprayed the offices of the Water Agency with hundreds of litres of slurry . Other farmers took the opportunity to set fire to barricades during their day of protest held across France . Farmers dumped hundreds of tonnes of rotten vegetables outside civic buildings as part of their protest . During one protest in Chatres, south west of Paris, farmers dumped 100 tonnes of manure along with rotting vegetables outside the offices of the agriculture department as well as the town hall. Around 300 farmers using 30 tractors took part in the protest. Union leader Jean Michel Gouache said his members were 'fed up' over 'increasingly crazy constraints and charges'. A group of more than 300 farmers dumped around 100 tonnes of manure and rotten vegetables in the centre of Chartres on Tuesday in protest at falling food prices. Assisted by some 30 tractors, the farmers dumped the slurry and rotting food in front of the offices of the agriculture department and town hall. Russia has imposed sanctions on EU agriculture products in response to EU protests over the Ukrainian crisis. Others dumped hundreds of tonnes of manure on the street outside the town hall in Chartres . The farmers blockaded the centre of Chartres in response to difficult trading conditions . The farmers complained that EU sanctions on Russia have hit their potential export markets depressing prices . In central Paris, farmers unloaded 50 tonnes of fruit and vegetables at the Place de la Republique in Paris and gave them away for free. Damien Greffin, of the FNSEA union in Paris said: 'Clearly we are expressing our annoyance, and the annoyance . of the entire farming world. 'Today, a farmer devotes most of his time to administration . and paperwork rather than production to feed the population, and . this is completely unacceptable.' Wednesday's day of action called by the FNSEA brought around . 36,000 farmers out onto the streets across France, accompanied . by hundreds of tractors, the union said. Farmer frustration over red tape and a deteriorating . economic outlook has led to more than 150 protests around the . country since late August, the FNSEA said. In an extreme case, vegetable growers in Brittany set fire . to public buildings in September. The government has condemned such violent incidents but has . also tried to address farmer grievances at a time when unpopular . Socialist President Francois Hollande is facing discontent due . to a struggling economy. This farmer dumped a load of apples on the street while calling for Francois Hollande to resign . Several major French towns were brought to a standstill as farmers complained over government policy . These farmers have dumped a mixture of corn flour and tyres during this demonstration in Pau . Anger has notably built up following controversy over a dam . project in the southwest designed to allow irrigation for farms . and over environmental rules after the government extended a . list of water protection zones to limit nitrate pollution. An environmental protester died last month during clashes . with police at the site of the planned reservoir, where work has . since been suspended by the local authorities. In several towns, farmers used tractors to dump livestock . manure outside local government buildings, displaying slogans . like 'Too much biodiversity is harmful'. The FNSEA is also calling for French farm produce to be . given a bigger place in the country's canteens and restaurants, . supported by an 'Eat French' slogan. Farmers took their tractors onto main motorway routes to disrupt traffic flow across the country . Farmers dumped hundreds of tonnes of manure outside government offices across France . French farmers complain that their income is being slashed by falling food prices and rising costs . As part of Wednesday's action, farmers carrying out checks . on lorries delivering food to the French finance ministry said . they had found Moroccan tomatoes and Italian apples. In Paris, passers-by expressed support for French produce. One passer-by said: 'If everyone made the effort and paid a little bit more, . they could eat quality food and get the French economy moving . again, and I think we really need that.'

"Only just into November and the blooper of the season competition may have its unfortunate winner. On a night when Forest were challenged by owner Fawaz Al Hasawi to prove their nine-match winless run really was just a ‘blip’, the team found themselves two goals down by half-time. The first was dreadful defending which allowed Arsenal loanee Jon Toral to give a penetrating run from Moses Odubajo the finish it deserved after the Brentford defender and Jamaal Lascelles collided in the area. Alex Pritchard (second left) celebrates after scoring from the penalty spot to put Brentford 3-0 up . Nottingham Forest (4-1-4-1): Darlow 5; Hunt 4 (Lichaj, 32 mins, 4) 5, Wilson 4, Lascelles 4 (Assombalonga, 45 mins, 5), Fox 5; Mancienne 6; Ince 5, Lansbury 6, Osborn 6, Burke 6 (Paterson, 62 mins, 5); Antonio 6 . Subs not used: Harding, Fryatt, De Vries, Tesche. Brentford (4-2-3-1): Button 7; Odubajo 8 (Dallas, 63 mins, 5), Dean 7, Craig 7, Bidwell 7; Douglas 7, Diagouraga 7; Pritchard 7, Toral 7 (Jota, 60 mins, 5), Judge 7; Gray 7 (Proschwitz, 75 mins) Subs not used: Saunders, Bonham, Smith, Tarkowski. The second, look away now Eric Lichaj, was a tap-in from Andre Gray courtesy of the weakest, shortest back pass imaginable. The defender had been on the pitch for all of three minutes and the touch could well have been his first. From such beginnings do crises develop and it is no exaggeration to say that Brentford could have been another two goals to the good in the first 45 minutes. How Jonathan Douglas missed a sitter, only he will know. A couple of minutes into the second half and Kevin Wilson’s decision to up-end Gray resulted in Alex Pritchard making it three from the penalty spot. Even then Forest kept battling and Michail Antonio scored from long range near the end after Danny Fox had been taken off on a stretcher leaving the home side with ten men. What had started as a promising opportunity to put things right was eventually a face-saving exercise. Forest's Chris Burke hurdles a challenge by Brentford defender Harlee Dean . It would be fair to suggest the Kuwaiti owner is not a patient man. Stuart Pearce is the fifth manager since the Al Hasawi family bought the club two years ago and four of those have been since Fawaz replaced cousin Omar. The 10-match unbeaten start seems a long time ago now. The owner wrote: ‘I have been in English football long enough now to know one month doesn’t make a season but I have also grown increasingly accustomed to the word “blip”.’ The conclusion to sentences like that in the past has been a quick farewell to the managerial incumbent, however popular the appointment in the first place. Striker Andre Gray (right) scored Brentford's second goal of the night . Pearce, never one to shirk a decision, dropped nine-goal, £5.5million striker Britt Assombalonga to the bench. He arrived for the second half as the manager threw everything into a fight back which imploded with the penalty decision. But it is a leakage rate of 12 goals in five games before Wednesday night which needs addressing urgently. There was plenty of decent, threatening build-up play from Forest without very much of an end product while every time Brentford broke, panic. Mark Warburton’s players have not been good travellers, three out of four away defeats before last night although they would have been buoyed by beating high-flying Derby last weekend. The opening goal was all down to Odubajo’s surging run. Referee Mark Haywood was spared the decision of whether Lascelles’ block was a penalty as both players tumbled to the turf because the ball squirted to Toral, who scored. Danny Fox was taken off on a stretcher to leave Forest down to 10 men . Forest responded positively without forcing David Button into any real saves until the latter stages. He could do nothing when Antonio let fly. But Pearce’s team always looked vulnerable on the break. Interestingly Lascelles was sacrificed in the half-time reshuffle with Michael Mancienne dropping into the back four from midfield. By that time, Lichaj had tapped the ball into Gray’s path making the task almost impossible. The ex-Aston Villa player hung his head and was roundly booed but showed character to keep battling. Any hopes of a comeback were dashed with Wilson’s challenge on Gray – a stonewall penalty. To the fans’ credit, many stayed until the end. To the players’ credit, they kept probing and did score. Stuart Pearce finds himself under increasing pressure from Nottingham Forest's Kuwaiti owners . But this will go down as a very bad night at the office for Pearce, and, by extension, Al Hasawi. ‘I never fear failure,’ said Pearce. ‘I care about the club and I feel I’m part of the terrace culture. The chairman has been supportive of me and I’m in the infancy of a job here, but, yes, we need a win. ‘Tonight we made individual errors. That erodes the confidence of the team and decent players become nervous players.’ Brentford boss Mark Warburton said: ‘We saw the team sheet and we thought we could exploit the space.’ Exactly.","Jon Toral, Andre Gray and Alex Pritchard put Brentford 3-0 up .

"The search for a cure to the common cold came a step closer yesterday – thanks to the common cod. A unique enzyme found in the Arctic species of the fish has the ability to trap the cold virus and stop it in its tracks, scientists claim. They have now adapted the enzyme, called trypsin, into a mouth spray that reduced the spread of the virus in clinical trials by 99 per cent – effectively curing it. Scientists have made a spray using an enzyme found in cod that halved the average number of days that people suffered from the common cold . The unique enzyme found in the Arctic species of the fish has the ability to trap the cold virus and stop it in its tracks, scientists claim . The spray works by forming an invisible barrier in the mouth and throat, which stops the virus being taken up by human cells and multiplying. The trials showed that the spray – made by Enzymatica – also halved the average number of days those who caught a cold had symptoms from 6.5 to three days. Dr Mats Clarsund, head of research and development at Enzymatica, said the remedy had been five years in the making, adding: ‘It is pretty revolutionary. ‘The common cold is a virus which binds to the mucus membranes of the nose, mouth and eyes. It is taken up by human cells and multiplies. ‘Once someone is infected, the virus moves to the throat area, where the first symptoms are a sore throat around 20 hours after the virus takes hold. 'The spray works because the enzyme forms a temporary, invisible barrier on the membranes preventing the virus being taken up. 'The enzyme doesn’t kill the virus, it effectively disarms it because it stops it being taken up with human cells, so the cold and its symptoms can’t progress.’ Trypsin, which is found in the pancreas of deep-sea cod, becomes more efficient at body temperature, making it very effective at stopping the virus when it comes into contact with skin or other tissue. The spray, known as ColdZyme, costs from £9.99 for a 7ml bottle and is being sold by Boots from this month.","An enzyme found in Arctic cod can stop the cold virus from spreading .

"WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . An equestrian centre shot dead a perfectly healthy former racehorse and dumped it in a mother-of-two's garden at night following a dispute over an unpaid £30 bill. Seven-year-old Kit was being kept in a DIY livery field owned by GG Centre in Raskelf, North Yorkshire, at a cost of £10 per week. But 26-year-old Beckie Warner - an experienced rider who leased the horse - told the centre she did not want to pay the charge until the end of Kit's stay. Ms Warner claims she  received a phone call last night, telling her that Kit would be left tied to a tree if she did not pay up. Just one hour later, she heard a dumper truck stop outside her house. She then saw Kit dying in her front garden from a single gunshot wound to the head, she says. Seven-year-old racehorse Kit, pictured left, was allegedly shot dead and dumped in a mother-of-two's garden in Raskelf, North Yorkshire (right) over a £30 unpaid bill . The horse, pictured, was being kept in a DIY livery field owned by GG Centre in Raskelf, North Yorkshire, at a cost of £10 per week, when the incident took place . Today, an RSPCA inspector claimed the horse had been killed illegally with a.38 pistol and said there was nothing physically wrong with the animal. But the owner of the GG Centre claims they had no choice but to put Kit down humanely, using a licensed specialist, after several failed attempts to get the horse into a box. Police also confirmed that two men, aged 36 and 53, are being questioned over the incident. Ms Warner said: 'I am absolutely devastated. I still cannot think straight. It's like being in a trance. 'I cannot get my head round what has happened, that someone could do something so evil. It's unreal - it's like something you would read about. 'I'm distressed by how somebody could do something so evil to an innocent animal, put a bullet in its head for just £30, not three grand but £30.' Ms Warner said she had to tell her daughters Honey, seven, and Lexi, four, there was a cow under the sheet for fear of upsetting them. She said: 'At about 9pm my horse would have been in her field happily eating grass and someone has taken her out, put a bullet in her head and dumped the body in my garden. 'The body was still there at 11am this morning, I had to tell my girls it was a cow under the sheet. They used to ride her.' Ms Warner said she had been looking after the horse - which belonged to a friend - since April, as part of a full loan agreement. Beckie Warner (left) said she received a phone call from GG Centre - owned by Harvey Johnson (right) - telling her the horse would be left tied up to a tree if she did not pay the bill . She claims she placed the horse at the GG Centre two weeks ago at a cost of £10 a week. The firm allegedly asked her to pay up front but she did not want to pay until afterwards. The incident took place on Wednesday evening, one hour after Ms Warner was phoned by the equestrian centre to demand payment of the bill . She said she received a phone call from the centre last night, asking again for the money. Ms Warner said: 'They asked me to pay a month up front but I didn't because people had warned me not to, I told them I would pay at the end of the month. 'Somebody from the centre phoned me last night and told me to pay up, but I said I would be paying them at the end of the week and they seemed fine with that. 'They told me if I don't pay up they would tie my horse up in my garden.' Today, Edward Harvey Johnson, owner of the GG Centre, confirmed the horse had been left with them in a DIY livery field, at a cost of £10 a week. The stables describes itself on its website as ‘one of the finest horse and rider facilities in the UK.’ He said the centre had tried frequently to contact Ms Warner, explaining they would tether the horse in her garden if she did not contact them. But he claims they were forced to put down the horse after several failed attempts to get Kit into a horse box. He claims it was done humanely by a licensed specialist in the field, before it was transported to Ms Warner's garden. Mr Johnson said: 'We removed the destroyed horse for them to dispose of in the correct or legal manner, as is the responsibility of the owner. Ms Warner found the horse lying in her garden, pictured, an hour after receiving a phone call from the centre . 'We are satisfied it was handled in the best possible way and we fulfilled our obligations for the safety and well-being of the general public. 'In this business you have to make these kind of decisions and they are not always pleasant or easy, but they have to be made. The buck has to stop somewhere.' Neighbours spoke of their horror over the incident. Donna Spencer, who was at the scene last night, said: 'The lady only had the horse on loan, she didn't own it. 'He phoned her and threatened her, and said if she didn't pay the money, the horse would be tied up in her garden. 'I'm just sickened, I can't believe someone has stooped so low to shoot someone's horse over £30. This needs to get out there.' Edward Harvey Johnson, owner of the GG Centre, said the horse had been put down humanely by a licensed specialist in the field after attempts to get him into a horse box were unsuccessful . And Dennis Jarvis said: 'There must have been about 12 police vehicles coming and going, vans, cars and officers in plain clothes. 'I looked down from my window and could see a big shape under some sheets, and I thought it might be a human body.' North Yorkshire Police today confirmed a 36-year-old man from Raskelf and a 53-year-old man from York were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. They remain in police custody. Karen Colman, an RSPCA inspector, said the arrests had been made at the GG Centre in Raskelf.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Nathaniel Clyne has revealed the story behind the tattoo on his left arm, illustrating him as a three-year-old child holding a football. The Southampton defender was given his first England call-up by Roy Hodgson last week for the upcoming Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia and the friendly at Scotland. But despite the future looking bright, Clyne remembers where he came from, and the striking ink is a representation of that. He also has London landmarks tattooed on him, including a phone box and Big Ben. Southampton right-back Nathaniel Clyne has admitted he is 'buzzing' at the prospect of an England debut . Clyne's interesting tattoo on his left arm depicts him as a three-year-old holding a football . ‘The tattoo is of me as a baby holding a football — it’s actually a picture of me in my mum’s house and I thought it would be good to get it written on to my arm,’ he said. ‘I was about three at the time. I always wanted to be a footballer and I followed my brother because he was always playing in the park. ‘I’m proud of where I’m from. I grew up in Stockwell, which wasn’t bad.

"Alex Song is sifting through an assortment of clothes. They are not the flamboyant kind he is accustomed to wearing, but they have been personally selected by him from West Ham’s club shop to wear for this photo shoot. ‘I like this one... but definitely not this one. I would never choose to wear this one,’ he says as he swaps a questionable navy pattern jumper for a smart navy claret cuff polo top. Then Cheikhou Kouyate bursts into the room. The midfielder merrily hums a tune before offering a warm welcome to those waiting in the wings, watching his team-mate deliver a sequence of Vogue-esque poses for the cameras. Midfield enforcer Alex Song was the obvious choice to model clothes from West Ham's fashion line . The Cameroon midfielder has always been proud of his individual sense of style . Suddenly Kouyate stops. ‘Hey, hey... why do you not ask me?’ He knows why. Song is West Ham’s ultimate fashion icon. Forget Andy Carroll, whose recent collaboration with Alexander Wang and H&M hit the billboards of Times Square in the Big Apple. Song is the man to be beaten for style here in Essex. Just take a look at the 27-year-old’s Instagram account and you’ll find various pictures of him sporting outfits which many would deem to be outrageous. Pink cardigan, a large trilby hat and a sarong draped over white jeans complete with white shirt, white cap and large red moonboot sneakers. That's just for starters. The Hammers staff and players are often amazed by his ‘brave’ wardrobe choices when he arrives for work at the club’s Chadwell Heath training ground. Not that it bothers the on-loan Barcelona man one bit. Song's Instagram account is awash with pictures of him dressed in some alternative outfits . The 27-year-old admits that some of his teammates tease him for being 'crazy' when it come to clothes . ‘Everyone who knows me really well knows that I love clothes and to dress well,’ says Song as he switches back into his clothing. It's a lot tamer than some of his previous clobber, but the casual two-tone leather and wool hoody is nevertheless eye-catching with its mix of short and long black laced tassles. ‘Some players were laughing at my jacket today,' he says. 'But it’s me. I like it because it’s short and long. They still say to me “Are you crazy!” That’s me. I’m an extravagant guy in the way I dress. I’ll never change.’ Song even has his own fashion label - Systeme Tchakap. It refers to an African way of life, living with a certain freedom and independence. ‘This hat is my own brand,’ says Songs as he leans forward to run his fingers across the synthetic peak front of his black snapback hat which is embossed with the brand name in red. ‘I sell it in some shops but mainly on the internet.’ Song has designed his own clothing label named Systeme Tchakap, which refers to an African way of life . Barcelona stars past and present including Javier Mascherano (top R), Cesc Fabregas and Gerard Pique (bottom R) wear Song styled baseball caps . This particular cap retails at £45 and it is so popular it is out of stock. And it doesn’t take long to figure out why when superstars like Lionel Messi and Neymar are pictured proudly showcasing his designs. Song expresses his love for fashion on the pitch too. He even rolls his shorts up to create the look of a throwback 1980s footballer. ‘I used to have it like that at Arsenal,’ he says. ‘It’s my own style and I like to do it. I feel good when I do it and when I play I’m very happy.’ West Ham’s current feelgood factor is a bit of a throwback to the famous Boys of ’86 era, when John Lyall’s side finished third in the old First Division. And it’s no coincidence that their transformation this season has been heralded by Song’s arrival. West Ham have risen to a surprising fifth in the Premier League table since Song's arrival at Upton Park . West Ham fans have pleaded with co-owner David Sullivan to make Song's loan deal permanent . In seven Premier League games with the former Arsenal ace at the heartbeat of the Hammers midfield, Sam Allardyce’s side have won four, drawn two and lost one, unexpectedly elevating them to fifth place. Red-hot strikers Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia have deservedly taken a most of the acclaim, having hit the back of the net nine times between them. But Song has enthralled his admirers with a succession of indomitable displays in midfield. In the 2-1 win over Manchester City a fortnight ago, he outclassed Yaya Toure. He even had the audacity to pull off a rabona against the champions. ‘It comes naturally,’ he laughs. ‘I’m looking to try it to make people happy but I’m mainly looking to try it to create a good opportunity.’ Inevitably, Song’s impressive start to the season has raised questions over his future. Co-chairman David Gold has been inundated with Twitter messages from supporters, urging him to make the transfer permanent. He agrees and insists discussions will take place. Song admits returning to the Premier League is different from sharing training with the likes of Neymar (L) The tough tackling midfielder learned his trade under Arsene Wenger at Arsenal . Naturally, Song takes it all in his stride and goes about his business as usual. Like his dress sense, things are a lot different at West Ham to what he has been used to over the past two years with Messi and Co in Catalonia. But he is very happy. ‘It’s a different way to when I was playing at Arsenal and Barcelona,’ he admits . ‘I’ve had a great opportunity to play for those two big clubs and again here at West Ham. ‘But I know it’s a different way. The first time I spoke to the Gaffer [Sam Allardyce] when I was about to sign, I was telling him that I like to play football. For me if I come from one team and the people don’t play football. I would be lost. ‘Sam said, “Don’t worry you’ll come here and see how we are playing”. I’m very happy because he gives us the opportunity to play. ‘I know we are not like Barcelona but we can play. And I like to play – when I have the ball, I don’t want to just put the ball away. I prefer to keep it, take my time and give the right ball in the right moment. And that’s what I want to do to help the team.’ Sam Allardyce, who picked up October's Manager of the Month, convinced Song to come to east London . Song has challenged West Ham to aim for a European finish after their storming start this season . Song is not one to take all of the credit, however. He identifies the likes of Sakho, Valencia and Stewart Downing for their part in West Ham’s upturn. Full interview in the official match programme . ‘West Ham do have very good players,’ he says. ‘The difference at Barcelona is that they are the best players in the world and, of course, that makes a big difference. ‘I try to bring my experience and the things I learned at Barcelona and at Arsenal to try and help the team. “We are trying to play the best football we can play and make the fans very happy.’ And they are very happy right now. The boo boys have disappeared and some are even daring to dream of Champions League football. ‘Why not?’ Song smiles. ‘For me, I believe we can catch Europe this year,’ he adds, still content after last weekend’s two-goal turnaround at Stoke where West Ham snatched a point. ‘But the best thing for us to do is to take it game-by-game. Today, we play Villa at home and we have to make sure we do not lose it. ‘We can’t look at where Villa are at the moment. We know that Villa is a good team and they will come here to try and get a good result. ‘We can’t think because we won against Manchester City and Liverpool that Villa will be easy. No. They have good players and we have respect for them. ‘We’ll do everything we can to win that game because it’s very important to get the three points at home.’ Song insists he will get better and better for West Ham this season once he regains full fitness . As Song straightens up his cap to conclude our chat, he warns that West Ham fans haven't seen the best of him yet. 'At the moment, I’m not fit like I want to be,’ he confesses. ‘I have a little bit of a problem with my knee. I can't train like I want to. Hopefully soon that will be finished. And when I’m not starting to feel nothing you will see more from me. 'I know I can do more.’ To paraphrase a slogan on one of his t-shirts, Song may not feel he is perfect but he is a limited edition.

"The colour of their shirts was symbolic and befitted the sombre occasion, matador red being replaced by funeral black. Spain may have rounded off a demoralising few weeks with a comfortable 3-0 victory over Australia in Curitiba but there was little appetite for fiesta, no sense that they had achieved some kind of consolation. This, after all, was the end of an era. From the line-up that had no place for those luminaries Xavi or Iker Casillas to the solemn trudge David Villa made to the touchline and the blank expression on Vicente del Bosque’s face at the final whistle, it felt like the time had come to say goodbye to those who have so entertained. VIDEO Spain bow out on high . Something to cheer: Fernando Torres celebrates his goal with Xabi Alonso . Opener: David Villa's first-half goal set Spain on their way to an easy win .

Subs: Casillas, De Gea, Azpilicueta, Javi Martinez, Busquets, Xavi, Pedro, Diego Costa. Goals: Villa 36, Torres 69, Mata 82. Man of the match: Andres Iniesta. For Villa, . who set the ball rolling with a cute 36th minute back-heel, . international retirement looms, as it does for Xabi Alonso. Xavi and . Casillas may well follow, while Del Bosque has offered to fall on his . sword after overseeing such a dismal defence of the trophy they won in . 2010. Changes, . clearly, are afoot yet if the last two weeks have been a catastrophe for . Spain, there can be no disputing that much of the previous six years . have been breathtakingly glorious, a period in which our views on how . football should be played were redefined. It is why . Spain’s exit from this carnival should be lamented. Holland and Chile, . clearly, deserved to progress at their expense from Group B but you . cannot help but feel the tournament will lack something when magicians . like Andres Iniesta are no longer involved. Joy: Goalscorers Mata and Torres celebrate . Rough and tumble: Australia's Mile Jedinak challenges Andres Iniesta . Spanish sandwich: Ben Halloran is crowded out by Mata and Jordi Alba . Iniesta, . as has so often been the case, was the star of the show, his repertoire . of passing too much for a limited Australia side to handle. This was his . 100th appearance for Spain and, typically, he used the ball with . metronomic precision; long or short, quick or slow, he always picked the . right option. Del Bosque . made seven changes to the team that was humbled by Chile in Rio de . Janeiro last Wednesday but Iniesta’s place was sacrosanct and his . presence helped Spain negotiate a tricky opening period to get on top in . the 23rd minute. He ushered . in Juanfran with a ball that was both immaculately timed and . beautifully weighted, taking advantage of the time and space Australia . had given him; Juanfran, who had surged into Australia’s penalty area, . picked out Villa, who nonchalantly did the rest. Floored: Torres goes to ground under the challenge of Matthew Spiranovic . Basement boys: Ryan McGowan reacts after Torres scored Spain's second . This was . what we have come to expect from Spain: the change of pace, the runs . that pull defences apart, the artistic passing and the killer instinct. It may have come two games too late but it was proof their gifts had not . deserted them. It was . also a reminder of Villa’s talent. A new adventure beckons in Melbourne, . then New York, but it has to be lamented he is departing both the . European and international scene. He is a wonderful striker, one who has . the talents to thrive in the Champions League. Missed opportunity: Villa sees a chance go begging . Taking a tumble: Tommy Oar is sent sprawling after a challenge by Juanfran . Getting shirty: Torres changes his top during the game .

"Created: . 09:14 EST, 26 April 2014 . Should university students studying literature or other texts be forewarned of content and themes that could be distressing, such as racism, rape or war? It seemed like a modest proposal, or so thought Bailey Loverin, a literature major at the University of California, Santa Barbara: What if professors were prodded to give students a written or oral heads-up before covering graphic material that could cause flashbacks in those who had been sexually assaulted, survived war or suffered other traumas? The idea proved popular with Loverin's classmates. Student government leaders at UCSB endorsed it. Faculty at other schools, editorial writers and online pundits had a different reaction, calling it 'silly,' 'antithetical to college life' and reflective of 'a wider cultural hypersensitivity to harm.' Warning: Bailey Loverin of the University of California believes students should be warned of material that could be traumatic to some students . 'What I have heard from a lot of people who don't fully understand the issue is, ""Life is life. You are going to get your feelings hurt and you should just suck it up and meet it head-on,""' Loverin, 19, said. 'But a girl just raped a month ago and sitting in a classroom for the first time again isn't ready to face that head-on.' Loverin told The New York Times that the idea came to her in February after a professor showed a film depicting rape in class with no warning. Despite having endured sexual abuse in the past, Loverin was not traumatized by the film but believes students deserve fair warning of such material. The uproar over her 'Resolution to Mandate Warnings for Triggering Content in Academic Settings' has called public attention to the use on college campuses of 'trigger warnings,' a grassroots phenomenon that had spread quietly from the Internet to the Ivory Tower. This year, the University of Michigan, Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania,  Oberlin in Ohio, Rutgers in New Jersey, Scripps in California and Wellesley in Massachusetts all have fielded requests  from students seeking more thoughtful treatment of potentially troubling readings, films, lectures and works of art. In a column called Trigger Warnings Needed in Classrooms, Rutgers student Phillip Wythe cited texts including F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, Virgina Woolf's Mrs Dalloway and Junot Diaz's This is How You Lose Her as material containing, variously, controlling relationships, gory violence and suicidal themes that could be trauma triggers for people who have ever experienced such things. Trigger warnings are advisories often written in bold type and affixed to a post, tweet, YouTube video or increasingly, a class syllabus. Long a feature of feminist web sites and originally used to warn rape and abuse survivors, they are designed to give people who might be negatively affected a chance to opt out. Domestic abuse: A Rutgers University student says books like Junot Diaz's This Is How You Lose Her should have trigger warnings, so that victims of controlling relationships are forewarned . The topics students are asking to be cautioned about cover a broad swathe of human suffering. At Michigan, speakers at an English Department event on bias said trigger warnings were needed for racially offensive book passages. The UCSB student resolution suggests they are appropriate for portrayals and discussions involving 'rape, sexual assault, abuse, self-injurious behavior, suicide, graphic violence, pornography, kidnapping, and graphic depictions of gore.' 'Classrooms have always been spaces where difficult, traumatic stuff got dealt with,' said Angus Johnston, an associate professor at Hostos Community College in the Bronx, N.Y., and historian of student activism. 'What's different now is, partly as a result of this new ethos in the online world of trigger warnings, you are seeing people being willing to assert themselves and say, ""My emotional well-being does matter.""' Laurie Essig, an associate professor at Vermont's Middlebury College, first heard about trigger warnings in the college context five years ago, following a discussion about eating disorders in her Sociology of Gender course. To illustrate her points, Essig showed pictures of fashion models and images taken from pro-anorexia web sites. Two students took her to task, telling Essig, 'Oh, you should have given a trigger warning for people with eating disorders, they can't see images like that.' While she has colleagues who do provide trigger warnings, Essig finds them 'ridiculous' and refuses to do so. 'I'm treating college students like the adults they are, and institutions increasingly treat college students like medicalized children,' she said. Filmmaker and writer Aishah Shahidah Simmons, a rape survivor who teaches at Temple University in Philadelphia, said she is careful to tell students on the first day of class and in her syllabus that 'we are getting ready to delve into some really difficult, painful information here,' such as sexual violence and police brutality. Simmons also gives them lists of resources for emotional support and has arranged private viewings for students who are afraid to watch a film in class. But she worries that trigger warnings, a term she does not use, could stifle free speech, if taken too far. 'Sometimes, I think you can get triggered by trigger warnings,' she said. Opposing views: Professor Laurie Essig (left) says trigger warnings are 'ridiculous' while AIshah Shahidah SImmons (right) says she is careful to tell her students when they will be covering difficult material . Already, the demands have led to head-scratching and in some cases, concerns about censorship. In February, after the Wellesley museum installed a life-like sculpture on campus of a man sleepwalking in his underwear, a student started an online petition to have it moved indoors because it had become 'a source of apprehension, fear, and triggering thoughts regarding sexual assault.' The same month, Wythe at Rutgers wrote that professors should employ 'trauma trigger warnings' as a compromise that would protect both academic freedom and 'individuals suffering from anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder - among many others.' A task force of faculty, administrators and students charged with updating Oberlin's sexual offense policy included a detailed section on trigger warnings in an online faculty resource guide. Under the sub-heading 'Understand triggers, avoid unnecessary triggers, and provide trigger warnings,' instructors were advised to be mindful of sexual misconduct, but also 'racism, classism, sexism, heterosexism, cissexism, ableism, and other issues of privilege and oppression.' Coddled: Many have described any measures taken to shield students from difficult and challenging material such as those suggested by Loverin of the University of California is antithetical to academic freeso, . Political science professor Marc Blecher was among the Oberlin professors who objected to the guide's 'imperative voice' and 'massively long list of -isms,' worrying they could be lead to discipline or legal action. 'It would have a very chilling effect on what I say in class and on the syllabus,' Blecher said. The task force has since removed the disputed section and plans to rewrite it with less 'emphatic-ness,' said Meredith Raimondo, an associate dean who oversaw the committee. So far, no schools have required trigger warnings. The executive council of the Academic Senate at UC Santa Barbara issued a statement Thursday noting many faculty members 'already use some kind of notification when difficult material will be covered in a course.' The council said it would work with students to address their concerns, adding the 'overall goal is to foster a climate of inquiry that allows students to learn, and faculty to teach, as freely and productively as possible.'","Student groups at universities around the country have called for trigger warnings for material that deals with difficult themes .

Rihanna vowed the masses at Tuesday's concert that was staged by HBO, Starbucks and Chase Corp. and intended to raise awareness for issues affecting veterans . Bruce Springsteen was joined by Dave Grohl and Zac Brown to cover  Vietnam-era anthem, Fortunate Son - a decision that received a mixed reaction on Twitter . 'What an amazing way to celebrate veterans on Veterans Day,' said Jack Black, one of the concert's hosts. While tickets were free, the celebrity hosts directed fans to ways they can volunteer or donate money to causes helping war veterans. Some in the audience said the gesture had symbolic importance. 'This is the first time since I've been back that I've felt honored to be back home, and I'm 65 years old,' said Bobby Monk, a disabled Vietnam veteran from Washington who wore a gray Army T-shirt. 'They treated us like criminals when we came back home. They didn't give us a parade.' Jennifer Hudson kicked off the event appropriately with a powerful rendition of The Star-Spangled Banner, a performance reminiscent of Whitney Houston's during the 1991 Super Bowl.

The massive crowd was then energized by Rihanna's anthem Diamonds and an ear-splitting set by Metallica, a longtime favorite of soldiers. Springsteen was more subdued, standing alone with an acoustic guitar to play a ruminative version of Born in the U.S.A., about a disillusioned Vietnam veteran. Earlier, Springsteen joined Grohl and the Zac Brown Band to cover another Vietnam-era anthem, Fortunate Son. The appropriateness of singing a counterculture era anti-war anthem that criticizes militant patriotic behavior was questioned by a number of people on Twitter. 'Maybe it's just me but Fortunate Son seems to be an inappropriate song to play at the Concert For Valor,' tweeted Jay Caruso. 'Leave it to Hollywood to insult those who serve on Veterans Day,' tweeted Ted Newton.

Eminem, wearing a camouflage hoodie, dropped several expletives before closing the show with his empowering Lose Yourself, again to the ire of many on Twitter. Other performers included Carrie Underwood, the Black Keys and Jessie J. In between the singers, extraordinary veterans were honored in video tributes hosted by Steven Spielberg, Reese Witherspoon and Oprah Winfrey, among others. Some of the subjects appeared onstage, including Leroy Petry, a Medal of Honor recipient who lost his right hand while serving in Iraq. Petry helped inspire Starbucks president Howard Schultz to write a book about veterans and pledge to hire at least 10,000 former service members.

Standing alone with an acoustic guitar, Bruce Springsteen played a ruminative version of Born in the U.S.A., his own song about a disillusioned Vietnam veteran . Comedian John Oliver, whose wife is a former U.S. Army combat medic, said he's seen firsthand the difficulties that returning veterans go through. 'It's kind of staggering, the dislocation over the past decade between the civilian population and the military,' he said. 'It offends me on a personal level.' The concert was televised live by HBO, which made its signal available to non-subscribers. Online streaming was also available. HBO chief executive Richard Plepler said it was possible that the concert could become an annual event. Schultz said he hoped the concert would help more Americans recognize the importance of welcoming post-9/11 veterans back to civilian life. 'Veterans Day comes once a year. Unfortunately, at times, it's turned into an annual weekend sale,' Schultz said. 'That's not what it's about.'

"Noah Ritter revealed more of his star potential on Wednesday when he charmed morning show viewers with another hilarious interview. The five-year-old, from Pottstown, Pennsylvania, stole the nation's hearts with his live TV interview last Friday on the opening day of the Wayne County Fair. Noah's clip - where he happily chats to the camera about super slides, his grandfather and how he doesn't watch TV news, all the while exhibiting a fondness for the word 'apparently' - has now had close to three million views on YouTube. Noah appeared on GMA live at 8.30am this morning, waving wildly at the camera and treating viewers to a massive yawn. Scroll down for video . Noah Ritter, five, from Pottstown, Pennsylvania, shared more of his hilarious take on the world on Wednesday morning on GMA . Noah  treated viewers to some energetic waving and a huge yawn this morning during another hilarious TV slot . The adorable five-year-old was amused by the idea that he should become a TV presenter when he grows up instead of his dream job, a paleontologist . The red-haired preschooler was asked by presenter Michael Strahan how it felt to be on TV, to which Noah responded: 'It's great, it's so great because I really never had any people like me. Fans... are you kidding me?' The five-year-old then told Strahan, newly-minted to the NFL Hall Of Fame: 'I know you're a part of the Giants... I used to like the Giants but my grandfather brainwashed me into liking the Steelers.' He then agreed with Strahan that he really liked dinosaurs, plenty of which were in display behind him, adding: 'I brainwashed myself to like dinosaurs.' The team erupted into laughter, but not much gets passed Noah, as he remarked: 'Now they're just laughing.' Strahan asked the five-year-old what he wants to be when he grows up. Noah replied: 'I'm going to be a paleontologist. He studies lots and lots of different types of dinosaurs.' Noah had Today show presenter Michael Strahan in fits of laughter when he told the former NFL star that he used to like the Giants but his grandfather 'brainwashed' him to be a Steelers fan . Noah also told viewers about his love of swimming and when Strahan asked if he could beat him, he quickly answered: 'Yes. I'm a very good swimmer. I've even won long races.' Amy Robach then asked Noah if he would ever be a news presenter, to which he shook his head and said: 'No, I'm being a paleontologist.' Noah was on a media blitz on Wednesday. He also told Today that he was thinking of retiring the word 'apparently', for a few simple reasons. He said: 'I don't know how to spell ''apparently''. I don't know what it means, but I use it in, ''Wow, this is apparently annoying.''' The five-year-old does have a way with words, however, telling the Today show that fame was like 'being a thousand drops of heaven'. Viewers were first introduced to Noah last week when he was stopped at the country fair in Honesdale by a WNEP TV crew. But while reporter Sofia Ojeda was seeking a verdict on the ride he had just been on with his grandfather, Noah had his own agenda. Exhibiting a fondness for the word 'apparently', he said: 'It was great and apparently I’ve never been on live television but apparently sometimes I don’t watch the news because I’m a kid and apparently every time Grandpa just gives me the remote I have to watch the Powerball.' Still attempting to get her soundbite, Ms Ojeda asked again how Noah had enjoyed his ride, only to get more of his adorable perspective on life. 'Well, it was great because apparently you’re spinning around and apparently every time you get dizzy, that’s all you do is get dizzy,' he said. 'I’ve never ever been on live television. I've never been on live television.' Noah's hilarious TV interview - where he managed to use the word 'apparently' eight times inside 90 seconds has gone viral with three million views on YouTube alone . Noah Ritter, 5, poses with his bicycle outside his home in Wilkes-Barre on Tuesday. He told viewers on Wednesday he plans to become a paleontologist when he grows up . The amused reporter, who is just seen crouching down to speak at his level asked: 'Are you excited?' To which Noah replied: 'Yeah, and apparently I only went down the super slide. . . I was scared half to death. I just freak out.' Noah used the word 'apparently' no less than eight times during the one-and-a-half-minute interview, and repeated that he had never been on live television three times. Noah's grandfather, Jack Borowski, who took him to the fair, told ABC News: 'Noah is pretty talkative. He has a large vocabulary.' He added that his grandson appears to be enjoying his new-found fame. 'We were watching it on the computer and it replayed on the local news,' Mr Borowski said. 'He’s going, ""That’s me. I’m a celebrity.""' But for Noah, who is spending the summer with his grandfather, TV fame comes a lowly third place in his list of favorite things. Mr Borowski said his first loves are dinosaurs and swimming. 'We go down to the history museum in Philadelphia about once a month because he loves the dinosaurs,' the grandfather said. 'And we go for swim lessons every Saturday morning because he loves to swim.'

"A 57-year-old woman who owned 20 cats was mauled to death by two vicious neighborhood dogs outside her Ohio home on Friday morning. Klonda Richey's lacerated body was found naked on snow-covered Bruce Avenue, Dayton about 8.15am, thrashed by her next door neighbors' male mixed breed Bullmastiffs. Records have revealed Richey complained at least six times about the 60-pound canines before her horrific death, but authorities said they were never able to find the dogs. Tragic: Cat-lover Klonda Richey, 57 (pictured with former Montgomery County Republican Party Chairman Rob Scott) was mauled to death by two vicious Bullmastiffs outside her Ohio home on Friday . Richey's next-door neighbors, 28-year-old Andrew . Nason and 23-year-old Julie Custer, were taken into custody after the attack. They are being . held on a charge of reckless homicide, pending the filing of formal . charges. WDTN reported Custer, a Wright State University nursing graduate and mother, was the registered owner of the dogs. The animals, which ripped off Richey's coat during the attack, were put down after they charged responding police officers on Friday. The Montgomery County Coroner's Office said an autopsy was completed yesterday but the results will be released on Monday. Richey's body is being held for further testing, according to Dayton Daily News. Arrested: Richey's next-door neighbors, Andrew Nason (right) and Julie . Custer (left) were taken into custody on Friday and are being held on a . charge of reckless homicide, pending the filing of formal charges . No action taken: Records show Richey repeatedly complained to authorities about the dangerous dogs owned by her next-door neighbors, Andrew Nason (left) and Julie Custer (right) Dog owner: Police said two dogs owned by Julie Custer (pictured) mauled Klonda Richey to death and left her naked on a sidewalk . 'My right hand man!' Julie Custer, who was arrested over the death of her neighbor, posted a picture of this dog to her Facebook page in 2012 . News of the shocking incident has devastated Richey's family and friends, who they described as a caring person who doted on her 20 cats. She had worked at Montgomery County Job & Family Services Administration Services Division for 25 years. 'It's so ironic that this devout animal lover would be killed by animals in such a brutal aggressive way,' colleague Ann Stevens said. 'Every conversation I had with Klonda included cats - she was very passionate about animals and their well being and because of that she always had a special place in my heart.' Richey was also an active Republican party volunteer, according to Dayton Daily News, and campaigned for Mitt Romney. Rob Scott, former chairman of the Montgomery County Republican party, met Richey when he became chairman of the party in April 2012. 'She was always smiling and upbeat and positive, I never heard her say one negative thing about anyone,' he said. 'She always looked on the positive side of life.' It is understood Richey lived alone in her clapboard home with her beloved cats. In the wake of Friday's attack, Montgomery County Animal Control Resource Center officers removed her cats, which were well cared for. They are reportedly being adopted by her friends. In a troubling twist, it has been revealed that Richey complained to law enforcers about the dangerous dogs before she was fatally mauled. A WTDN investigation showed in July of last year, Richey called 911 and told the dispatcher that two Bullmastiffs living at 35 East Bruce Avenue charged her.

'We have had previous complaints on the animals but we’ve never located them or seen them,' he said.

"The picture apparently showing a big cat dubbed the Beast of Trowbridge was last night claimed to be a fake. Although it certainly appears to be a black and furry four-legged beast, doubt has been cast over whether it really was photographed prowling near a certain Wiltshire town. It emerged the photograph - possibly of a cougar - may have in fact been taken in Lapeer County, Michigan, in the US- and first published in 2007 . Cat-ch me if you can: Herbert and Doreen Smith spotted this large feline in Trowbridge, Wiltshire . Brush with the beast: The couple were just feet away from what they believe could be the Beast of Trowbridge, a puma or panther spotted for years in the area . Herbert and Doreen Smith claim they . saw the unusual animal while walking in Murhill Woods, in Trowbridge, . Wiltshire last week and took the photo. Mr Smith, 71, said they observed the animal catching and then eating some prey. He said: 'Our first impression was sheer astonishment. We really could not believe our eyes at what we were seeing. 'The animal was eating what we believe it had just caught. 'There was a lot of rabbits about so I expect it was having breakfast. 'I was about 20ft away from it while it was eating. It looked up at me for a couple of seconds, then resumed eating. Expert: Big Cat investigator Frank Tunbridge said it looked like a cross between a black leopard and a puma . 'If it wasn't for my wife tugging at my arm to get me out of there, I would have stayed observing this magnificent animal.' The . Smiths are not the first to spot the creature which has been dubbed the . 'Beast of Trowbridge' by locals and there have been numerous sightings . over the years. Described as a puma or panther, the animal has also been seen in nearby Staverton and Westbury Leigh. After . looking at the pictures, Big cat tracking expert Frank Tunbridge said . the animal looks like a cross between a black leopard and a puma. He said: 'It is what we would call a British Big Cat. 'Looking . at the curve of the tail it is very feline. Cats lay down to eat like . that, unlike dogs or foxes which usually stand up. 'It . is difficult to judge the size as there is very little in the photo to . suggest proportions, but the couple who saw it certainly say they were . shocked and presumably they would have known if it was just the size of a . domestic cat.' Mr Tunbridge, of Gloucester, added that it is entirely possible for big cats to survive in the UK. 'I go out into the field all the time and I know how they live. 'Big . cats do not need antelopes or zebra to survive on. They can live off . hares, rabbits, pheasants, moles, and of course there is plenty of those . in our countryside. 'In . the summer when there is plenty to eat, they survive on the smaller . mammals, but in winter when there is less food around they will go for . the bigger prey like deer.' He . said it is widely thought big cats came to roam the British countryside . after they were released by people who bought them as pets in the 1960s . and 70s. 'They were kept by the pop stars and models and people with money when there were no rules and regulations,' he said. 'When the Dangerous Animals Act came in in 1976, rather than have their pets destroyed they would take them out to the Cotswolds or the Forest of Dean or somewhere similar and just let them go. 'They bred and cross-bred after that.' The Beast of Trowbridge has been likened to the colour and size of a panther (file pic) Sightings of the 'Beast of Trowbridge' have been reported for years, but there was a sudden flurry in 2009. Chauffer Mark Jenner, 34, of Trowbridge, spotted what he believed was a big cat lurking by the side of a road between Bradford on Avon and Bath. He told The Wiltshire Times: 'I could see these large reflective eyes and thick black coat, it was much larger than a cat.' Den Owen, 39, of Trowbridge, also spotted the beast twice in the space of a week, while driving towards home. At the time she said: 'It ran across the road like only a cat could. It had its back down and its tail out flat. It was around five and a half foot long and the height of a dog.” Meanwhile Pamela Thomson, of Chapmanslade, claimed she had a close encounter with a big black cat six years ago in Westbury Leigh. She took a photograph of the four-inch paw print it left on her car. In another incident, songwriter Mike Booth, of Marlborough,told the newspaper that he saw a large cat crossing the road in front of him. Also in 2009, shop worker Allyson Jones told how she came face to face with the big cat dubbed the 'Beast of Trowbridge'. Miss Jones, 38, a beauty specialist, was driving on the B3107 between Bradford on Avon and Holt when she saw the beast in the path of her car. She said: 'I thought it was going to eat me. It had just jumped out of a hedge and stood in the path of my car staring at me. 'It's eyes were red because of my headlights, which I then turned off because I know that with other animals, like deer, you turn your lights off and they run away. 'The cat ran away and headed in the direction of Trowbridge.' Jim Holt, 52, from Trowbridge, also saw the beast. He said: 'This cat ran out of the trees across the road and it was then that I saw this creature just looking out from the trees. 'It just lay there and stared. It is definitely a large cat-like creature from what I could tell.' Rita Fielding, 73, of Bradford on Avon, spotted a big cat in 2010. She said: 'I looked over and saw a massive black cat in some dead grass by the bank. I turned to tell my neighbour and it had gone by the time I looked back. 'What struck me is that it was so very very black and was much bigger than a dog.' Meanwhile Jim Connor, 73, and his wife Anna, 71, have seen a panther-like creature in Trowbridge and Westbury. He said: 'I've seen it walking up the drive in the middle of the night without a care in the world.' THE WILDCAT OF WOODCHESTER . In January 2012, DNA tests were . carried out on the carcasses of three roe deer found dead at Woodchester . National Park, near Stroud, in a bid to establish how they were killed. One . of the deer had its vital organs missing and had had its snout severed - . the hallmarks of a panther-like kill - but the tests found no evidence . of a wild cat being involved. Testing: A DNA test on . the carcass of this deer did not prove the presence of a big cat, but experts said the attack had the hallmarks . of a panther-like creature . In February 2012, a gigantic paw print was discovered in the hills around Bristol. Barber Luigi Armato, 32, photographed the print on his mobile phone near the village of Binegar in the Mendip hills, while on a shooting trip with his father and brother. Mr Armato, from Bristol, said the print was like nothing he had ever seen before - while wildlife experts said its size correlated with the paw of a big cat. The Avon Wildlife Trust said the prints are unlikely to be those of a fox - unless it was an extremely large one. The mark of the beast? Luigi Armato snapped this print on his phone . while on a trip in the Mendip Hills . The Mendips have been the site of several reported big cat sightings in recent years, and savaged carcasses discovered in the West Country added weight to claims that at least one giant beast is living there. Also in February 2012, grainy film footage emerged online showing what appears to be a 6ft-long beast slinking across a field just three miles from Woodchester Park. Teaching assistant Coryn Memory, who lives in the area, said she had spotted the large black animal - dubbed the 'Wildcat of Woodchester', five times before shooting the video. She said her first sighting came in July 2009, when she saw the panther-like creature crossing a field near her house in Thrupp, near Stroud. THE BEAST OF BODMIN MOOR . Evidence: A large cat skull, found in the River Fowey, on the edge of Bodmin Moor in 2005 . One of the more famous big cats is . the Beast of Bodmin Moor - over 60 sightings of a large black cat have . occurred in the area over the years. In 2005, a skull with large fangs and thought to be the remains of a big cat were found in the River Fowey close to the moor. The skull was sent to the Natural History Museum in London for verification. They determined that it was a genuine skull from a young male leopard, but also found that the cat had not died in Britain. In fact, the skull had been imported as part of a leopard-skin rug. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food  conducted an official investigation into the 'beast' and other unknown animals reported to be roaming Britain in 1995. It concluded there was no 'verifiable evidence' of exotic felines loose in Britain,. But it also stated that the investigation could not prove that big cats were 'not present'. THE BEAST OF NORTH NORTON . In July 2013, Sir Benjamin Slade claimed the beast had been on his land and that animals had been killed at the 98-acre Maunsel House. One of his staff managed to take a picture of the purported animal. Tom Baker, 25, the staff member who . snapped the creature when he was putting out the rubbish at Maunsel . House, said: ‘I saw something about 150 metres away and didn’t know if . it was a deer, but it looked strange. I zoomed in and took the images. ‘It certainly looks like a big cat. I have no other explanation for it.’ Mysterious: What appears to be a big cat in a picture taken by Sir Benjamin Slade at Maunsel House, Somerset .","Herbert and Doreen Smith were left shocked after seeing the huge animal .

"Journalist Nick Ames was in the press box at the Partizan Stadium in Belgrade on Tuesday and witnessed the chaotic scenes which led to the abandonment of the Euro 2016 qualifier between Serbia and Albania. Perhaps I should have known better, but as Serbia vs Albania neared half-time I had started thinking to myself that the evening had, after all, gone off in relative calm. Sure, you could not hear a single note of the Albanian national anthem above the whistles and howls; sure, you didn’t need too big a Serbian vocabulary to know that the chants from the ultras just below Partizan Stadium’s press box were about as colourful as it gets. But, a couple of chances for the visiting side apart, Serbia had controlled the first half and – with no away fans in the stadium – there seemed little scope for trouble unless the visitors took a shock lead. The flag is flown above the pitch by a drone with the message 'autochthonous', meaning indigenous . Stefan Mitrovic leaps to grab the flag and pull it and the drone to the ground - leading to chaos .

Serbian riot police try to contain the home supporters after fighting broke out in the pitch and the stands - it is not known whether the fans shown in this picture were involved in the disorder . Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic walks from the pitch with his head bowed on a disgraceful night . Albanian fans were banned from attending the match between the two Balkan rival nations, due to the turbulent relations between the two. These have mainly surrounded the over the former ethnic Albanian-dominated Serbian province of Kosovo. Kosovo declared independence in 2008, but this is not recognised by Serbia. NATO waged a 78-day air war in 1999 to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by Serbian forces fighting a two-year counter-insurgency war. Seven of Albania's squad were born in the Kosovo region. This was a game that had set the alarm bells ringing from the off, though. Serbia and Albania have a fraught and uneasy recent history, centring around Kosovo – the largely ethnic Albanian-populated territory that declared independence from Serbia in 2008. Tensions are high. UEFA had stepped in to settle a dispute between the two FAs about away ticketing, advising that nobody should travel, and the scope for flashpoints seemed thin on the ground. Unless somebody came up with something unexpected, surreal and quite remarkable. Just as I began musing on the unremarkable nature of it all, thinking to tweet my impressions at the break play was stopped by Martin Atkinson – the English referee may never have another night like this – because a flare had been thrown in the direction of an Albanian throw-in taker. It was cleared from the pitch quickly enough; the delay, though, took longer than usual and it was only upon a glance upwards that the reason became apparent. A small craft was hovering just above the pitch, visible against the floodlights on a dark, clear night and parallel to the top of the stand. Strange enough, but what was gradually bringing the crowd to fever pitch as it came to their attention proved to be the spark inside the tinderbox. The red and black flag, the familiar figure of an eagle in the centre, depicted ‘Greater Albania’ – an idea encompassing the area of the Balkans in which ethnic Albanians reside. Riot police attempt to contain fans in the stands of the Partizan Stadium . A flare is lit among the Serbian crowd - it is not known whether  fans shown in this picture were involved in the disorder . Chelsea defender Ivanovic watches on as the Albanian players seize the flag . Riot police and fans clash in the stands before the game was later cancelled - it is not known whether the fans shown in this picture were involved in the disorder . The double-headed eagle, as featured on the Albanian flag, is imposed upon so-called 'Greater Albania' where ethnic Albanians live. The word 'Autochthonous' refers to Serbia's alleged attempts to control Kosovo despite not being indigenous to the region. The man on the left is Ismail Qemal, founder of the Albanian national movement, and of the modern Albanian state as its first head of state and government. On the right is Isa Boletini, a nationalist figure who fought in the Albanian Revolt in Kosovo in 1910 and later in World War I against Serbia. All the same, when Serbia defender Stefan Mitrovic leapt up to catch the flag, which had sunk from the sky as the seemingly remote-controlled drone dropped with it, it seemed a sensible enough thing to do. Take it to the sidelines, get it off the pitch, get on with the game. It had been a surreal, almost filmlike sequence and an act of stunning provocation – but there was time to salvage matters. But Albania’s players wanted their flag and, after Andi Lila and Taulant Xhaka had wrestled Mitrovic for it, it ended up in the hands of striker Bekim Balaj – well known for scoring a superb winner against Portugal last month. What followed was a blur, a rush and swirl of people and movements that I was only able to piece together correctly upon returning from the stadium. At the time, it was impossible to believe your eyes: in years of covering football at home and abroad, nothing had come close to this. As Balaj made to leave the field, substitutes and officials from both sides had entered the fray – joined, somehow, by fans who had found it surprisingly easy to burst the massed ranks of police. One supporter made for Balaj with a chair; he was wrestled to the ground by Lorik Cana, the Albanian captain and ex-Sunderland player, who detained him there for a almost a minute while chaos unfolded around him. Another, entering the pitch from the other side, made for visiting players too. This unholy mix of players, staff, police and fans piled in – and for a moment you had no idea where it would end. It did come to a close, eventually, when the Albanian players made a run for the players’ tunnel in the south-east corner. This was always going to be the lesser of several evils, but it didn’t stop the being pelted with missiles from the Serbian ultras – stationed in that very corner, right below my seat in the press box, and set upon by another pitch invader.

As they crouched and ran, hands over their faces, a Serbian official could be seen covering his own in evident despair a little behind them. His countrymen left the field in orderly fashion shortly afterwards, but the damage – and Serbia has some previous – may have been done despite the obvious act of provocation. We waited for news. It came, 15 minutes or so later, that the match would continue. By now, the ranks of police separating stands from pitch were three or four deep; a presence whose like I have never witnessed at any sporting event. Out came Serbia manager Dick Advocaat and a few of his substitutes a little after that; in they came again shortly afterwards. The south stand had been partly cleared by then, and something appeared to be up. Sure enough, news filtered through that Atkinson had abandoned the match. Serbia emerged from the tunnel anyway, moving to the centre circle and applauding the fans who remained. But there was little to applaud in Belgrade on Tuesday night. An event that had been given every opportunity to pass peacefully had ended in turmoil whose repercussions may be felt beyond football. Few supporters remained outside an eerily quiet ground when I finally left an hour later. All was calm again but, just as had been the case before Atkinson stopped play, that told none of the story.

"Symone Greene, a 22-year-old substitute teacher, has been charged with first-degree sexual abuse of a minor in a significant relationship after allegedly having sex with a football player student. A 17-year-old teenager is said to have recorded the teacher performing a sexual act before sending the video to his friends. The alleged incident happened on October 17 in a classroom at Options Public Charter School in Washington, DC, according to the warrant. Symone Greene, the teacher who allegedly had sex with a 17-year-old student on her first day of school . The teen, a football player, recorded Greene performing a sex act on him after a high school pep rally for the team, authorities say . The student told police he met her at the school and gave her his phone number, reports WTTG. He claims he later received a text message from Greene, who was teaching English, to which he asked her if she was 'kinky'. She allegedly responded, 'I don't tell, I show,' court documents state. The sex attack at the end of the school's pep rally - it allegedly occurred in Greene's classroom where the student recorded the oral sex,  without Greene's knowledge, according to the warrant. Greene then allegedly sent the teen a text message over the weekend asking him not to tell anyone because 'it is not right for a student and teacher to have a relationship.' Greene was working at Options Public Charter School (pictured) in Northeast D.C. on Friday when she first met the victim, a 17-year-old football player, according to court documents . She also allegedly sent a clothed picture of herself to the student, reports WUSA. 'When school administrators learned of the incident Monday morning, we immediately contacted the Child and Family Services Agency, the Metropolitan Police Department, and the parent of the student,' Shannon Hodge, the school's executive director, said in a statement. Hodge said Greene was contracted through a company based in Delaware and had never worked at the school before. Greene was arrested and charged this week, according to the documents.","Symone Greene has been charged with first-degree sexual abuse of a minor in significant relationship .

"An incredible country estate with a 38-bedroom main house, its own loch, a golf course and 19 other homes has been put on the market for £6million. The Dall Estate, in the Scottish Highlands, was earmarked to become the world's most expensive private members club, with annual fees of £2million, and was dubbed the 'Monaco of The Glen'. But planning permission was rejected and the owner, Malcolm James, decided to continue to use it as a family home. Scroll down for video . Inside one of the grand rooms: The opulently decorated interior was earmarked to be the stage of the world's most expensive member's club - preemptively dubbed  'Monaco of the Glen' He has now put the mammoth estate on the market for 'in excess of £6 million', the same as several three-bedroom flats in Mayfair and significantly less that a £6.6million one-bedroom flat in Kightsbridge which went on sale last month. The Dall Estate is bigger than many villages - and comes with Dall House, its own loch, an assault course, an old golf course, a boat shed, a boat house, dormitories and 19 additional homes. There are labs, a hydro power station and even an indoor sports centre with its own five-a-side football pitch on the estate - which dates back to 1346 and is located on the south shore of Loch Rannoch in Highland Perthshire. The sprawling property is dominated by the 38-bedroom main home and whoever takes over the estate gets riparian rights on the loch. The owner is Malcolm James, a secretive Cornishman who made his millions in property speculation. He bought the property for around £1.3million in 2002. View of the castle: The main building has 38 rooms and is currently occupied by its enigmatic multi-millionaire owner Malcolm James . Views of the loch: The site offers stunning views of Loch Rannoch, pictured above, in Highland Perthshire . Mr James bought the estate in 2003. It had previously been Rannoch School, whose former pupils include the current Earl of Cardigan. The Dall Estate, now on the market for £6million, was previously Rannoch School - until the institution closed in 2002. The school was founded in 1959 and was immediately welcomed as the perfect private school environment for a robust regime of outdoor pursuits. Pupils flocked to the remote surroundings with its beautiful lochside setting. But by 1999, many parents were questioning the value of a boarding school education and the only private schools that were flourishing were those that could guarantee top grades and a ready supply of day pupils. Rannoch performed averagely in exams and was seen as too remote by most parents. From a high of around 300 pupils, by 2001 the school roll had declined to just 140. But the private school, opened in 1959, was forced to close in 2002 due to falling numbers and insurmountable debts. The businessman had hoped to turn Dall Estate into a playground for billionaires and, in 2009, unveiled ambitious plans for the ultimate private members club. He wanted to charge people £2million per year to be a member, leading to the proposed site being dubbed the 'Monaco of the Glen'. The entrepreneur boasted about how Tiger Woods wouldn't be able to afford to be a member, but he would be allowed to use the golf course 'as a guest'. But there were a number of protests and Perth and Kinross Council voted against the plans. Mr James uses the main mansion as his private home but has now instructed Asset Properties to sell the entire estate for more than £6million. Kyle Cockburn, boss of Asset Properties, today described it as 'a really special place with fantastic history'. He said: 'A clan seat estate is a very rare thing and I hope someone spots its potential as a corporate retreat or a hotel. 'Now the referendum has been decided it is time to find it a new owner. We have interest from all over the world and finding a buyer is very much what I aim to do. 'It is likely to attract wealthy hoteliers from China but it would also be an ideal billionaire's retreat. The estate has so much. It practically has the services you would find in a small town. 'There is the old golf course, curling rink, chapel, sports centre, hydro station and even a small library.' The estate lies on the edge of the ancient Black Wood of Rannoch, which is one of the largest remnants of ice age forests in Scotland. View across the estate: It has been described as larger than many villages yet is on the market for just £6million . Outbuilding:  Dall Estate had previously been Rannoch School, whose former pupils include the current Earl of Cardigan . It is set in grounds of approximately 90 acres, which contain many mature specimens of trees, including giant American Red Woods, and abundant wildlife. The house was commissioned by Clan Chief George Duncan Robertson and built by the renowned architect Thomas Mackenzie, who was responsible for Aldourie Castle (1853), famous for being where the Loch Ness Monster was first seen. Dall House was the only home he designed and built himself from scratch in the Scots Baronial style, known for its 16th Century features, including turrets. The house, which is B-Listed, retains many original Victorian features including the magnificently wood panelled hallways, staircases and reception rooms.

"Pope Francis has today come out against the legalisation of drugs such as cannabis, saying attempts to sell it for recreational use are 'highly questionable'. Francis told members of a drug conference in Rome that attempts to legalise recreational drugs 'are not only highly questionable from a legislative standpoint, but fail to produce the desired effects.' The news comes as it was revealed the pontiff threw out asylum seekers seeking refuge in his favuorite church while he visited, forcing them to sit in the car park and refusing to meet with them. Pope Francis has spoken out against legalising drugs, saying that allowing recreational use was 'highly questionable' (Francis pictured today on a visit to Malta) The Pope spoke out against allowing drugs to be given to addicts, saying 'Let me state this in the clearest terms possible. The problem of drug use is not solved with drugs!' The Pope previously said that the Church must be the ‘first port of call’ for migrants arriving on Europe’s shores, but refused the meeting in case it is seen 'as a political gesture'. Francis has also spoken out against drug addiction, calling it evil, and has often met with addicts. When he was archbishop of . Buenos Aires, he devoted much of his pastoral care to addicts. Francis added that providing addicts with drugs offered only 'a veiled means of surrendering to the phenomenon.' He said: 'Let me state this in the clearest terms possible. The problem of drug use is not solved with drugs. 'One has to say yes to life, yes to love, yes to others, yes to education, yes to greater job opportunities. 'If we say yes to all these things, there will be no room for illicit drugs, for alcohol abuse, for other forms of addiction.' Just . last month, Uruguay - next door to Francis' native Argentina - approved . selling marijuana cigarettes in pharmacies, and recreational marijuana . is legal in the U.S. states of Colorado and Washington. It was also revealed today that before his visit to Malta (pictured), the Pope had around 120 refugees seeking asylum in his favourite church thrown out so he could visit . In Colorado, cannabis has already been linked to a string of poisonings in children after they ate cookies or sweets laced with cannabis that are identical to non-cannabis varieties. Of the nine children who have so far been treated for eating edible marijuana, six became critically ill, with the youngest being just two. Francis refused to meet with around 120 people, mostly migrants from North Africa and Eastern Europe, who took refuge in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore two weeks ago. Having been evicted by Italian authorities from a squat outside Rome the fifty families asked Francis to grant them asylum in the Vatican. In a letter to the Pope they said: 'We ask that you make yours the wounds that we carry, that you grant us as human beings who have been persecuted, harassed and humiliated by the Italian state, political asylum.' But Francis, who went to pray at the Marian Basilica on his very first day in office, and often seeks advice there before making journeys abroad, had the church cleared yesterday before his visit. As he arrived in a procession to celebrate the Corpus Christi the migrants were relegated to the car park by Vatican Gendarmerie. ‘We couldn’t even see the Pope. We were moved to the car park and he came in the back entrance,’ one migrant Rashid Belbiar from Morocco said. Vatican spokesman Father Thomas Rosica said beforehand that the Holy See feared such a meeting might be ‘manipulated to put pressure on the Rome authorities’. Francis refused to meet with the refugees, despite their pleas, over fears it would be seen as a 'political gesture'. Francis often visits the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore before travelling to ask for guidance . One woman identified only as Magdalina, told La Repubblica the migrants were 'shocked' at their treatment. She said: 'We were counting on being able to meet Pope Francis. We asked him to hear us out, even just for a few minutes. 'But they told us that we could not meet him and must go away from the church. They told us that if he met us it would be a political gesture.' Francis was their 'last chance of salvation', she said. The group must leave the Basilica today. While the Italian authorities have offered the group temporary accommodation in a former exhibition hall they had previously refused because other inhabitants have been diagnosed with tuberculosis. Tomorrow while on a visit to the southern Calabria region in Italy, Francis will visit the stronghold of one of the world's most powerful Mafia families. The Pope is due to travel to the town of Cassano Jonico, home of the 'Ndrangheta, a criminal organisation that allegedly has a turnover of $72billion per year. The crime syndicate is so well established that it even has routes into the local churches, according to prosecutors in the region. Francis became emotional when denouncing the killing of Nicola 'Coco' Campolongo in January. The three-year-old boy was shot dead alongside his grandfather and another woman in an alleged hit by Calabria's Mafia, with Francis calling on gangsters to 'repent'.","Pope Francis has spoken out today against the legalisation of drugs .

"Former White House press secretary Jay Carney joined a chorus of Obama naysayers on Wednesday, saying there's no question of whether the U.S. will put 'boots on the ground' in Iraq – only a question of how many. '""No boots on the ground"" is semantically problematic,' Carney told CNN anchor Jake Tapper, 'because obviously there will be American military personnel with their boots on the ground.' 'There are already,' Tapper replied. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Jay Carney, the former White House press secretary, said Wednesday that there will 'obviously' be American 'boots on the ground' in Iraq . The president insisted Wednesday that he won't put combat boots on the ground in Iraq to fight the ISIS terror army . Conservative journalist Bill Kristol (right) assured Carney and host Jake Tapper (left) that 'there are already' American troops fighting ISIS . President Obama insisted Wednesday during a speech at a Florida air base that he will not send ground troops into Iraqi combat zones to fight the ISIS terrorist army, despite his top general's statement a day earlier that Obama had asked him for recommendations 'on a case-by-case basis.' 'I want to be clear,' Obama insisted. 'The American forces that have been deployed to Iraq do not and will not have a combat mission. They will support Iraqi forces on the ground as they fight for their own country against these terrorists.' Carney seemed at odds with his old boss 24 hours later on CNN, but he also kept a tunnel of daylight between Obama and former President George W. Bush, whose decade-long Iraq war was a gigantic military operation involving nearly 150,000 U.S. servicemen and women. 'There is the distinction that is being drawn ... between what we did in Iraq – a war that lasted for a very long time, cost us an enormous amount of money and cost a lot of people their lives and resulted in sustained and terrible injuries for many, many more – and what we are doing now,' Carney said. Conservative publisher Bill Kristol suggested that the White House shouldn't rule out a scenario where military commanders declare,""You know what? This thing is on the cusp. We need to send in 3,000 or 5,000 U.S. combat ground troops to win this thing"".' 'That would be saying specifically only 5,000,' Carney replied, 'not 5,005.' 'No,' said Kristol: 'You would be leaving the option open, which is what a serious commander-in-chief does.' On Tuesday, Joint Chiefs chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey told the Senate Armed Services Committee that circumstances on the ground could drive him to push for American combat troops to be embedded with Iraqi army units. 'If we reach the point where I believe our advisers should accompany Iraqi troops on attacks against specific ISIL targets,' Dempsey said, using an alternative name for the terror group, 'I will recommend that to the president.' Asked by New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte whether the president had ruled out the use of American ground forces in a combat role, Dempsey responded, 'Yes. But he has told me as well to come back to him on a case-by-case basis.' He said that if needed, he 'would go back to the president and make a recommendation that may include the use of ground forces.' On Wednesday Obama cited both the Iraq conflict and the emergence of a new Ebola virus epidemic in west Africa as signifying 'America's unique abilities and responsibilities to lead.' On Monday night the White House announced a deployment of 3,000 ground troops and Army engineers to intervene in Liberia, a country that has already seen more than 2,400 diagnosed cases and 1,300 deaths from the disease. 'It is America that has the unique capability to mobilize against an organization like ISIL,' he said. 'In a world full of broader social challenges, it is America that has the unique capability and know-how to help contain and combat a threat like Ebola.' Aside from his early roll call of the various armed services, Obama's biggest applause line was his direct threat to ISIS. 'Whether in Iraq or in Syria,' the president said, 'these terrorists will learn the same thing that leaders of al-Qaeda already know: We mean what we say.' 'Our reach is long. If you threaten America, you will find no safe haven. We will find you eventually.'","Former White House press secretary seemed to be at odds with President Obama .

"The owners of a 'monster' 130-pound pit bull Niko that mauled to death a young girl only one week before her fifth birthday are refusing to talk to investigators, police said. Mia DeRouen and mother Megan Touchet, 27, were attacked by her boyfriend’s pit bull last week in their Houma, Louisiana, home while watching television. It took police 10 shots to finally bring the beast down, officials said. Despite the young girl suffering severe wounds to her head, face and chest in the attack, and her mother handed her to paramedics through the window of a room she had barricaded herself in, Touchet and her boyfriend are refusing to talk. April 3 would have been her fifth birthday. Tragic: Four-year-old Mia Derouen, pictured, was mauled to death by her family's pit bull while she was watching TV Tuesday night - April 3 was to be her fifth birthday . 'Monster': Niko was a 130 pound beast of a dog - the average pit bull weighs in around 50 pounds . 'Happy birthday': Mia's father posted birthday wishes to his daughter online and pleaded with people to stop talking about pit bulls . ‘Our detectives are in the process of trying to interview Megan and Kerry, who were the owners of this dog, but so far they've been unsuccessful in their attempts to talk to them,’ a Houma Police spokesperson told WWL. Touchet and boyfriend Kerry Dominique are keeping tight-lipped on the advice of their attorneys, the spokesperson added. They have remained silent in the week since Niko attacked the girl around 7pm last Tuesday.Niko is said by police to have been aggressively pacing around the apartment when they entered, and even attacked one of the officers. Counselors have been called in to help even cops hardened through decades of service to get over the traumatic crime scene. Not so gentle giant: Niko (bigger dog at left) is blamed in the mauling death of Mia DeRouen (right) 'We have some counseling that we are looking to set up for some of these officers,' a police official told WVUE. 'The scene, from what I understand, was pretty horrific.' Investigators are looking into the series of events that led to the giant animal to commit the grisly act. They are trying to determine if criminal negligence in how the killer canine was treated or stored could have led to the girl's death. Niko tested negative for rabies, but authorities are still awaiting the results of testing for steroids, according to Houma Today. Normal pit bulls tip the scales at about 50 pounds, and in rare cases hit 80 pounds, according to the ASPCA. Niko weighed 130. There were early reports that investigators were looking into whether the dog was bred for fighting, but police have since dismissed those claims. Vicious attack: Mia, pictured with her dad Chris, was pounced on by the dog, one of two at her mom's home in the Houma Highland Apartments . According to police, the attack happened inside the family home. 'She was screaming for help,' Duplantis said of the desperate mother's 911 call. Mia . suffered facial and head injuries in the pit bull attack and was rushed . to Terrebonne General Medical Center but didn't make it. Touchet suffered moderate injuries and was hospitalized as well. She remains in hospital today. Duplantis did not know whether the girl was on a sofa or chair or on the floor when she was attacked. Police reported that it was 'running loose inside the apartment acting in a very vicious manner' and officers shot it three times to 'eliminate the threat of additional injuries.' 'It's a traumatic event,' said Terrebonne Parish President Michel Claudet told WWL. Her father, Chris DeRouen, has posted several times of his grief over losing his daughter. 'I'm just empty. I feel guilty the few times I've been able to smile or laugh....like I'm betraying her memory,' he wrote Wednesday. 'I know in my heart there's more I could have done. I can't shake it. I just want to go to sleep and shut my eyes forever. 'I dream a dream you never died, and there was never a day we didn't pick flowers... You bring me cups of tea and cook my favorite meals....bring them to me on your little colored plates. You ask me when I'm done, and serve me some more. And then I wake up.' Every one of his posts is filled with dozens of offers of help, condolences and prayers - but he replies to none. The devastated dad instead wished his dead daughter a happy birthday in one post and pleaded with everyone stop talking about pit bulls in the next. Frantic call: Police officers were called to the complex around 7 p.m. by the girl's mother, Megan Touchet, who was also injured as the fought the crazed dog off her child . Prayers: Her father, Chris Derouen, picured, took to Facebook to beg for a miracle as his daughter fought for life in hospital. She later died . He previously took to Facebook to beg for a miracle as his daughter fought for life in hospital. 'Please I need prayers,' he wrote. 'My daughter was attacked by a pitbull and they don't know if she will make it....please God...I need this miracle.' After she passed away he covered his wall with pictures of the two of them, and friends and family expressed their sympathies. Claudet said the family had another pit bull. 'They had two pit bulls, and one was over 100 pounds,' he said, adding that this larger dog was the one that attacked Mia. 'Unfortunately, that's what happened and it's such a horrific event,' he said. The second pit bull was taken away by animal control officers, police said. Duplantis described the scene as 'horrific' and said counseling was being offered to the officers who were on the scene. It's not clear if charges will be filed in the case, which is still being investigated. A gofundme page to raise money for the child's funeral expenses has surpassed the original $25,000 goal set.","Mia Derouen was attacked by the dog, one of two at the home in Houma, Louisiana, last week and died in hospital from her injuries .

"A City boss at a firm accused of racial harassment discrimination told his staff that badminton is a sport for 'gays', and told colleagues who played it to 'get a dress', a tribunal reportedly heard. Neil Campbell, head of alternative investments at brokerage firm Tullett Prebon, is alleged to have described the racquet game as one for the 'gay and dainty' to his staff. His former employee Kishore Kansal, 33, who is suing the firm for £1.5million in damages, complained about the comments in a grievance procedure he filed against Mr Campbell, before walking out of his job as a broker, and being fired for gross misconduct in his absence. City worker: Private equity risk solutions manager Mr Kansal, who was on a £130,000-a-year-salary, has taken Tullett Prebon to an employment tribunal, citing racial harassment and discrimination . Private equity risk solutions manager Mr Kansal, who was on a £130,000-a-year-salary after joining the firm in May 2012, has taken Tullett Prebon to an employment tribunal, citing racial harassment, discrimination, unpaid bonuses, a public interest disclosure, and not being allowed to take, or be paid for, annual statutory leave. The claims are denied by Tullett Prebon, and six of Mr Kansal's ex-colleagues. According to The Independent tribunal heard that Mr Campbell had been interviewed over the comments, which he said he 'may have made', and it was recommended he be sent on a diversity training course. The hearing was also told that sexist and racist jokes were also circulated among staff in the office via email, and that Asian employees were often described as terrorists. Mr Kansal said he also heard his Asian colleagues being called 'terrorist,' 'brown boy' and 'dog' by Mr Campbell. Paul Dunkley, managing director of the firm's volatility group, had investigated Mr Kansal's complaint against Mr Campbell and, the court heard, was told during this probe that the alternative investments team was 'capable' of racist, homophobic and sexist comments, but that the matter was dropped. Paul Gilroy QC, representing Mr Kansal, said one staff member, Kipp Elkington had told Mr Dunkley during the investigation that the culture of the desk stemmed from Mr Campbell. Office: Mr Kansal worked as a private equity risk solutions manager at the company's offices at 155 Bishopsgate in the City of London . He asked if this had raised 'alarm bells', to which Mr Dunkley replied: 'It did… that all of the desk was acting inappropriately. Neil should have stopped it.' During the investigation, Mr Campbell had told Mr Dunkley that Mr Kansal did not mix socially with his colleagues and was not a 'team player'. Mr Kansal, whose parents came from the Punjab more than half a century ago, told the hearing he had 'experienced a major culture shock' from the very first day of his job, and claimed he saw his colleague Ghatan Vahidy being mocked by Mr Campbell who imitated a Pakistani accent, accusing him of being a terrorist and commented that the British were fighting 'ragheads' in Afghanistan. The tribunal heard Mr Campbell even twerked as he called another colleague, Maulik Patel, a 'brown boy' while a picture of terrorist Irfan Naseer was stuck on a wall behind his desk after some colleagues thought it 'bore a resemblance' to him. Mr Kansal accused Mr Campbell of saying 'almost all private equity investors were deluding themselves. He referred to them as retards, idiots and imbeciles.' Claims: Mr Kansal said he also heard his Asian colleagues being called 'terrorist,' 'brown boy' and 'dog' by his boss Mr Campbell . Despite trying to avoid attracting attention in the office, Mr Kansal claimed he was victimised when he refused to join in. He also said he was prevented from working from home and had his work internet restricted. However, when he put in the grievance against Mr Campbell, his boss and others on the alternative investment team turned against him during a Christmas works lunch and he was forced to take sick leave and then unfairly sacked. In his witness statement at the Central London Employment Tribunal Mr Kansal, 33, said he had worked private equity since graduating in law from UCL in 2002. Describing Campbell's racist mocking of Mr Vahidy he said: 'Neil Campbell stood up with a large grin on his face and said ""you can't say that. You can't say anything. '""You speak like this"" and then proceeded to do an impression of a Pakistani accent, saying ""bud-li, bud-li, bud-li."" 'He slightly angled his head each time he said ""bud-li"" in a way I recognised to be uniquely South Asian."" As the weeks passed he added: 'He made these comments with such frequency that I came to expect them. It was regular, almost like clockwork. 'He would have his favourite terms such as terrorist and brown boys that he would roll out on an almost daily basis and he would rarely miss an opportunity to make a new comment if the opportunity presented itself. 'I was also surprised by how the others in the office took this behaviour. There was no apparent protest. 'They would all seem to show loyalty often laughing along and even contributing to the jokes.' Of the 800 people working on his floor at 155 Bishopgate, Mr Kansal said 'almost 99.9 per cent were white, middle-aged males.' There were no black people, only a handful of Asians and 'hardly any women around, and I noticed that the women that were there seemed to be young and very attractive,"" he told the tribunal . He said he feared leaving the firm because of the potential damage to his reputation adding: ""Private equity is a highly specialised and niche sector. 'If I suddenly left people would assume that I had failed to generate any business and my reputation would be damaged substantially.' Despite being promised bonuses of 75 to 85 per cent of net revenues instead of being paid £262,387 between June and December 2013 he says he only got £28,643, while his white colleagues received £198,000 and £192,000. Mr Kansal left the company on February 4 of this year and tried to claim he was constructively dismissed. Probe: The Central London Employment Tribunal (pictured) was told that at the same time Mr Kansal's grievance was being investigated, he was himself the subject of a disciplinary procedure against him was launched the same day because the firm said he had emailed private company data to his own email address . However, a disciplinary procedure against him was launched the same day because the firm said he had emailed private company data to his own email address. Refusing his appeal it accused him of 'wrongdoing and damaging the team' and then dismissed him on March 27 this year. His whistleblowing claims were also dismissed as 'frivolous and vexatious.' A spokesman for the company said: 'Tullett Prebon denies all allegations and defends these claims vigorously.' During the hearing Jane Russell, representing the company, said Mr Kishal himself had helped create the hostile environment he claimed he was a victim of. Mr Kansal admitted emailing colleagues a clip of the North Korean dictator Kim Jon Il from the South Park film Team America after a conference call with a south east asian client in the US who had a 'very funny accent.' She said: 'How can you be the victim of the hostile environment that you created? To the extent you are seeking compensation for this environment - that means you are being rewarded, at least in part, for your own wrongdoing isn't it?' The hearing continues.","Kishore Kansal suing Tullett Prebon for racial harassment and discrimination .

"Martial arts fighter Shaun McNeil has been committed to stand trial for the one punch murder of teenager Daniel Christie in Sydney's Kings Cross. McNeil, allegedly knocked the 18 year old unconscious with a single blow to his head on New Year's Eve, 2013. A court has heard, moments before the fatal incident, the 26 year old accused murderer was shoulder charged by a teen trying to sell him drugs. More than a week later the 18-year-old's life support was turned off and McNeil was charged with his murder. Shaun McNeil, 26, who police allege threw a fatal punch at Daniel Christie in Sydney's Kings Cross last year . Daniel Christie, 18, who allegedly knocked his head after being punched by Mr McNeil . At a hearing in Sydney's Central local court on Tuesday, Seven News reported NSW Attorney-General Greg Smith had asked the acting director of public prosecutions to closely examine the case with a view to determining if murder charges were appropriate. The magistrate determined McNeil would stand trial for murder in the NSW Supreme court next year after hearing evidence from witnesses. One of the three teens allegedly assaulted by McNeil that night told the court they were walking around Kings Cross selling the illicit drugs ecstasy and MDMA. At around 9pm the teen, who can only be referred to as Witness 1, said one of his mates - Witness 2 - accidentally shoulder-charged a man at a pedestrian crossing. 'It started off with (my friend Witness 2) apologising or somethin' like that and then he tried to sell drugs to the man,' the teen told the court. Witness 2 said he had smoked marijuana and 'ice' that morning before heading to the late-night district to meet with his friends that evening. Witness 3 told the court McNeil demanded he hand over the drugs, allegedly declaring 'I'm an MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) fighter.' When Witness 3 refused, he said the 26-year-old 'started cutting sick' and throwing punches, before one allegedly struck the left side of his face. A court hearing found that another man assaulted by Mr McNeil shoulder barged him and offered him drugs shortly before he assaulted Mr Christie . Mr Christie's death was one of several attacks that sparked new laws introduced to help curb alcohol-fueled attacks . 'I shaped up. I got ready to fight him. I got my fists ready,' the teenager told Central Local Court. Next, he said, one of his friends - Witness One - intervened and punched McNeil. 'Some dude came out of nowhere saying, `Why (are) you picking on little kids?'. Then he (McNeil) put him on the ground. He went down.' After assaulting the trio, it's alleged McNeil approached Mr Christie and his brother, Peter. Using a single closed fist, McNeil knocked Mr Christie unconscious, causing him to fall back and hit his head on the road. He then allegedly punched Mr Christie's brother Peter, splitting his lip. Prosecutor Jennifer Price also told the court that McNeil was walking in Kings Cross with his girlfriend when the teens approached him. Mr Christie's death was one of a series of attacks that sparked new laws   to help curb alcohol-fueled attacks. Mandatory minimum sentencing laws were introduced earlier this year to be imposed against people who commit such crimes.","MMA fighter Shaun McNeil, 26, has been committed to stand trial for the one punch murder of Daniel Christie, 18 .

"An out-of-control student got into a violent confrontation with his teacher after his phone was confiscated during class. The ninth grade student was in the middle of a lesson being taught by his physics teacher at John F. Kennedy High School in Paterson, New Jersey, when he flew into a rage. A video, taken by one of the other students, shows the classroom descend into chaos as the 16-year-old boy wrestles his 62-year-old teacher  to the floor. Altercation: The student is seen wrestling with the teacher who tried to carry on with his lesson as the boy grabs him around his waist .

He has also been charged with assault. David Cozart, the school's principal of operations, said that the boy became irate after his physics teacher took the cellphone from him. In the 23-second clip posted to YouTube, the student can be seen wrestling with the teacher who tried to carry on with his lesson as the boy grabs him around his waist and slams him into a desk. Other students can be heard shouting for the student to 'stop' and 'chill' but none tried to physically stop him during the assault. Some were seen moving away from the scene saying 'I'm out, I'm out' and others hollered for the security saying 'Someone help him'!

"A maze of white temples, memorial arches, paved roads, and houses... hidden 130 feet underwater: this is China's real-life Atlantis. The so-called Lion City, tucked in a lake between the Five Lion Mountain, was once Shi Cheng - the centre of politics and economics in the eastern province of Zhejiang. But in 1959, the Chinese government decided a new hydroelectric power station was required - so built a man-made lake. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Metropolis: Shi Cheng, dubbed Lion City after the Lion Mountains that surround it, has lain hidden under 131 feet of water since 1959 to generate hydroelectric power . Classical: The structures in Shi Cheng were built 1,300 years ago featuring traditional Chinese statues. Away from the wind and sun, it has remained intact . Erecting a dam, the historical metropolis was slowly filled with water until it was completely submerged by the turquoise-blue mass now referred to as Qiandao Lake. Depending on where on the lake bottom it is, the city is between 85 and 131 feet underwater. And it lay forgotten for 53 years. Greek philosopher Plato wrote about . Atlantis some 2,600 years ago, describing it as 'an island situated in . front of the straits called the Pillars of Hercules.' Hidden: The city was once a political and economic hub for eastern China but after authorities built the man-made Qiandao Lake in 1959, it is nowhere to be seen . Divers have rediscovered the opulent city and plan to bring tourists round . Even wooden structures remain surprisingly strong, according to the team that have gone to inspect . There are rows of houses made out of brick, with wooden stairs that are still almost pristine . He said the island he called Atlantis 'in a single day and night... disappeared into the depths of the sea.'

"German pensioners are being sent to care homes in Eastern Europe and Asia in what has been described as an ‘inhumane deportation’. Rising numbers of the elderly and sick are moved overseas for long-term care because of sky-high costs at home. Some private healthcare providers are even building homes overseas, while state insurers are also investigating whether they can care for their clients abroad. Experts describe a time bomb’ of increasing numbers unable to afford the growing costs of retirement homes. Inhumane: Rising numbers of Germany's elderly and sick are being sent to care homes in Eastern Europe and Asia because of rising care home costs . And they say the situation should be a warning to Britain, where rising numbers of pensioners are forced to sell their homes to pay for care. The Sozialverband Deutschland (VdK), a socio-political advisory group, said the fact that many Germans were unable to afford the costs of a retirement home in their own country was a huge ‘alarm signal’. ‘We simply cannot let those people, who built Germany up to be what it is, be deported,’ VdK’s president Ulrike Mascher told The Guardian. ‘It is inhumane.’ Researchers found an estimated 7,146 German pensioners living in retirement homes in Hungary in 2011. More than 3,000 were in the Czech Republic and more than 600 in Slovakia. There were also unknown numbers in Spain, Greece and the Ukraine, as well as Thailand and the Philippines. Some told researchers they were there out of choice as costs were lower, while standards of care were often higher. But many others admitted they moved reluctantly. Criticism: Experts have described the 'time bomb' of increasing numbers unable to afford the growing costs of retirement homes, while others have spoken of 'inhumane deportation' (stock image) According to Germany’s federal bureau of statistics, more than 400,000 senior citizens cannot afford a German retirement home, a figure growing by around 5 per cent a year. This is because many are living for longer while their pensions are stagnating. As a result, the Krankenkassen – or statutory insurers that make up Germany’s state insurance system – are discussing cheaper care in foreign retirement homes. EU law prevents state insurers from signing contracts with overseas homes. But that is likely to change as legislators are forced to respond to Europe’s ageing population. Artur Frank, the owner of Senior Palace – which finds care homes for Germans in Slovakia – said it was wrong to suggest senior citizens were being ‘deported’. ‘Many are here of their own free will, the results of sensible decisions by their families who know they will be better off,’ he said.","Country's elderly and sick being sent abroad due to rising care costs .

"A former Playboy playmate has been found dead of an apparent overdose at the age of 34. Cassandra Lynn Hensley was found in a friend's bathtub on Wednesday and police are looking into the death. Known best as 'Miss February 2006', Ms Hensley has continued her modeling career and was most recently named 'Angel of the Month' by Philadelphia's Metropolis Nights magazine. In her heyday: Cassandra Lynn Hensley, who was found dead on Wednesday, was Miss February 2006 and she is pictured at a Playboy mansion party the following year . Two sides: Just 10 days before her death, Cassandra Lynn posted this photo of her holding up her latest spread . TMZ reported the death on Thursday and said that while there was no sign of foul play the death is still under investigation. According to her Facebook account, Ms Hensley was living in northern Virginia at the days leading up to her death but was visiting a friend in Los Angeles this week. The unidentified friend found the playmate unresponsive in a bathtub. The friend called police and though the call has not been released, TMZ reports the friend indicated that it may have been due to an overdose. No specific drugs have been identified. First responders were not able to revive the model when they arrived at the scene. She . was raised in Ferron, Utah and attended high school where she . reportedly moved around a lot and got into some trouble, prompting her . to be kicked out of several schools. Overdose: She was found by her friend that she was staying with in Los Angeles and the friend told police that it may have been an overdose . Melding of months: Cassandra (left) is seen at a Playmate party in 2006 alongside fellow models Kara Monaco (center) and Christine Smith (right) 'She was just a nice, outgoing girl who was a little wild,' Aaron Arrington told MailOnline. Mr . Arrington went to the same junior high as Ms Hensley and though they . have been out of touch for some time, he told MailOnline that she had a . somewhat difficult time growing up. 'She was a nice girl but I think she didn't have a really stable childhood,' he said. 'She was a little rowdy.' Eventually she moved into the famed Playboy mansion and was living there around the time that she was made a centerfold. In her . most recent interview, she made it very clear that she is active in the . glamor modeling industry and did not let 2006 career highlight put an . end to her aspirations. Making a name for herself: In recent months, Cassandra Lynn was working as a hostess at events . 'Yes, there is life after Playboy, I have been a part of many great experiences: travel shows, magazine covers, and of course giving advice to young impressionable girls who think they need to act a certain way for a chance to be a model (classy not slutty),' she said to Metropolitian Nights. Cassandra, whose nickname was 'Butterfly' for the five butterfly tattoos she had on her body, had been working in recent months as an event hostess. She recently bought a motorcycle and . had been learning how to ride it in the months leading up to her death, . making her decision to co-headline an autoshow afterparty with a fellow . former playmate in May of last year even more fitting. She did the same for a golf event outside of Washington, D.C. in September. Into her ride: Cassandra Lynn recently bought this motorcycle and updated her Facebook followers about how she was learning how to ride the bike . Home life: She recently dyed her hair dark brown and regularly updated with selfies and pictures with her dog . The five-foot five-inch model still has a biography on Playboy's archives, wherein she described herself as a hopeless romantic making February the best month for her centerfold debut. 'I love Valentine’s Day. And candy. Especially conversation hearts,' she told the site. She was active on social media and had more than 7,800 followers on Twitter. She arranged for her feed to update daily with her horoscope so the latest message posted to her account- which was set live a day after she was found dead.

"Actress Michelle Collins has overcome her personal problems by using natural therapies . Actress . Michelle Collins shot to fame in the BBC soap EastEnders as Cindy Beale . – a woman who plotted to kill her cuckolded husband – and as barmaid . Stella Price in ITV’s Coronation Street. Her private life has famously been almost as turbulent as those of her on-screen personas. Now, . in a deeply personal and controversial confession, the 52-year-old . argues that it is natural therapies – and not medication – that have . helped  her overcome mental illness. It would be wonderful if there really was a pill for every ill – a magic wand you could wave to make it all just go away. But there isn’t.  And yet more than ever it feels like that’s what many of us  are looking for. Whether it’s drugs to control cholesterol or mood, or antibiotics swallowed at the first sign of the sniffles, more of us each year are taking medication – when in truth it’s our lifestyles that need looking at. Mental health is a case in point: Last year, 50 million prescriptions for antidepressants were handed out. Of course, many of these will have been vitally necessary. But the fact that the figure rises every year makes me think many people are being given happy pills when other methods of tackling their problems might be just as effective. Before you throw this newspaper across the room, accusing me of being utterly judgmental, let me say that I speak from personal experience. I have dealt with tougher times. And as someone who has been on antidepressants, I have strong feelings on the subject. I know it will seem controversial to some, but I am a big advocate of using alternative therapies to overcome the stressful and upsetting elements of our lives. That can mean exercise, or chatting it through with a supportive friend or therapist, or actually looking at complementary and alternative medicine. Personally, I am a wholehearted believer in the power of homeopathy. I know many people don’t agree but I am pleased it’s available on the NHS and think that availability should even be extended – more information should be given to patients about alternatives to mainstream medicine. It’s important to listen to your mind and body – and the fact  that strong medicines aren’t right for me is something I’ve learned from experience. My life has been a bit difficult at times, and I’ve always been quite open about it. Even though I don’t want to dwell on the past, I feel it’s important to share problems that are often difficult to discuss. My hope is that doing so might make it easier for others. Scroll down for video . Remedies: Michelle (right) gave her daughter Maia natural medicine as a young child . The crunch point for me was when I landed a job in the West End show Daddy Cool several years ago. I  suffered an anxiety attack and was prescribed medication. Some of my patients have used homeopathy for mental health problems with some success. Like Michelle, they advocate the practice. But, speaking as a doctor, I cannot recommend it: more than 150 clinical trials have been unable to prove that homeopathy works. Homeopathy’s dilution theory – that water ‘remembers’ the active ingredients it comes into contact with – is implausible. If it were true, water would also remember other substances – bacteria, animal waste or the test-tube the remedy was made in. So how do I explain the positive effects some people experience? Michelle had crucial time and input from a therapist who listened to her worries. It helped her develop a positive mental attitude about coping with her anxiety. I believe it is this that has led to the improvement in her condition. The placebo effect is real and powerful. So even though the pills are inert, treatment will ease the symptoms of stress. That is why taking a remedy before a show helps to control the panic. But the pill itself could just as well be a sugar lump. Given the traumatic times Michelle has had, it is so important that she has found something that works for her. But as a general solution for others it would not work. I was already at a low ebb and found theatre was out of my comfort zone. I’d never appeared in a musical before and, as my friends can tell you, I can be very hard on myself at times. The thing is that, despite people often telling me that I come across as confident and extroverted, I am painfully shy. As an actor, you can hide behind the character you’re playing, which is what I managed to do in EastEnders and Coronation Street. But the reality is that I can make myself ill with stress when I land a new role because I tend to rehearse to the point of obsession. The night before the Daddy Cool rehearsals started, I was extremely anxious and slept terribly. On the day itself, while getting ready to go to the theatre, I had an overwhelming desire to just run away. There was a powerful voice in my head saying: ‘You can’t do it.’ I didn’t get palpitations or pins and needles or other things people  feel with panic attacks, but I  did start to shake. My hands were trembling and it felt like my legs were going to give way. It passed after about 20 minutes, but I  was absolutely terrified – I didn’t go to the rehearsal, and went to the doctor instead. He suggested a course of antidepressants. Was I depressed? I don’t know. But I wasn’t offered an alternative, so I thought I should say yes. I needed a quick fix and started taking the pills immediately. I managed to continue with the show but they just didn’t agree with me at all. I felt sick, dizzy and confused, like I was having some kind of bizarre out-of-body experience. So I stopped taking them after only a couple of weeks. It was then . that I decided to take matters into my own hands. I sought out . alternative remedies like acupuncture and reiki massage, a type of . energy healing. To . reduce my stress levels I took up yoga, meditation and Pilates.  And a . friend suggested that I take gelsemium, a homeopathic anxiety remedy – . made from a flower – that you can pick up from most chemists. Anxiety: Michelle as Eastenders' Cindy Beale in 1998. She conquered shyness by hiding behind the character . I wasn’t totally new to these things, having given my daughter Maia some natural therapies when she suffered a lot of sore throats as a child. But the gelsemium really worked and I decided to book a  session with a homeopathic doctor near my home in North London. It was a revelation. A consultation will typically last an hour or longer. After discussing your primary reason for being there, you’ll explore other areas of your life, your attitudes and even the sensations you feel at certain times – such as whether you have hot or cold feet in bed at night. It sounds bizarre, but by doing all this investigative work, a homeopath is able to build up a treatment plan targeted specifically at you. It’s not a one-size-fits-all approach. I don’t want to say too much about what I was advised or took as it could be completely different for another person, but I can say that, from the word go, I felt cared for in a way I never had before. Along with the remedies, I was advised on diet – you can’t eat salt or use a mint toothpaste, for instance, as strong flavours can affect the homeopathic pills. It’s just another example of the attentiveness involved. I found that it was a turning point for me. I am now appearing in a play called The Glass Supper at the Hampstead Theatre and I make sure to take my remedies each night. Of course I still get tetchy and stressed before I go on stage – and I am probably not nice to be around – but it’s nothing compared to how I was before. Since going down the homeopathic route, I am much healthier than I used to be. I take more care of my health, both mind and body, and make sure I’m eating well. I sleep well, I have lots of energy, and the dizziness and stomach pains I once thought were part of everyday life have cleared. Everyone has a busy lifestyle and is stressed and we are all looking  for someone or something to alleviate things. But it’s important to learn to step back and have some time to yourself: we don’t do that enough. lFor more information see findahomeopath.org.uk.

"A retired chemist allegedly told police he planned to blow up Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards. Joseph C. Callahan, 69, from Connecticut, is accused of stockpiling an incredible arsenal of guns, ammunition and home-made bombs in his $1million mansion. He was arrested on Monday after police were called to his home after his ex-wife became worried at his lack of contact. Retired chemist, Joseph C. Callahan,  told police he planned to blow up Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards . According to a police report, he said he was making a bomb intended for Richards, 69, reported the Fairfield Citizen. But, he claimed he never meant to hurt Richards. He insists it was just a gift. According to the warrant, the bomb was allegedly in the garage next to the spray tank, but Callahan couldn't remember if he had attached a fuse to it yet. Callahan lives in Greenfield Hill, . Connecticut, almost 10 miles from Richards’ home in Weston. When questioned Callahan allegedly said of the ammonium nitrate: 'That’s the chemical used in the 1993 World Trade Centre bombing.' Police say Callahan had more than 250 guns, tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition and explosive devices at his house in Fairfield. Scene: The five-bedroom residence in Fairfield, Connecticut, is valued at over $1 million . Callahan, who has a chemistry background, was charged with 11 counts of illegal possession of explosives, six counts of first-degree reckless endangerment and one count of manufacturing bombs. On his LinkedIn page, Callahan says he is president of chemical company Remair. He also worked at gun manufacturer Remington Arms for nearly two decades. The Hartford Courant reported that local police and federal agents raided the five-bedroom property last week and officers found 274 firearms, tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition and a large amount of hazardous materials on October 1. Authorities immediately closed down Bronson Road, where the home is located. It then took two days for experts to deal with the dangerous materials and make the area safe. No one was injured in the operation, which included agents from the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, alongside state and local police. Fairfield police chief Gary Macnamara described 'tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition strewn through the residence', as reported by Fox Connecticut. There were also scores of containers of highly explosive material stored at the large property at 1625 Bronson Road. Christopher Tracy, Fairfield's acting fire chief, said in a press release last Wednesday that 'a large amount of various chemicals' were found at the home. Danger: Authorities found larger amounts of explosive materials stashed at the property . Dennis . Schain of the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection . added that some of the chemicals may have been used by Callahan in his . rocketry hobby. Callahan is reportedly cooperating with authorities and was released from custody to remove the remaining dangerous chemicals. His attorney to told TMZ that while Callahan was mentally unstable at the time of his arrest, but he stabilized and was released on his own recognizance. The Courant reported that haz-mat professionals and fire department officers will remain on the scene until Callahan fully complies with the court order to dispose of the material. He is due in court in Bridgeport, Connecticut, on October 16. Last night, Callahan’s lawyer Richard Meehan said he had not seen the arrest report but added: 'He is a delightful gentleman who never had any intention to make a bomb and never intended to hurt anybody.'","Joseph Callahan was arrested following discovery at Connecticut mansion .

"Only 8.1 per cent of Britons admitted to being unable to afford food in 2012, down from 9.8 per cent in 2007 . The number of families  saying they are going hungry has fallen over the past five years – as the number of food banks has risen. Britons were among the least likely in the developed world to say there were times when they could not afford food, an international report found. Only 8.1 per cent reported this in 2012, down from 9.8 per cent in 2007 – before the economic crisis and when Labour was in power. The study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which represents industrialised nations, flies in the face of Left-wing claims that cuts in public spending are leaving thousands of families going hungry. The number of food banks has increased over the past few years, with charities claiming that more than half a million people across the country have visited them. It emerged this month that more than a third of councils are subsidising food banks at a cost of £3million to the taxpayer. While most town halls paid for support such as management and administration, some were even paying for the food. The Government has repeatedly questioned whether food banks are responding to growing need. Last week Welfare Minister Lord Freud said it is very hard to know why people go to food banks. While he conceded nobody turned to charities for food parcels ‘willingly’, he suggested more people were visiting the banks simply because there were more in existence. Last night a Whitehall source said: ‘Shameful opportunism has led some people to leap on this issue as a way to bash the Government. ‘It’s a relief to get some clear-sighted figures. It’s time to reframe this debate with a little more honesty.’ The Government has repeatedly questioned whether food banks are responding to growing need . Figures on the proportion of people going hungry are published in  the Social Indicators 2014 report by the OECD, after surveys were carried out by pollsters Gallup in all 34 member countries. The UK total of 8.1 per cent is far less than the EU average of 11.5 per cent, an increase from 9.5 per cent before the economic crisis, and the OECD average of 13.2 per cent, which rose from 11.2 per cent. In fact, the UK came 24th out of 34 – far behind our near neighbour France on 10 per cent. Countries hit by the eurozone crisis fared badly, with Ireland on 9 per cent, Spain on 12 per cent, Italy on 13 per cent and Greece on 17 per cent. The highest need in Europe was in Hungary, where 31 per cent went hungry. Canada, New Zealand and the United States – which came sixth on 22 per cent – all ranked far worse than Britain. Only ten countries are lower in the table than the UK, including Germany, Japan and the Nordic and Benelux countries. Bottom of the table was Switzerland on 4 per cent. Most countries have seen their level of need rise since the financial crisis – but not Britain. We are one of only 11 countries to see the proportion fall since the last survey in 2007, along with Switzerland, Japan, Germany, Sweden and Poland. The report said: ‘Responses confirm that rising numbers of families may have less money to spend on food and a healthy diet.’","Only 8.1% reported they couldn't afford food in 2012, it was 9.8% in 2007 .

"Scotland Yard said today viewing the film showing James Foley's murder by an Islamic State (IS) extremist may be illegal - but experts believe any prosecutions for watching it would be 'absurd'. The Met also urged people not to spread the gruesome video over social networks like Twitter and Facebook, warning they could be arrested. The film shows Mr Foley, 40,  kneeling in a desert-like environment at an unknown location as an IS fighter stands by his side dressed in black and with his face covered. The killer, who is believed to be British, accused America of 'aggression towards the Islamic state' for its attacks on IS, before murdering Mr Foley. Scroll down for video . Warning: Scotland Yard has said that viewing, downloading or spreading the IS video of James Foley's murder could be an offence, experts have said that this would be very difficult to prove . Scotland Yard, which leads counter-terror policing in the UK, confirmed that it is investigating the video and reminded social media users that spreading extremist material is a crime. The force said: 'The Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command is investigating the contents of the video that was posted online in relation to the alleged murder of James Foley. 'We would like to remind the public that viewing, downloading or disseminating extremist material within the UK may constitute an offence under terrorism legislation.' Government sources today confirmed that David Cameron has seen a full version of the video following his return to Downing Street. The film has spread across the internet and has potentially already been seen in some form by millions but the police and CPS would find it difficult to prove an offence had taken place, an expert told MailOnline. Human rights barrister Adam Wagner said: 'For disseminating a terrorist video to be an offence you would have to very clearly encourage the activity shown, for example to say that you think what the terrorists have done is excellent and encourage others to do the same. 'But even then there is a defence if you can prove that the message did not represent your views, or was in fact sarcastic. ‘In theory if you had downloaded the video to your computer you could be in trouble, because possessing terrorist material is an offence regardless of your intent, similar to possessing child pornography. But streaming the film is unlikely to be an offence. You would have to be streaming it for the purposes of encouraging or committing terrorism. ‘But merely viewing it - it is difficult to see how that could engage even the very wide terrorism laws. There would also be no public interest in prosecuting a someone for viewing if they didn't intend to promote IS. It would be absurd. So for the Met to say that viewing a video in and of itself could constitute an offence seems to me to be far from reality’. Appalling: The killing of James Foley has shocked the world but police and Twitter have taken steps to stop it spreading . The footage appears to then show another captured journalist, Steven Sotloff, who went missing near the border of Syria and Turkey last year. His life depends on the US president's 'next decision', the IS fighter warns. The film has not been verified but the journalist's family have accepted that it shows his death and Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the footage appears to be genuine. Mr Foley's mother Diane released a statement saying: 'We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people. 'We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages.' Mr Cameron returned to No 10 just two days into his family holiday in Cornwall to lead the response, posting on Twitter: 'If true, the murder of James Foley is shocking and depraved. I will today chair meetings on the situation in Iraq/Syria.'","Scotland Yard warns against viewing, downloading and disseminating of film showing James Foley's murder .

"Doctors and nurses were given a green light yesterday to take a hand in killing desperately sick or disabled patients. Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said that rules which say doctors, medical workers and carers should be prosecuted for helping patients to commit suicide are wrong. In future, she said lawyers at the Crown Prosecution Service should only bring charges when the doctor or carer ‘may have exerted some influence on the victim’. Her order to CPS lawyers brought furious condemnation from anti-euthanasia campaigners who accused Mrs Saunders of legalising assisted suicide and opening the way for suicide hospitals in Britain on the model of the Dignitas clinic in Zurich. Alison Saunders' order to CPS lawyers has sparked outrage among anti-euthanasia campaigners . The Care Not Killing group said: ‘She is effectively at a stroke of her pen decriminalising assisted suicide by doctors and other health care professionals as long as they don’t have an existing relationship with the patient.’ The DPP was also accused of changing the law to allow doctors to help suicides without reference to Parliament or even the courts. The switch in prosecution policy, announced in a CPS statement yesterday afternoon, comes at a time when peers and MPs are set to debate a bill aimed precisely at democratic reform of the law so that doctors can kill terminally ill patients. Lord Falconer’s Assisted Dying Bill, due to go to its committee stage in the Lords next month, would allow doctors to provide lethal drugs to someone who has been diagnosed as terminally ill and who is expected to die within six months. Two doctors would have to sign that the death was above board. However the DPP’s ruling yesterday appears to free doctors from the threat of prosecution even if the patient they kill is not already dying from a terminal illness. The law on assisted suicide, laid down by Parliament in 1961, sets a maximum jail sentence of 14 years for anyone who aids and abets a suicide. This was effectively amended in 2010 by Mrs Saunders’ predecessor as DPP, Keir Starmer, who was asked to write prosecution guidelines in a Law Lords test case decision. Alison Saunders, Director of Public Prosecutions, has said prosecutions should only be brought when the carer has exerted influence over the patient's decision to commit suicide . The result of Mr Starmer’s guidelines is that no-one has been prosecuted for helping a Briton travel to die at the Dignitas clinic, even though many of the 150 Zurich British suicides have had help from relatives or friends. The Starmer rules mean in practice that no-one will be prosecuted unless they help to kill someone out of greed or malice. The 2010 guidelines said that prosecutions should be brought against medical professionals and carers where ‘the victim was in his or her care.’ Mrs Saunders’ new rule follows rulings by the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal in the case of Tony Nicklinson, a paralysed stroke victim who died in 2012, but who had asked the courts to allow someone to kill him by injecting him with a lethal drug. The Supreme Court judges hinted in June that they favoured assisted suicide but drew back from telling Parliament that the 1961 law breaks European human rights rules. The DPP said her new guideline was made ‘in the light of the recent comments of the Supreme Court.’ She said prosecutors should in future concentrate on the words ‘the victim was in his or her care’. She also added her own footnote to the Starmer rules, which said that no medical professional should be prosecuted ‘merely because someone was acting in a professional capacity.’ They should consider prosecuting only when there was ‘a relationship of care between the suspect and the victim such that it will be necessary to consider whether the suspect may have exerted some influence on the victim.’ Mrs Saunders said that assisted suicide is ‘an emotive subject on which many hold strong views and these cases present difficult and complex decisions for prosecutors.’ She added that ‘nothing in these guidelines offers immunity against prosecution.’ But the Care Not Killing campaign said: ‘This is very concerning. ‘It weakens the protections for sick and vulnerable people and signals to anyone in Europe wanting physician assisted suicide that Britain is open for business, opening the door to a Dignitas style death clinic being set up in the UK. It is an invitation to doctors who wish to push the boundaries and assist people who are not their patients to kill themselves to have free rein and go ahead.’ Campaign Director Dr Peter Saunders added: ‘Such a facility could now be staffed by so-called health care professionals, who could assist in terminating the lives of disabled, terminally ill and vulnerable people with impunity. ‘The DPP’s job is to administer the law not usurp the democratic authority of Parliament, which is due to discuss this issue in just a couple of weeks time. She is acting way beyond her brief and effectively decriminalising physician assisted suicide by stealth.’ The logo of Dignitas, a suicide assist clinic in Switzerland. Anti-euthanasia campaigners fear the new prosecution policy could lead the way to similar institutions opening in Britain . ‘I hope she will be forced to go in front of Parliament and answer why she has rewritten the current law, ignored the will of MPs and peers and put at risk the lives of many vulnerable people in our country.’ The assisted dying pressure group Dignity in Dying, which backs Lord Falconer’s bill, said the DPP’s guideline was a ‘small change’ which would not make the law workable. Dignity in Dying chief Sarah Wootton said: ‘The change to the prosecuting policy makes clear that a healthcare professional who assists a patient to end their life in the context of an ongoing caring relationship is more likely to be prosecuted than a healthcare professional who assists outside of that context. ‘This seems to send a strange message to patients – effectively that they should not seek help from healthcare professionals who know them and their medical history, and who they as patients trust, but instead seek advice and assistance from healthcare professionals they do not know.’","Prosecution rules relaxed for doctors who help patients commit suicide .

"Once thriving, a number of early 20th century theatres are now shadows of their former glory. The ornate carvings and stunning architecture are still visible in many, but this is overshadowed by the state of disrepair that surrounds them. US photographer Matt Lambros has made it his mission to document the sad decline of these entertainment venues. The Paramount Theatre, located in Newark, New Jersey, like many others that thrived in the early 20th century, is now in a state of disrepair . Photographer Matt Lambros has made it his mission to document the sad decline of once-magnificent auditoriums, such as the Embassy Theatre in Port Chester, New York . Mr Lambros has visited 57 theatres across the United States and is not planning on stopping there. Here are pictures of the Eastown Theatre (left) in Detroit, Michigan, and the Loew's Kings Theatre in Brooklyn, New York (right) This theatre, Loew's Palace, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, closed in 1975, just over 50 years after it opened in 1922 . Many of the theatres are abandoned and crumbling, with peeling paintwork, collapsed ceilings and rolled-up, moth-bitten carpets. Mr Lambros, 30, has visited and photographed 57 deserted theatres since he began his 'After the Final Curtain' project. He now travels across the country looking for them, visiting one local theatre a month and planning longer trips twice a year. Those at risk of being demolished are top of his priority list. Mr Lambros, 30, aims to visit one local theatre a month and travels further afield in the US twice a year. Pictured is the Shore Theatre in Coney Island .

Among those documented are the Metropolitan Opera House in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Paramount Theatre in Newark, New Jersey, and the Lyric Theatre in Birmingham, Alabama. He also photographed the Embassy Theatre in Port Chester, New York, the Eastown Theatre in Detroit, Michigan, and Liberty Theatre in Dorchester, Massachusetts. He said: 'I started photographing theatres after going to see a movie in the Village East Cinemas in Manhattan. 'As I was watching the movie, I found myself looking at the architecture of the theatre. 'Having grown up going to the movies in modern multiplexes, I couldn't believe they were showing movies in a place like this.' Mr Lambros used to photograph abandoned buildings in general before developing a specialist interest in theatres. 'I started doing some research and started shooting them,' he said. 'I've gone to plays in working theatres before, but I never really appreciated the architecture until I started photographing the abandoned ones. He added: 'Current condition, the original architect, accessibility and theatre size all come in to play when planning a shoot.' Mr Lambros started photographing theatres after going to see a film and found himself looking at the architecture rather than the screen. Since, he has travelled far and wide, including to the State Palace Theatre in New Orleans, Louisiana .

Mr Lambros said he used to go to the theatre to watch plays but never truly appreciated the sort of stunning architecture seen here at the Proctor's Troy Theatre, New York . Mr Lambros is saddened by the level of disrepair at theatres such as the Paramount Theatre located in Newark, New Jersey . The National Theatre in Detroit, Michigan, which was opened in 1911 and closed in 1975, has certainly seen better days . Loew's Kings theatre in Brooklyn, New York, was the first Mr Lambros photographed and remains his favourite. He described it as an 'amazing building'. Mr Lambros, from Brooklyn, blames the decline of tradtional theatres in the rising popularity of huge multiplex cinemas. He said: 'The rise of the multiplex combined with the downturn of some of the areas where these theatres are located contributed to their closing and state of disrepair. 'A lot of these theatres are out of sight, out of mind and I think my favorite thing about my photographs is that they help to remind people that these buildings still exist. 'When they view my photographs people are usually a bit upset that the theatres have been left to rot.' Mr Lambros journeyed to Dorchester, Massachusetts, to capture images of this, the Liberty Theatre . The photographer blames the decline of tradtional theatres, seen here at the Metropolitan Opera House, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on the rising popularity of huge multiplex cinemas .

"A 32-year-old Canadian woman died as she drank tea at a Peru shaman ceremony. Jennifer Logan of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan was backpacking through the country when she had a fatal medical reaction as she drank tea designed to make people vomit, purge and cleanse the body at a rainforest retreat on January 17. She had to be taken by motorcycle and then boat to the nearest hospital, but she could not be revived by doctors, who say the woman died of a pulmonary edema. Jennifer Logan (above) died after drinking a tea designed to make people vomit and purge in a Peru shaman cermeony . Amy Logan, the victim's youngest sister who recently traveled to Peru with her mother to retrieve her sister's remains, told CBC; 'We suspect the tea had a role.' Ms. Logan was at a two week long all-female retreat at the Canto Luz Centre outside Puerto Maldonado (participant left) when she drank the tea (right) Officers have examined the cup Ms. Logan drank out of and the jug while also conducting interviews with staff  as they investigate the death. Ms. Logan's sister explained that the participants at the two week long all-female retreat at the Canto Luz Centre outside Puerto Maldonado were each given tea to drink, prepared by the staff, and that her sister was attempting to find 'clarity on her future path.' Ms. Logan, just 32-years-old when she died, had already accomplished much in her life, from tutoring sex-trafficked women and girls in Nepal and working on educational programs in India to, most recently, teaching women in Saudi Arabia to read. In this photo a shaman in the Coafan region boils leaves for their psychoactive proporties as used in ayahuasca, Ecuador, 2009 . 'The other three women in the group stopped vomiting within 15 minutes,' said Ms. Logan's sister. 'Jennifer didn't stop and began to panic.' Soon after she passed out, and when the staff was unsuccessful administering first aid, they took her to the nearest hospital. Staff from the retreat claim Ms. Logan was drinking a tobacco purge tea at the time of her death, not the hallucinogenic ayahuasca that has become popular of recent and resulted in several deaths, and describe her death as 'extreme and unusual.' They also said in a statement that they were 'devastated by this reminder of the power of nature, both for life and death, and the absoluteness of life deep in the Amazon rainforest.' They have temproarily closed as Ms. Logan's death is investigated.","Jennifer Logan was backpacking through Peru when she participated in a two week retreat at the Canto Luz Centre outside Puerto Maldonado .

"It's considered to be the world's most sophisticated superfighter jet, but Britain's new £150million combat aircraft has been banned from flying in bad weather for fears it could explode. Engineers working on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter have found the jet's fuel tank could explode if hit by lightning. According to reports, the aircraft, which is hoped to enter service for both the RAF and the Royal Navy in five years' time, has also been made more vulnerable to enemy attack than the aircraft it is set to replace, after its weight was reduced in an attempt to increase fuel efficiency. The F-35 Lightning II, also known as the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), has been banned from flying in bad weather, for fear its fuel tank could explode if hit by lightning . The Telegraph has reported the revelations were disclosed in a leaked report from the Pentagon's operational test and evaluation office, which states that, until a device in the fuel tank is redesigned, test-flying within 25 miles of thunderstorms is 'not permitted'. Several other problems have been identified with the plane, including a fault in the design of the fuel tank which means it is unable to rapidly descend to low altitude. A handful of cracks were also discovered in the tested aircraft during examinations by the United States Air Force and the aircraft's manufacturer Lockheed Martin. The report states: 'All of these discoveries will require mitigation plans and may include redesigning parts and additional weight.' A Lockheed Martin spokesman has said the manufacturer does not consider the latest problem a 'major issue'. The spokesman said: 'We have . demonstrated very good vulnerability performance and we continue to work . with the Joint Programme Office.' The new fighter jet has been designed to be practically invisible to radar and has a top speed of 1,300mph . The short take-off and vertical-landing version of the F-35B is due to become Britain's replacement for the Harrier. The new fighter jet has been designed to be practically invisible to radar and has a top speed of 1,300mph and a range of 1,450 miles, compared to the Harrier's 700mph and range of 350 mile range. The latest revelation is the second blow to the programme in recent weeks, after Canada pulled out of a deal to buy 65 of the aircraft last month. And while the US is buying 2,500 F-35s for £254bn, Britain is committed to buying only 48, although the final decision will depend on the role of the Royal Navy's two new carriers in the future and whether the price of the aircraft falls, as is expected. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'All variants of F-35 are currently within the Development Test phase and minor issues like this are common during this early stage of the overall programme.' It has been reported that until a device in the fuel tank is redesigned, test-flying within 25 miles of thunderstorms is 'not permitted'","F-35 Joint Strike Fighter not allowed to fly within 25 miles of thunderstorms .

"Training budgets for nursery staff have been slashed by 40 per cent, MailOnline can reveal as minister scramble to secure a deal on cutting crippling childcare bills. David Cameron and Nick Clegg last night failed to agree a deal on giving more help with the cost of looking after their children, including offering tax breaks to working parents and tearing up red-tape for nurseries and childminders. But new figures reveal councils across England have dramatically cut funding budgets to train new childcare staff, undermining hopes of a massive expansion in the sector to reduce costs. Council training budgets for childminders and nursery staff have been cut by 40 per cent in a year, new figures show . Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg, who obtained the figures, said parents are ‘rightly frightened’ at the prospect of the quality of care being hit. In an article for MailOnline, Mr Twigg also warned that plans to copy the French system where staff can look after eight children at once – up from four in the UK – will fail to reduce costs. But the government accused him of 'total opportunism and incoherence on childcare' after backing the Swedish system where there are no ratios at all. Mr Twigg writes: ‘Cameron needs to make sure he doesn’t repeat the same mistakes he’s already made – he could make the right choices and improve the childcare system for parents but the real fear is that their plans will cause collateral damage: cutting the quality of childcare.' Labour's Stephen Twigg warns working parents will be 'rightly frightened' by reductions in the quality of care for their children . He urged the government to follow the Sweden childcare system which 'gives parents choice, affordability and good quality places'. But education minister Liz Truss hit back, saying the Swedish system has no ratio rules at all. ‘Stephen Twigg has today exposed Labour’s total opportunism and incoherence on childcare. 'He starts by attacking the idea of loosening staff: child ratios but in the next breath he says we should move to the Swedish system – where they have no compulsory ratios at all. 'Either he is deliberately pulling the wool over people’s eyes, or he doesn’t know what he is talking about. ‘After thirteen years in power, Labour left behind a childcare system where parents faced the highest costs of any major country besides Switzerland and staff were paid barely more than the minimum wage. 'The fact he has made such a basic error proves you can’t trust Labour on childcare.’ It comes as a new study found families living in deprived areas are more likely to receive a poorer standard of childcare. Labour used Freedom of Information laws to reveal how much councils have spent on training for the early years workforce and supporting childcare providers to employ well-qualified staff. In 2010-11 almost 140 councils in England spent £93.3million but a year later the budget had been cut by 40 per cent to £56million. Mr Twigg adds: ‘The Government has slashed the budget for training for nursery staff, putting quality at risk. In four areas – Redcar, Enfield, Solihull and Lewisham, there is now no money available for councils to provide nursery staff training.’ Just 15 councils increased their spending year-on-year. Miss Truss this week revealed she was considering overhauling staffing ratios to help reduce running costs for nurseries and childminders. It is hoped that reducing the red-tape burden on employers will help to bring down childcare bills which sees British parents spending more than a quarter of their income on looking after their children. Education minister Liz Truss accused Labour of 'total opportunism and incoherence on childcare' But Mr Twigg pointed to a survey of childminders which showed that 81 per cent said that if the maximum ratios were increased, they would not charge parents less per hour. ‘The Government plans to cut back on childcare standards and safeguards – under the guise of deregulation. ‘This means that childminders could be looking after eight toddlers, instead of three or four under current rules. ‘Most parents say one toddler can be a handful – they will worry that child safety could be at risk, as well as the quality of early learning.’ According to a new report from the Policy Exchange think tank, around six in 10 childminders working in the most disadvantaged areas are rated as good or better by Ofsted, compared to 77 per cent  childminders in the richest areas. The study, due to be published at the end of the month, suggests that only around one in 10 nurseries and childminders were rated outstanding by Ofsted last year. The report is due to call for the Government to focus on improving the quality of early years education, and suggest that Teach First - which trains top graduates to work in schools in disadvantaged areas - should be extended to pre-school education. Report author Harriet Waldegrave said: 'Early years education will only have a positive impact on a child's development if it is of a high quality. While provision is improving, it's not doing so fast enough.""Most worryingly of all, lower quality provision in disadvantaged areas means positive effects of early years education are less likely to be seen for the children who need it most.'","Coalition yet to agree reforms to tackle spiraling childcare costs .

"Smallpox was eradicated in 1979 and was one of the world's most-feared diseases. It covers the body in a painful rash (pictured) It was one of the world’s most feared diseases that covered a person’s body in painful pus-filled spots. And scientists fear that smallpox, which was eradicated in 1979, could re-emerge from the most unlikely of places – defrosting corpses. A handful of experts fear that bodies infected with the disease, which are defrosting in Siberia - having become exposed from melting frost – could potentially begin a cycle of infection, should a person make contact with the remains. Concerns have been raised for years, but a newly-discovered 'giant' 30,000-year-old virus found in Siberian permafrost has led France's National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) to warn that the prospect of a smallpox comeback cannot be ruled out. A report by BBC Future questioned whether frozen bodies of people who had smallpox – and might have died from the disease – could release the virus into the environment. If such a scenario did occur, it could potentially start a global pandemic. The question has been the source of speculation for over a decade as scientists believe the disease could be in suspended animation in bodies that are surfacing as a result of the warming climate, Gizmodo reported. In 2002, author Richard Stone wrote an article for Science asking whether smallpox is lurking in the Arctic. He described a ‘nightmarish place near the Kolyma River’ in north eastern Siberia where authorities in Yakutsk gathered a team of people to investigate remains of bodies from the 18th century with smallpox scars as they were worried that flooding could resurrect the virus. Author Richard Stone wrote an article for Science asking whether smallpox is lurking in the Arctic. He described a 'nightmarish place near the Kolyma River' (pictured) in north eastern Siberia where defrosting bodies infected with smallpox oozed . Smallpox is an ancient disease caused by the variola virus and results in a nasty rash where lesions are filled with fluid and then pus. The highly contagious disease was fatal in up to 30 per cent of cases before it was eradicated in 1979. It no longer occurs naturally but was contagious - spreading with contact between people and saliva droplets in an infected person's breath. The very last stocks of the virus are held in two secure laboratories - one in the U.S. and one in Russia - but some governments think there is a risk that the virus exists in other places. The World Health Organisation (WHO) cannot assess the risk of an outbreak but is working to help governments prepare for the possibility. There is no cure for smallpox but a vaccine can be used effectively to prevent infection up to four days after a person has been exposed to the virus. A staggering 300 million people died from smallpox in the 20th century alone.SOURCE: WHO . He wrote: ‘The researchers huddle around a mummified child half-submerged in thawing mud. They gently peel away a few layers of deerskin clothing to reveal blackened skin pocked with blemishes characteristic of smallpox pustules. ‘As they cut into a wizened leg, liquid oozes from the spongy flesh.’ Later, the team doused the opened tomb with disinfectant to stop anyone accidentally carrying the virus out of the area. The disease is known to have ravaged populations in the Arctic and elsewhere at the time and it is thought that evidence of the disease survives there simply because it is cold, while bodies have rotted away in warmer regions. Some scientists think that bodies frozen in the north could be 'a fertile ground and a reservoir of the virus,' Live Science reported. Smallpox is resilient when frozen and permafrost has previously yielded other types of living bacteria that are three million years old. Last week, scientists announced they have successfully revived a 30,000-year-old giant virus frozen in ice. The French and Russian researchers said that the virus is a type never seen before and warned that global warming could lead to more ancient viruses that can affect humans being uncovered. Dubbed Pithovirus sibericum, the virus was found in a 98ft (30metre) deep sample of permanently frozen soil taken from coastal tundra in Chukotka, near the East Siberia Sea, where the average annual temperature is minus 13.4 degrees Celsius (7.8 degrees Fahrenheit). The work shows that viruses can survive being locked up in the permafrost for extremely long periods, France's National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) said in a press statement. 'It has important implications for public-health risks in connection with exploiting mineral or energy resources in Arctic Circle regions that are becoming more and more accessible through global warming,' it said. The revival viruses that are considered to have been eradicated, such as the smallpox virus (pictured) whose replication process is similar to that of a newly-discovered 30,000-year-old virus, is no longer limited to science fiction, France's National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) warned . 'The revival of viruses that are . considered to have been eradicated, such as the smallpox virus, whose . replication process is similar to that of Pithovirus, is no longer . limited to science fiction. 'The risk that this scenario could happen in real life has to be viewed realistically.' Imre Friedmann, who examined the smallpox-scarred body found at  the Kolyma River said: 'If bacteria survive, I don’t see why viruses don’t survive.' Another expert, Donald Henderson, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, said the hardiness of the smallpox and the expanse of frozen tundra means that it is possible that viable variola is preserved in permafrost. 'If it were going to be anywhere... [the tundra] would be the likely place,' he said and experts think dry permafrost is probably where it would be found. However, scientists who have tried to excavate corpses with the tell-tale signs of smallpox in Alaska and Siberia have not recovered any viable viruses from them. The World Health Organisation told MailOnline: 'Our experts cannot confirm that live virus could be recovered from archaeological relics. A U.S. CDC publication said that while living organisms in relics seem to be non-existent, 'nevertheless, archaeological specimens should be handled with caution. Last week, scientists announced they have successfully revived a 30,000 year old giant virus frozen in ice. This is a close-up of the previously unknown virus infecting an amoeba cell. They warned that global warming could lead to more being uncovered . 'Each . situation should be approached independently and with vigilance and . attention'. Dr Kevin Brown, Lead Clinical Virologist for Public Health England told MailOnline: 'Although short lengths of smallpox viral DNA has been detected in corpses in the permafrost in Siberia and other preserved historical artefacts, no infectious virus has ever been obtained from archaeological remains. 'There is no evidence that previously frozen corpses in the permafrost are a potential source of infectious smallpox virus.' Michael Lane, retired director of the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention’s smallpox eradication programme, which ran during the 1970s and early 1980s, said: ‘No one feels there's a serious chance that global warming will melt the permafrost and unleash an epidemic.’ Other scientists think that climate change actually reduces the chance of finding the smallpox virus, as it is unlikely that it could spend a number of days unfrozen. Jonathan Tucker, a senior fellow at the Centre for Nonproliferation Studies, said: 'The gradual thawing of the . permafrost brought about by global warming [further diminishes] the . likelihood of recovering infectious smallpox virus particles from the . corpses of victims buried in the Arctic region.' French and Russian researchers identified the virus by taking a culture of amoebas found 30metres deep in the Siberian permafrost, and adding some of the permafrost .

The team thawed the virus and watched it replicate in a culture in a petri dish, where it infected a simple single-cell organism called an amoeba. They found the cells exploded, and when examined under a microscope, showed the presence of a giant virus particle known as a pandovirus. Radiocarbon dating of the soil sample found that vegetation grew there more than 30,000 years ago - a time when mammoths and Neanderthals walked the Earth, according to a paper published in the U.S. journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). P. sibericum is, on the scale of viruses, a giant -- it has 500 genes, whereas the influenza virus has only eight. It is the first in a new category of viral whoppers, a family known as Megaviridae, for which two other categories already exist. P. sibericum is harmless to humans and animals because for it only infects a type of amoeba called Acanthamoeba, the researchers said.

"Max Price's parents Lisa and Martin are raising their son as a boy and a girl so he does not 'grow up aggressive' Max Price is a happy, healthy one-year-old boy who spent yesterday morning playing with his vast collection of toy cars, planes, tractors, and dinosaurs. Dressed in a red checked lumberjack shirt and rust-coloured jeans, he shouted ‘beep beep!’ and giggled with delight while pushing a plastic motorbike around the living room of his family home. Then, after lunch, a strange transformation occurred. Max scampered upstairs to his bedroom with his 23-year-old mother, Lisa, and re-emerged several minutes later wearing a dark blue, knee-length dress decorated with pink flamingos. He swiftly grabbed a blonde-haired doll, sat her in a pink plastic pram, and took her on a short walk, stopping only when it was time to pretend to breastfeed her. Later in the afternoon, the child collected several more dolls, found a selection of pink toy cups and saucers, and staged an impromptu tea party. Max, who turns two later this month and lives in Walsall, is being raised according to a radical technique known as ‘gender-neutral parenting’. It means Lisa and her husband, Martin, 34, encourage him to wear both boys’ and girls’ clothes, and to play with conventionally female – as well as male – toys. Rather than being worried if he decides not to play football, and asks instead for someone to paint his fingernails with glittery polish,  they instead see it as a form of cute self-expression. ‘If Max wants to wear a pink tutu and fairy wings, then he can wear it,’ says Lisa. ‘He’s just expressing himself. I don’t want to put him in a certain box and treat him that way. I want to teach him to be whatever he wants to be. He can pick his own clothes and, as long as they’re warm enough for the winter, I’ll get him whatever he wants.’ Lisa and Martin share the terraced home with a hamster called Simon, two cats, Tigger and Pixie, and a German Shepherd called Roxy. Visitors to the bustling home tend to be surprised, but ‘mostly supportive’, of their decision to pursue gender-neutral parenting. ‘You get the odd funny look, and a bit of hostility, but once we explain how we are bringing our son up, and why, people tend to understand,’ says Lisa. Scroll down for video . The couple from Walsall said they love their son for who he is. They are raising Max, who turns two later this month, according to a radical technique known as 'gender-neutral parenting' ‘I hope that Max won’t get teased when he’s older. But part of what we are trying to do with Max is to instil such a sense of confidence, and a sense of who he is, that he won’t care what anyone else thinks.’ Lisa, a full-time housewife, took the decision to allow Max to identify as either a girl or a boy 12 months ago, after seeing high-profile rape cases being discussed on parenting websites. ‘Gender stereotypes can be so damaging. ‘They teach little boys to be aggressive and dominant over women,’ she argues. ‘There’s research out there saying that the whole “boys will be boys” thing basically teaches lads that it’s OK to be a certain way, because it’s in their nature to be aggressive. It’s detrimental for them and for females.’ The decision was fully supported by Martin, an unemployed courier. ‘I think my husband is more of a feminist than I am,’ she says. ‘His biggest concern about the whole thing is usually “does Max have the right shoes to go with that dress!”’ Martin, for his part, adds: ‘My parents told me that I played with my sister’s dolls as a child and it doesn’t bother me. I can’t see why it would bother anyone.’ They are adamant that Max has thrived . under the gender-neutral regime, pointing out that he is able to string . three or four-word sentences together, and is ‘almost’ potty-trained. The concept of gender-neutral parenting first became popular among . feminists in America during the 1970s, when it inspired the actress . Marlo Thomas to write a best-selling children’s book called Free To Be… . You and Me. Recently, it has experienced a small revival. Max pictured pushing his doll in a buggy in one of his favourite dresses, left, and a pink coat, right . In 2011, a Canadian couple made headlines after refusing to reveal the gender of their new-born child Storm in what they called ‘a tribute to freedom and choice’. The following year, a Cambridgeshire couple, Beck Laxton and Kieran Cooper, revealed they were raising their child Sasha as gender neutral to allow his or her ‘real personality’ to shine through. In normal circumstances, Max would be required to start wearing gender-specific clothes when he starts at school. However Lisa and Martin have a contingency plan that will allow him to continue dressing as he pleases. ‘We’re planning on home educating Max,’ says Lisa, who was herself home-schooled. ‘However, if he does eventually choose to go to school, and wants to wear a girl’s uniform, I certainly won’t stop him.’ She adds: ‘It doesn’t matter if he’s homosexual, bisexual, transsexual or asexual as far as I’m concerned.

"Lord Patten is facing mounting pressure to resign today after it was revealed he has ten other jobs earning him up to £200,000 a year. Despite earning £110,000 a year as BBC Trust chairman, the former-Tory Cabinet minister is only expected to be performing 'Trust duties' three or four days a week - but in reality does only three. The rest of the time he is occupying himself with five other paid roles and five voluntary roles. Lord Patten, Chairman of the BBC Trust, pictured yesterday, left,  as it was revealed he had ten other jobs despite being paid £110,000 by the BBC and right, in his role as Chancellor at Oxford University, one of his jobs . BBC Trust chairman. Pay: £110,000 a year for 'three days a week' He is paid reportedly nearly £80,000 a year as an adviser to oil company BP, plus up to £40,000 from energy company EDF. He also receives 'occasional' income from writing and speaking engagements. One of his unpaid roles includes the prestigious post of Chancellor at Oxford University. One senior Tory figure has called for . Lord Patten to resign, saying he has been spread too thin by his . commitments to other jobs. Tory MP Philip Davies told . MailOnline: 'Lord Patten has been asleep at the wheel as Chairman of the . BBC; unaware of things he should have known about and slow to act at . any stage of the BBC crisis and his judgment has been shown to be . faulty. 'The likeliest explanation for these . failings is that he has so many other jobs he hasn't given the BBC Trust . the focus it deserves. 'Lord Patten is part of the problem not part of the solution and he should resign.' Lord Patten is also a non-executive director at headhunting firm Russell Reynolds Associates. A non-executive director is expected to be present at monthly management meetings and on average 18-20 other days throughout the year. He will earn an estimated £15,000 a year based on figures from the Institute of Directors on the average pay for a non-executive director at a medium sized company. As BP adviser he is expected to attend two meetings and offer advice. For EDF he attends four meetings. There are 12 BBC Trustees, all of . whom are appointed by the Queen on advice from ministers. As they are all appointed part-time, they are able to fulfill other roles. During the first six months of this year the BBC Chairman spent 78 days on BBC business - accounting for three days a week. But the BBC said not all of that time was in Trust offices. A BBC Trust spokesman told MailOnline: 'In the period in question, the Chairman spent 78 days formally on BBC . business, the majority of them in the Trust offices, and on many other . occasions in other BBC buildings. 'That works out at three days a week, . which is what he is supposed to do, and that takes no account of the . fact that he is available seven days a week to deal with BBC business on . an ad hoc basis.  Ultimately, what building he is in is an immaterial . point. The BBC Director General, George Entwistle, left, stands with Lord Chris Patten, as he announces his resignation as director general on Saturday . 'The fact is that he is always available for BBC business.' Vice chair Diane Coyle holds ten positions, and is on the same EDF panel as Lord Patten. His other duties are all publicly documented in the 'Register of Lords' interests'. Lord Patten is also a member of the European Advisory Board for Bridgepoint, a private equity group, and an adviser for telecomms company Hutchison Europe. He is co-chair of UK-India Round Table, taking up three days a year, and co-chair of the British Council in Italy's annual conference. Earlier this week Lord Patten insisted the BBC would go through a 'radical overhaul' in the wake of George Entwistle's dramatic resignation as director general on Saturday after just seven weeks in the job. He said Mr Entwistle left the Corporation 'extremely honourably' and was taking responsibility for the 'awful journalism' that saw Newsnight wrongly label a Tory peer a paedophile. He told The Andrew Marr Show: 'Throughout this in the way the BBC has covered ourselves, our credibility depends on telling the truth about ourselves and others, however horrible it might be.' Lord Patten has so far defied pressure to resign.","Lord Patten paid £110,000 to work for BBC often just three days a week .

"Shelling out: The Department spent more than £1.2m on flights between May 2010 and February 2012 when Chris Huhne was in charge . Ministers and officials at the ‘green’ department for energy and climate change have clocked up a bill of over . £1.5 million for nearly 3,500 flights since the coalition came to . power. More than ten per cent of the flights - 362 - were business class but they made up over a third of a cost - £600,000. DECC shelled out for business class . for 32 domestic flights to short-haul destinations such as Glasgow and . even Manchester, both easily accessible by train. The department spent £250,000 on 1,228 . domestic flights in two and a half years to destinations that are often . easily reachable by train. The department is tasked with . including air travel in the European Union Emissions Trading System - . which makes flights more costly for those paying out of their own . pockets. Most of the costs were amassed while . former Lib Dem Cabinet Minister, Chris Huhne, was in charge. The . department clocked up £1,227,429 in costs during his reign from May 2010 . until February 2012. DECC also paid £460 for a flight to . Aberdeen according to the figures, unearthed by the Taxpayers Alliance . in a Freedom of Information request to the department. The huge costs led the Taxpayers . Alliance to label the flights as a ‘extravagant waste’ and an . ‘breath-taking hypocrisy’ for the department which is meant to champion . cuts to greenhouse gases. The figures also showed that 3,017 flights were taken in economy class at a cost of £835,000. Business class flights were also . booked from London to cities in Europe such as Budapest (£699), Berlin . (£474), Madrid (£271) and Cologne (£370). A bill of £500 was racked up for flying first class, from London to Lisbon - despite it breaching the department’s own policy. Shelling out: The department flew business class for 32 domestic flights to short-haul destinations such as Glasgow and even Manchester, both easily accessible by train . Despite its ‘eco-friendly’ credentials, the department also embarked on air travel to far-flung . destinations such as Auckland, Cape Town, Jakarta, Washington, New York, . Nairobi, Tokyo and Hong Kong. These long-haul destinations cost more than £4000 each in flight costs alone. The costliest flight was £5,792 from Cancun to London. A London to Cape Town jaunt cost £5,396, while two flights to Santiago cost £5,190 each. Some £123,551 was spent on 116 ‘premium economy’ flights. DECC has a headcount of 1,286 staff, which works out to three flights per employee. Anger: Matthew Sinclair said the report showed 'extravagant waste from a department which can¿t be trusted with more and more of our money, while others work hard to make savings' Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of . the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Despite being one of the departments . making air travel more expensive for people paying their own way, the . Department of Energy and Climate has spent an astonishing amount of . taxpayers’ money on flights. ‘This looks like breath-taking . hypocrisy and extravagant waste from a department which can’t be trusted . with more and more of our money, while others work hard to make . savings.’ He added: ‘Officials urgently need to . explain why they spend so much money on so many business class flights . in particular. If Ministers can’t provide a satisfactory explanation for . the number and cost of the air fares their department is racking up, . then there have to be serious sanctions for officials who have left . taxpayers with such an unfair bill.’ The department defended its extensive air travel. A DECC spokesman said: ‘The . department’s international work, which includes securing the nation’s . future energy supplies, carrying out negotiations with other countries . and international organisations on energy and climate change issues, and . regulating the North Sea oil and gas industry among other things, means . that sometimes air travel is unavoidable. He added: ‘Any such travel is for . business purposes only, and we are careful to ensure that the most . cost-effective and suitable flights are identified. ‘This Government has never said people . who care about climate change must not fly: it’s not surprising that . for some journeys, especially over very long distances when time is a . factor, flying is the common sense option.’ DECC also has staff based in Aberdeen . and the spokesman said it was easier to fly there as a train took seven . hours one way and a return trip would ‘take up two working days’.","Department has taken 3,500 flights, with 362 in business class .

"For the price of an actual plane ticket, you can experience what it was like to fly in the golden age of air travel. The 'Pam Am Experience' will be conducting four four-hour 'flights' over the next few months, in a reconstructed Boeing 747. And while the plane doesn't actually take off, passengers get a round-trip ticket to the past with a four-course airline meal and a tour of the perfectly reconstructed jet from the Sixties. Luxury: For the next three months, Air Hollywood, a Los Angeles sound stage, will be hosting four 'Pan Am Experience' dinners - showing 'passengers' what it was like to fly during the golden age of air travel . Only the best: Passengers can buy either a $297 first class ticket or $197 clipper class ticket. Both classes get service from these ladies, dressed in the mod uniforms of the period . In-flight entertainment: After dinner, passengers in first and clipper class are treated to 70s-era films played on a projector . Passengers can buy either a $297 first class ticket, or pay $197 for a seat in clipper class. They are then ferried on board by fashionable fight attendants decked out in the mod uniforms of the 60s and 70s. And passengers are expected to dress up for the flight too, just as they would have done 50 years ago. 'Guests are expected to dress the part,  and dress nicely, just like passengers did in the 1970s. We won’t require a coat and tie, but we will discourage jeans, sneakers, shorts or sandals. Our goal is to make this feel like Mad Men, and our guests should play the part,' Rob Shalhoub of Air Hollywood told Travel Skills. Fresh: Passengers in first class have their chateaubriand carved seat-side by the stylish stewardesses . Sweet: At the end of the meal, flight attendants bring a dessert trolley around with cheese, fruit, liquor and coffee . Hang out: A view of the second floor of the jet, where first class passengers were allowed to unwind back in the 60s and 70s . Leg room: The more modest accommodations in clipper class are still much roomier than what modern airlines offer . Break out the Mad Men suits: Pan Am Experience guests are encouraged to show up dressed in the clothing of the period . After boarding in the first or clipper class cabins, passengers are treated to cocktails before dinner. In first class, flight attendants serve passengers a four-course meal from trolleys on vintage Pan Am china. The meal includes a shrimp and lump crabmeat cocktail starter, chateaubriand carved seat-side, chicken and a vegetarian pasta. And for dessert, passengers get to choose from a fruit and cheese trolley which rolls through with liquors and coffee to top it off.

After the meal, passengers enjoy 70s-era movies played from an overhead projection system. At the end of the flight, ticket holders can look over a vast collection of Pan Am memorabilia and shop for licensed merchandise, as well as explore sets put up by Air Hollywood for other films like Bridesmaids. The experience was made possible in large part to Anthony Toth, the owner of the largest Pan Am collection in the world, who reconstructed the plane himself in a garage.

"Russell Means, a former American Indian Movement activist who helped lead a 1973 uprising against the U.S. government and appeared in several Hollywood films, has died. He was 72. Means died early Monday at his ranch in South Dakota, Oglala Sioux Tribe spokeswoman Donna Solomon said. Means announced in August 2011 that he had developed inoperable throat cancer and was forgoing mainstream medical treatments in favor of traditional American Indian remedies and alternative treatments away from his home on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Farewell: American Indian activist Russell Means (in October 2011) has died at his home in South Dakota . 'Our dad and husband now walks among our ancestors,' his family wrote on his website. 'He began his journey to the spirit world at 4:44 am, with the Morning Star, at his home and ranch in Porcupine.' Means led AIM's armed occupation of the South Dakota town of Wounded Knee, a 71-day siege that included several gun battles with federal officers. AIM was founded in the late 1960s to protest the U.S. government's treatment of Native Americans and demand the government honor its treaties with Indian tribes. Means told the AP in 2011 that before AIM, there had been no advocate on a national or international scale for American Indians and that Native Americans were ashamed of their heritage. 'No one except Hollywood stars and very rich Texans wore Indian jewelry,' Means said. 'That's all changed.' He was often embroiled in controversy, partly because of AIM's alleged involvement in a 1975 killing. Strong: In 1974, he challenged Oglala Sioux Tribal President Richard . Wilson in a reservation election. He laughs after hearing that Wilson said he will give AIM 10 days to get off the reservation after he is . reelected 'or else' Outspoken: Means, pictured in 1989, helped bring the grievances of Native Americans to national and global attention in the 1970s before going on to become a Hollywood actor . Activist: Means, who led an uprising against the government in South Dakota in 1973, is pictured being arrested by Denver police in 2000 for blocking the March for Italian Pride Columbus Day parade . But Means was also known for his role in the movie The Last of the Mohicans and his unsuccessful run for the Libertarian nomination for president in 1988. Paul DeMain, publisher of Indian Country Today, there plenty of Indian activists existed before AIM, but the group became the 'radical media gorilla'. 'If someone needed help, you called on the American Indian Movement and they showed up and caused all kind of ruckus and looked beautiful on a 20-minute clip on TV that night,' DeMain said. Means said he felt his most important accomplishment was the founding of the Republic of Lakotah and the 're-establishment of our freedom to be responsible' as a sovereign nation inside the borders of the United States. His efforts to have his proposed country recognized by the international community continued at the United Nations, he said, even as it was ignored by tribal governments closer to home, including his own Oglala Sioux Tribe. Movie star: Means is pictured left in the Last Of The Mohicans with Daniel Day-Lewis, centre . High profile: Means, pictured left beside Eric Schweig and Daniel Day-Lewis, played chief Chingachgook . But others may remember him for his former organization's connection to the killing of Annie Mae Aquash, whose death remains synonymous with AIM and its often violent clashes with federal agents in the 1970s. Authorities believe three AIM members shot and killed Aquash on the Pine Ridge reservation on the orders of someone in AIM's leadership because they suspected she was an FBI informant. Two activists - Arlo Looking Cloud and John Graham - were eventually convicted of murder. The third has never been charged. Means blamed Vernon Bellecourt, another AIM leader, for ordering Aquash's killing. Bellecourt denied the allegations in a 2004 interview, four years before he died. Also in 1975, murder charges were filed against Means and Dick Marshall, an AIM member, in the shooting death of Martin Montileaux at the Longbranch Saloon. Marshall served 24 years in prison. Means was acquitted. Career: Means, pictured left in The Last of the Mohicans and right in April, also played roles in Natural Born Killers and the animated film Pocahontas, among others. In 1995, he released an autobiography . Remembered: Means, pictured in April 2012, died early on Monday at his ranch in South Dakota . But Means always considered himself a Libertarian and couldn't believe that anyone would want to identify as either a Republican or a Democrat. 'It's just unconscionable that America has become so stupid,' he said. His acting career began in 1992, when he portrayed Chingachgook alongside Daniel Day-Lewis' Hawkeye in The Last of the Mohicans. He also appeared in the 1994 film Natural Born Killers, voiced Chief Powhatan in the 1995 animated film Pocahontas and guest starred in 2004 on the HBO series Curb Your Enthusiasm. Means recounted his life in the book Where White Men Fear to Tread. He admitted to his frailties and evils but also acknowledged his successes. 'I tell the truth, and I expose myself as a weak, misguided, misdirected, dysfunctional human being I used to be,' he said.","Means led uprising against the government in South Dakota in 1973 .

Scotland Yard said the man, 26, had been messaging someone through the popular online gay dating app Grindr and invited him to his home in Bayswater, west London. Detectives have released CCTV pictures of two men they are hunting after a gay man was attacked in his own home in west London . When the man, described as blond and in his 20s, arrived he spent most of his time texting on his phone and then announced he was leaving and was escorted out by the victim.

"British shops should sell New Zealand . lamb rather than homegrown meat if they want to help protect the . environment, experts have claimed. The suggestion, likely to outrage .

A New Zealand Romney spring lamb standing with its mother . And some methods produce more harmful gases than others, they said. The study claims Britain, for . instance, would be better off importing lamb from New Zealand which has . been produced more efficiently than on its own farms. Countries can also not only reduce . emissions but make financial savings by being more careful with regards . to the way animals are reared. Costs: Emissions could be reduced and money saved by cutting down meat consumption . National Farmers Union representative . Nathan Alleyne said: ‘I don’t think we’d be coming out in support of . that measure, but we’d need to read the report before commenting on it.’ Resilient: Crops like barley could be used more . The study shows food production accounts for up to 29 percent of man-made greenhouse gases. Looking at emissions across the food . system - including forest clearance, fertiliser production and transport . - rather than just farming itself - agriculture research organisation . CGIAR said much more work was needed to cut climate change emissions . from food. Their report ‘Climate Change and Food .

"Unapproved genetically modified wheat has been discovered growing in the United States. The revelation is threatening the outlook for U.S. exports of the world's biggest traded food commodity, with importers keenly aware of consumer sensitivity to gene-altered food. The European Union is preparing to test . incoming shipments, and will block any containing GM wheat. Chicago . Board of Trade wheat futures fell 0.5 percent on Thursday. USDA officials said that when a farmer sprayed the so-called 'volunteer' plants (not pictured) with a glyphosate herbicide, some of them unexpectedly survived . Major importer Japan has cancelled a tender offer to buy U.S. western white wheat, while other top Asian wheat importers South Korea, China and the Philippines said they were closely monitoring the situation. 'We will refrain from buying western white and feed wheat effective today,' Toru Hisadome, a Japanese farm ministry official in charge of wheat trading said. GM wheat was discovered this spring on a farm in the west coast state of Oregon, in a field that grew winter wheat in 2012. USDA officials said yesterday that when a farmer sprayed the so-called 'volunteer' plants with a glyphosate herbicide, some of them unexpectedly survived. Major importer Japan has cancelled a tender offer to buy U.S. western white wheat, while other top Asian wheat importers South Korea, China and the Philippines said they were closely monitoring the situation . Scientists found the wheat was a strain field-tested from 1998 to 2005 and deemed safe before St. Louis-based biotech giant Monsanto withdrew it from the regulatory approval process on worldwide opposition to genetically engineered wheat. No GM wheat varieties are approved for general planting in the U.S. or elsewhere, the USDA said. The EU has asked Monsanto for a detection method to allow its controls to be carried out. With high consumer wariness to genetically-modified food, few countries allow imports of such cereals for direct human consumption. However, the bulk of U.S. corn and soybean crops are genetically modified. With high consumer wariness to genetically-modified food, few countries allow imports of such cereals for direct human consumption . The latest finding revives memories of farmers unwittingly planting genetically modified rapeseed in Europe in 2000, while in 2006 a large part of the U.S. long-grain rice crop was contaminated by an experimental strain from Bayer CropScience , prompting import bans in Europe and Japan. The company agreed in court in 2011 to pay $750 million to growers as compensation. Asia imports more than 40 million tonnes of wheat annually, almost a third of the global trade of 140-150 million tonnes. The bulk of the region's supplies come from the United States, the world's biggest exporter, and Australia, the No. 2 supplier. The USDA said there was no sign that genetically engineered wheat had entered the commercial market, but grain traders warned the discovery could hurt export prospects for U.S. wheat. 'Asian consumers are jittery about genetically modified food,' said Abah Ofon, an analyst at Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore. 'This is adding to concerns that already exist on quality and availability of food wheat globally.' European traders said Black Sea and EU wheat was well positioned to benefit in any displaced demand for U.S. grain. But some were more pragmatic on the overall impact. 'The market is going to need U.S. wheat, we won't be able to do without it, so that could mean more checks and more sanitary certificates,' one European dealer said. 'Japan is in a position to be selective and to react sharply. It has other suppliers and the financial means to be choosy and pay more if needed. This is not necessarily the case for (top global wheat importer) Egypt which is in a difficult financial situation.' A major flour miller in China, which has been stocking U.S. wheat in recent months, said importers will tread carefully. China has emerged as a key buyer of U.S. wheat this year, taking around 1.5 million tonnes in the past two months. Chinese purchases in the year to June 2014 are estimated to rise 21 percent to 3.5 million tonnes, according to the USDA, with most shipments coming from the United States, Australia and Canada. The Philippines, which buys about 4 million tonnes of wheat a year and relies mainly on U.S. supplies, is waiting for more details before acting, an industry official in Manila said. 'I won't be surprised if other countries start cancelling or reducing their purchases of U.S. wheat, particularly Asian countries, putting pressure on wheat demand,' said Joyce Liu, an investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore. Genetically modified crops cannot be grown legally in the United States unless the government approves them after a review to ensure they pose no threat to the environment or to people. Monsanto in a statement posted on its website said: 'While USDA's results are unexpected, there is considerable reason to believe that the presence of the Roundup Ready trait in wheat, if determined to be valid, is very limited.'","EU will test incoming shipments after GM crops discovered in Oregon .

"A former top US diplomat had shoes thrown at him in the Commons last week in a re-run of the attack on George W. Bush when he visited Iraq as President. There was panic as a  protester hurled two shoes at Paul Bremer, ex-US envoy to Iraq, as he made a speech in a meeting room at the Palace of Westminster. Mr Bremer, who was in charge of rebuilding post-war Iraq, ducked as the man accused the US of ‘f****** up’ and declared he had ‘a message from Saddam Hussein’ to deliver before throwing the first shoe. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Duck: Mr Bremer (right) was sat alongside Chairman Henry Smith and making a speech when the protestor began hurling shoes at him . Missed: Mr Bremer smiled with relief as the shoe narrowly missed his head. The man had yelled that he had a 'message from Saddam Hussein to deliver' Fumbled: Mr Bremer tried to catch the second shoe and joked 'you should improve your aim if you want to do something like that' Regaining his composure, Mr Bremer tried to catch the second shoe as security guards grabbed hold of the man, who said he was brought up in Iraq, and removed him from the room. Before resuming his speech,  Mr Bremer taunted the protester for missing him, saying: ‘You should improve your aim if you want to do something like that.’ He added: ‘If he had done that while Saddam Hussein was alive, he would be a dead man by now.’ In 2008, Mr Bush – who appointed Mr Bremer to his post in Iraq – was the victim of a similar attack when he visited Baghdad and  a journalist hurled shoes at him in a traditional Arab gesture of  disrespect. Mr Bremer, 71, was the victim of several assassination attempts while in charge of Iraq after the 2003 invasion. The Westminster incident came as he addressed a meeting organised by the think-tank, the Henry Jackson Society. After giving a speech about defending freedom and democracy in the 21st Century, Mr Bremer took questions from the audience. One man rose to speak, identifying himself as someone who grew up in Iraq and came to the UK in 2005 ‘after the USA destroyed my country’. Video footage of the incident, posted on The Commentator website, does not show the attacker but he is heard declaring: ‘I have two messages, one from Saddam Hussein and one from the Iraqi people. This is the first message.’ Target: George W. Bush was the victim of a similar attack in 2008 when he visited Baghdad and a journalist threw shoes at him . Amid gasps from the audience,  the first shoe then flies towards Mr Bremer who flinches but relaxes when it falls short. He then tries to catch the second shoe, which also misses him and hits the top of a wood-panelled cupboard. But his attacker is heard shouting: ‘You f***** up my country, you destroyed the  country. F*** you and f*** your democracy.’ Another American  is heard telling him to ‘get out of here, dude,’ after which the Iraqi was led away. He was restrained by police outside the room and then ejected from the Commons. Back inside, Tory MP for Crawley Henry Smith, who chaired the meeting, is seen apologising to Mr Bremer. In response, Mr Bremer leans over and says: ‘It’s OK – I tell you something, it has happened before.’ To laughter from the audience, he adds:  ‘No hard objects! Throw questions.’ Unperturbed by the incident, Mr Bremer was then given a tour of the Commons by Mr Smith.He has since signed one of the size 8 shoes hurled at him. In a comment issued through the Henry Jackson Society, Mr Bremer said yesterday: ‘The incident shows how lucky the man is to live in a country like the UK where free speech is respected. ‘Many British and American soldiers gave their lives to bring this same right to Iraqis in Iraq.'

"A man who organized a liaison with another man through the gay dating app Grindr viciously attacked him with a hammer before biting him and attempting to rob him, authorities have said. The unnamed victim needed surgery for a damaged eyelid and staples to shut a wound to his head after the allegedly violent attack by Curtis Rosenblat near Seattle, Washington in March. Rosenblat, 23, was arrested trying to board a plane at Sea-Tac Airport on May 7 and has now been charged with assault. During his arrest, Port of Seattle police were forced to shock him with a Taser, Deputy Prosecutor Michelle Larson wrote to the court, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported. Scene: Curtis Rosenblat, 23, was arrested waiting for a flight in Sea-Tac Airport last week after he allegedly met a man on Grindr, took him back to his apartment and beat him with a hammer (file picture) Rosenblat had used the sex app Grindr to message and arrange a meeting with the man on March 22, and the alleged victim picked him up near his apartment at 3am. The pair searched for a secluded place to have sex but when they could not find one, they went to Rosenblat's apartment, a Seattle detective told the court, the Post-Intelligencer reported. They were naked inside his home when Rosenblat tried to kick the other man out without his belongings, the detective said. The men began fighting and when Rosenblat left the room, the alleged victim tried to grab his items, but Rosenblat returned with a hammer and began beating him, the detective said. 'When the hammer was not . enough, the defendant then began to viciously bite the victim,' Larson told the court. Hookup: The men messaged on gay dating app Grindr (pictured) before meeting up on March 22 . A woman in the apartment tried to break up the fight and the man fled, police said. The victim called police and the female witness told cops that Rosenblat had told her he 'wanted to get the guy's stuff'. Rosenblat has been splitting his time between Massachusetts and Washington, and was arrested at the airport last week, where a scuffle with police officers ensued. 'The defendant is clearly a danger to the community,' Larson said. Rosenblat faces a second-degree assault charge for the attack and a charge for assaulting a police officer. He remains jailed on $115,000 bail.","Curtis Rosenblat, 23, 'organized a liaison with another man and tried to kick him out of his house naked so he could keep his belongings'

"The owner of a ladies' clothes shop called Isis has become the victim of a hate campaign after people mistakenly linked it to the jihadist network terrorising the Middle East. Jill Campbell has run the IsisBoutique in Malvern, Worcestershire for seven years but has been forced to issue a statement saying she has no connection to the extremist group. The 54-year-old revealed today that pedestrians walking past her shop and people on social media have subjected her and her staff to abuse due to her shop sharing a name with the terrorist organisation. Staff at the ISIS boutique in Worcestershire say they are being abused because of the business's name . Owner Julie Campbell (right), pictured with sales executive Fiona Budd and a model of Egyptian goddess Isis, say it is bizarre events in the Middle East are affecting her clothes shop . She revealed that one internet troll even threatened to letter bomb her shop unless she changes the name. Mother-of-two Ms Campbell said: 'This terrorism is happening thousands of miles away, and yet my business in Malvern is being targeted, it's bizarre. 'There was a particularly nasty comment on our Facebook page from someone who said we would get a letter bomb in the shop if we didn't change our name. 'Another person posted ""Terrorism comes to Malvern"" alongside a picture of the front of our shop. 'I overheard another couple talking about the name last weekend when the woman said to her partner ""look that shop's called ISIS"" and he said ""they're the ones who have been beheading everybody"". 'I can't believe I have to do this, but I want to make it clear I do not in any way, nor does this business, have any affiliation with, or support for, this vile terrorist group in the Middle East. The shop has been called Isis for seven years but the name only started causing trouble this year . Passers-by are becoming angry because the shop shares a name with the terror group in Syria and Iraq . She added: 'It's been going on for the last couple of months now. Two or three times a week passers-by will make ridiculous and ill-advised comments to us in the shop about being involved in terrorism.' 'It has also filtered onto social media, and we are having to monitor our Twitter account and ask to have tweets removed that are suggesting we are linked to terrorism. 'To see a tiny little business, in a tiny little town in a tiny part of the world become connected with, in some peoples' eyes, international terrorism is madness. 'I'm sure most people in the town know the truth, it's just a few making idiotic comments.' Ms Campbell is also considering putting her plans to open a new shop in the Cotswolds on hold. She added: 'Even though it's absurd, I do unfortunately feel I have to protect my business. 'It's getting out of hand, and I just want it to blow over. Luckily my staff are fine with it, as are existing customers as we are established here.' She has refused to change the name, which comes from the Egyptian goddess of beauty and femininity . She added: 'I was thinking of opening a second shop in the Cotswolds, but with this going on, I'm considering whether to put it on hold now, which is a real shame. 'We had looked at a shop in Stow-on-the-Wold which is 12 miles from the home of David Cameron in Dean so you can imagine the bad publicity if people say ISIS has moved onto the Prime Minister's doorstep. 'People are telling me I should change the name of the business, but why should I? We've been here for seven years, we were called ISIS before all of this, and the name represents our business.' Ms Campbell says she came up with the name ISIS after leaving Oxford in 2007. She added: 'I came up with the name because the river in Oxford is named locally as ISIS and it is also the Egyptian goddess of magic, mystique, beauty and femininity which is everything the shop is all about.' A statue of Isis found off the coast of Alexandria . The goddess Isis was first worshipped in Ancient Egypt as the ideal mother and wife as well as the patroness of nature and magic. She is often depicted as the mother of Horus, the falcon-headed god featured throughout Egyptian theology. Her image as a model of womanhood made her popular both with the slaves, who saw her as a mother-figure, and the wealthy, who saw her as a example to wives. It was believed that the annual flooding of the River Nile came from the tears of Isis as she wept over the death of her brother Osiris. The figure of Isis passed into Roman and Greek mythology and she is still worshipped by some pagans today. Some scholars have suggested images of Isis holding her son influenced images of Mary and Jesus in Christian religion. She was also incorporated into the symbolism of Freemasonry and is referred to in Mozart's opera, the Magic Flute. The goddess also gives her name to the section of the River Thames from its source until it reaches Dorchester-on-Thames.","Shop has sold women's clothes in Worcestershire for seven years .

"A mother who founded the world's first nightclub specifically for larger women has stepped down as figurehead of the group after losing 17 stone, having been warned by doctors that the excess weight could leave her paralysed. Shadoe Gray, 49, set up Club Curves in LA, California, seven years ago, when she weighed 25 stone. But when she dropped to just eight stone her frame no longer represented her company and she felt she had to step down. The mother-of-one had previously loved her larger size - and admits receiving plenty of male attention - but when doctors warned that her health was in danger she decided to change her lifestyle. Scroll down for video . Shadoe Gray, pictured at 280lbs in 2005 (right) and 112lbs today (right), opened the world's first big girls' club . 'I want to help other people start their own clubs for big people because I will never stop feeling like a big girl' But losing 17 stone after gastric surgery has, the blue-eyed blonde says, come at a price. Not only is she celibate - the types men who used to be attracted to her having now lost interest - but she has also been bulled out of the club she founded, leaving her feeling 'outcaset from my own people'. Shadoe said: 'I set up Club Curves after suffering fat discrimination - but when I lost weight I was bullied for being too thin. 'It's left me devastated - I'll never get stop feeling like an outcast from my own people. I've lost a lot of friends along the way because they couldn't accept that I'm not fat anymore. 'But even though I've been forced into the shadows, I'm still flying the flag for big women.' In 1997 Shadoe (right) founded Club Curves and became a spokeswoman for larger ladies . Shadoe had been teased about being overweight since childhood, but by the time she hit her 20s she'd enough of being sidelined. In 1997 she founded Club Curves and became a spokeswoman for larger ladies, with her message that size doesn't matter. She said: 'I wanted to find a place where I could be looked at with desire. I became more successful as a businesswoman with the club and happier about my figure. 'I realised people were attracted to me in a physical way and that I had an attractive personality. Everything in life was good.' But with her new-found popularity, she was soon eating up to five thousand calories a day. Shadoe, 49, poses at a local park in Long Beach, California after losing 17 stone . She said: 'I was eating anything I could get my hands on - there was no off button.  I would go to the shop and buy 12 doughnuts, then eat half that day and half the next. 'My breakfasts were enough for three people and I would always but them at McDonalds. 'I'd snack all day on crisps, cookies and soda and then I'd have a fast-food dinner of hamburgers before a big dessert of cakes and cookies.' Her weight rocketed to 25 stone and her health was in such she was told to slim down. But it presented her with a big dilemma. She said: 'I was comfortable with my size emotionally but I had pain in my knees, asthma and I got a stress fracture in my lower back because of the weight. 'I couldn't even do simple things like cross my legs or tie my shoelaces. My doctor told me if I didn't do something I was going to lose the ability to walk.' 'I didn't want to go through with surgery because I knew I would face a lot of criticism' Although she had been approved for surgery ten years before, Shadoe was reluctant to lose weight. She said: 'I didn't want to go through with surgery because I knew I would face a lot of criticism.'There I was telling people of the world to love the size they were and I was having weight-loss surgery. It was a very difficult decision to make.' Shadoe had surgery in 2005 and was left only able to eat 150g of food at a time. On a modest diet of whole wheat toast for breakfast, macaroni cheese for lunch and a small turkey taco for dinner she lost 12 stone in just one year. However, she was later ousted from the business and no longer invited to speak on behalf of big women. She said: 'My message was that size shouldn't matter but it's like Martin Luther King waking up one day and being white. 'You feel the same way and want them to listen but people said 'What the hell do you know?' I was a skinny white girl who looked like Barbie.' And Shadoe's love life also took a turn for the worse. 'I was constantly asked out when I was bigger but I've not been intimate with a man since my surgery' 'I realise I can't be a figurehead for Club Curves but I have a wealth of knowledge about the way it works' She said: 'I was constantly asked out when I was bigger but that stopped. I've not been intimate with a man since my surgery.' After suffering the backlash from her clientele, Shadoe shut the club down for a year before opening it again without herself as the figurehead. And her next venture is to help other people open their own big girls clubs. She said: 'I realise I can't be a figurehead for the club but I have a wealth of knowledge about the way this business works. 'I spent 20 years promoting the message of loving yourself no matter your size. I want to help other people start their own clubs for big people because I will never stop feeling like a big girl.' Shadoe insists she'll never gain weight again but admits she sometimes pines for the old days.She said: 'When my gastric band makes me sick every day I wish I hadn't done the surgery. I miss the person I was.' 'It's very difficult being in plus-size promotions at my size. Now I'm just the lady running the club, now I'm the boss and people are respectful of me. 'Everything I do I did for those girls and changing their lives and if they wanted to have weight-loss surgery too I would support that.' She added: 'As far as my love life goes I hope to meet someone in the future. I've been single for eight years now but I'm really trying to put myself out there and make more of an effort to meet people.'

"If you're prone to feeling low and lethargic, a device that can change your mood at the touch of a button may be a godsend. Scientists have developed a headset that uses electrical impulses to alter your mood by using a smartphone – and it should be on sale next year. The device currently consists of a set of electrodes connected to a phone and produces a short-lived energising effect that feels a little like drinking a can of Red Bull, MIT Review reported. Scientists have developed a headset that uses electricity to change your mood by using a smartphone – and it should be on sale next year. The device currently consists of a set of electrodes (illustrated with a stock picture) connected to a phone to administer an almost imperceptible shock . The start-up behind the device, called Thync, said it can also be used to produce a calming effect stronger than drinking a few pints of beers or taking a pill with drowsy side effects. Co-founder Jamie Tyler, a professor at Arizona State University, explained that the time the relaxing feeling lasts, which can feel similar to mediation, varies from person to person. The device works by using a type of transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) where a barely imperceptible electrical current is applied when a user presses a button on the smartphone. The device produces a short-lived energising effect that feels a little like drinking a can of Red Bull . The skin is mildly shocked behind the ear for an energising effect and on the temple and the back of the next for the relaxing effect. Whereas previous TDCS research has focused on using electricity to affect the outer part of the brain, the headset targets specific nerves and muscles just beneath the skin to create the strong effects. Marom Bikson, a professor of biomedical engineering at City College of New York, recently used a prototype of Thync’s device for a 100-person study looking at the device’s calming effects. The experiment was funded by the company, which has recently raised $13 million (£8.2 million) in venture capital to bring its products to market. Professor Bikson said the study showed ‘with a high degree of confidence’ that the device has an effect, although the results were variable. ‘For some people -not everyone-the effect is really profound,’ he said. ‘Within minutes, they’re feeling significantly different in a way that is as powerful as anything else I could imagine short of a narcotic.’ Professor Tyler is also working on a device that uses ultrasound to affect the brain without surgery or drugs. This technique could affect deep areas of the brain, associated with emotions and motivation and will be able to target areas measuring millimetres across. He hopes that it could one day be used to treat psychiatric disorders and shed light on how the brain works. Professor Tyler will work with Amit Etkin, a professor of psychiatry and behavioural science at Stanford University to investigate how the gadget might treat depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and Parkinson’s. The device currently consists of a set of electrodes connected to a phone. Electrodes are attached to different parts of the head, depending on the desired effect. The device works by using a type of transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) where a barely imperceptible electrical current is applied when a user presses a button on the smartphone. The skin is mildly shocked behind the ear for an energising effect and on the temple and the back of the next for the relaxing effect. This is because it targets specific nerves and muscles just beneath the skin to create the strong effects. The start-up behind the device, called Thync, said it can also be used to produce a calming effect similar to mediation and stronger than drinking a few pints of beers or taking a pill with drowsy side effects .","Device is currently a set of electrodes connected to a phone .

"Causing a stir: The arrival of the Duchess of Cambridge and her family on the privately owned island of Mustique has upset fellow holidaymakers . It has long been an idyllic retreat for the rich and famous – so you wouldn’t think the presence of Royalty would cause a stir. But the arrival of the Duchess of Cambridge and her family on the privately owned island of Mustique has upset fellow holidaymakers. Heightened security measures to ensure Kate’s privacy mean the Mustique Company, which owns the Caribbean island, is restricting the movements of other guests. Tourists have been told that if they wish to dine at one of the island’s two hotels they must travel in a vehicle provided by the venue. They are banned from using the rented ‘mules’ – the island’s fleet of souped-up golf carts – in case they try to take pictures at the Middleton family’s £15,000-a-week Aurora villa, featuring its own plunge pool and a stunning ocean view. There have also been reports of guests being quizzed by security men while walking on the beach. One local millionaire, who asked not to be named, said: ‘This isn’t exactly the way one expects to be treated when you pay very good money to visit the most exclusive island in the Caribbean.’ Kate’s party, which includes her parents Michael and Carole, sister Pippa and younger brother James, is staying at the villa owned by Mark Cecil, a hedge fund manager and friend of the family. Prince William is expected to join them shortly. A security source on the island said the new arrangements had been put in place after discussions with the Duchess’s British team of bodyguards. ‘The concern isn’t crime,’ the source . said. ‘It is that visitors might try to take photos of the VIPs who are . here on their phones.’ The source insisted the Mustique Company was meeting the costs of security. Neither the Mustique Company nor Buckingham Palace would comment last night.",Arrival of Duchess of Cambridge and her family on Mustique has upset fellow holidaymakers .
"A mother and daughter have spoken of their experience of both being diagnosed with the same cancer at exactly the same age. Christina Jones, 55, from Sutton Coldfield in Birmingham, was diagnosed with the blood cancer Hodgkin’s lymphoma at the age of 24 in 1982. She beat the condition and, despite being told she may not be able to have children, gave birth to daughter Philippa in 1988. Astonishingly, Phillippa was diagnosed with the same condition in 2011, despite the cancer not being considered to have a strong hereditary link. Christina Jones and her daughter Phillippa were both diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma aged 24 - despite the fact the cancer is not thought to have a genetic link . ‘I couldn’t believe that Phillippa could have the same disease as me at exactly the same age - especially as family history isn’t thought to play a role,’ said Christina . Indeed although there can be a slightly . increased risk of developing the cancer if a close relative has suffered with the condition, it is not known whether genes or a shared lifestyle play the deciding role. 'It's an amazing story because the the risk of two relatives getting the cancer is very low,' said . Martin Ledwick, head information nurse at Cancer Research UK. Christina said she knew that something was wrong when she developed a lump on the side of her neck as a young woman. ‘Almost overnight, a lump appeared - but I thought it was nothing, so I left it for a couple of weeks. But it didn’t disappear and it was totally painless which is a key symptoms of Hodgkin’s.’ Christine eventually saw a doctor who sent her for blood tests. They showed an abnormality and a biopsy confirmed that she had cancer but that it was only in the early stages – between stage two and three. Survivors: The mother daughter duo said they weren't frightened about their diagnoses and tried to remain positive throughout their cancer treatment . Phillippa, now 25, said that having a mother who had been through the same ordeal was reassuring. Philippa's cancer was more advanced than her mother's when diagnosed and she underwent both chemotherapy and radiotherapy . Because the cancer was contained, she underwent four weeks of targeted radiotherapy. ‘It was tough – I felt nauseous constantly and of course the insides of my mouths were raw from radiation burns,’ she said. But . Christina said she wasn’t scared about the diagnosis because in the . Eighties, people were far less aware of the gravity of cance, she says. ‘Back then you just had to get on with it – there was less support. To tell you the truth, I needed it explained to me that lymphoma was a cancer of the blood because it just wasn’t publicised then. ‘I’m an optimistic person, too, and I just didn’t think to get too down about it.’ Christina was later given the all clear and has enjoyed good health ever since. Christina admitted that in 2011 she hadn’t given much thought to her cancer in many years so when daughter Philippa started to exhibit certain symptoms, she didn't think it could be the same cancer she had suffered with three decades before. Hodgkins lymphoma (cells pictured) is a disease of the white blood cells and make sufferers more prone to infection . 'My lump was smaller than Mum's and didn't grow anywhere near as fast, no none of us thought it could be the beginnings of the same disease,' said Phillippa. Eventually the symptoms worsened and Philippa began to lose weight, suffered night sweats, abdominal pain -  which doctors later discovered was caused by an enlarged spleen. Doctors sent her for an ultrasound scan but because they didn't think it was urgent, she didn't receive the results for a month. By the time the scan came back in August she had developed another lump under her arm. Phillippa was given an immediate biopsy she was given the news that was suffering with Hodgkin's lymphoma within 24 hours. 'It was bizarre being given the same news but I didn't panic,' said Phillippa. 'There were a couple of tears but it was so good to know I wasn't alone because Mum had been through the same.' 'You don't want to burden your friends with your worries about cancer, so knowing I had Mum who had been through it all before made it feel like I could confide in her.' Phillippa's lymphoma was more advanced than her mother's and she was diagnosed with stage three to four cancer. She was treated at Heartlands . Hospital in Bordesley Green and was given radiotherapy and underwent six cycles of chemotherapy. Philippa went into remission in January 2012 and was given the all-clear the following month. She is now feeling 'better than ever' and is enjoying her new job as a charity fundraiser for Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research. Philippa and Christina are supporting Cancer Research UK's Race for Life 2013. Run, walk or sponsor. Enter now at raceforlife.org . Nearly 1,500 people are diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL) in the UK each year. HL is cancer of the . white blood cells called B lymphocytes that circulate around the . lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread . throughout the body. The lymphatic system is part of your . immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic . vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as . lymphocytes. Lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to . multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the . lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes or glands. These lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. The most common symptom of HL is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, . armpit or groin. It usually affects . young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50. The cause is . unknown but risk factors include medical . conditiona that weakens your immune system, taking immunosuppressant . medication and being previously exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (which . causes glandular fever). It isn’t thought a family member having the disease increases the chances of developing it. The only way to confirm a diagnosis of HL is by carrying out a biopsy. Almost all young people with HL will be fully cured. For older people over the age of 50, the . cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent. Treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and drugs including steroids.","Christina Jones, now 55, developed Hodgkin's Lymphoma aged 24 .

"Olympic swimming champion Grant Hackett has spoken about his life-changing five-week stint in an Arizona rehab clinic this year, confessing that his addiction to Stilnox sleeping pills played a major role in him seeking help. The gold medallist also said that a 'sustained amount of pressure and stress' and his bitter divorce from Australian singer Candice Alley led him to get treatment. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline about his rehab experience for the first time, he said he was reluctant and 'scared' to go to the US clinic - but was persuaded to go by his dad. 'I was in denial about [help] for a long time, I thought I could manage everything and anything,’ he said on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Better than ever: Grant Hackett is looking forward to returning to the spotlight this weekend after his time away in rehab . His spell in rehab followed a bizarre incident in February when he was filmed half-naked in the foyer of Melbourne's Crown Casino. After his initial reluctance, the 34-year-old admitted he formed ‘great relationships’ from the experience. 'There was a bit of reluctance because you don’t know what you’re getting yourself into,’ Hackett said. He confessed he was a ‘little bit frightened’ and a ‘little bit scared’ before boarding the plane to America but he has now described his time away as a ‘great personal development’ lesson and has spoken about the great friends he made inside the clinic. 'I got a real insight into myself, what motivates me, where I’ve had difficulties throughout my life,' he said. 'A lot of people in there were really high-achieving individuals who had just been through tough periods. 'It's a very safe environment where you feel you can make yourself vulnerable and recover properly. Through the course of that vulnerability you do make great relationships,' he said. It was initially reported Hackett entered rehab because of an addiction to Stilnox, a prescription anti-anxiety drug and sleeping pill that is given to patients to treat insomnia and anxiety. Until now he has declined to say that the drug actually led to his admittance. 'It wasn’t really that to be honest, I have to steer a bit clear of that because of legal proceedings… but what I can tell you is that yes, definitely, I was using sleeping medication for a little while there, but that wasn’t the only thing,' he confessed. Divorced: The Olympian's troubles came after his divorce from Australian singer Candice Alley in August 2013 . Panicked: The Olympian was seen wondering the foyer of Crown Casino, Melbourne, half-naked in February . He also said his hectic life as an executive at Westpac bank, a presenter at Channel Nine, studying for a master’s degree and 'going through a very very public divorce that was extremely difficult to cope with' meant he didn’t give himself the time to rest. 'I was doing that not for weeks or months – I did that for years, it’s just not a sustainable way of living.' Hackett and Alley first announced their separation in 2012 and divorced in August 2013. 'Because of my athletic background I thought it was a weakness to say ""I need help"",' he said. Hackett’s father Neville previously said the family staged a form of intervention to get the former sportsman into ‘one of the best’ rehab facilities in the world. Long term use: Hackett was first prescribed Stilnox over ten years ago by doctors to help him wind down after competitions . 'Extremely difficult': Hackett confessed he was going through 'a very very public divorce' and did not give himself enough time to rest . He said what rehab really helped him to do was get to the root of his problems and thus rid himself of his reliance on the medication. 'Why wasn’t I sleeping? Why wasn’t I feeling like I was on top of it?... It’s more getting to the crux of it and also getting rid of those band aid solutions.' Doctors first prescribed Hackett Stilnox over ten years ago, to help him switch off at night after competitions. 'Sometimes you can't come down after those events. That's why I used Stilnox back then. It was the particular medication that doctors prescribed. 10 odd years ago they said ""this is the medication to use"" because it doesn’t have too many side effects… and it's got no hangover effect,' he explained. Hackett has battled with an addiction to the drug previously and in 2012 he called it 'evil'. He said when he was first prescribed the pill it was ‘absolutely innocent’ and he holds no grudges against the doctors who gave it to him. 'You could wake up the next morning and compete at the highest level again, so that was the rational and logic behind it.' 'Sometimes you can't come down after those events': Hackett is one of Australia's most decorated Olympians but said he's also an 'over thinker' Sleeping aid: Hackett has battled with an addiction to Stilnox previously and in 2012 he called it 'evil'. He said when he was first prescribed the pill it was 'absolutely innocent' Hackett said although not all athletes have trouble switching off at night he is the 'sort of person with a very analytical mind'. 'I’m a real thinker so often for me to do that, switch off, is not necessarily as easy as it is for the average person,' he explained. His advice to any young athletes looking for help now would be to 'avoid it all costs'. These days Hackett turns to more natural remedies, including meditation and mindfulness to wind down. 'It's not the sort of stuff I was a big believer in before… but I try and do that at the end of each day just to get out of my own head so to speak.' And his personal life is also back to a 'very happy place'. He refused to go into detail about his children, twins Jagger Emilio and Charlize Alley, because of legal proceedings. 'But of course, they are the absolute centre of my world as you can imagine,' he said. Moving on: Hackett knows his public image has taken a battering in recent years but hopes he will be judged by his 'actions moving forwards' Hackett is spending most of his time in Queensland with family and friends at the moment and revealed he is currently single . 'I'm always dating someone here and there but I haven’t actually dated anyone yet. I’m just laying low.' Hackett  knows his public image has taken a battering in recent years but hopes he will be judged by his 'actions moving forwards'. 'I'm the sort of person that if you give me a second chance, I'll take it with both hands,' he said. 'I'm always going to make mistakes but I’m going to try and keep them to an absolute minimum.' The swimmer said what matters most to him is his very close friends and family and making them proud. Life-changing: The 34-year-old, seen here with his parents, has found new ways to cope with his 'chaotic' lifestyle and is glad that he finally got help . 'They're there if I win gold medals or if I’m seen at the Crown or whatever it may be that stems from that,' he explained. Hackett will return to the public spotlight on Sunday, when he appears on Channel Nine’s Wide World Of Sports alongside former cricketer Michael Slater. 'I'm in a really good healthy physical and mental state and I feel like I’m in a place where I’m ready to jump back into that chaotic life,' he said. Four months after he was filmed wandering in the Crown casino foyer wearing a singlet over his underpants, he said: ‘I don’t think I need to go around with my head down or anything like that. 'I'm going to get on with the job. I made a mistake. I put my hand up and take full accountability and responsibility for that. Now I’ve just got to get on with it.'","Swimmer confessed he was reluctant to go to U.S. rehab in March .

"While Olympic gold medalist Grant Hackett has admitted to an addiction to Stilnox, no one has detailed the effects of his addiction as vividly as flight attendant Owen Beddall in his new tell-all memoir: Confessions of a Qantas Flight Attendant: True Tales and Gossip From The Galley. Mr Beddall spent 12 years attending to the needs and whims of the rich and famous as a first class Qantas flight attendant. His book documents finding comedian Russell Brand and singer Katy Perry delightful as they returned from their 'first date' in Phuket as 'celebrities do'.  He said Katy was so down to earth she could have been any other passenger. Then there was the flight where he plied stunning British singer Lily Allen with so much booze she was 's***faced', which was 'the absolute proof I'm 100 per cent gay. If I was a straight guy I would have taken advantage of her there and then.' But it is Beddall's tale of watching Grant Hackett and his now ex-wife Candice Alley on a flight to London that is one of the most compelling. Grant Hackett and his manager have both been contacted seeking comment to this story. In this extract from the book, Beddall recalls the flight at the end of 2005. Scroll down for video . The book tells a revealing story of Grant Hackett high on sleeping pills on a flight with ex-wife Candice Alley back in 2005, when he had to be wrestled to the bathroom by crew . 'OLYMPIC HERO LOSES IT . It was 11 pm in Bangkok and the passengers connecting with the flight to London started piling onto the plane. It was one of the rare occasions that I was rostered on with both my two close friends, Malcolm and Marcus – they were working in business and I was working in first class. We’d just come off a riotous thirty-six hours in Bangkok and I was feeling like death warmed up. Between the heat of Bangkok and the whingeing of the boarding passengers, I wished I could click my heels and be back in Brussels. Everything was running as it usually did in first – champagne corks popping, canapés flowing and passengers complaining before they even had their seatbelt buckled! As we settled the precious ones into their seats, there was a buzz from business class. Australia’s Olympic swimming hero, Grant Hackett, and his singer girlfriend, Candice Alley – soon to be wife; now ex-wife – were seated in 25J and 25K. There was general excitement from crew and passengers alike. After the first- and business-class passengers were all put to bed, crew grabbed the cheese boards and gathered in the business-class galley on the main deck for our customary goss. The light over 25J went on and it was Candice. Grant was asleep. Beddall's book also tells of the time he met Russell Brand (left) and Katy Perry (right) on their return flight from their 'first date' in Phuket . She handed us a packet of the sleeping sedative, Stilnox, and asked us to please hide it, explaining that they reacted badly with him; he’d just taken some. Thus instructed, we did as she asked. About two hours later, I was standing alone in the first-class galley flipping through a magazine when, smack bang, Grant Hackett came flying out of business class and through the first-class curtain followed closely by Malcolm and Marcus, who were desperately trying to restrain him. 'I should be in here,' he slurred. He then stepped towards the front right door and started to unzip his fly. Eventually, we wrestled him into the toilet; let’s just say it was like getting a thoroughbred horse into a racing barrier. Although I’d heard that some people had bad reactions to Stilnox – even sleepwalking – this was truly bizarre behaviour. Grant Hackett is slightly shy of two metres tall. Somehow, when he emerged, we managed to steer him back to his seat; that was a lengthy struggle. Minutes later, he was amorously kissing Candice. While we found that amusing, Candice was clearly embarrassed. We were trying to assess what she wanted us to do when his behaviour suddenly became a great deal more intimate. Quick as a flash, we removed her from the situation by taking her to the business-class refreshment bar then I raced to get Grant some water. Former Olympic swimmer Grant Hackett had to be wrestled to the toilets and his ex-wife handed his pills over to flight attendants so he couldn't take any more, according to Beddall . When I returned with the water, he was laughing to himself while hop-scotching over Candice’s reclined seat. Everyone around him was shocked; our Olympic hero off his head on sleeping pills? Of course, years later, his battle with sleeping pill addiction would become public. Fortunately he settled, and during the breakfast service in the morning he appeared quite sheepish. Before they disembarked, I quietly slipped Candice the Stilnox as she exited the toilet and she thanked me. Back in business class, Grant was looking under his seat and shaking out his blanket. When I enquired whether everything was all right, he told me rather abruptly that he was looking for something. Marcus travelled in to central London on the same Heathrow Express train as the celebrity couple and reported that Grant still looked upset about losing ‘something’. He must have got over it because Malcolm, who was working on Grant’s return flight to Australia, told me it was uneventful.'

"Dozy burglar Richard Almaraoui was jailed for five years after he broke into a flat - because he was wearing an electronic tag . A serial burglar was caught after breaking into a flat while he was wearing an electronic anti-crime tag that recorded his movements. Richard Almaraoui, 33, stole a student's laptop in the raid, Norwich Crown Court heard yesterday before he was jailed. Robert Warner, prosecuting, said police managed to recover the mini-computer from the repeat offender's home. Mr Warner said police then had no . trouble tracking down Almaraoui after his tag, which records . all his movements, showed he had raided the victim's flat in Norwich. Almaraoui, of Dereham, Norfolk, admitted the burglary and asked for five similar offences to be considered. He also breached a suspended jail sentence. Jailing him for five years, Judge Stephen Holt warned Alamaraoui that if he continued to offend his sentences would get longer. Judge Holt added: 'You continually break in to people's homes, causing a large amount of distress and fear.' He accepted Almaraoui had a difficult . background and drug problems, but said: 'The only person that can stop . you taking drugs is you.' Michael Clare, defending, said he had stopped taking drugs while on remand and wanted to make a fresh start. Electronic monitoring of offenders, which includes ankle tags and satellite technology, is provided by companies G4S and Serco. G4S, which monitors around 14,000 offenders in the UK, states on its website: 'Satellite tracking effectively limits an offender's freedom whilst not employing a full time custodial sanction. 'Subjects wear an electronic ankle tag, which communicates using radio frequency to a tracking device usually worn around the waist.  A G4S Control Centre tracks the electronic monitor and records the location of the offender to within a few metres using satellite GPS technology backed up by mobile telephone technology. 'Subjects are also given a Home Extension Unit which is located normally at the subject’s home, and is the size of a small radio. This unit allows the subject to move freely around at home. The subject's position is shown as location trails on a computer screen map.' Almaraoui, 33, stole a student's laptop in the raid, Norwich Crown Court heard yesterday .

"Aimee McWilliams was in serious danger of losing her sight as her eyes were starved of oxygen . After . finally getting round to having a routine check-up for her contact . lenses, Aimee McWilliams assumed it would be merely a formality. Having worn contacts since the age of 14, the 33-year-old fashion designer from London had never experienced any problems with them. The . general advice is to avoid wearing contacts for more than eight hours a . day. However Aimee, like many people, had been wearing them for much . longer - in her case, for more than 14 hours every day. This had . slowly been starving her eyes of oxygen; while the damage wasn't . apparent to the naked eye, it was spotted when the optometrist used a . special microscope. Aimee was shocked to learn that she was in serious . danger of losing her sight. 'I was horrified,' recalls Aimee, from . London. 'I'd always worn my lenses from 7 am until nearly midnight. Nobody had told me that I was jeopardising my sight by wearing them for . so long, though I  suppose I just said I used them daily. 'What . frightened me even more was that there had been no signs anything was . wrong - my eyes looked the same. And I'd delayed my annual check-up by . several weeks because I was so busy and I didn't think I really needed . one.' Around 3.7 million people in Britain wear contact lenses. But . many don't appreciate how meticulous you need to be about using them, . says Hosam Kasaby, a consultant ophthalmic surgeon at Southend . University Hospital and BMI Southend Hospital. One of the risks is . corneal neovascularisation, the condition Aimee had. As Mr Kasaby . explains: 'The cornea - the clear outer layer at the front of the . eyeball - is the only part of the body that gets its oxygen supply . directly from the air rather than from the blood. 'But a contact lens acts as a barrier to that oxygen supply, so extensive wear can potentially starve the cornea of oxygen. 'The . body compensates for this by  growing new blood vessels over the cornea . to provide an oxygen supply, or corneal neovascularisation. 'Left . unchecked, the eye can become covered with blood vessels, and turn the . cornea opaque. In rare cases it can threaten sight.' The problem is . the condition can build up over several years - it's only when it gets . to an advanced stage that contacts wearers become aware of a problem, as . that's when it will cause red, irritated eyes, by which time it may be . too late. The general advice is to avoid wearing contacts for more than eight hours a day . Stopping wearing the lenses can cause the new blood . vessels to collapse, though in severe cases, when there is excessive . blood vessel growth, even if they collapse, they can cause scarring. Corneal . neovascularisation may be more common with standard soft lenses, which . are made of water-containing plastic. The other main type of lens, gas . permeable, while less flexible, allows in more oxygen, says Robert . Glass, a Manchester-based optometrist. 'There are also newer types of . soft lenses, known as silicone hydrogels, which allow more oxygen to . pass through to the cornea than previous soft lens materials, making . them healthier,' he says.There are lenses licensed for use during . sleep, which are permeable enough to ensure there is minimal risk of . corneal neovascularisation. But you should be assessed by an optometrist . before using these. It's not only corneal neovascularisation that's the problem with wearing contacts for too long. Lucia . Paovesana, 27, says her big, round blue eyes, which she once considered . her best feature, have been ruined through wearing contact lenses for . more than ten hours a day, as the whites of her eyes are now often red . and sore. She's worn contacts since she was 14, then four years ago . she began suffering eye infections every few months. 'If I was awake I'd . wear lenses,' says Lucia, who lives in Tamworth and works in a bar. 'But every few months my eyes would become red and painful. I'd leave . the lenses for a couple of days and they'd settle down. But the cycle . would repeat itself.' Eventually, she saw her optician, who . immediately referred her to a specialist at Ashfurlong Medical Centre in . Sutton Coldfield, where she was diagnosed with blepharitis - . inflammation of the eyelids - aggravated by wearing her contacts for too . long every day. Blepharitis causes reddening of the whites of the eye . as the inflamed lids scratch the surface. People wearing contacts are at . much higher risk of blephar-itis, as the eye is more likely to be dry . and prone to irritation. Blepharitis cannot usually be cured, but . the symptoms can be controlled by regularly cleaning the eye with boiled . water (after it has cooled) and massaging it when closed to prevent . deposits of sticky discharge and flakes of skin building up behind the . lid. She delayed an annual check-up and didn't think she really needed one . A few weeks after she discarded her lenses, as advised, Lucia's . eyes began to lose most of their redness. 'But four years later, my . eyes are still red in the corners and I felt I've really ruined my eyes . by wearing contact lenses,' she says. It's not only overuse of . contact lenses that can threaten the health of the eye - carelessness . with hygiene is an obvious problem. And, ironically, some patients think . they are practising good hygeine but aren't, explains David Anderson, . consultant ophthalmic surgeon and corneal specialist at University . Hospital Southampton. 'Most people tend to wash their hands in the . bathroom before putting in their lenses. But many are unaware that . unless they dry their hands properly or if they leave their contact . lenses uncovered in their case, they're potentially exposing themselves . to a bug known as acanthamoeba. This lives in water tanks, which tend to . provide the supply to bathrooms. As such it can be found on bathroom . surfaces too.' Acanthamoeba bugs stick to contact lenses and can then . burrow their way through the cornea, causing acute pain. It's only at . this stage that a sufferer would be aware they had a problem. Prescription . drugs may be able to treat the bug in the early stages, but specialists . say it is very difficult to get rid of. In serious cases, the patient . needs a corneal transplant but these have a high failure rate, resulting . in sight loss. Other steps to prevent the infection include never . swimming or using a hot tub or shower when wearing contacts, advises . Jeff Kwartz, consultant ophthalmic surgeon at the Royal Bolton Hospital. 'And never hold them under running water.' Each year, infections . cause around 6,000 cases of a severe eye condition known as microbial . keratitis - inflammation and ulceration of the cornea that can lead to . vision loss. Contact lens wearers are at a higher risk, since bacteria . can get trapped in the lenses. So how should you protect your eyes? Mr Kwartz recommends using daily disposable lenses, which are usually . more expensive as each new lens will be sterile and will never need to . be cleaned. If you do use monthlies - these are taken out and . cleaned every night, and replaced after a month - rub them with the . solution recommended by your optometrist before putting them in their . case. The lens case should also be replaced every month, adds Mr . Glass. 'Over time, cracks can form in which micro-organisms can thrive, . leading to infection.' The number of years since contact lenses were invented . And never reuse or top up disinfecting . solution - put fresh solution in the case every time you take the lenses . out, says Mr Glass. Rinse the storage case and leave it open to dry . after use every day and clean it once a week with a clean toothbrush and . contact lens solution. But the most important thing is to try to . limit lens use to eight hours a day and keep hands scrupulously clean, . says Mr Kasaby. 'Break the habit of wearing lenses from the moment . you wake up until you go to bed - when you get home from work, switch to . glasses in order to allow the eye's oxygen intake to get back to . normal. Or, if you have a social event, do this the other way round.' As . for Aimee, she feels she has had a lucky escape. She was advised by her . optician at Optical Express to stop wearing her lenses immediately - . and for good. Once she stopped, within a few months the tiny blood . vessels had collapsed and were no longer a threat to her vision. But she . struggled wearing glasses - after years of wearing lenses they made her . feel dizzy when she glanced to the side - and she decided to have laser . treatment to correct her vision. 'Now I have 20/20 vision, but I . still shudder to think I could have ended up losing my sight simply from . wearing my contact lenses for much too long every day.'","Fashion designer Aimee McWilliams, 33, from London wore contacts daily .

"Solar 'super-storms' pose a 'catastrophic' and 'long-lasting' threat to life on Earth, a scientist has warned. These huge storms are caused by violent eruptions on the surface of the sun and are accompanied by coronal mass ejections, or CMEs. CMEs are the most energetic events in our solar system - involving huge bubbles of plasma and magnetic fields being spewed from the sun’s surface into space. Scroll down for video . Solar 'super-storms' pose a 'catastrophic' and 'long-lasting' threat to life on Earth, a scientist has warned. A solar eruption could take out the National Grid, along with many electrical systems across the world . They are often preceded by a solar flare - a massive release of energy from the sun in the form of gamma rays, X-rays, protons and electrons. A solar superstorm occurs when a CME of sufficient magnitude tears into the Earth’s surrounding magnetic field and rips it apart. Such an event would induce huge surges of electrical currents in the ground and in overhead transmission lines, causing widespread power outages and severely damaging critical electrical components. Ashley Dale, who was a member of an international task force - dubbed Solarmax - set up to identify the risks of a solar storm and how its impact could be minimised, warned of the danger man faces from 'solar super-storms.' A solar superstorm occurs when a CME of sufficient magnitude tears into the Earth’s surrounding magnetic field and rips it apart . Mr Dale, carrying out doctoral research in aerospace engineering at Bristol University, said it is only a 'matter of time' before an exceptionally violent solar storm is propelled towards Earth. He says such a storm would wreak havoc with communication systems and power supplies, crippling vital services such as transport, sanitation and medicine. Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost. Astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission. They do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks. The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field. Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies. A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced. Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents. 'Without power, people would struggle to fuel their cars at petrol stations, get money from cash dispensers or pay online,' he said. 'Water and sewage systems would be affected too, meaning that health epidemics in urbanised areas would quickly take a grip, with diseases we thought we had left behind centuries ago soon returning.' The largest ever solar super-storm on record occurred in 1859 and is known as the Carrington Event, named after the English astronomer Richard Carrington who spotted the preceding solar flare. This massive CME released about 1022 kJ of energy - the equivalent to 10 billion Hiroshima bombs exploding at the same time - and hurled around a trillion kilos of charged particles towards the Earth at speeds of up to 3000 km/s. However, its impact on the human population was relatively benign as our electronic infrastructure at the time amounted to no more than about 124,000 miles (200,000 km) of telegraph lines. Mr Dale makes it clear in the latest issue of Physics World that these types of events are not just a threat, but inevitable. Nasa scientists have predicted that the Earth is in the path of a Carrington-level event every 150 years on average. This means that we are currently five years overdue - and that the likelihood of one occurring in the next decade is as high as 12 per cent. This image of a huge solar flare (top left) was captured by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). One of the most dramatic features is the way the entire surface of the sun seems to ripple with the force of the eruption . The 40-strong international team of scientists from Solarmax gathered at the International Space University in France last year to identify the best ways of limiting the potential damage of a solar super-storm. A sub-group of scientists concluded that advanced space-weather forecasting is the best solution, which could be achieved by sending an array of 16 lunchbox-sized cube satellites into orbit around the Sun. The network could give around a week’s notice of where, when and with what magnitude solar storms will take place, providing adequate time to switch off vulnerable power lines, re-orientate satellites, ground planes and begin national recovery programmes. Mr Dale’s own solution is to design spacecraft and satellites so that the sensitive, on-board instruments are better protected again sudden increases in radiation from solar storms. He suggests redistributing the existing internal architecture of a craft so that sensitive payloads are surrounded by non-sensitive bulk material such as polyethylene, aluminium and water. Mr Dale added: 'As a species, we have never been more vulnerable to the volatile mood of our nearest star, but it is well within our ability, skill and expertise as humans to protect ourselves.'","Huge storms are caused by violent eruptions on the surface of the sun .

"After hunting for buried treasure for three decades – and not finding a great deal – even the most diligent of us might have given up. But not Reg Mead and Richard Miles. The two amateur metal detectors kept up their search of the same area throughout the decades and have finally struck gold – or rather silver. They have unearthed the largest hoard of Celtic coins ever found. Each one of the 30,000–50,000 coins is estimated to be worth around £200 each, putting the value of the haul at up to £10milion. Scroll down for video . A coin in the hand: Archaeologists believe the hoard, found by two metal detectors, is worth about £10million . They are thought to be from the first century BC and were found buried 3ft deep under a hedge in a farmer’s field on Jersey. Two thousand years ago the Channel . Island – which remains a popular spot to stash large sums of money – . was a refuge for tribes fleeing what is now northern France from the . invading Roman armies. As the legions of Julius Ceasar drew . closer, the treasure is thought to have been buried by a Celtic tribe . called the Coriosolitae, in the hope it could be dug up once the danger . had passed. Determined Reg Mead and Richard Miles spent decades searching a field in Jersey after hearing rumours that a farmer had discovered silver coins while working on his land . And there the coins – packed in clay and weighing a ton – have remained undisturbed until last week. The men who discovered them, Mr Mead, . 70, and Mr Miles, a customs officer in his 40s, suspected treasure was . in the area three decades ago, when they heard rumours a farmer had . found some silver pieces on his land. After a series of largely . unsuccessful forays in the area, they unearthed a stash of 120 coins in . February. Mr Mead, a grandfather who lives with . wife Ruth in St Clement, Jersey, said: ‘Richard found the first one and . it was amazing – when you see him raising his hand above his head . (saying) “got one”.’ The pair used a powerful metal . detector known as a deepseeker to search for more treasure in the field . and struck lucky last week. Richard Miles and Reg Mead first stumbled across a find of 60 silver and one gold coin - believed to be part of the same haul - back in February this year . The team prepares to lift the haul out of the ground, a side view demonstrating how big the bundle of coins is . Getting the hoard out: Metal detector Reg Mead (centre, back, blue polo shirt) watches as archaeologists unearth the Celtic coin hoard . ‘The machine picked up a really strong . signal – so we immediately got in touch with professional . archaeologists,’ Mr Mead said. ‘They started digging and we could not . believe how many coins there were. ‘All of them were stuck together. I . have been searching for things like this since 1959 and never found . anything on this scale before. ‘We had been searching that land for 30 years.’ After four days of careful digging the . hoard was hauled to the surface by crane. It will now be subject of an . inquest to determine ownership rights. Neil Mahrer from Jersey Heritage examines part of Europe's largest hoard of Iron Age coins which have been unearthed in Jersey and could be worth up to £10m . Mr Mahrer, a conservator at the Jersey Heritage Museum, carefully examines the huge haul . Mr Mead added: ‘I am absolutely numb . at the moment. To find one haul of coins in a lifetime is rare, but to . find two is just unheard of.’ The location of the find is being kept secret. Neil Mahrer of Jersey Heritage Museum, . who helped to excavate the money, said: ‘This is the biggest Celtic . coin hoard ever found which is tremendously exciting.’ The previous record find was in 1935 at La Marquanderie in Jersey when more than 11,000 were discovered. Fine toothcomb: Experts predict they are of Armorican origin - modern day Brittany and Normandy - from a tribe called the Coriosolitae who were based in the modern-day area of St Malo and Dinan . Mr Mahrer added that the coins, which are called staters and quarter staters, weigh as much as a 50p piece. ‘All the coins are silver and a common . theme is a picture of a man or god’s head on one side of the coin and a . horse on the other,’ he said. ‘They are covered in green corrosion . because the silver is mixed with copper and copper corrodes. But they . should come up again in a good condition.’ Dr Philip de Jersey, a former Celtic . coin expert at Oxford University, said: ‘The find is very significant. It will add a huge amount of new information, not just about the coins . themselves, but the people who were using them.’ Dated around 50BC, it's believed the coins were buried underground to be kept safe from Julius Caesar's campaigns (pictured) The . first century BC was a time of turmoil for the Iron Age settlements . being forced to the edge of Europe by the advancing Roman armies. As . Julius Caesar’s troops thrust towards northern Gaul, the Coriosolitae - . the Celtic tribe that buried the coin hoard in Jersey - were being . forced out of their home territory. Gaul - which covered modern day France and parts of surrounding countries - finally fell to the Romans in 51 BC. Its . northern section, known to the Romans as Armorica but covering present . day Brittany and Normandy, had close links to southern Britain. Julius Caesar observed that armies from Britannia were often to be fighting in alliance with tribes from Gaul against his men. Home for . the Celts was typically a roundhouse with thatched roofs of straw or . heather and walls of wattle and daub when timber was plentiful. Porridge, beer and bread made from rye and barley were commonly eaten and drunk from vessels made of horn. The . image of long-haired, moustachioed Celts depicted in the cartoon tales . of Asterix and Obelix actually has a basis in historical records. Classical texts mention that both Celtic men and women had long hair, with the men sporting beards or moustaches. One . Roman, Diodorus Siculus, wrote: ‘When they are eating the moustache . becomes entangled in the food, and when they are drinking the drink . passes, as it were, through a sort of strainer’. With Christianity not coming to . northern Europe until the 6th century AD, the Celts worshipped a variety . of pagan Gods and practised polygamy. Important . religious festivals included Beltane, May 1, the beginning of the warm . season, and Lugnasad, August 1, celebrating the ripening of the crops. Other . feasts included Imbolc, February 1, when sheep begin to lactate, and . Samhain, November 1, a festival when spirits could pass between the . worlds, thought to have carried on in the tradition of Halloween. As for . leisure activities for both the young and old, glass gaming pieces have . been found in later Iron Age burials, suggesting the Celts played board . games. Children may have occupied their free time by practising their skill at the slingshot - a common Iron Age weapon. VIDEO: Excavation heaven!

"Rare outing: William and Kate at a friend's wedding at the Church of St Peter and St Paul in Northleach, Gloucestershire, in 2010 . Prince William is not a regular churchgoer despite being the future Defender of the Faith and Supreme Governor of the Church of England, the Daily Mail has learnt. Although the 30-year-old future king was confirmed into the Anglican faith in 1997, he is understood to attend services of worship only a ‘handful’ of times each year. Most of these are connected with official engagements or on special occasions in the Christian calendar such as Christmas, as well as weddings and christenings. Sources say William – and his wife Kate – ‘rarely, if ever’ go to church privately on a Sunday morning, or indeed at any other time in the week. A senior aide also admitted: ‘I’m not aware that he goes every week.’ While William is not alone in being a non-attender – barely 8 per cent of those who attend church regularly are young men his age – his stance is unlike other members of the Royal Family. The Queen is a devout Christian, with a deep sense of religious duty, who attends church on a weekly basis. Prince Charles, despite his interest in other faiths, particularly Islam, has always been a regular churchgoer. The revelation about William comes at a time when Christianity is already under threat from public apathy, particularly among the younger generation. Just 10 per cent of the population now attend church each week, while the average age of worshippers has risen to just under 60. According to one survey by Christian charity Tearfund, the UK is among Europe’s four least observant counties. Two thirds of those polled had not been to church in the past year, except for baptisms, weddings or funerals, although 53 per cent still identified themselves as Christian. 'Rarely, if ever': Sources say William and Kate (pictured on their wedding day in Westminster Abbey) only attends services of worship only a 'handful' of times each year . The monarchy, however, has a unique relationship with the Anglican Church. The sovereign holds the title ‘Defender of the Faith and Supreme Governor of the Church of England’. In his or her coronation oath they also promise to maintain the Church, a vow that the present Queen takes very seriously. Archbishops and bishops are appointed by the monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister, who in turn considers the names selected by a Church Commission. They take an oath of allegiance to the Queen on appointment, as do parish priests, and may not resign without royal authority. Every five years the Queen opens the General Synod, the supreme authority of the Church of England, and any ‘law’ passed by it has to be given royal assent. Not alone: William, pictured giving a religious reading during a diamond wedding anniversary of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh service, is not alone in being a non-attender - barely 8 per cent of those who attend church regularly are young men his age . While there is little doubt  that when he accedes to the throne William will uphold these responsibilities, his decision not to  worship regularly will add fuel to the fire of those who argue that  the church has little relevance in Britain today. The last known occasion William went to church was with his wife and her family in Berkshire on Christmas Day. Before that the couple attended a service in the Solomon Islands in September as part of a South Pacific Diamond Jubilee tour on behalf of the Queen. Religious royals: The Queen (right) is a devout Christian who attends church on a weekly basis and Prince Charles (left) has always been a regular churchgoer . A spokesman for the prince insisted yesterday that he was a dedicated Christian despite his lack of regular attendance. ‘The Duke of Cambridge is a committed Anglican and has a strong personal faith,’ they said. Aides also pointed out that not only was he confirmed in 1997 when he was 14, but he and his  wife wrote a prayer for their wedding service as evidence of his ‘continued faith’. Confirmation marks the point  in the Christian journey at  which believers affirm for themselves the faith into which they have been baptised. Weeks before their 2011 wedding, Kate also chose to be confirmed. The Archbishop of Canterbury’s office declined to comment last night, but a spokesman for the Church of England said: ‘In addition to obviously being sovereign, the requirement for a Supreme Governor is that they are “in communion” with the Church of England. According to the Book of Common Prayer this means taking communion three times a year.’ All aboard: The Queen yesterday . When the Queen’s Bentley failed to start . after a church service in Sandringham yesterday, only one thing could . do the trick – divine intervention.

"A 36-year-old California man is suing the Michael Jackson estate, claiming the pop star molested him for several years after the two appeared together in a 1988 Pepsi commercial. The lawsuit filed Friday remains sealed, but sources told the Daily Beast that the new complainant is James Safechuck, a Southern California computer programmer who is married with two children. Safechuck was 10 years old when he starred in a Pepsi commercial with Jackson, acting the part of a young boy who sneaks into the singer's dressing room during a concert and eventually meets his idol. Scroll down for video . New claims: A fifth man has come forward saying Michael Jackson molested him when he was a child. The lawsuit filed Friday remains sealed but sources identified the complainant as James Safechuck, who appeared in a 1988 Pepsi commercial with the pop star. The two pictured in red above in Hawaii . The former commercial actor is adding his name to a previous suit filed last year by 31-year-old Wade Robson, an Australian former-choreographer who claims Jackson sexually abused him at a young age. The two men are being represented by law firm Gradstein & Marzano. The latest allegations come as a surprise since Safechuck was named as a possible abuse victim by Neverland Ranch staff during Jackson's 2005 criminal case - but he remained silent. But the former-actor changed his mind after becoming a father himself and undergoing intensive therapy. Child actor: Safechuck was just 10 years old when he was cast to star in a Pepsi commercial with Jackson. He plays a boy who sneaks into Jackson's dressing room in the middle of a concert . Michael wannabe: The commercial shows Safechuck trying on the singer's hat and coat while the pop star performs on stage . Caught: At the end of the commercial, Safechuck meets his idol when Jackson returns to the dressing room . 'Once you start having children and you see what it’s all about … your perspective on life changes,' a source told the Daily Beast. And a source closest to Safechuck says the man blames 'some of his current issues' on his relationship with Jackson. Sources say that Safechuck describes his time with Jackson in the lawsuit, claiming he was molested from the age of 10 until about 14 or 15. Safechuck was 10 years old when he appeared with Jackson in the Pepsi commercial, and was seen out and about with the pop star for years after. Befriended: After the commercial, Safechuck remained a fixture in Jackson's life, traveling the world with the singer. Seen above leaving the Mayfair Hotel in London in 1988 . Roadie: Safechuck traveled attended many international shows with Jackson. Seen above in Paris in 1988 . Today: Safechuck now works as a computer programmer in Southern California and has since married and went on to have two kids of his own. Pictured in both pictures above in London with Jackson in 1988 . During 1988, the year the commercial was shot, Safechuck followed Jackson around the world - attending concerts in Paris, Los Angeles, and London. He was also pictured with the star attending a Pepsi conference in Hawaii and seeing the premiere of The Phantom of the Opera musical on Broadway along with Liza Minelli. Jackson even treated Safechuck to a shopping spree at F.A.O. Schwarz toy store on that New York trip. When Jackson went to trial for child molestation allegations in 2005, prosecutors gathered testimony from several Neverland Ranch workers who said they feared Safechuck was an abuse victim. Several workers say Safechuck was a frequent quest and an estate manager testified that he saw Jackson standing in a Jacuzzi with his hands 'down the front of Jimmy's underpants and was manipulating the boy's genitalia'. Change of heart: When Jackson went to trial for child abuse allegations in 2005, several Neverland Ranch staffers told prosecutors that they suspected Safechuck was a victim. At the time, he refused to acknowledge the allegations . Witness: One Neverland Ranch maid said in 2005 that she saw Jackson and Safechuck naked from the waist up in bed together on two different occasions . A master bedroom maid said she saw the two in bed together, nude from the waist up, on two different occasions. But because Safechuck never admitted to the abuse, a judge ruled that the allegations wouldn't be included in the trial. Adding fuel to the latest allegations is a 1994 interview Jackson's sister La Toya gave to Geraldo Rivera. In the interview, La Toya says she and her mother came across a $1million check written to the father of one of Jackson's young male friends. She didn't name the boy, but said the father was a garbage collection. According to the Daily Beast, Safechuck's father was, and still is, employed in waste management. Calls placed to both Safechuck's attorney and Harry Weitzman, attorney for the Michael Jackson estate, were not immediately returned Monday evening. Mr Weitzman previously called Robson's lawsuit a money grab - 'transparent...outrageous and sad.' Robson also refused to accuse Jackson of molestation during the 2005 trial, and even testified on the late singer's behalf. But he changed his mind last year, saying he had been brainwashed by Jackson and it wasn't until he had a child of his own that he realized what Jackson did was wrong. Rosbon claims that the secret of the abuse has led him to have two nervous breakdowns, and he hasn't been able to work. He once choreographed for Britany Spears, NSYNC, Usher and Pink but has lately been unable to work.","The lawsuit filed Friday is sealed, but sources have identified the new complainant as 36-year-old computer programmer James Safechuck .

"Sydney toddler Jakob Brown was murdered by his stepfather in 2008 . A stepfather who killed his two-year-old stepson following years of abuse has been jailed for at least twenty years and six months. Gregory Wayne Hill, 40, pleaded guilty last year to murdering his stepson on March 3, 2008 while he was caring for little Jakob Brown at The Oaks in Sydney's south west. During that day, the court heard Hill delivered the two savage blows that would kill the boy. The first attack ripped the two-year-old's stomach wall and would have caused him 'enormous pain'. But instead of seeking medical attention, Hill watched the boy's suffering for hours before delivering the fatal blow to his head. The boy was pronounced dead on arrival at Campbelltown Hospital. In sentencing Hill to a maximum of 27 years and 6 months at the Supreme Court on Thursday, Justice Geoffrey Bellew said the 40-year-old had shown a 'callous disregard' for the boy. 'They were two separate and distinctive acts of wanton violence perpetrated by the offender on a helpless victim. 'The first left him suffering in pain, the second left him to die.' Three days before his death, the court heard Hill had turned up at his Sydney pre-school telling staff the toddler had bruises and scratches because he had 'fallen out of the shower' and had been 'biting himself'. Later that day when staff undressed the boy, they discovered an inflamed bruise on his pelvic area, along with a large, fresh cut on his shoulder. The little boy's father Darren Gibson described Hill outside court as a 'piece of s***' who 'deserves a death penalty'. 'You don't deserves to go to jail. You deserve a death penalty and that's it,' he said, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. 'I hope he rots in hell for the rest of his life.' On the numerous occasions after the boy had been left in the sole care of Hill from 2006 to 2008, severe bruising, swelling and rash-like haemorrhaging to his head, face, neck and shoulders, and bleeding into his nappy had all been noticed. Nevertheless, on March 8 the boy was again left in his sole care while his mother went to TAFE. The court heard Hill had no criminal history. Taking into account his guilty plea, Justice Bellew sentenced him to a minimum of 20 years and six months. Taking into account time already spent in custody, his earliest date of release is November 2032. He made no reaction as the sentence was handed down.

"Grounded: Miss Lawson in London after her US travel ban. She was not allowed to board a flight to L.A. after her drug admission in court last year . Nigella Lawson has been banned from the US because of her court confession that she took cocaine. Humiliatingly, the celebrity cook was stopped from boarding a flight from Heathrow to Los Angeles, the Daily Mail can reveal today. Her television career in the U.S. - she is a judge on talent show The Taste - is now in peril. The 54-year-old ‘Domestic Goddess’ was forced to confess under oath during a trial last year that she had snorted cocaine seven times and smoked cannabis in front of her children. Although Scotland Yard did not act over her confession, the U.S. authorities are taking a tougher stance. Miss Lawson arrived alone at Heathrow’s Terminal Five on Sunday morning to catch a direct British Airways flight to LA. She is thought to have checked in and passed security before being told she could not board her plane. She had to return to the first class check-in to arrange to collect her hold luggage. ‘She didn’t seem to say much, but she did not look happy,’ said an onlooker. ‘She could not get on the flight so she had to turn around and leave.’ Miss Lawson is thought to have tried to enter the U.S. by registering online for permission to travel and confirming she had not been arrested or convicted of offences including taking illegal drugs. But the US can also decide to bar foreigners who have committed drugs offences without ever being charged. Would-be travellers can apply to have the ban lifted, but this can take months. Miss Lawson wrote on Twitter in the early hours of Sunday that she was ‘packing for my holiday’ – including a picture of a sun hat and some Colman’s mustard. The specific grounds on which she was barred entry to the US have not been confirmed. And it is not known if she was stopped at passport control or at the departure gate where passports are often scanned. She is now expected to engage lawyers to ensure she can travel freely to America, which she regularly visits for pleasure and for work. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s customs and border protection department said it could not comment on individual cases. Confessions: Miss Lawson admitted taking cocaine and smoking cannabis during an appearance at Isleworth Crown Court last year . Miss Lawson arrived alone at Heathrow's Terminal Five on Sunday morning to catch a direct British Airways flight to LA. File picture . But a spokesman said foreigners who had admitted committing drugs offences in the U.S. or another country were deemed to be ‘inadmissible’. ‘In general, an alien found inadmissible will need a waiver of inadmissibility,’ he added. ‘Depending on the basis of their refusal they may be eligible to apply in advance of travel for a temporary waiver of inadmissibility. The waiver application process can be lengthy.’ Airlines are required to supply U.S.security officials in advance with details about all passengers on flights to America so they can be screened against Washington’s ‘no fly list’ of suspects linked to terrorism. The carriers must also check that passengers have a valid visa or other authorisation to enter the U.S. before they take off from the UK. Nigella Lawson with her ex-husband Charles Saatchi. Although Scotland Yard did not act over her drug confession, the US authorities are taking a tougher stance . Sisters Francesca (right) Grillo and Elisabetta Grillo. They were found not guilty of fraud . Miss Lawson wrote on Twitter that she was 'packing for my holiday' - including a picture of a sun hat and some Colman's mustard . The moment Charles Saatchi grabbed Nigella Lawson by the throat. The marriage broke down soon after . Weeks after her cocaine confession, Miss Lawson was allowed to fly into America on New Year’s Day to film a live interview promoting the second series of The Taste USA. The show was broadcast in January and February, having been filmed before the TV chef’s admission of drug-taking. But American border protection officers appear to have hardened their position since January. Steven Heller, a U.S. immigration lawyer based in Lewes, East Sussex, said her celebrity status as the ‘Domestic Goddess’ may have counted against her. ‘I strongly doubt that if someone who was not particularly notable made an admission in court proceedings about past drug use, it would come up,’ he said. Since the start of this year, the American authorities have enforced a stricter interpretation of the law on excluding people who admit an offence, he added. Mr Heller is confident that Miss Lawson will eventually be able to get a visa to travel to the U.S., although the process could take some time. ‘I’m sure she can get a waiver. The typical wait time is about 20 to 25 weeks but you can get it done in a matter of days. You need to demonstrate a need for it to be handled quickly,’ he said. Being blocked from America caps a torrid 12 months for Miss Lawson, who has endured a very public divorce from her former husband Charles Saatchi. The marriage broke down irrevocably after Mr Saatchi, 70, a wealthy art collector, accepted a caution for assault when newspapers printed pictures of him with his hand around his wife’s throat outside Scott’s restaurant in Mayfair in June. Culinary expert: The 54-year-old is a judge on talent show The Taste . Miss Lawson then had to give evidence at the trial of her former housekeepers, Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo, who were accused of stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds from her and Mr Saatchi. While insisting she had never been an addict or habitual user of drugs, she confirmed she had taken cocaine. She said she needed the drugs to cope with the death of her first husband, John Diamond, and the ‘intimate terrorism’ of her second, Mr Saatchi. The TV cook also described how she ‘smoked the odd joint’ of cannabis in the last year of her marriage to Mr Saatchi to make ‘an intolerable situation tolerable’. But she maintained that she was now drug-free, telling the jury: ‘I did not and do not have a drug problem, I had a life problem. I decided to address that.’ Francesca Grillo’s barrister suggested in court that Miss Lawson had played down the extent of her drug use, in part to keep alive her dreams of success in the U.S. Karina Arden told the jury: ‘You may think about her breaking into the American market – that means she wouldn’t want it coming out for that reason, because you all know about the Americans taking a strong line in relation to foreigners with drugs.’ Peril: Miss Lawson's U.S. TV career could be upset by her travel difficulties . Miss Lawson was never arrested, and Scotland Yard said in January that she would not face any police action over her admission of drug-taking, in part out of fears that charging her would deter other court witnesses from telling the truth. It would be no surprise if Mr Saatchi was delighted at the U.S. authorities’ moves to bar his ex-wife from the country. In a furious email which he sent her last year, he revealed his contempt for her burgeoning American TV career, saying: ‘Bravo, you have become a celebrity hostess on a global TV gameshow.’ Other British celebrities said to have found it more difficult to gain entry to the US as a result of convictions or drug use include Amy Winehouse, Kate Moss, Russell Brand and Oasis stars Noel and Liam Gallagher. A spokesman for Miss Lawson said: ‘We would never comment on Nigella’s travel plans.’ A BA spokesman said: ‘Due to data protection laws, we cannot comment on individual customers.’","U.S. authorities deny entry after TV chef's admission about cocaine use .

"A charity dedicated to protecting ponies has sparked outrage by suggesting they should be eaten to save the species. Dartmoor Hill Pony Association put forward the suggestion 'with reluctance' as the best way to preserve herds on the ancient moorland. Founder Charlotte Faulkner believes herders will only continue to keep the animals if there is a 'sustainable market' for them. Unusual dish: Dartmoor Hill Pony Association founder Charlotte Faulkner with a plate full of roast Dartmoor pony meat on her farm in Devon . Fancy eating a horse? The pony group has suggested that a viable market in pony meat (left) for human consumption is the only way to save the species. Sausages made out of pony meat are also pictured (right) But South West Equine Protection (SWEP) reacted with fury, saying it would never support the breeding of animals for profit. The charity's welfare officer Becky Treeby said: 'It would be very upsetting to look at foals which in six months' time could be in someone's burger.' Dartmoor ponies are essential to the ecology of the 368 square mile national park in Devon by keeping the gorse under control. Dartmoor Hill Pony Association suggested that to save them ponies should be eaten . Dartmoor ponies are essential to the ecology of the 368 square mile national park in Devon by keeping the gorse under control. Their numbers have slumped from over 25,000 in the 1930s to fewer than 800 today. But with ponies selling for as little as £10 at auction, they have been left to breed unchecked and there are now fears of overpopulation. SWEP favours birth control – castrating stallions, giving them vasectomies or gelding mares – to keep the number of foals down. Charlotte Faulkner alongside her Dartmoor Ponies on her farm in Cordon near Newton Abbot, Devon . But now the Dartmoor Hill Pony Association has suggested that a viable market in meat for human consumption is the only way to save the species. In a letter proposing the idea sent to SWEP, she said: 'I am writing to ask whether SWEP would consider giving measured support to this understandably upsetting subject, which as pony lovers we find so hard to accept. With ponies selling for as little as £10 at auction, they have been left to breed unchecked and there are now fears of overpopulation . 'It has taken years of considering reports and listening to the outcome of meetings to recognise and reluctantly accept that Dartmoor pony herders will only carry on keeping their herds if they have a sustainable market for them. We are in real danger of ponies disappearing from Dartmoor altogether.' She added that a meat trade would encourage pony herders to keep the herd's young for at least three years – the entry level set for animals going for meat. That, in turn, would also mean animals not selected for slaughter could be broken and trained for riding and driving, best done from the age of three. 'Strangely, having a meat trade should improve a pony's chances of finding a new home at sales,' she wrote. The Princess Royal sparked similar protest in November last year by suggesting people should eat horse meat to improve welfare standards.","Dartmoor Hill Pony Association put forward suggestion 'with reluctance'

"A morbidly obese rapist who crushed his victims under the weight of his hulking 23-stone body has been jailed for eight years. Noureldin Derwish threatened to kill the families of his victims - one a 17-year-old girl - if they didn't have sex with him, a court in Melbourne, Australia, heard. A jury found the 27-year-old guilty of 13 counts of rape, three counts of making threats to kill and two counts of false imprisonment, News.au reported. The County Court in Victoria (pictured) heard Noureldin Derwish threatened to kill the families of his victims - one a 17-year-old girl - if they didn't have sex with him . The court heard how he convinced his . victims that he was an international drug lord who knew where former Al Qaida leader Osama bin . Laden lived through his criminal connections. Derwish . lured one victim into his trap by telling her that unless she met him . for sex he would use his Egyptian mafia connections to hunt her down. He took her to a hotel in Melbourne's eastern suburbs where he handcuffed her to a bed for seven hours while he raped her. The young girl had been waiting for her . sister at a station in September 2010 when Derwish, who called himself . Ali, approached her and offered her drugs in exchange for sexual . favours. The victim, who had grown increasingly fearful of Derwish, agreed to meet him again some days later, News.au reported. He . had threatened to find her family and kill them if she told police, and . again reminded her of his links to the Egyptian mafia. The court heard how he convinced his victims that he was an international drug lord who knew where Osama bin Laden lived through his criminal connections . Derwish met his second victim, who was 23, in June 2011. After she rejected a false job offer at one of his strip clubs, he offered her a job working for his fictitious company. While . negotiating details of the fake job, the victim repeatedly turned down . requests to sleep with Derwish, including an offer of $3 million. Derwish . later told his victim that he had not wanted to sleep with her, but was . testing her to see if she was a suitable candidate for the job at the . company. After the victim . grew impatient with waiting to start her new job, Derwish, who went by . the name Fernando, started to become aggressive. He told her he was an international cocaine importer and threatened to kill her entire family while making her watch. He also told the victim that his cousin was looking for a sex slave and had his eyes on her sister. He forced the woman to have unprotected sex on a string of occasions and to make two sex videos. The . judge said that while Derwish was mentally impaired there was . meticulous planning involved in creating the web of lies necessary to . lure his victims. He received a non-parole period of eight years and was placed on the sex offenders' registry for life.","Noureldin Derwish threatened to kill the families of his victims .

"Qatar have pulled out of the women's basketball competition at the Asian Games after refusing to abide by international regulations preventing them from wearing hijabs. The Qatari players had been asked to remove their head coverings before their opening group game against Mongolia on Wednesday, but chose to pull out of the match instead. According to International Basketball Federation (FIBA) rules, Article 4.2.2 says players cannot wear 'headgear, hair accessories and jewellery'. Qatar have pulled out of the women's basketball competition at the Asian Games after refusing to abide by international regulations preventing them from wearing hijabs . With no sign of the rule being relaxed ahead of their next scheduled match against Nepal on Thursday, Qatar decided to withdraw from their remaining games. An assistant with Qatar's National Olympic Committee said: 'We have decided not to take part in the remainder of the Asian Games women's basketball competition.' Nepal's players took the court for 15 minutes in their opening match on Wednesday, before the forfeit was announced. Both Qatar games were recorded as 20-0 defeats on the Asian Games' official website. The opening ceremony of the 17th Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea, took place on Friday night - but the International Basketball Federation's rules on headgear has angered Qatari competitors . The wearing of hijabs has become a hot topic in sport in recent years with Muslim athletes complaining they are being discriminated against. Judoka Wojdan Ali Seraj Abdulrahim Shaherkani, a judo competitor, made the headlines at the 2012 London Olympics when Saudi Arabia demanded she be allowed to compete wearing a hijab. While international judo federation rules at the time barred her from doing so, Shaherkani was eventually allowed to compete wearing a modified veil. Human Rights Watch said it should have been up to the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) to prove why Qatari players should not wear headscarves. 'We oppose any general ban on wearing of headscarves and onus should be on the regulator to prove why a ban is necessary on the basis of health and safety,' it said. 'In the case of basketball, it's difficult to see how a ban on the headscarf is anything other than an unnecessary restriction on the players' rights to religious freedom and personal autonomy.' South Korean singer Psy (pictured) performed at Friday's opening ceremony of the Asian Games, which prides itself on diversity and inclusiveness and runs under the official slogan 'Diversity shines here' Competition at the Asian Games is conducted under the regulations of the sports' international governing bodies, meaning athletes in other sports are free to wear hijabs. Basketball remains the exception. All four bronze medal-winning rowers of Iran's lightweight women's quadruple sculls team wore hijabs on Wednesday, while Kuwait's Najlaa I M Aljerewi and Iran's Aghaei Hajiagha Soraya wore them in the triathlon and badminton events on Thursday. FIBA said earlier this month it held discussions on the issue and was introducing a two-year 'testing phase' on what players can wear, though that only applies at the national level, not international competitions such as the Asian Games. The situation has left Qatari athletes confused and angry. Qatari player Ahlam Salem M. Al-Mana said: 'We have to take this stand. We knew about the hijab ban but we have to be here. We have to show everyone that we are ready to play, but the International Association is not ready.' The Asian Games, which prides itself on diversity and inclusiveness, has brought 9,500 athletes from 45 countries to Incheon in South Korea to compete in the world's second biggest multi-sports event after the Summer Olympics.","Qatari players were asked to remove their hijabs before their opening match .

"Euthanasia advocate Philip Nitschke tweeted this photo at midnight after he was suspended by the Australian Medical Board, a move he claims was 'politically motivated' Euthanasia campaigner Philip Nitschke says he will appeal a Medical Board of Australia decision to suspend him over his links to a man who had sought advice about how to kill himself. The board on Wednesday night used its emergency powers to suspend Dr Nitschke after ruling that he posed 'a serious risk to the health and safety of the public'. A spokeswoman for the board has confirmed to AAP that the suspension, which prevents Dr Nitschke from practice anywhere in Australia, is an interim measure pending the outcome of an inquiry. The ruling, which came into effect at midnight, follows the suicide of Perth man Nigel Brayley, who died in May after communicating with Dr Nitschke. Nitschke later tweeted a picture of himself holding a clock at midnight and a glass of wine with the caption: 'A drink at midnight to mark the end of 25 years as a doctor. Now to appeal this politically motivated de-registration'. 'The Medical Board of Australia is focused on public safety and managing risk to patients,' the board said in a statement issued on Thursday. The ruling was made under a section of the law that 'enables the board to limit a practitioner's registration in some way to keep the public safe', the statement said. Dr Nitschke, who was notified of the suspension at about 10pm on Wednesday, says he will appeal the decision. 'This is to my mind a clear case of a difference in ideology leading to a suspension. In other words, it's a political suspension,' Dr Nitschke told AAP on Thursday. It's understood the medical board found that Dr Nitschke presented 'a serious risk to public health and safety that needs to be managed' and that he had breached his duty to 'protect and promote the health of individuals in the community'. Dr Nitschke was suspended after communicating with a man from Perth who committed suicide in 2011 . Dr Nitschke said the board had sent him a letter explaining his beliefs were 'incompatible with medical practice'. 'Obviously the lawyers will be working out their strategy in the sense that we have a right to appeal as they pointed out, and we'll certainly be doing that and at that appeal drawing attention to the fact this is a rather grubby little political act,' he said. Dr Nitschke and his supporters have started a fund to finance his legal battle, and on Thursday morning claimed to have received about $6000 since they began taking donations at midnight. Mr Brayley, 45, died in May after taking euthanasia drug Nembutal. His wife Lina, 37, died in February 2011 after she fell from the top of a quarry while taking photographs. The death was initially believed to be an accident, but it emerged after Mr Brayley took his life that he was being investigated for his alleged involvement. Dr Nitschke has confirmed that Mr Brayley attended an Exit International workshop in Perth in February and purchased the banned Peaceful Pill eHandbook. He has said Mr Brayley's death was 'a clear case of rational suicide'. * Readers seeking support and information about suicide prevention can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or the Suicide Call Back Service on 1300 659 467 .","Euthanasia campaigner set to appeal suspension .

"She fled Nazi Germany as a five-year-old girl refugee, called herself ‘Steve’ to help her advance in a male-dominated world and regularly faced sexist behaviour in the workplace. Now, business pioneer Dame Stephanie Shirley, 80, has told the young women of today that they have ‘got it dead easy’ compared to those of her generation. The retired business leader and philanthropist said the law was no longer holding back woman - and insisted: ‘Today's young women, I don't know what they're complaining about’. 'I don't know what they're complaining about': Dame Stephanie Shirley (pictured), 80, has told the young women of today that they have 'got it dead easy' compared to those of her generation . She told the Telegraph Ways With Words festival in Dartington, Devon: ‘There's nothing holding women back. The law is pure. There's very little in this country that is legally overtly discriminatory. ‘It's all cultural issues that you cannot legislate against. We as women and individuals have to learn to work within that culture and perhaps to change that culture.’ Dame Stephanie Shirley was born in Dortmund in 1933 but fled Germany for Britain as a five-year-old, where she was taken in by a childless couple in the West Midlands. She founded the business technology group that became Xansa in 1962, and two years later her physicist husband David suggested she changed her name to Steve to help her progress in the business world. Retiring in 1993, she has donated £135million to charities worldwide - which accounts for 90 per cent of her technology empire. Much of this has gone to autism charities, after her only child Giles died aged 35 in 1998 from a fit connected to his autism. The peer, of Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, went to school in Staffordshire before later studying at Birkbeck, University of London. Some 23 years after arriving in Britain as a wartime refugee in 1939, Dame Stephanie founded software company F I Group (which became Xansa) - and found it advantageous to sign off letters using the name of ‘Steve’. She only employed only women until this was made illegal by the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, and retired in 1993 with an estimated £150million wealth she built through the IT industry. Dame Stephanie added that sexist behaviour was ‘pretty bad in my day’ - adding that men regularly pinched her bottom. But she added that a quota system would be a bad idea to bring more women into senior positions, because both sexes should be ‘measured by the same criteria’. It comes after she told the Jewish Chronicle two months ago: 'I’m really disappointed that women today are still talking about doing what I was doing 50 years ago. When things are easy, perhaps we don’t value them as much. 'Many people don’t want to pay the cost of success - the cost to your health, family and life. They don’t want to go there; but either you believe in equality or you don’t. I certainly do.' Four months ago official data revealed that Britain was on course to hit a Government target of 25 per cent female membership of FTSE 100 boards by the end of 2015. Women now hold 21 per cent of board positions at FTSE 100 companies, up from 13 per cent in 2011 and 17 per cent in 2013, according to data from Cranfield School of Management in Bedford.","Dame Stephanie Shirley insists women must work within today's cultural .

"A family cheated death after their VW Golf convertible burst into flames on the school run - just a day after they bought it on eBay for £800. Nicky Keefe had driven her partner and three children a quarter of a mile from their home in Cheam, Surrey yesterday when the car started smoking. But the problem wasn't spotted until her son James, 14, noticed his trainers were melting - and shouted: 'Mum, my feet are on fire!' Nicky Keefe bought a VW Golf on eBay for £800 but on the school run the following day, it exploded into flames . Nicky Keefe, right, pictured with daughter Mia, 10, only realised how serious the problem was when son James noticed his black Vans shoes (pictured) were melting . The family collected the 19-year-old car from a private seller in Hampshire on Sunday. Yesterday morning, Mrs Keefe saw the smoke coming from the grills but assumed it might be normal for an old car so she turned on the heater to clear the windscreen. Then James, who was sitting in the passenger seat, noticed his Vans shoes were beginning to melt. Mrs Keefe's partner, Kevin Keogh, was in the back with James' two younger siblings, Mia, 10 and Harry, 12. Fortunately, no-one was injured. Mrs Keefe, a primary school teacher, said: 'We got out of the car and told the people behind us our car was on fire. Then suddenly it was engulfed in flames.' She said: 'We are in shock but we are all safe. That's the main thing. 'They were quite a nice, normal couple. I think they are going to be quite shocked that this has happened.' The 19-year-old Golf Cabriolet was listed on the auction site with a starting price of £500 but sold for £810 . The former owner described it on eBay as having a 'few dings' but added 'it has lots of years left in it' A selling point of the four-seat convertible was that it had less than 95,000 miles on it and MOT until next year . The former owner added the car is 'great fun to drive in the summer or winter with the heated seats' She added her partner was checking their insurance to see if they were covered, and would also contact eBay about the incident.

In her blog for Hello! magazine she wrote: 'Despite the early starts I have managed to get my ass to the gym a few times so I'm feeling pleased about that, I try and do a mix of cardio and squats, lunges and press ups using weights for about 45 mins to an hour. 'I still hate the thought of going but once I have been I feel so much better!' She later boast that she has been three times this week. One of those times was with Mark's sister Jessica who posted an impressive picture of the pair on Instagram balancing on one leg on a PowerPlate machine, holding a ball up in the air. The 29-year-old is about to return to our screens in a BBC drama, which may be motivating her fitness blitz . Michelle's new fitness kick may also be because fiancee Mark will be honing his body with his grueling Strictly workouts . Jessica, who is currently trying to get over her ex Ricky Rayment, captioned the shot: 'Regram from today in the gym me & @michkeegangoing for it 2nd day in a row training with @danib_gd'. Previously Michelle has been less bothered about her diet and fitness regime with Mark admitting she eats ice-cream in bed. ‘She doesn’t diet that much. She had a Magnum ice cream at 12 o’clock last night in bed! She just goes to the gym two to three times a week and watches what she eats,’ he told New magazine earlier this year. However, whether it her latest undertaking in the BBC's gritty drama Ordinary Lies that has spurred her latest fitness kick or Mark becoming more chiseled due to his Strictly dance rehearsals, Michelle seems determined to shape up. She quit her role as Corrie barmaid Tina McIntyre earlier this year and was brutally killed off the ITV soap in her dramatic exit and this will be her first big return to our screens.","Always slim and relatively sporty, she appears to have stepped things up .

"Manchester City’s Manuel Pellegrini has admitted he allowed himself a smile when Robin van Persie scored a late goal for Manchester United on Sunday. In derby week, that is something you do not hear very often. For City boss Pellegrini, however, the Van Persie goal that turned three Chelsea points into one at Old Trafford was perhaps the best moment of a week that underlined City’s uncertain form once again. Having let a two-goal lead slip to draw in the Champions League at CSKA Moscow last Tuesday, Pellegrini’s team subsequently lost at West Ham in the Barclays Premier League. Ahead of Wednesday’s Capital One Cup tie at home to Newcastle, City still search for consistency. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manuel Pellegrini: I can't remember cheering Van Persie goal . Pellegrini, frustrated after losing to West Ham, was cheered up by Chelsea drawing at Manchester United . Asked if he cheered when Van Persie scored, Pellegrini said with a laugh: ‘I don’t remember. At that moment I thought the game was finished and I went to drink a glass of water. When they told me after how the game finished I smiled.’ That is as close as Pellegrini is likely to come to a show of emotion, in public anyway. Nevertheless the Chilean knows that, with United to come at the Etihad on Sunday, his team are fortunate to be only six points behind Chelsea. ‘This year maybe we are playing in irregular form,’ he said. ‘Maybe some parts of the game are well, and others not so well. The Premier League champions dropped points in the title race after losing 2-1 at West Ham on Saturday . Pellegrini admits being pleased after Robin van Persie scored a late equaliser against league leaders Chelsea . ‘We are always clear that we need to improve and we are thinking about the best way to do it. ‘It’s very difficult to analyse the whole of last season and compare with just some games of this season. Last year we had one point less than we do this year. We didn’t start so well as I wanted last year either. ‘I think it’s important to have some clean sheets. As a team you play easily or you play with more trust when you don’t concede any easy goals at the beginning. ‘But we must improve in general, not just the defending. We must create more chances, we must score more goals. We are working on that and I am sure we will return to be the same team we were in the most important part of last season.’ Samir Nasri was pictured back in training with Manchester City's squad following his groin injury . As often with the City manager, there was some contradiction in his message on Tuesday. What he was clear about, however, was his team’s need to win on Wednesday, on Sunday and then at home to CSKA in the Champions League next week. He said: ‘I think we must win the three games. They are three important competitions.’ City welcome back forward Samir Nasri into their squad for the Newcastle match after a month and a half out with a groin problem. Meanwhile, Pellegrini has paid little heed to news that United striker Wayne Rooney had been limping this week ahead of Sunday’s game. ‘We really don’t change our way to play for one player,’ he said. ‘If it’s not Wayne Rooney it will be Angel di Maria, Juan Mata or Robin van Persie. They have so many creative players. We cannot prepare for a game talking about one player.’","Manchester City host local rivals United in the derby this Sunday .

"Football could be banned indefinitely at crisis-hit Sayreville War Memorial High School as it emerges the horrific hazing ritual currently under investigation may not have been the first. Seven students aged 15 to 17 have been charged with sex crimes after allegedly pinning down new players, anally penetrating them with a finger, then sticking it in the boys' mouths. The scandal has sparked outrage across New Jersey, with thousands gathering tonight outside the school calling for more to be done to tackle bullying and assault. But tonight Sayreville Schools Superintendent Richard Labbe revealed information gathered by the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Officer suggests harassment, intimidation and bullying may have taken place before this year in the Bombers' locker room. Action: Superintendent Richard Labbe is considering banning football indefinitely at Sayreville War Memorial High School after the prosecutor said there is evidence of previous harassment, bullying and intimidation . Having already suspended the squad for a season, Labbe is now considering extending the ban into 2015 and beyond. His words came as hundreds of people gathered in a show of solidarity for the pupils, calling for schools to do more to tackle bullying and assault. The scandal has forced the school to call of this season's football as governors consider the future of the team, the coach and the principal. Outcry: Hundreds gathered in Sayreville, New Jersey, today calling for the school to do more to tackle assault . Disillusioned: Fans, parents and teachers of Bombers players implored them to put an end to hazing rituals . Support: Organizer Maureen Jenkins praised the young victims for speaking up and provoking action . Clutching candles and balloons, protesters vowed to form alliances to pinpoint and eliminate bullying from New Jersey. 'I want to praise the young men who did speak up. It takes a lot of guts and courage,' organizer Maureen Jenkins said. A reverend announced the creation of a new support group for young people in the area. Arrest warrants have been issued for seven members of the team, who play for Sayreville War Memorial High School in New Jersey. And now claims have emerged that seven people at once were required for the sick ritual. Four boys would pin the freshman down in the locker room, and two would stand guard. The seventh would howl, turn off the lights, then carry out the penetration, according to the new claims. Fears: Parents said they had no idea assaults of this nature could happen at their children's school . Students: Young people were among the crowds, horrified by the alleged attacks on their fellow pupils . 'Sick ritual': Sayreville War Memorial High School's football team, some of whose players are pictured above, has been by a hazing scandal. The identities of the players involved is not known . Sayreville War Memorial High School has been rocked by allegations of bullying, intimidation and harassment among players on their popular football team. Here students are seen arriving at the school this week . The description of the attacks, which are alleged to have taken place almost every day from September 19 to 29, was given by an unnamed parent of a football player to NJ Advance Media on Saturday. He or she described the ritual as 'sickening'. They said: 'Just think if my son or somebody else's son wanted to leave and they either felt overwhelmed by it, [or] they couldn't leave because there was somebody at the door'. It came as the coach of the team, George Najjar, refused to answer questions to the news website about whether he would resign. He said: 'There will be a time and place when I have something to say, but now is not the time.' All seven of the accused players have been charged with sex crimes. Sayreville War Memorial High School senior Kishan Patel, 17, stops to answer questions from the media as he leaves school Tuesday October 7, 2014, in Sayreville, N.J . A reported hazing incident that 'went too far' and is at the center of the investigation into the high school football team that has resulted in the cancellation of the school's football season. Patel believes when investigation is done, the cancellation of the school's football season will be seen as an overreaction . Three were charged with aggravated sexual assault, criminal restraint, hazing and other crimes for an act of sexual penetration upon one of the children. The four other students were charged with aggravated criminal sexual contact and other crimes. Those in custody were awaiting a Family Court decision on whether they would be held at a juvenile detention facility or be released to their families. Their names weren't released because of their ages. On Monday night, schools Superintendent Richard Labbe announced he was canceling the rest of the season after the prosecutor's office substantiated allegations of hazing involving members of the school's football team. Parents in the township have complained that the whole team is being punished. However, the victims' families insist the gravity of the case warrants the drastic measures. 'In the darkness, a freshman football player would be pinned to the locker-room floor, his arms and feet held down by multiple upperclassmen,' reports NJ Advance Media. 'Then, the victim would be lifted to his feet while a finger was forced into his rectum. Sometimes, the same finger was then shoved into the freshman player's mouth.' One official also told ABC News, '[The freshmen] would live in fear of seniors and juniors. They would race to the locker room to get changed and get out before the older kids got there.' This was all uncovered when a parent of one child notified authorities about what was happening at the high school. Superintendent Richard Labbe said there will be a criminal investigation as there is 'enough evidence to substantiate that there were incidences of harassment, intimidation and bullying'. He added that these incidences took place 'on a pervasive level, on a wide scale level and at a level which the players knew, tolerated and in general accepted'. 'Based upon that information, we are canceling the remainder of the football season for the freshman, the junior varsity and varsity football programs,' Supt Labbe said. According to CBS New York, Supt Labbe explained that the school first learned of the allegations last week through an anonymous allegation made to the Sayreville Police Department. 'They informed me that upon preliminary investigation, the matter in the incidents that occurred or that were alleged to have occurred, or were of such a serious nature that they were forced to turn the case over immediately to the office of the Middlesex County prosecutor,' he added. No players have been suspended and Supt Labbe would not comment on whether any personnel will be fired. He said canceling the season sends a clear message that this sort of behavior will not be tolerated. 'This district and this board of education is making a unified stance to say 'no.' No to bullying,' he said. Supt Labbe added that in addition to the criminal investigation, the high school is also investigating to see if similar behavior took place within any other sports. Speaking to CBS New York's radio channel, some parents claimed canceling the football program is not fair to innocent players. 'The students can't play, it's a ding on the entire community, it's a ding on the high school,' one parent whose son is on the team said. Upset: Audience members react as members of the Sayreville Board of Education  address a hazing incident that 'went too far' and is at the center of the investigation into the Sayreville War Memorial High School football team . Discussion: Members of the Sayreville Board of Education hold a press conference at the Selover School in South Amboy, N.J., to address a hazing incident that 'went too far' 'For all of them, the ones who are innocent, to have this taken away from them. They're being punished for something they did not do,' another parent added. A number of commentators on Twitter seemed to agree . I feel bad for those Sayreville players,' one person wrote. 'I couldn't imagine having something I work so hard for be taken away because of others poor choices.' But others praised Sayreville's zero tolerance approach to bullying. One person wrote: 'I'm so proud the district took a MAJOR stand against bullying.' 'Was the only choice the program had.' another wrote. 'People didn't want to listen and thought the sport should win out. Safety is priority.' Sayreville High School's football team - which one of New Jersey's top programs having won three sectional titles in four year - has already forfeited multiple games amid the hazing accusations, . Meanwhile, police are investigating former assistant coach of the Sayreville High School football team Charlie Garcia on drug charges. Garcia, 38, resigned from his position at the school after he was found with more than two boxes of steroids and more than a dozen syringes during a traffic stop late last month. According to NJ.com, he was charged with third-degree illegal possession of steroids, possession of hypodermic needles, driving with an expired license, failure to signal a lane change and possession of a controlled dangerous substance in a motor vehicle.","Sayreville Schools Superintendent revealed ban could stretch in 2015 .

"Mitt Romney may be considering another presidential run after all, his wife Ann suggested in an interview that aired Tuesday. Prodded about her husband's intentions, Ann Romney told Fox News' Neil Cavuto that 'at this point' she and Mitt are 'not making plans' for 2016. Asked moments later what Mitt would do if a presumed candidate like Jeb Bush, a moderate Republican from Florida, decided not to run, Ann told Cavuto: 'Well, we will see, won't we Neil?' Mitt, a two-time Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Governor, has sworn up and down that he’s not plotting another presidential campaign, and it would take some serious begging from fellow Republicans to get him into the 2016 race. The 2012 presidential nominee has adamantly said he’s had his turn and ‘someone else has a better chance’ at winning. Allies of the Republican power broker say he should stay open minded to the idea of a comeback campaign, however, and insist they’d be right there supporting him if he did choose to run again. Ann Romney, right, suggested in an interview that aired Tuesday that her husband, Mitt Romney, left, may run for president again in 2016. The couple is pictured here on Election Day in 2012 after Romney conceded the presidency to Barack Obama . Mitt Romney has said he won't run again unless other qualified candidates sit 2016 out. His presence on the campaign this trail with Republican candidates competing in the midterm elections have stoked speculation that he will. Romney is posing with a supporter in this photograph, taken at a rally in Beckley, W.Va. last month . ‘We miss Mitt a lot,’ Women for Romney director Lisa Spies told MailOnline. ‘I can speak for a lot of other staffers when I tell you people would be honored to work for him again. No doubt in my mind. It’s a no brainer,’ she said. ‘We would all die for the opportunity to work for him again.’ Former Romney deputy campaign manager Katie Packer Gage agreed that many of Romney’s former staffers, herself included, who ‘really believe’ in him ‘would love to see him do it because we all think he would have been an outstanding president and still think that he’s the best candidate out there.’ House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, the 2012 vice presidential nominee who is a potential 2016 presidential candidate himself, said he would also have his former running mate’s back if he saddled up for the rodeo for a third time. ‘I would love to see Mitt run again,’ Ryan told CNBC last month. ‘I hope he does.’ Republicans have a deep bench of presidential candidates to choose from in 2016, with as many as a dozen current and former lawmakers, including Bush, a former governor himself, hinting at plans to form exploratory committees next year, and it would be highly unusual for the party’s most recent presidential nominee to compete for the presidency again. Normally when a political party loses a presidential election their nominee becomes an elder statesman. Sens. John McCain and John Kerry, who were their parties’ respective nominees in 2008 and 2004, went back to lawmaking after their campaigns ended. Former Vice President Al Gore launched an issue advocacy campaign to tackle climate change when he was bested in the 2000 general election by George W. Bush. But as Romney supporters have pointed out, it took Ronald Reagan three tries at the presidency to get elected, and he is now one of the most beloved former presidents in American history. Emma Nemecek, of Mt. Vernon, Iowa, listens as former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney speaks during a rally for Iowa Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst in May in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Romney supporters want the former Massachusetts governor to run for president  a third time in 2016 . Recent polling in early voting states suggests Romney wouldn’t be laughed off the national stage if he decided to follow in Reagan's footsteps and take another shot at the White House in 2016. A WMUR-TV poll taken in July found that 39 percent of Republicans in New Hampshire would support Romney in the party primary. In Iowa, Romney would win the support of 35 percent of Republicans in the primary, according to a USA Today/Suffolk University poll conducted in August. Kevin Madden, a former Romney spokesman who serves as the executive vice president for external affairs at public relations firm JDA Frontline, attributed Romney’s sudden popularity to ‘buyer’s remorse with the current administration.’ ‘So many of the points he promoted during the campaign ended up being proven right, whether Ukraine or the economy or Obamacare – you name it,’ he told MailOnline. Romney said in a 2012 interview with CNN that that Russia was the United States’ biggest ‘geopolitical foe’ after Obama was caught on a hot mic promising then- Russian President, now Russian Prime Minister, Dimitri Medvedev more flexibility after his reelection. Political analysts mocked Romney at the time for pointing the finger at Russia and claimed that he was out of his depth when it came to national security. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has shifted the former presidential candidate’s standing in the foreign policy arena, however, and Romney supporters frequently offer the international debacle as proof that their candidate was right all along. ‘People thought that was crazy, now people are like wait a second, he knows what he’s talking about,’ Spies told Mail Online. If it walks like a presidential candidate, and it talks like a presidential candidate: Mitt Romney kisses a supporter while campaigning for New Hampshire Senate candidate Scott Brown, right, at a farm in Stratham, N.H. in July . Romney himself has taken Obama to the woodshed over his foreign policy in Russia and other parts of the world in recent television appearances and op-eds. A flurry of activity in the media and on the campaign trail this summer and has had talking heads and Romney supporters wondering if the former politician really is flirting with another campaign. ‘Every time he comes to a fundraiser most donors will send an email to me saying, “Oh my God, is he running?” ’ Spies said. ‘I think they’re just hopeful.’ Utah Senator Jason Chaffetz says he, for one, thinks Romney may be giving more thought to 2016 than he’s letting on. ‘Right now, I think there are more reasons [for Romney] to do it than not,’ Chaffetz told the Salt Lake Tribune in August. ‘I haven’t yet consulted my Magic 8 Ball, but I bet it would come to the same conclusion. ‘He’s not exactly tucking his hat down low and fading off into the sunset,’ he pointed out. ‘He is still a very visible presence.’ Anthony Scaramucci, the National Finance Co-Chair for Mitt Romney in 2012, told Fox Business earlier this month that Romney could enter the race if an establishment candidate pulled the plug. 'I don’t think he’s 100% made the decision,' Scaramucci said. 'But a couple of factors could happen: If Gov. Jeb Bush drops out or declares that he's not going to run, I think that puts Gov. Romney in...position. 'I think he's going to do it,' Scaramucci concluded. 'I don't think there's any reason for him not to do it. His family is behind him. Ann Romney told Cavuto in her interview that while such a scenario is possible - that Bush drops out and husband dives in - it's not likely. 'I think Jeb probably will end up running myself,' she said. Mrs. Romney indicated that her husband's final decision would hinge on whether former Florida Governor Bush opts to make a political comeback next year. 'I think he would draw on a very similar base that we would draw on,' she said, and 'I'm sure he's considering it very seriously right now.' Scaramucci, a financier who raised money hand over first for Romney in 2012 from Wall Street, told Fox Business that Romney would still be his guy in 2016. 'I can tell you right now. The governor has a very strong following, including myself. And he'd be my No. 1 draft pick,' he said. Romney lauds New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie during a birthday celebration on September 10 at The Hilton in East Brunswick, New Jersey. The event, dubbed 'Governor Chris Christie 52nd Birthday Celebration' doubled as a NJ-GOP fundraiser . Madden, the former Romney spokesman, told MailOnline he's doubtful that Mitt is positioning himself to do anything other than help out the party, though. ‘What’s happening is he’s going where the need is and he feels he can help,’ Madden said. ‘Say what you want about the Romney 2012 campaign, the one thing it did really well was raise money,’ he said. ‘I think that’s where a lot of the demand comes from for Governor Romney’s appearances on the campaign trail,’ Madden commented. ‘He has a proven ability to attract people and make a case for the raising of resources for candidates.’ Romney has appeared at campaign events this fall for a number of Republican candidates in tight races, including former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, who has relocated to New Hampshire and is now running for the Senate there. He's also headlined fundraisers for those candidates, helping introduce aspiring lawmakers to the big dollar donors who funded his two presidential campaigns. Romney's most recent deputy campaign manager, Gage, said she didn’t think Romney would run again, either, and predicted that fevered support for him would die down as other Republicans officially announce their candidacies. ‘Right now,’ she said, ‘there really isn’t really another candidate that’s of the same caliber that people are rallying behind. ‘So of course they’re looking to a candidate that’s so effective and articulated what a lot of people were thinking so well,’ she explained. ‘There’s a little thirst for that leadership.’ Yet the former Romney aide was careful not to count out  another attempt at the presidency for her previous boss, either. ‘Never say never,’ Gage said.","Ann Romney suggested that her husband would consider getting in the race if former Florida Gov.

"British police have reduced the number of detectives investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann despite officers getting permission to question a number of new witnesses. Police are preparing to return to Portugal to quiz around ten potential witnesses for the first time, but two detective sergeants and four detective constables have reportedly been removed from the case in the past year. Six extra civilian staff have been brought onto the investigation, so although the number of detectives has been cut from 29 to 23, 37 people continue to work on the case, which has so far cost £7.3million. Scaled back: British police have reduced the number of detectives investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann despite officers getting permission to question a number of new witnesses . A police spokesman told The Mirror: 'Staff numbers are open to change depending on the needs of the review.' The investigation into Madeleine's disappearance from the holiday resort of Praia de Luz on May 3, 2007, was reopened by the Metropolitan Police in 2011 and the reduction in detectives involved could be interpreted as the probe being scaled back. News of the numbers working on the case came as prosecutor Ines Sequeira paved the way for a new British police visit to the Algarve by approving a fifth international letter of request which had been gathering dust following her predecessor's departure in the summer. Officers in Faro are now scheduling the interviews, which will take place at the PJ police station in the town where four suspects were quizzed at the start of July. Parents: Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann have continued to fight to find their daughter after she disappeared seven years ago . Missing: Last week a new picture of three-year-old Madeleine dressed as a pumpkin was released by a campaign group with the blessing of her parents. She vanished from the room she was sharing with her younger twin siblings in Praia Da Luz more than seven years ago . It was thought three of the suspects would be given a new grilling when the Operation Grange team led by DCI Andy Redwood returned to Portugal. But Mrs Sequeira, 49, is understood to have authorised only interviews with a string of witnesses who British police have never questioned directly. Respected Portuguese daily Jornal de Noticias said Scotland Yard opted out of asking for permission to reinterview the suspects in their fifth letter of request, which state prosecutors received in August. Around ten witnesses are expected to be quizzed, including some who were questioned by Portuguese police after Madeleine vanished from her holiday apartment in Praia da Luz more than seven years ago. The unnamed witnesses are expected to receive police summons in the coming days. As happened during the July round of interrogations, British police will sit in on the interviews but they will be led by Portuguese officers who will ask questions on their behalf. Lead investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood (second left) with British police and their Portuguese counterparts investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in June of this year . The Operation Grange team last visited Portugal three weeks ago. A small team of three officers including DCI Andy Redwood met Policia Judiciaria bosses in Faro for an update meeting before travelling to the university city of Coimbra a five hour drive north to visit a lab where many of the DNA samples collected after Madeleine's disappearance are held. British police told bosses at Portugal's Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences they wanted to retest some of the samples to try to crack the mystery of Madeleine's disappearance. They are yet to send a sixth international letter of request which mother-of-four Mrs Sequeira will have to authorise before Met Police forensics experts are allowed access to the lab or given permission to take samples to Britain to analyse them. The forensic material includes hairs and pieces of the curtains that hung in apartment 5A at the Ocean Club holiday complex where Madeleine was sleeping with baby siblings Sean and Amelie, now nine, while her parents Kate and Gerry ate tapas nearby. British police shifting through soil on an area of wasteland during a search for Madeleine McCann in June 2014 . It emerged last week nearly 100 strands of hair tested during the original Madeleine McCann investigation were never DNA-matched. Portuguese forensic experts analysed 444 hair strands they believed could hold the key to the youngster's  disappearance. They found 432 were human and 12 non-human. They were unable to DNA-match 98 of them and only obtained partial results from 19 of them, it was reported last week. Institute president Francisco Brizida, said after the October 14 meeting: 'I have the certainty they went away very happy. 'The tonic of the meeting was about the possibility of the tests on samples collected in 2007 being re-done. 'The British police wanted clarification on the examinations the institute had carried out during the early stages of the inquiry in the areas of genetics and biology. 'We talked about non-identified material that was collected in Madeleine's apartment. 'I can't say for sure new DNA tests that didn't yield a conclusive result in 2007 could now yield an objective result. 'But technology nowadays allows us to go further than years ago in areas like genetic markers. The Ocean Club in Praia Da Luz where Madeleine McCann was staying when she disappeared in May 2007 . 'Several possibilities are open. One could be that British police do the tests in Britain with British technology and another that the institute does them. 'But that's an area in which the institute does not have the last word. There's a situation of judicial cooperation and a new international letter of request would be necessary.' The Operation Grange inquiry is running in parallel with a new Portuguese probe, reopened in May more than five years after being shelved. Scotland Yard detectives suspect Madeleine, three when she vanished, was killed during a bungled break-in. They dug up waste ground and inspected sewers in Praia da Luz in June in a grim search for her body. One of the suspects questioned in July was a former Ocean Club worker and another a 51-year-old schizophrenic drug addict. They both denied any involvement in Madeleine's disappearance. Portuguese police believe Madeleine was snatched by a foreigner no longer living in Portugal. However they have not ruled out the involvement of junkie burglar Euclides Monteiro, whose widow they questioned last year. Last month, it emerged the cost of the British police search for Madeleine will soon top £10 million  - double the original amount estimated by the Home Office when the force was called in by David Cameron in 2011. The Home Office has defending the rising cost of the probe, insisting: 'The Government believes it is right that it does all it can to support the search for Madeleine McCann.'","Number of detectives on the case has fallen from 29 to 23 in the last year .

"American Simone Biles retained her world women's all-around gymnastics title on Friday, but it wasn't just the other competitors she had to fight off on her way to victory. 17-year-old Biles wrapped up the win after a late challenge from Romania's Larisa Andreea Iordache, but was interuppted on the medals podium when a bee flew out from her flower bouquet. When asked about the incident, Biles told USA Today, 'I don't do bugs.' When Simone Biles realised there was a bee in her bouquet, she threw it away in fear . The moment remained light-hearted, as Biles joked with her compatriot Kyla Ross on the podium (right) USA youngster Biles finished the four-apparatus final at 60.231 points, 0.466 better than Iordache at 59.765. Fellow American Kyla Ross, the 2013 runner-up to Biles, finished third at 58.232 in the final at the 4,000-seat Guangxi Gymnasium in Nanning, China.

Iordache (left) and Biles (right) embrace after the latter is scared by a bee flying from her flower bouquet . The 145-centimetre (4ft 9in) gymnast admitted she was not immune to the pressure of being a defending champion. She won back-to-back US championships this year. 'Pressure from other people, but then I don't take it, so it's okay. But there's a little bit.' Iordache, the European floor champion, finished in the medals, climbing up from her fourth place finish last year. 'I am quite pleased with what I did today, but that does not mean I can not do even better,' she said, insisting she could even catch Biles any day now. 'Everything is possible at any one competition. Today I did not get gold but next time there is always a chance.' Biles became the first female gymnast since Russia's Svetlana Khorkina in 2003 to win a second straight all-around world crown. Biles (left) ducks away from the bee as it buzzes past her on the podium on Friday . During the competition, Biles performs on the balance beam during the Women's All-Around Final . She is also the second US woman to ever win back-to-back world all-around titles with Shannon Miller trailing the blaze in 1993 and 1994. Bunched in an elite rotational group of top six qualifiers, Biles took a 0.700-lead after her first apparatus, vault. But the cushion wore off with China's Yao Jinnan topping the table on uneven bars and Iordache dominated balance beam by landing safely on the padded beam after a twisted back salto. Biles stood just 0.133 points clear of the 18-year-old Romanian going into the final event, floor exercise. But Iordache stepped out of bounds after one of her dynamic tumbling passes for a 0.1-point deduction to score 14.733. Biles celebrates after winning the All-Around Final on day four of the Gymnastics World Championships . Biles, the defending world floor champion, performed last on the night. she soared high and landed clean in an overwhelming performance which left the crowd assured of her victory before her score of 15.066 was put on the board. It was her second gold at these championships as she led her 16-year-old and 17-year-old teammates to a second straight women's team title on Wednesday. There were scary moments on balance beam when Biles saved herself from the verge of falling. She lost her balance momentarily after a triple back salto and after another back flip. 'I don't really know. I don't get nervous for it, but I try not to fall and then I end up almost falling,' she recalled. Ross, who turns 18 at the end of this month, fought through the barrier pain as she hurt her hip and thigh at a US training camp. 'I wasn't really sure how I would be able to compete at the world championships, but I was able to push through and I was really proud of myself for that.'","17-year-old Simone Biles retained her world gymnastic title on Friday .

"It was probably just horse play, but a contestant suggested an answer on Wheel of Fortune that prompted host Pat Sajak to walk off the set.

The correct answer is Surf City Here We Come, the title of rock and roll duo Jan & Dean’s 1963 classic.

"The parent of one of the players at the high school football team engulfed in a horrific hazing scandal has described in detail how freshman members were allegedly abused. Boys who are new to the team were pinned down by seniors in the locker room, one of whom would anally penetrate them with his finger then stick it in the boys mouth, it was claimed this week. Arrest warrants have been issued for seven members of the team, who play for Sayreville War Memorial High School in New Jersey. And now claims have emerged that seven people at once were required for the sick ritual. Four boys would pin the freshman down in the locker room, and two would stand guard. The seventh would howl, turn off the lights, then carry out the penetration, according to the new claims. 'Sick ritual': Sayreville War Memorial High School's football team, some of whose players are pictured above, has been by a hazing scandal. The identities of the players involved is not known . Sayreville War Memorial High School has been rocked by allegations of bullying, intimidation and harassment among players on their popular football team. Here students are seen arriving at the school this week . Superintendent Richard Labbe said there will be a criminal investigation as there is 'enough evidence to substantiate that there were incidences of harassment, intimidation and bullying' on the football team . The description of the attacks, which are alleged to have taken place almost every day from September 19 to 29, was given by an unnamed parent of a football player to NJ Advance Media on Saturday. He or she described the ritual as 'sickening'. They said: 'Just think if my son or somebody else’s son wanted to leave and they either felt overwhelmed by it, [or] they couldn't leave because there was somebody at the door'. It came as the coach of the team, George Najjar, refused to answer questions to the news website about whether he would resign. He said: 'There will be a time and place when I have something to say, but now is not the time.' All seven of the accused players have been charged with sex crimes. Sayreville War Memorial High School senior Kishan Patel, 17, stops to answer questions from the media as he leaves school Tuesday October 7, 2014, in Sayreville, N.J . A reported hazing incident that 'went too far' and is at the center of the investigation into the high school football team that has resulted in the cancellation of the school's football season. Patel believes when investigation is done, the cancellation of the school's football season will be seen as an overreaction . Three were charged with aggravated sexual assault, criminal restraint, hazing and other crimes for an act of sexual penetration upon one of the children. The four other students were charged with aggravated criminal sexual contact and other crimes. Those in custody were awaiting a Family Court decision on whether they would be held at a juvenile detention facility or be released to their families. Their names weren't released because of their ages. On Monday night, schools Superintendent Richard Labbe announced he was canceling the rest of the season after the prosecutor's office substantiated allegations of hazing involving members of the school's football team. Parents in the township have complained that the whole team is being punished. However, the victims' families insist the gravity of the case warrants the drastic measures. 'In the darkness, a freshman football player would be pinned to the locker-room floor, his arms and feet held down by multiple upperclassmen,' reports NJ Advance Media. 'Then, the victim would be lifted to his feet while a finger was forced into his rectum. Sometimes, the same finger was then shoved into the freshman player’s mouth.' One official also told ABC News, '[The freshmen] would live in fear of seniors and juniors. They would race to the locker room to get changed and get out before the older kids got there.' This was all uncovered when a parent of one child notified authorities about what was happening at the high school. Superintendent Richard Labbe said there will be a criminal investigation as there is 'enough evidence to substantiate that there were incidences of harassment, intimidation and bullying'. He added that these incidences took place 'on a pervasive level, on a wide scale level and at a level which the players knew, tolerated and in general accepted'. 'Based upon that information, we are canceling the remainder of the football season for the freshman, the junior varsity and varsity football programs,' Supt Labbe said. According to CBS New York, Supt Labbe explained that the school first learned of the allegations last week through an anonymous allegation made to the Sayreville Police Department. 'They informed me that upon preliminary investigation, the matter in the incidents that occurred or that were alleged to have occurred, or were of such a serious nature that they were forced to turn the case over immediately to the office of the Middlesex County prosecutor,' he added. No players have been suspended and Supt Labbe would not comment on whether any personnel will be fired. He said canceling the season sends a clear message that this sort of behavior will not be tolerated. 'This district and this board of education is making a unified stance to say 'no.' No to bullying,' he said. Supt Labbe added that in addition to the criminal investigation, the high school is also investigating to see if similar behavior took place within any other sports. Speaking to CBS New York's radio channel, some parents claimed canceling the football program is not fair to innocent players. 'The students can't play, it's a ding on the entire community, it's a ding on the high school,' one parent whose son is on the team said. Upset: Audience members react as members of the Sayreville Board of Education  address a hazing incident that 'went too far' and is at the center of the investigation into the Sayreville War Memorial High School football team . Discussion: Members of the Sayreville Board of Education hold a press conference at the Selover School in South Amboy, N.J., to address a hazing incident that 'went too far' 'For all of them, the ones who are innocent, to have this taken away from them. They're being punished for something they did not do,' another parent added. A number of commentators on Twitter seemed to agree . I feel bad for those Sayreville players,' one person wrote. 'I couldn't imagine having something I work so hard for be taken away because of others poor choices.' But others praised Sayreville's zero tolerance approach to bullying. One person wrote: 'I'm so proud the district took a MAJOR stand against bullying.' 'Was the only choice the program had.' another wrote. 'People didn't want to listen and thought the sport should win out. Safety is priority.' Sayreville High School's football team - which one of New Jersey's top programs having won three sectional titles in four year - has already forfeited multiple games amid the hazing accusations, . Meanwhile, police are investigating former assistant coach of the Sayreville High School football team Charlie Garcia on drug charges. Garcia, 38, resigned from his position at the school after he was found with more than two boxes of steroids and more than a dozen syringes during a traffic stop late last month. According to NJ.com, he was charged with third-degree illegal possession of steroids, possession of hypodermic needles, driving with an expired license, failure to signal a lane change and possession of a controlled dangerous substance in a motor vehicle.","Seven students 'assaulted new pupils' at Sayreville War Memorial High School, NJ .

"You religiously tot up the calories in the food you eat, but still find you can’t shift the pounds? It could be down not to what you are eating, but drinking. Surveys by drinks charities and the Royal Society of Health (RSPH) have shown that up to 75 per cent of Britons are unaware how many calories are contained in their favourite tipple, and that calorie overload through alcohol is occurring at an alarming rate. As a result, pressure is mounting on drinks companies to provide more information on labels - including the amount of calories alcoholic beverages contain. Mindless drinking: New research reveals that 75 per cent of Brits are unaware how many calories are contained in their favourite tipple - a large glass of wine is equivalent to a digestive biscuit . The RSPH is among those calling on the EU health commissioner to introduce stricter guidelines on what consumers must be told about the energy content of drinks. 'There is a clear appetite for this information,' said Shirley Cramer, chief executive of RSPH. 'It could make a major difference to the waistlines of the nation.' Guidelines in the UK recommend men drink no more than four units a day and women no more than three, with two alcohol-free days per week. Exceeding these limits can not only raise the risk of heart disease, strokes and diabetes, it can also lead to weight gain in the places you least want it - around the waistline and on the hips. Will you regret it in the morning? Even sticking to the recommended 2-3 units a day could see you consume up to 6,000 calories per month, representing a weight gain of almost two pounds . Katherine Brown, Director of the Institute of Alcohol Studies says weight gain is one of the most instant effects of regular high alcohol consumption: a large glass of wine (250ml) can add 228 calories to your evening meal, the equivalent of a Cornetto ice cream or two fish fingers. A standard glass of red or white wine (175ml) could also contain up to 160 calories, which is similar to a slice of Madeira cake. Even sticking to the recommended 2-3 units a day could see you consume up to 6,000 calories per month, representing a weight gain of almost two pounds. Weigh it up: A bellini, which is a mixture of Prosecco sparkling wine and peach purée or nectar, contains 158 calories per glass, which is equivalent to a small plain croissant . In 12 months that equates to a stone and a half of added bulk.Indeed, it’s hardly surprising that Carol Vorderman recently claimed to have shed weight after ditching booze for a year. Brown says a lot of women simply don’t realise that, by sharing a bottle of wine in the evening, they are consuming the calorie equivalent of an indulgent portion of cheesecake.

Last year, a submarine car driven by Roger Moore as James Bond in the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me sold at auction for £880,800 (£550,000). While it sold under estimate, it can't be driven on the road, but can be used as a submarine. The Lotus was nicknamed 'Wet Nellie' during filming and was built by a former Navy SEAL at a cost of around $100,000 (£62,439) - the equivalent to $500,000 (£312,196) today. Although Roger Moore starred as Bond in the film, the submarine car was driven by retired Navy Seal Don Griffin during underwater filming.

The house was reverted to its original appearance when the girls moved out in March 1946. However now, nearly 70 years later, part of the estate has been transformed back to how it looked when it was used by the school. Rooms have been reverted back to dormitories, old school uniforms have been hung on mannequins and memorabilia including books from the war and never-before-seen paintings have been put on display. It is part of an exhibition which has been opened to mark the centenary of the First World War and the 75th anniversary of the Second World War.

"The most recent NHS figures show that one in ten children starting primary school is obese. (File picture) A five-year-old has become one of the youngest children to be taken into care for being obese, it emerged last night. Social workers decided the parents were doing too little to bring the youngster’s weight under control. The child, whose identity is protected by law, had a body mass index of 22.6 – clinically obese for a five-year-old. He or she is thought to have weighed around 4st 4lb – a stone and a half more than average. The decision was taken by  officials at Tameside Council in Greater Manchester. The local authority has also taken a 14-year-old into care, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. The teenager had a BMI of 30.3, . giving a weight of 13 stone – five stone more than average. Another . child was removed by Sunderland council, but officials refused to . provide details of their age or weight, claiming it would breach data . protection laws. The Freedom of Information request . sent to all local authorities asked how many children, in the past . financial year, have been taken into care where obesity was cited as a . contributing factor. The vast majority responded and where care proceedings were instigated, gave general neglect as the reason. In . the previous year, 2009/10, four children were taken into care for . obesity reasons: three from the London borough of Lewisham aged three, . ten and 15, and an 11-year-old from Northumberland. Sir Liam Donaldson, warned that healthcare chiefs would look at removing children from their families if they became so obese their health was at risk . In September this year, social workers in Dundee provoked outrage by removing four obese children from their parents. Three girls aged 11, seven and one and a boy of five were placed into care to be ‘fostered without contact’ or adopted. The most recent NHS figures show that one in ten children starting primary school is obese. Overweight children are at far higher risk of heart disease, strokes, diabetes, asthma and cancer in later life. Experts predict that obesity will cost the Health Service up to £6.3billion a year by 2015. Sir Liam Donaldson, the former Chief Medical Officer, warned in 2006 that healthcare chiefs would look at removing children from their families if they became so obese their health was at risk. The first reported case came in 2007 when an eight-year-old girl from West Cumbria was taken into care weighing ten stone. In 2008, seven children were removed from homes in England. These included a six-year-old boy from Derby, an eight-year-old girl from Cumbria who had to wear size 16 clothes, and children from Lincolnshire, Wolverhampton and Tower Hamlets in London. ‘We sincerely hope that such occasions . would be rare…but make the point that this would be the automatic . response to a child at the other extreme – severe malnutrition' NATIONAL OBESITY FORUM . A spokesman for the National Obesity Forum said it supported placing obese children into care, but only after everything possible had been done to try to reduce their weight. ‘We sincerely hope that such occasions would be rare…but make the point that this would be the automatic response to a child at the other extreme – severe malnutrition,’ the spokesman said. A spokesman for Tameside Council said: ‘The point at which obesity turns into a child-protection issue is a complex and difficult area, and in these two cases there were other determining factors that led to the children being placed in local authority care. ‘Parents should be supported to address their child’s obesity, and social workers should only act if parents fail to engage with the proposed plan to improve their child’s safety and wellbeing.’ David Simmonds, of the Local Government Association’s children and young people board, said: ‘Social workers use their professional judgment about how best to keep children from harm.’","NHS figures show that one in ten children starting primary school is obese .

"Anthony Weiner's sexting partner Sydney Leathers really is milking every second of her 15 minutes of fame. On Monday, she publicly debuted a $40,000 plastic surgery makeover worthy of an X-rated movie star. The 23-year-old Indiana native went under the knife last month, getting size-D breasts, liposuction on her flabby tummy, a nose job and teeth whitening. She exclusively told MailOnline that she thinks married New York mayoral candidate Weiner, would love her new boobs, even though she previously said he was more of a foot fetish man. Why? 'Because he's a pervert,' Leathers says. Scroll down for video .

Sydney Leathers said her former sexting pal Anthony Weiner, seen here with wife Huma Abedin, would 'secretly love' her new size-D breasts . Despite her seemingly made-for-porn makeover, she insisted she isn't going back to X-rated movies. She . made headlines starring in XXX film Weiner and Me. Weeks later it was . revealed that she was possibly exposed to HIV because she had . unprotected sex with a male co-star who was at risk for the virus. Leathers . says the porno movie was a 'one-time thing,' but says she wouldn't do . anything differently if she was handed her 15-minutes of fame again. 'I’m . happy with my life I think I did the right things,' she said. 'I think . it bothers people that I’m happy with myself and my life.' Leathers . also revealed her fame has made her a pretty penny. She wouldn't . discuss the amount but said, 'It was way more than I thought it'd be - . enough that I'm comfortable now.' She hinted that a book about her relationship with Weiner might be on the cards. She said she had wanted surgical . enhancements even before she shot to fame with her revelations that she . exchanged sexually-explicit messages with Weiner - months after . resigned from Congress over a sexting scandal. The . married father-of-one had been a frontrunner to be the next . mayor of New York City when Leathers' bombshell went public. A new poll . reveals he is likely to win just  seven per cent support in this month's . Democratic primary - second-to-last place. Before and after: Sydney Leathers says she 'needed' the liposuction, which removed four pounds of fat from her midsection. She is seen, left, in a July 25 photo shoot on a California beach . Success: Leathers offered a 'thumbs up' as she regained consciousness in at the office of a New York plastic surgeon . Leathers would not say how much she had to pay for the $40,000 makeover - though she allowed cameras from Inside Edition to film the entire process . Sydney's nose: Dr Richard Westreich . Breast implants and liposuction: Dr Matthew Schulman . Sydney's dental work: Dr Shawn Sadri . Leathers said she had always wanted bigger breasts - she was naturally a size C - and to remove a bump on her nose. 'I just wanted to feel more comfortable in my own skin,' she says. As . for the liposuction - doctors removed five pounds of fat from her . stomach and her sides - she says, 'Well, it just needed that.' She . says she's not done with her surgery yet - she'll need laser . surgery on the scars on the underside of her breast where New York . plastic surgeon Dr Matthew Shulman inserted the silicone implants. Leathers says Weiner always discouraged her whenever she talked him about getting a boob job. 'But I feel like secretly, he’d love it,' she said. 'Because he's a pervert.' She wouldn't talk about how she paid for the surgeries, but a crew from Inside Edition exclusively filmed the transformation from start to finish and unveiled her new look today. The entire package was valued at $40,000. She says that the surgery 'wasn't a big deal', despite undergoing three procedures at once. However, she conceded she didn't tell anyone in her family before she went under the knife - except her brother who was there for support. Notice the difference? Leathers said the angioplasty she received left her with a 'cuter' nose. She is seen before the surgery, left, and after, right . Leathers said she had always wanted a bigger bust and to have the bump on her nose removed - and she got it, thanks to Anthony Weiner . Under the bright lights: Leathers chose to star in an XXX-movie before her plastic surgery . After: Sydney Leathers has had multiple surgeries done - including breast implants, liposuction, a nose job and dental work . She especially made sure to keep the news from her father. 'He always used to tell me, ""You don’t need that stuff, you’re beautiful the way you are."" Maybe I didn’t want him to talk me out of it,' she said. Leathers says neither her fame nor her new body has her - despite plucking her from her home in southern Indiana. 'I'm the same, just with bigger boobs and a cuter nose now,' she said. Her surgery is the latest in a long line of publicity stunts since she was revealed as Weiner's latest online mistress. Following the HIV scare, the former political blogger became an advocate for safe sex. This came not long after she became an advocate for legalizing marijuana. Leathers said last week she regrets having unprotected intercourse in her porn debut with an actor who days earlier slept with a star diagnosed as HIV positive. Debut: Sydney Leathers porn movie where she stars alongside Xander Corvus who previously slept with a porn actress who was diagnosed as HIV positive . The man who played Weiner, Xander Corvus, had previously had sex with Cameron Bay -  a porn actress whose recent HIV diagnosis brought the porn industry to an abrupt halt. The chain of events sparked fears that Leathers may have been exposed to the virus. Leathers said: 'I feel like it's my duty to stress the importance of using condoms.' She went on to advise that condom use is important not just while making porn but if people were thinking about 'having a one night stand in real life'. She added: 'Whether your partner is a porn star or not, you could be putting yourself at risk. You don't know who all they have been with.'

"He may have been one of London's most feared gangsters, but Reggie Kray was terrified at coming face-to-face with Britain's most dangerous prisoner Charles Bronson, newly-found letters have revealed. In a note penned by the notorious East End gangster during his time at HMP Wayland, Norfolk, Kray described the prospect of a prison meeting with Bronson as 'the most frightening visit I had'. The pair were in separate jails serving lengthy sentences when Bronson requested Kray visit him in his cell at HMP Parkhurst in September 1992. Insight: The letter penned by Kray was written in 1999, around seven years after his meeting with Bronson . Kray, left, who died in 2000, described his meeting with notorious criminal Bronson, right, as 'the most frightening experience I had' Now a newly-discovered three-page handwritten letter has provided a fascinating insight into the meeting between the two fear criminals, who were surrounded by 20 prison guards when they met in Bronson's cell. In the note, addressed to an inmate known only as 'Clive', Kray admits the confrontation was the 'most frightening' prison visit he ever experienced. When Bronson - affectionately referred to as 'Charlie' throughout the letter - broke the silence by saying 'hello Reggie' the pair burst out laughing. And as he left, Bronson presented Reggie with a pair of black and white boxing gloves inscribed with his name. The gloves and letter are being auctioned with other Kray memorabilia, including a picture of Reggie with Barbara Windsor, Christmas cards and ten oil paintings he produced. A prison application letter revealed Bronson asked for Reggie to visit his cell at HMP Parkhurst on 7 September 1992, but it is not clear when the meeting occurred. Reggie wrote his letter when he passed the boxing gloves to his friend Clive on 4 October 1999, just a year before he died. These personal photographs and letters are going under the hammer at TW Gaze Auctions, in Diss, Norfolk, on November 25 and could fetch up to £3,000. Letter: Kray wrote the letter to a friend known only as 'Clive', in which he also passed on a pair of boxing gloves given to him by Bronson when they met . Auction: The letter, along with the boxing gloves and a photo album featuring a picture of Kray with Barbara Windsor, is expected to fetch up to £3,000 at auction . The lot includes a photo album with a picture of Reggie in a bow-tie sitting with a smiling Carry On and Eastenders actress Barbara Windsor. He said: 'There are various personal photographs and Christmas cards to someone called Clive. 'There are also private photos of Reggie with Barbara Windsor and several personal letters to Clive. 'We don't quite know who Clive is but from what he writes it appears they served time together.'  Other Reggie items up for grabs include 10 oil and canvas paintings valued up to £150 each. Sentence: Kray had written the insightful letter during his time at HMP Wayland, Norfolk, a year before his death . The Kray twins were sentenced to life imprisonment in 1969 with a non-parole period of 30 years for the murders of George Cornell and Jack 'The Hat' McVitie. Charles Bronson, 58, has spent most of his life behind bars and dubbed 'Britain's most violent prisoner'. The former East End bare-knuckle boxer has convictions for armed robbery, wounding with intent, wounding, criminal damage, grievous bodily harm, false imprisonment, blackmail, threats to kill. He has moved prisons 120 times and is currently in a high-security unit in HMP Wakefield.",Pair met after Bronson requested Kray visit in 1992 .
"Once the preserve of Marty McFly and sci-fi fantasies, hoverboards are set to become a reality after a developer attracted nearly half a million dollars in funding. Greg Henderson, the creator of the Hendo Hoverboard, has created a working prototype of the device which works by using electromagnets to glide an inch off the floor. The boards will currently only work over metal surfaces, so Mr Henderson is also designing the world's first hover park - similar to a conventional skate park but with an aluminium floor. Scroll down for videos . On its way: The Hendo Hoverboard is set to become a reality after a kickstarter campaign raised nearly half a million dollars in order to develop the product . The board uses four electromagnets to push against the floor, making the board float an inch off the ground, but will only work over metal surfaces - for now . Developer Greg Henderson is planning to use some of the Kickstarter money to develop the world's first hover-park which will allow people to skate around like in a conventional skatepark . However he has also vowed to develop the technology so that it works over every surface, including water, allowing people to recreate the opening sequence of Back To The Future II where Marty uses a hoverboard to escape his pursuers by skating over a lake. Mr Henderson initially went to Kickstarter looking for $250,000 to make the technology a reality, but has so far received  $437,000. The campaign finishes in December, at which point Mr Henderson and his team will begin getting the boards ready for their commercial launch in December next year. In the meantime they are currently working on their 18th prototype, a working model which uses four electromagnetic engines to float an inch off the floor and allows the staff at Arx Pax to glide across a metal half-pipe, using their bodyweight to move in any direction. Mr Henderson said: 'This is not the end, this is just the beginning of where this technology can go. 'The wheel has served us very, very well, and we're not taking the wheel head on, but there are certain places where this may be more appropriate than the wheel. 'Last month the Wikipedia entry for Hoverboard said this was a fictional device. It doesn't say that anymore.' The idea came to Mr Henderson while he was trying to find ways of building structures that can better withstand earthquakes. As part of his research, he came up with a method that uses electromagnetic fields to separate the building from the ground in the event of a disaster. That same technology, he realised, could also be put to work in a hoverboard that would allow people to glide on air. In a video released by Mr Henderson, a man is seen moving smoothly along a custom-built skate ramp on his board, which is held an inch of the ground. Ever since Michael J Fox made his getaway on a hoverboard in Back to the Future II (left), gadget fans have been dreaming of floating on their own device . Unlike the Back to the Future board, the technology requires the board to be on top of conductive materials to serve as a secondary magnetic field . Unlike the Back to the Future board, the technology requires the board to be on top of conductive materials - such as copper or aluminum -  to serve as a secondary magnetic field. The Hendo Hoverboard uses four ‘hover engines’ which emit magnetic fields that push against each other. The magnets only work as long as metal conductor is used in the surface underneath. So the board underneath the Hendo can be aluminum and copper to work, for instance. The innovation here is in the efficiency of the induction process and the ability to control the movements of the hovering objects. The system claims to be able to carry 40lbs (18kg) and has a battery that lasts for around seven minutes. Maglev trains use similar technology but laying down a track costs around £464,000 ($750,000) per metre. Mr Henderson, however, claims its technology would only cost £6,200 ($10,000) per metre of track. Mr Henderson’s 19-person company, Arx Pax, is now making the technology inside the device available to the public on crowd funding site Kickstarter. The company is hoping to raise £155,000 ($250,000) for the campaign and will sell the technology for £185 ($299) in a box it calls the Hover Engine developer kit. Buyers can take the hover tech outside of the box and put it in anything they want to hover. It can carry 40lbs (18kg) and has a battery that lasts for around seven minutes. ‘We want to see what you can do with our technology,’ the company writes on their Kickstarter page. ‘You can use it for hovering, or for applications we haven't even imagined.’ Consumers can also buy the complete Hendo hoverboard from £6,200 ($10,000). In the meantime, the group is working on something called the G-Ray, which will allow people to control the hover technology remotely using a smartphone app. Californian group Arx Pax claims its technology would cost £6,200 ($10,000) per metre of track to work .

"The wife of a semi-professional golfer who shot her ex-lover after he entered her home unannounced covered up their affair by calling him her gay friend, a police report has revealed. Mishay Simpson, 28, shot Andrew Noll, 23, in the chest after she heard him coming up the stairs in her home in Davis Islands, Florida, while her husband, Rhett Simpson, was out of town on August 19. She called 911 to report an intruder while Noll called 911 to say he had been shot - and when Simpson later spoke to investigators, she claimed Noll was a family friend who had been stalking her. Now a police report, which was released on Monday after the state attorney declined to bring any criminal charges, has revealed Simpson and Noll had an affair, the Tampa Bay Times reported. Secret life: Mishay Simpson, 28, left, had a months-long affair with Andrew Noll, 23, right, after meeting him in a gay bar earlier this year. After they broke up, she shot him when he turned up at her house unannounced . Six months before the shooting, the mother-of-one had been out with her husband at a gay club in Ybor City when she met Noll, who worked there as a bartender. She continued to see him, telling friends that he was her 'gay friend' - but his roommate told police that the pair were far more than just friends. Robert Odom said Simpson visited their apartment several times and that once he heard them having sex, according to the police report. During the affair, they took explicit photographs later found by police. Their text messages revealed Noll saying he wanted Simpson and his daughter to live with him, and Simpson responded: 'The day u change I will leave him for u.' Simpson even paid for Noll's rent on his apartment, according to the report. 'The only person in Tampa that does not know about the affair is Mishay's husband,' Odom told police. Denial: Simpson, left, said Noll, right, stalked her after they broke up. Noll recovered from the gunshot wound . Affair: Simpson, left, is married to semi-professional golfer Rhett Simpson, right, and they have a daughter . But a few weeks before the shooting, Simpson said the relationship had to end and that Noll needed to start looking after himself - and Noll apparently wasn't happy about it. Noll responded by calling her repeatedly and sending her more than 55 text messages. A week before the shooting, Simpson sought an injunction for protection against him, the Tampa Bay Times reported. The night of the shooting, Noll texted her again and Simpson responded that her husband was away and that she was going to bed - which Noll told cops he took as a hint for him to come over. But after he arrived, he set off the burglar alarm. He headed upstairs, where Simpson and her daughter were in their beds, and when Simpson heard someone coming, she grabbed a 9mm Ruger and shot as the door opened, striking him in the chest. 'When officers arrived at the scene, they found Noll lying on the second story floor of Simpson's home with a single gunshot wound to his chest,' police said in a later release. 'Noll was transported to a local hospital with non-life threatening injures.' Double life: Simpson told Noll she would leave her husband for him, according to a police report . Happier times: Simpson, pictured right with her husband and daughter, eventually ended the affair a few weeks before the shooting - but Noll bombarded her with text messages and calls and went over to her house . After the shooting, it emerged that Noll had faced multiple complaints from women for threatening behavior and even sexual assault, although none have led to criminal charges. In January, he met one of his neighbors and asked her out, but she declined, saying she had a boyfriend. He called her as many as 20 times and bombarded her with 39 text messages in which he called her a 'fat b****', according to a police report shared by the Tampa Bay Times last month. Days later, the woman's brother was staying at her apartment when Noll confronted him and a friend and threatened them, adding that he was going to have sex with the woman. The woman was granted an injunction for protection after she wrote in a court petition: 'I am in fear of losing my life... I am scared to even walk to my car.' Scene: She was home with her daughter in their house, pictured, when Noll entered and set off the alarm one night in August. She grabbed a gun and shot him as he entered through her bedroom door . In another incident in March, a woman told police Noll forced himself on her after they went on a date. But the case was dropped after the woman continued to see Noll and he showed cops texts she had sent him. In 2011, he was arrested for domestic battery after a man described as his boyfriend said Noll attacked him during an argument. But the charge was dropped after Noll attended a domestic violence diversion program. Simpson's husband Rhett Simpson is a PGA Apprentice in Palm Harbor, Florida and works at Innisbrook, A Salamander Golf & Spa Resort, according to his Facebook page.","Mishay Simpson shot Andrew Noll in the chest in her Florida home on August 19 after he walked into her bedroom unannounced .

"Guilty: Hannah Notley, 30, told an alleged rape victim it was her fault CPS has dropped the case . A policewoman was jailed yesterday after lying to bosses and an alleged rape victim that prosecutors were not going to press charges. In fact, PC Hannah Notley had not even passed the case file to the Crown Prosecution Service. Notley, who had taken on detective duties as a sexual offences-trained officer at Essex Police CID, was assigned to the case in July 2011. The alleged rapist was arrested and interviewed, and his mobile phone and computer examined. But when Notley was later asked for a progress report, she told a superior the CPS had dropped it. It was then logged on the police system as needing ‘no further action’ and Notley even told the alleged victim that prosecution lawyers had decided to drop the case, despite knowing it had never been passed to them. Yesterday, the 30-year-old, from Benfleet in Essex, broke down in tears as she was jailed for four months at Southwark Crown Court, in London, having already pleading guilty to a charge of misconduct in public office. Prosecutor Zoe Martin said: ‘She falsely informed her superiors and the victim of the case that the CPS had advised that no further action be taken against the suspect when in fact no file had been sent to the CPS, no such advice had been received.’ The court heard Notley even gave superiors the name of the CPS lawyer who had taken the decision, which was also a lie. In February last year, Notley spoke to the complainant, telling her that the CPS had dropped the case because she had reported it too late so there was no physical evidence. Miss Martin said this was a blow to the complainant, adding: ‘She was clearly upset because it implied that the decision to some extent was her fault for reporting the rape late. She failed to correct the assumption of her superiors at Essex Police that the case had been investigated and passed on to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the court heard . ‘On the evening that she was telephoned by Miss Notley to say that there was no further action, she tried to take her own life. ‘She says that because of Miss Notley’s actions, the man she states raped her is walking round the streets.’ The . matter only came to light after an independent adviser allocated to the . complainant pursued the matter and it transpired that the CPS had never . been sent the file. Notley . told the adviser she would ‘chase’ prosecutors. When she realised the . truth was coming out in April last year, she called her professional . standards department to confess. Guilty: Hannah Notley pictured at an earlier hearing . The rape allegation was re-investigated and the alleged perpetrator was charged. He is to stand trial in May. Judge . Alistair McCreath said: ‘You let down the police. You let down the . wider public, but in particular you let down the complainant. ‘You looked her in the eye and you told her things that were untrue and you knew were untrue. ‘That was a very cruel thing to do.’ Allan . Compton, defending, said Notley was depressed at the time and had had a . breakdown. She had split from her fiance weeks before their wedding, . and later suffered a miscarriage. Notley fought back tears as she entered the dock at Inner London Crown Court before pleading guilty to one count of misconduct in public office .

"Savage: Emma Hall, 21, is facing a life sentence for leading a vigilante gang who tortured and brutally killed a teenager wrongly accused of rape . A woman is facing a life sentence for leading a vigilante gang who tortured and brutally killed a teenager wrongly accused of rape. Emma Hall, 21, of Romford, showed no emotion as she was found guilty of murdering Luke Harwood, 18, at the Old Bailey. Her friends James Danby, 27, and Tony O’Toole, 30, were also convicted of murder. Mr Harwood was savagely beaten to death in May last year after an 18-year-old girl pointed him out to Hall during a chance meeting and claimed she had been raped by him two years before. She had made a complaint to police but the matter was dropped when she withdrew the allegation. Police found no evidence that a rape had taken place. The teenager and Hall were visiting friends at a house in Romford, Essex, where Mr Harwood was also staying. He was beaten up in a room and dumped on wasteland in Woodford Green, east London. Simon Denison QC, prosecuting, said: 'She told the others that he was the person she had told Hall about at the time who had raped her. 'The men, over a prolonged period of time, severely beat him up by punching and kicking him to the head, so he was bleeding heavily from his injuries and his face was terribly swollen.' Hall then drove Danby and O’Toole and Mr Harwood to a lane where he was taken to the bank of a stream and 'finished off'. False accusation: Luke Harwood was just 18 when the gang attacked and murdered him . Mr Denison said: 'They killed him by punching and kicking him and stamping on his head many, many times. 'The bones in his face were crushed.' The killers then bought petrol and set fire to their bloody clothing, before cleaning up bloodstains at the house. The following evening, Hall drove them and another man to the spot where the body had been covered with a mattress and other rubbish. Killers: James Danby and Tony O'Toole were also convicted of murder. They punched, kicked and stomped Luke Harwood to death . Billy Duggan was found guilty of perverting the course of justice . Mr Denison said: 'They had with them . knives and a pair of bolt cutters that they were intending to use to . mutilate his body to make it more difficult for him to be identified by . cutting off his fingers and removing his teeth.' But Hall had secretly tipped off police to divert guilt from herself, and officers were waiting for them when they arrived. Mr Denison told the jury: 'His murder was quite extraordinarily callous, violent and brutal.' Two years earlier, the teenage girl had claimed she was raped 'but when what she was saying was examined more closely by police, it was clear that she was not in fact saying that he had raped her', added Mr Denison. Hall and Danby were also found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and perverting justice. O’Toole was also found guilty of perverting justice and conspiracy to pervert justice along with Danby. Billy Duggan, 21, was found guilty of perverting justice and conspiracy to pervert justice. The defendants, who were all from Romford, were remanded in custody to be sentenced next week. Jovan Roberts, 28, was cleared of murder and causing grievous bodily harm with intent, and Khalid Hassan, 20, was cleared of conspiracy to pervert justice. They were discharged.

"Spencer Lacey Ganus was paid just $926.20 for her role as teenage Elsa in the wildly popular movie . Frozen actress Spencer Lacey Ganus was paid just $926.20 for her role as teenage Elsa in the wildly popular movie - despite the fact the film raked in more than $1.2 billion at the box office. The 15-year-old, who voiced Elsa in some of the early scenes, received just a one-day guaranteed payment of the measly sum, TMZ reports. This was according to her contract which was filed in a court. Ganus, who has also featured in similarly chilly films Ice Age and Happy Feet, only had a few lines in the animated blockbuster. But with the movie easily topping the billion mark, TMZ points out that her slice of the pie is a just a tiny 0.000077 per cent. Broadway actress and singer Idina Menzel - now best-known for belting out Let It Go - voiced grown-up Elsa and the role of young Elsa was played by Eva Bella. Frozen, based on Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale The Snow Queen, overtook Toy Story 3 in March to become the highest grossing animated film of all time. It grossed a record $1.2 billion at the global box office, making a huge profit on its relatively modest $150 million budget. Let It Go, performed by Idina Menzel as Elsa, has also become a chart hit in countries across the world including the US and the UK. The film sees fearless optimist Anna set off on an epic journey - teamed up with rugged mountain man Kristoff and his loyal reindeer Sven - to find her sister Elsa, whose icy powers have trapped the kingdom of Arendelle in eternal winter. Encountering Everest-like conditions, mystical trolls and a snowman named Olaf, Anna and Kristoff battle the elements in a race to save the kingdom. Spencer Lacey Ganus voiced Elsa in some of the early scenes of Frozen, when the character was a teenager . Broadway actress and singer Idina Menzel - now best-known for belting out Let It Go - voiced grown-up Elsa . Frozen was in the UK box office top 10 for more than three months and now ranks as the 10th highest grossing film in cinema history. The film won two Oscars, and its songs, penned by Broadway duo Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, topped the US Billboard 200 chart for 13 consecutive weeks. Disney has now started construction on a Frozen attraction, which will replace the Maelstrom at Epcot's Norway Pavilion, at The Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.

"Jailed: Ashleigh Loder, 25, of Devon, wasted at least 100 hours of police time by inventing the assaults . A young mother has been jailed for making two false rape claims within hours of drunkenly sleeping with a friend’s partner. Ashleigh Loder, 25, wasted at least 100 hours of police time by inventing the assaults. She first told officers she had been attacked by two strangers in an alley before changing her story to say a man she knew had forced her to have sex in her home. However the friend she had accused was able to prove his innocence because he had filmed the sexual encounter on his mobile phone. The footage showed Loder, a mother-of-two from Bideford, Devon, was a willing and active sexual participant. She was drunk on vodka and invented her story because the partner of the man with whom she’d had sex was a friend. She feared the consequences of the other woman finding out what they had done. She broadcast  her rape claims around Bideford and the man was forced to stay inside for two weeks to avoid reprisals, Exeter Crown Court  was told. Loder admitted perverting the course of justice and was jailed for six months. Judge Phillip Wassall told her: ‘The man was branded a rapist locally and it caused him considerable distress and suffered threats within the local area and lost time off work. ‘One can only imagine what it is like to be accused of a very serious crime which could carry a sentence of around six years.’ Jonathan Barnes, prosecuting, said Loder called the police on the night of December 1 and said two strangers had raped her in an alley near her home as she left for a night out. Hearing: Loder admitted perverting the course of justice and was jailed for six months at Exeter Crown Court . But forensic checks at the scene and on her clothing cast doubt on her story. Instead of admitting her lies she then created a fresh fiction, accusing her friend’s partner of rape. He was able to prove his innocence with the images of their encounter on his phone. Loder had also sent him a text with the alley rape claim, which cast doubt on her version of events. Mr . Barnes said: ‘The allegations had a considerable effect on him. They . were bandied about the area and he had to live like a recluse for two . weeks. 'Her life was a complete dream and she convinced herself she had been raped' Greg Richardson, defending . 'He lost two stone in weight through the stress and had problems sleeping.’ Greg Richardson, defending, said of Loder: ‘Her life was a complete dream and she convinced herself she had been raped. Who knows what was going on in her mind but she believed something within her had said no. 'She says the situation she got into was rock bottom. She wishes to apologise sincerely to the man.’","Ashleigh Loder, 25, jailed for six months for perverting course of justice .

"The smell of flatulence has secret health benefits - and could help stave off cancer, strokes, heart attacks and dementia, scientists have revealed. Hydrogen sulfide is one of a number of potent smelly gases produced by bacteria as it breaks down food in the gut. It is toxic in large doses but in tiny amounts it helps protect cells and fight illness, according to experts at Exeter University. When cells become stressed by disease they try to draw in enzymes to generate their own minute quantities of hydrogen sulfide. The smell of flatulence has secret health benefits - and could help in the fight against strokes, heart attacks and dementia, research has revealed (file picture) The chemical helps to preserve mitochondria, which drive energy production in blood vessel cells and regulate inflammation, and without it the cell can switch off and die. Now researchers have come up with a new compound named AP39 to assist the body in producing just the right amount of hydrogen sulfide. They believe it will help prevent or reverse mitochondrial damage, which is a key strategy in treating conditions such as stroke, heart failure, diabetes, arthritis, dementia and ageing. Professor Matt Whiteman from University of Exeter’s medical school said: 'When cells become stressed by disease, they draw in enzymes to generate minute quantities of hydrogen sulfide. 'This keeps the mitochondria ticking over and allows cells to live. If this doesn’t happen, the cells die and lose the ability to regulate survival and control inflammation. 'We have . exploited this natural process by making a compound, called AP39, which . slowly delivers very small amounts of this gas specifically to the . mitochondria. 'Our results indicate that if stressed cells are treated with AP39, mitochondria are protected and cells stay alive.' Small amounts of hydrogen sulfide could help stave off diseases such as cancer, according to experts at Exeter University . Before it can be tested on humans, researchers have run disease models to see how effective AP39 is. Early results show that it can help up to 80 per cent more mitochondria survive highly destructive conditions such as cardiovascular disease. Fellow researcher Dr. Mark Wood added: 'Although hydrogen sulfide is well known as a pungent, foul-smelling gas in rotten eggs and flatulence, it is naturally produced in the body and could in fact be a healthcare hero with significant implications for future therapies for a variety of diseases.' The study was published in the journal Medicinal Chemistry Communications.","Researchers reveal secret health benefits of smelly gas hydrogen sulfide .

"Hostels were once the crowded, dirty havens for backpackers on a budget. Rooming with 12 strangers who kept you awake with their snoring or worse, bathrooms you needed a vaccination before entering and bedsheets sure to leave you scratching for days were sacrifices made in return for a night's shelter for under a tenner. With such a bad reputation, it is no surprise that a trend for posh hostels - or 'poshtels' - is emerging. Scroll down for video . Goodbye dirty dorm rooms: The rise of the 'Poshtel' sees the humble hostel getting a stylish makeover. Pictured: Casa Gracia in Spain .

"It was the day after a wretched night before and Brendan Rodgers, still grappling with Liverpool's Champions League defeat in Basle, was talking strikers. Given that Mario Balotelli had been anonymous for most of the game in Switzerland and Daniel Sturridge was still injured, Rodgers had been asked whether Liverpool had made sufficient moves during the transfer window just gone to cover Luis Suarez's departure. In a flash, he provided an answer that offered a tantalising glimpse of what the future might hold. Divock Origi has started this season well for Lille, including scoring a penalty against Wolfsburg . Luis Suarez was the Premier League's best player last season and Liverpool have struggled to replace him . With Daniel Sturridge out injured, Brendan Rodgers' side have struggled to find their best form . Divock Origi is doing better than Liverpool's four other strikers. He has scored four goals in nine club matches this season. Daniel Sturridge scored once in his three matches before his injury . Mario Balotelli has also found the net once in eight Liverpool matches (he has picked up two yellow cards, however) Rickie Lambert has not scored in eight appearances . Fabio Borini has no goals in three matches . Liverpool spent close to £110million in the summer and it is the £9m they handed over to Lille for Divock Origi which Rodgers believes could be the finest investment. 'There are very few players who can replace Suarez,' Rodgers explained. 'Actually there are no players who can replace Suarez. When you look at the availability of other players during the summer, it was something that was difficult for us. 'It's no good now I know but we took a player in Divock Origi who we believe will be world class and we'll get him in the summer. Now he is a top player. He has everything: the speed, the profile and so on and he (could) play (for Liverpool) now.' Origi has always been highly-regarded, as one story from his youth shows. When he was a 13-year-old, his first club Genk had taken all their age-group squads to the Belgian coast for pre-season training and on the last night, they had a 'keepie-up' challenge. Divock Origi shot to fame with his goal at the World Cup, but Liverpool were interested before that . Origi is a key member of Belgium's next generation of talent and Rodgers believes he can be world class . Players were invited on to stage to show off their skills, with some players doing 30, others doing 70. When it came to Origi, he did a remarkable 1,500. Those close to him say he likes to play the game 'beautifully' and enjoys pulling off technical tricks. 'Our deal was that we couldn't bring him in now,' Rodgers continued. 'That was unfortunate because he can run in behind (the defence), he can keep the ball, he can press and he can run but that (Origi staying with Lille) was part of the deal.' There is no chance Origi will be allowed to come to Anfield in January but it is clear that Rodgers is already counting down the days until he gets to start working on a day-to-day basis with a 19-year-old who shot to prominence during the World Cup. The young Belgian rose to prominence in Brazil, where injuries and form led to him starting twice for Belgium . Liverpool had been working quietly on a deal to sign him long before he scored against Russia. The wheels of his switch to Merseyside had already started rolling and the move was not a reaction to that moment of magic in the footballing cathedral the Maracana. Of all the deals Liverpool concluded during a frantic three-month period, the ones that were met with most satisfaction involved Origi and Emre Can, as they illustrate what the club under Fenway Sports Group are aiming to promote. The idea is to buy outstanding young talent at a reasonable price and use Rodgers' ability on the coaching field to transform them into genuine world class players. An ankle injury has prevented Can from showing what he can do so far, while Origi is across the Channel. Emre Can is another of Liverpool's young recruits who has not yet made an impact but suits the philosophy . Origi is with the Belgium squad ahead of their fixtures with Andorra and Bosnia this week . But while he is out of sight, he is not out of mind. Liverpool are closely monitoring his progress – he has scored three goals in Ligue 1 and one in the Europa League this season, helping Lille get off to a solid start – and Rodgers, Origi has revealed, is in constant contact. 'Sometimes Brendan sends me some messages and sometimes people from Liverpool come and visit me in Lille,' said Origi. 'It's good to know they are following my progress. Things are going well but there's still some room for improvement. 'I'm still working hard trying to prepare myself for a higher level. I'm feeling good and ready to continue this form. Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert have failed to hit their stride since arriving at Anfield this summer . Origi is keen to arrive at his parent club next summer, as Liverpool hope to develop him into a top player . 'It's a new era at Liverpool and everything will go well. They have a fantastic team. It's only positive and I don't think we have to worry about Liverpool.' Rodgers may have caused eyebrows to raise amongst some Liverpool supporters when he admitted that his side have been 'unrecognisable' from the swashbuckling group of last season and that a period of transition beckons. One thing that he cannot be accused of lacking, however, is a vision and the arrival of Origi is something he believes will accelerate this group even further. Where this particular player is concerned, the end of the current season cannot come quick enough for Liverpool.","Brendan Rodgers says young striker Divock Origi can be 'world class'

"Putin at the Paralympics: Russia's leader warned giving oligarchs power in Ukraine risked the perception of rewarding wealth with power . Ukraine has drafted in its super-rich oligarchs to stop the Kremlin stirring up dissent in the Russian-speaking east of the country. Billionaires have been appointed as governors in the key industrial heartland in a bid to prevent a Crimean-style takeover by Russian leader Vladimir Putin. It is hoped that their influence and self-interest in preventing further conflict could help curb separatist tensions among pro-Russian activists in the region. But the move to conscript tycoons is seen as high-risk – and Putin has already warned that citizens will see it as the super-wealthy being rewarded with power after making their fortunes in skewed privatisation deals. Ukraine’s fledgling government named Ihor Kolomoisky, a metals, banking and media baron worth £1.5billion, as governor of his native region Dnipropetrovsk. Bearded Kolomoisky – seen as having built his wealth as a friend of ex-premier Yulia Tymoshenko – views his duty as quelling unrest by Russian agents seeking to destabilise and break up Ukraine. ‘I hope that my presence in the region will help cool the few hotheads that are present here and stabilise the situation, to bring calm so that the citizens of Ukraine living in the Dnipropetrovsk region would feel safe,’ he said. On the prospect of Russian troops in eastern Ukraine, he admitted: ‘We do have those concerns.’ Serhiy Taruta, the country’s 16th-richest man, was put in charge of the strategic coal mining region of Donetsk, where rebels raised the Russian tricolour this week. He said he took the job because Ukraine faced ‘dangerous times’. Well connected: Yulia Tymoshenko, Ukraine's ex-premier, under whose patronage Ihor Kolomoisky, a billionaire now appointed as governor of his native region Dnipropetrovsk, is seen as having made his fortune . But the Kremlin says the moguls will use their positions to further their fortunes. Putin said: ‘No wonder people do not accept this... people have become rich and now they also have been brought to power.’ The move comes after Putin and Kolomoisky exchanged angry words this week. The Russian president called the tycoon a ‘unique swindler’, while Kolomoisky dubbed Putin a ‘pint-sized schizophrenic’ saying his ‘messiah-like’ rebuilding of a Russian empire would ‘lead this world to catastrophe’. Former US ambassador John Edward Herbst said the oligarchs were showing their commitment to an ‘independent, sovereign and territorially integrated Ukraine’.","Kremlin says the moguls will abuse their positions to further their fortunes .

"A thief who stole a teenager’s first car unwittingly helped bring down his insurance costs - by scoring a perfect ten out of ten on the vehicle’s ‘black box’ safety system. Alex Cooper, 17, was left distraught when his prized £13,000 Vauxhall Corsa was taken from outside the skip hire company in Oldham, Greater Manchester, where he works. But the teenager, who had a ‘black box’ unit installed to reduce his insurance costs by analysing his driving, was able to track down the vehicle using the system’s Global Positioning System feature. Recovered: Alex Cooper, 17, and his mother Kimberley, 43, with their £13,000 Vauxhall Corsa, which was stolen from outside the skip hire company in Oldham, Greater Manchester, where the boy works . The unit works like a plane’s black box flight recorder - measuring speed, acceleration, smoothness and control, before giving a score for each journey. Alex found his limited-edition Corsa in nearby Shaw, Oldham, three hours after it was taken - and it later emerged the thief had scored a perfect ten out of ten for safe driving before ditching it. Alex, from Moorside, Oldham, only managed 7.9 on the way to work. The unit, which allows Alex to monitor his performance via a phone app, means he can earn cashback for good driving. His insurance firm Carrot said he would be allowed to keep the thief’s score on his record. Alex said: ‘I found it quite funny that he drove better than me.’ Found: The teenager had a 'telematics' unit installed to reduce his insurance costs by analysing his driving, and was able to track down the vehicle using the system's Global Positioning System feature . Alex only passed his test in February and it costs him around £2,400 a year for insurance on the Corsa, which is owned by his mother Kimberley, 43, a hairdresser. They were able to find out from the black box's GPS feature that the car was stolen at 10.55am on May 8 and abandoned around four miles away later that day at 11.12am - 17 minutes later. 'I found it quite funny that he drove better than me' Alex Cooper . The Corsa, which had its passenger window smashed and ignition tampered with, was left with an estimated repair bill of around £2,000. His mother said: ‘We were absolutely mortified, it’s our pride and joy. But we laughed when we found it had been driven so carefully. We can only think they’ve driven like that to not arouse suspicion.’ A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said that no arrests had been made over the theft. Monitoring: Alex's insurers Carrot said he would be allowed to keep the thief's score on his record . Black box-style systems have already been fitted in many vehicles to monitor the number of journeys made, the time of day and driving behaviour such as speed and braking. The technology, known as telematics, will have to be included as standard to all new cars under EU regulations from October next year to help emergency services find crashed vehicles. Insurers have urged motorists with older vehicles to fit them voluntarily because they make premiums cheaper for safer drivers. Experts say around half of all cars will have the monitoring equipment by 2020. Drivers are scored on a range of behaviours, and receive money back on their insurance if they drive safely. Estimates suggest that young drivers should see their annual premiums fall by 20 per cent. An analysis of 10,000 young driver claims by the Co-operative Insurance in 2012 also  suggested that those with telematics insurance are 20 per cent less likely to have a car crash than those with standard insurance. They also tend to be involved in less serious road accidents, as the cost of a typical insurance claim from a customer with the box is 30 per cent less than from a customer without.","Alex Cooper's £13,000 Vauxhall Corsa taken from outside his workplace .

He continued: 'No, absolutely I'm not taking this fight lightly because I know his hunger and he's young and he wants to win the fight, but I will not let that happen. 'I'm not thinking about the knock-out because it will make me confident and careless. 'If the knock-out comes it will come but my focus is to make sure that 100-per-cent condition and killer instinct is there, the aggressiveness is there, so that's my focus in training.' The Filipino fighter insisted he was focused on Algieri and will switch attention to Mayweather after the bout .

"Southampton want to offer Jay Rodriguez a new contract in an attempt to keep him from Tottenham's clutches. The England striker is a target for Mauricio Pochettino when the transfer window reopens in January. Rodriguez's current deal expires at the end of the 2015/16 season, but the Saints - despite the fact he hasn't played since April due to a serious knee injury - want to extend his stay at St Mary's. Jay Rodriguez is set to be offered a new contract as Mauricio Pochettino targets the striker for Tottenham . Rodriguez hasn't played since April due to a serious knee injury but Saints want to extend his deal . Pochettino has made the former Burnley man one of his priority signings in the New Year.

"Would the average M&S woman buy a kimono? Would its 50-something customer ever, voluntarily, try on a crop top? These two things are what M&S’s new style supremo Belinda Earl is banking on. And she launched her vision for the women of Middle England yesterday in grand style, with the unveiling of her collection for spring/summer 2014. Floodlights illuminated a honey-stoned former church in London’s Regent’s Park, while handpicked members of the fashion press were served elegant trays of canapes and prosecco on tap. There was even a goodie bag containing an Italian vase. Would the average M&S woman buy a kimono? Would its 50-something customer ever, voluntarily, try on a crop top? Liz Jones gives her brutally honest opinion on M&S's new drop . You can’t say Earl’s not trying. And while you’d think she’d be pouring sweat given that womenswear sales dropped, again, in the three months until September, she oozed calm. ‘I’m not losing sleep,’ she told me. ‘Yes, I’ve been surprised at the attention on me since I joined M&S, but it’s a public company. Everyone has an opinion about us.’ She was keen, though, to distance herself from the humourless, much derided Leading Ladies autumn ad campaign, featuring Tracey Emin, Helen Mirren et al, stressing that she has no input into the marketing of her critically, if not commercially, well-received clothes. So, is the M&S CEO Marc Bolland insisting Earl work five days a week, not her usual three? ‘No, definitely not. But my smartphone is always vibrating.’ Is she at least beginning to achieve what she set out to do, having been in the hot seat for more than a year? (She joined M&S, after heading up Debenhams and Jaeger, in September 2012.) Designer: I think this ensemble is very Alexander McQueen - and you can do up the coat to make it look less 'fashion' if you like (Limited Edition trench, £79, white collarless shirt, £22.50, black skirt, £29, and black sandals with block heels, £29.50) Flattering: This tuxedo waistcoat is slimming and could be worn over anything - but I worry the top is too revealing (Limited Edition Collection tuxedo waistcoat, £59, top £35, trousers £39.50, shoes £49.50 and leather tote £79) Limited edition: This best of British collection is pricey and only a few hundred of each piece will be produced (soft wool cocoon coat £249, top, £69, and skirt, £79) Soft leathers: These buttery soft leather pieces will be instant sell-outs, but they will snapped up only by the fashion pack (£249, leather pencil skirt, £149, collarless shirt £39.50, and red shoes £99) ‘Absolutely,’ she said. ‘As promised, we are rolling out a more spacious shop floor design across the country, training staff to be more confident about offering styling advice and we have a welcome zone in each store, with mannequins displaying key trends.’ I wonder if she isn’t galled that even in the weeks after the collapse of the garment factory in Bangladesh, other stores saw sales soar, while M&S, which has a policy of never using factories more than two storeys high, has seen them plummet? ‘It’s frustrating, but we’re not going to abandon our ethical stance: that is what customers expect from us,’ said Earl. Surely, though, she has made some mistakes, such as offering too many lines and, more importantly, introducing sky-high prices (a British wool pea coat for winter is £349, while a small pink leather satchel is £299!). Liz's favourite: This is the best dress I've seen in years: Short sleeves, ruching to cover the tummy and a gorgeous mesh overlay fabric (M&S Collection lace mesh overlay dress, £45, clutch, £25, and shoes £19.50) Think pink: I like a soft leather T-shirt and these cotton cigarette are are cut well but the colour's rather garish (Per Una Speziale top, £169, trousers, £59, and shoes £29.50) But yesterday Earl refused to admit she might not be on the right path: ‘Women want real choice, newness. And that pea coat sold extremely well, by the way.’ Ah, but what about Marc Bolland’s comment last week in response to certain must-haves, such as the notorious powder blue coat, selling out, saying key pieces were ‘carefully managed’ so as not to become ubiquitous? Earl then lapsed into marketing speak: ‘It’s all about potentialising it. It’s not our purpose to restrict [a garment], but about creating a tension, a balance.’ My big worry is that M&S’s new collection is all too high fashion. I mean short, swishy skater  skirts. M&S, you cannot be serious! She pooh-poohed, too, claims that M&S’s regional stores are still the poor relation to those in the big cities. ‘You can buy every piece online and have it delivered to your home or your nearest store. There is no problem,’ she said. And herein lies the rub. While the spring collection is gorgeous, with so many pieces reminding me of designers such as Jil Sander, Helmut Lang, hell, even Alexander McQueen, I wonder that the core customer might feel sidelined — women who don’t own a computer, much less shop online. Much I saw yesterday will undoubtedly garner glowing plaudits in the fashion press: a cutaway McQueen-style black trench, cream tuxedo waistcoat, pink leather biker with chunky ribbed sleeves, pencil skirts in sky blue or lemon (guaranteed to sell out in days, despite the £149 price tag),  cream waffle skirt, chunky knits, sweatshirts, a lemon dress in mesh with ruching at the tummy. And the shoes have improved ten-fold: silver, pointy stilettos, black sandals with block heels.M&S’s Best Of British range, which is rather preppy, features gorgeous cropped black trousers, a tweedy summer coat (£249) you could wear to the smartest of weddings and silk shirts. This outfit belongs in Zara: The skater skirt comes straight from the Eighties while the peach jacket it too boxy. (M&S Collection jacket, £79, top, £22.50, and skirt £39.50. The leather bag, £99, and two-tone pumps £25, will be wardrobe staples for years) No-go: Oh dear, Twiggy might look lovely in this kimono jacket and wide culottes, but those of us who are more branch-like will feel very wide indeed (Twiggy for M&S Collection kimono jacket £69, Per Una culottes, £45 and shoes, £29.50) God is in the details: silk linings, extra-long zips, classy gold metallic labels. But, but, BUT! My big worry is that M&S’s new collection is all too high fashion. I mean short, swishy skater  skirts. M&S, you cannot be serious! Crop tops that will show off your tummy and cropped trousers that suit only those with the legs of a flamingo. Trendy sandals, with a wide ankle strap, that only shorten the leg. While its silk kimono blouse is lovely and could be worn by a woman of any age, the kimono wrap jacket is too bulky. Yes, there is a gorgeous metallic, spaghetti-strapped slip dress on sale, but only those with Kate Moss’s body could possibly pull it off. The new white voluminous skirts with sheer stripes feel very Topshop — which is exactly where they belong. Of course, it all appeals to skinny fashionistas like me, but we are not the core customer. I doubt, too, there are enough of us to keep M&S shareholders happy. So if this spring/summer collection, which hits stores in January, doesn’t lift sales of clothing, will Belinda be out on her ear? She laughed when I said this. ‘No. I’m very confident. This is a journey.’  But the thing is that fashion moves so swiftly and the M&S customer’s patience is notoriously so thin that time may be running out. If I were in Belinda’s shoes, I’d be working seven days a week and putting my phone on Loud… .",Liz worries that the SS14 range is too high fashion .
"Senior Tories must publish details of their ‘secret trysts’ with foreign billionaires and party donors, the former head of Britain’s sleaze watchdog warned last night. Sir Alistair Graham said revelations about senior ministers mingling with Russian oligarchs, hedge fund billionaires and lobbyists at private Tory fundraising dinners were having a ‘corrosive effect’ on public trust. Sir Alistair, former chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, said the issue was a problem for all three parties. The Prime Minister was under fire yesterday after the guest list for a £12,000-a-table Tory party was leaked to the media. Under fire: Among the guests at one of last year's heavily-criticised events was Tatiana Borodin and her Russian banker husband Andrey . It revealed that Mr Cameron, his wife Samantha, and a string of other senior Tories, including Boris Johnson, Theresa May and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, entertained an exotic array of foreign plutocrats, hedge fund managers and lobbyists in return for cash. And last night it emerged that Ed Miliband is to host his own Labour fundraising gala, where ‘premium’ tables will cost £15,000 each. The Prime Minister yesterday dismissed critics of the party’s reliance on wealthy donors, saying it was better than Labour’s reliance on the unions. Last night Mr Cameron hosted another lavish summer party for wealthy supporters at London’s exclusive Hurlingham Club. The Conservative Party refused to publish the guest list. Under fire: David Cameron, who has been criticised for the fundraiser, pictured arriving with his wife Samantha last year . Sir Alistair urged Mr Cameron and other party leaders to come clean. ‘These events have a corrosive effect on public trust because there is no transparency,’ he said. ‘We have no idea who is lobbying who or what is being discussed – the public is completely cut out. ‘If ministers held meetings with these people in their offices, they would have to publish the details. But we know nothing about these secret trysts unless there is some kind of leak. It is unacceptable. ‘It is perfectly legitimate for parties to seek donations, but it must be transparent – not done on the back of giving access to cabinet ministers. ‘In my experience people don’t pay substantial amounts of money unless they have got an agenda of some sort. It’s a problem for all the main parties.’ The new revelations cast fresh light on the way the Conservatives are generating a huge war chest to fight the next election. Fundraisers have been ordered to raise a staggering £100,000 a day to build an election machine to crush Mr Miliband. Sources say this inevitably means asking wealthy individuals to reach for their chequebooks. The Daily Mail revealed this year that the Conservatives rely heavily on a group of about 70 major donors who pay a minimum of £50,000 a year each to be members of Mr Cameron’s elite ‘Leader’s Group’. In return, they are invited to regular dinners, lunches and cocktail parties with Mr Cameron and other senior ministers. Members of the group have given a staggering £43million to the party since records began in 2001. But the Tories also host numerous other fundraising dinners. The leaked dinner plan contains details of an event held last summer in the City. Guests included six billionaires and 15 others with fortunes worth more than £100million. There were 73 financiers, 47 retail and property tycoons, ten people in oil, gas and mining and 19 working in lobbying and PR. Manor house: David Cameron hosted another event at the Hurlingham Private Members Club in Fulham, London . In an extraordinary move, some guests were placed on tables with senior ministers responsible for their area of commercial activity. Criticism: Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said the 'trysts' were having a 'corrosive effect' on public life . There is no suggestion of wrongdoing – and no evidence that any guests or ministers discussed areas of mutual interest. But the mere fact that ministers and wealthy businessmen are able to hold private talks away from the public gaze concerns some campaigners. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, for example, was seated with Greek shipping magnate Constantine Logothetis. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, who has responsibility for planning, was seated with controversial Russian-born businessman Alexander Temerko, whose firm builds off-shore windfarms. Labour said many of the foreign guests appeared to own mansions in the UK and were likely to be hit by Labour and Lib Dem plans for a mansion tax. A Tory spokesman last night said  all donations were in accordance with the law. But campaigners say a wide-ranging clean-up of party funding is needed. Alexandra Runswick, of Unlock Democracy, said: ‘Whether it is party donors given seats in the House of Lords or people buying dinner with David Cameron, the public feels our politics are for sale – that politicians listen to donors and lobbyists but not voters.’ Ed Miliband has claimed to be reducing his party's financial reliance on the unions . Labour faces its own questions over its financial dependence  on the unions and claims that  they have been allowed to dictate party policy. Funding from the union paymasters accounts for three-quarters of large donations raised by the party. Leader Ed Miliband has claimed to be reducing his party’s financial reliance on unions, but critics have accused him of increasingly writing party policy from union demands. In May, Unite made its biggest donation since Mr Miliband became leader (£1.8million) just days after Labour unveiled plans to cap private rents – a policy long demanded by the union. And only this week, Unite announced it would bankroll its election campaign – with Unite boss ‘Red Len’ McCluskey telling Mr Miliband to ‘bring home the bacon’ for his members as he pledged £12million at a speech to members in Liverpool on Monday. At the same time, Unite members began to vote for a ‘wish list’ of policies – including higher taxes, more public spending, and the repeal of all trade union laws passed in the past three decades. Unite have already donated more than £12million to Labour since Mr Miliband beat his brother, David, to become leader with its support. Mr McCluskey said: ‘Unite stands fully behind Labour and Ed Miliband in the increasingly radical agenda he has outlined. Have conviction, Ed. Ignore the personal stuff, it is trivial nonsense.’ Mr McCluskey, whose union became embroiled in the Falkirk vote rigging scandal, also boasted of its influence in selecting Labour candidates to stand as MPs, saying there were ‘more union-backed candidates than for a generation’. Figures from the Electoral Commission show that 75 per cent of donations to Labour in the first quarter of this year came from unions. The Lib Dems, meanwhile, are facing a possible police probe into ‘cash-for-honours’ allegations. Last month it emerged that the party’s three biggest donors – who have provided two-fifths of the party’s donations – were given peerages by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. The three Lords – Ministry of Sound magnate James Palumbo, Domino’s Pizza founder Rumi Verjee and clothes tycoon Raj Loomba – donated about £600,000 between them. Police are reviewing the evidence before deciding whether to mount an investigation. The Lib Dems want public funding for political parties to end the need to raise cash. Labour is sympathetic to the idea, but it has been rejected by the Conservatives, who say voters would not accept paying for political parties through their taxes.","Sir Alistair Graham said revelations had a 'corrosive effect' on public trust .

"France has seen a sharp rise in the number of people being hospitalised for alcohol-related conditions. Around 400,000 people out of a population of 65 million are admitted to French hospitals every year for conditions like comas, hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, a rise of 30 per cent compared with three years ago. In addition, short term hospital admissions for binge drinking symptoms are up by a staggering 80per cent. Worrying trend: France has seen a 30 per cent rise in  the number of hospital admissions for conditions like comas, hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, in just three years . Despite being one of the world's key . producers of wine and spirits, the French are often perceived to have a . healthy attitude towards alcohol with most drinking done at mealtimes . and rarely to excess. According to the French Society for Alcohol abuse hospital admissions for drink related diseases , particularly amongst young people, are now twice as numerous as those for common complains like diabetes or cardio vascular disease. ‘We are seeing more and more young people arriving at accident and emergency clinics in drunken states who remain in hospital for one or two days to be sobered up. We are also seeing young patients whose health is already seriously affected due to pancreas or liver diseases like cirrhosis which previously did not show  until much later in life’, said Dr Damien Labarrière, a specialist based in Orleans in a radio interview. Professor Michel Reynaud, addiction . specialist in the Paris area, co author of the report, added that young . French women are turning more and more to binge drinking in order to . show off to their friends. ‘It is particularly worrying that large numbers of young girls see getting drunk as a form of glory’ he said. ‘This . is a health emergency. We have no longer government money to cope with . this problem. When one considers the rising scale of it it is hard to . see how it can be stopped’, he said. Despite being one of the world's key producers of wine and spirits, the . French are often perceived to have a healthy attitude towards alcohol . with most drinking done at mealtimes and rarely to excess . Professor . Reynaud blamed the ‘banalisation ‘of alcohol for the Gallic rise of . binge-drinking and legalisation of Internet advertising for drink. ‘Social networks have democratised consumption of alcohol and proclaimed drunkeness as a status symbol’, he said. ‘Le Binge-drinking’ has now become a familiar expression in the French language and many blame the UK for its rise in France. Hortense Dormoy a journalist for women’s magazine Marie-Claire described binge-drinking as consuming alcohol ‘over a short period of time to reach a drunken state and complete loss of control’ and ‘drinking six glasses or more for men and five or more for women’. She claimed the phenomenon ‘originated from England where young people take advantage of “happy hours” to drink as much as possible in as short a time’. The magazine revealed that 2.3 per cent of French  17-year-olds had recourse to bingeing at least ten times a month. Paradoxically  alcohol consumption over the past 50 years has actually declined by 50 per cent  in the country which is the world’s number one tourist destination and produces champagne, cognac and some of the finest wines on the planet, alcohol in  France still remains a prolific serial killer due to ‘le binge-drinking’. Figures for 2009 revealed this month  that drinking killed 49,000 people in France of whom 40 per cent were under the age of 65. Short term hospital admissions for binge drinking symptoms were up by a staggering 80per cent, Many French believe British culture is to blame for this worrying trend . 36,500 of the French victims were men with alcohol accounting for 13 per cent of total male deaths and 12,500 were women representing 5 per cent of female deaths. The 13 per cent of total male deaths  due to alcohol abuse compares with 5 per cent in Switzerland , 3 per cent in Italy and 1 per cent in Denmark. The 5per cent French female deaths due to drinking  are  also higher than Italy (2per cent) and Denmark (1per cent). ‘Alcohol is a major cause of premature death being responsible for 22 per cent of deaths in the 15 to 34 age group, 18 per cent between 35 and 64 and 7 per cent of people over 65. Deaths due alcohol are caused mainly by cancer and heart disease ‘, statistics  revealed. In France scientific tests on rats revealed that young rodents fed large doses of alcohol became twice as likely to become dependent on drink when they reached maturity. Leading researcher Mickael Naassila revealed that ‘We noticed that the animals literally lost control of their alcohol intake and were able to consume between 5 and 6 grammes perkilo of their weight, which is a huge amount’.","Short term admissions for binge drinking symptoms up 80% .

"Actor Warren Clarke, known for his role in TV drama Dalziel And Pascoe, died today at the age of 67. Warren Clarke's gruff northern accent was familiar to millions who watched him play the taciturn Superintendent Andy Dalziel in the popular BBC drama. The Oldham-born actor played the surly police officer for 61 episodes, providing the yin to the yang provided by Colin Buchanan's Peter Pascoe. But his career spanned several decades on stage, television and film, ranging from Cold War dramas to comedy and even playing Winston Churchill in the West End. The star, who also appeared in films such as Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, is said to have died after a 'short illness'. Scroll down for video . Actor Warren Clarke, known for his role in TV drama Dalziel And Pascoe, died today at the age of 67. Pictured right with co-star Colin Buchanan . Born into a poor Lancashire family, he worked hard to achieve fame, telling the Daily Mail in 2011 that he was a 'lucky b******', adding: 'Although I've worked nearly 50 years for this, through the tough times as well as the good times.' Clarke was raised by his secretary mother and stained-glass window maker in a council house. They died within a year of one another when Warren was in his 20s, leaving him and his sister Beryl, who is 11 years older, a ‘bunch of photographs and happy memories'. He was conceived when his father returned from the War. He wanted to be a footballer until his passion for acting kicked in. ‘When I told my parents what I was going to do, they said, “Good luck, son.” He told the paper that before one television series, 1989's Nice Work, he had to ask friends for money and his wife Michelle had to sell her engagement ring to buy food. His first big-screen appearance could have led to stardom but was affected by factors out of his control. A twenty-something Clarke appeared alongside Malcolm McDowell as Dim, a half-witted yet violently evil 'droog' in Stanley Kubrick's controversial 1971 dystopian masterpiece A Clockwork Orange, based on Anthony Burgess's novel. After several court cases implicated the film's brutal violence, including the murder of a tramp in an underpass by a gang featuring McDowell and Clarke's characters, Kubrick withdrew the film from cinemas and it remained rarely shown until its re-release following his death in 1999. With appearances in Coronation Street and the Avengers already under his belt Clarke went on to appear in numerous television series and films in a wide variety of roles. Warren Clarke (left) as a thuggish droog in A Clockwork Orange with Malcolm McDowell (right) Oldham-born Clarke was also known for his starring role in BBC series Down To Earth alongside Pauline Quirke, about a family who leave the rat race to relocate to rural Devon . They included a Russian dissident opposite Clint Eastwood in 1982 Cold War thriller Firefox, a violent football hooligan in 1995's British cult classic ID, and a nouveau-riche, pig-obsessed northern Regency industrialist opposite Rowan Atkinson and Miranda Richardson in Blackadder the Third in 1987. This appearance spawned some of his best-loved lines, flattering his daughter (Richardson) by telling Blackadder: 'I'd no more place her in the hands of an unworthy man than I'd place my John Thomas in the hands of a lunatic with a pair of scissors' and 'I love her more than any pig, and that's saying summat'. Other brief television appearances included Lovejoy, All Creatures Great and Small and The Onedin Line. He was was also known for his starring role in BBC series Down To Earth, about a family who leave the rat race to relocate to rural Devon. Clarke with his wife, Michelle, the mother of his daughter Georgia who he met 30 years ago . But it was Dalziel and Pascoe which made him a household name. He starred as the ageing, gritty detective in the TV adaptation of Reginald Hill's stories about the chalk-and-cheese colleagues for 12 series from 1996 until its conclusion in 2007. Other notable programmes have included the BBC adaptation of Bleak House nine years ago and Channel 4's Red Riding trilogy in 2009. His death was announced by the agency which handled his career, Independent Talent Group. A statement issued on behalf of his agent said: 'The actor Warren Clarke died peacefully in his sleep on November 12 2014, after a short illness. 'He will be greatly missed by his family and loved ones. At this time we ask that you respect their privacy in their time of grief.' Warren Clarke with daughter Georgia Mabel on the Carribean Island of Barbados, and right, on the Alan Titchmarsh Show . Clarke’s marriage to his first wife and the mother of his son, Rowan, ended a few years after his parents died. He said: ‘Not being there with Rowan (who was 10 at the time) was tough. Nobody has an easy time with divorce. You don’t like what’s happening but you have to get on with it. But I’ve got a happy marriage now.’ Warren met Michelle through friends 30 years ago. They tried for a baby for 20 years and had pretty much given up hope when Michele became pregnant with Georgia. ‘When I thought it would never happen, it did, then I thought, “Oh my God, I’m old enough to be a grandfather"",' he said.

Emmerdale actor John Bowe, who has acted alongside him, said: 'Safe journey, Warren. And no arguments on the way.' Writer and broadcaster Tony Parsons said: 'Warren Clarke was wonderful for 40 years - from Dalziel And Pascoe all the way back to Dim in Clockwork Orange.' Clarke was a lifelong Manchester City fan and his death was mourned by the club. City's official Twitter feed included a message which read: 'Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Warren Clarke following sad news of the actor and MCFC fan's passing.'

"A New Yorker has entered the Guinness Book of Records after collecting 750 pizza boxes from around the world. Scott Weiner is so obsessed by his favourite dinner that he is a professional pizza tour guide, taking visitors to New York to interesting and unusual restaurants. However, despite his love of pizza, he has rationed himself to just 15 slices a week. Scott Weiner has more than 750 Pizza boxes from around the world stored in his Brooklyn apartment . Scott Weiner, pictured, paid $200 for the world's largest pizza box measuring a staggering 54 inches square . As part of his quest, Weiner has collected boxes from 45 different countries over the past 15 years. One of his boxes was signed by tattoo artist Ed Hardy. The 32-year-old from Brooklyn developed his strange addiction while touring with his band. As well as 'Scott's Pizza Tours', Weiner has written a book on the history of Pizza boxes. I bet you can't top that - a man has spent a whole lot of dough after amassing the World's biggest pizza box collection. Pizza fan, Scott Weiner, 32, has spent around 15 years building up his collection and now owns more than 750 boxes including some of the rarest boxes from around the world. Weiner stores his collection in a cupboard inside his Brooklyn, some of which are from Brazil, Italy, Israel and India. He found one box featuring the Simpsons inside an Amsterdam bin. He also paid $200 for a 54 square inch box with is understood to be the world's largest. Weiner, pictured, has pizza boxes from 45 different countries including  India, Italy and even Israel . Weiner, pictured, helps spread his obsession with his company 'Scott's Pizza Tours' Weiner's achievement has been recognised by Guinness World Records who gave him a certificate . He said: ' I started collecting physical boxes in 2009, my first box was a Roma Foods ""Tour of Italy"" series Volume 3: Florence. 'I never thought there would be so much variation until I saw a yellow and blue box in Israel, boxes in New York and New Jersey are white with red printing and the Israeli box was just so completely different I was intrigued. 'It was when I saw that there was a series of boxes from a food distributor, I knew it was something possible to collect. 'I was exposed to different pizzerias while on tour with my band in the early 2000s, when I came home to New Jersey I would take my friends to different pizzerias and tell them about the ovens and their history. 'I've got lots of great boxes, some from Brazil transform into toys like puzzles and model airplanes, while most of them are rare because they're printed then they become garbage. Weiner said he is planning to travel to London, England, for a special exhibition featuring his best pizza boxes . 'One is a limited edition box from a place in Niagara Falls, it was their 50th anniversary box and the owner mailed me one and I have another that is signed by Ed Hardy, the tattoo artist, who designed the art on the box. 'I even have one from India that is newer but it has amazing steam vents so that the pizza won't get soggy. 'But I adore one unlicensed Simpsons box because it's rare and I remember squealing when I found it in Amsterdam in 2012, I'll never forget that moment. 'I eat pizza everyday but I cap myself at 15 slices per week in an effort to prevent pizza burnout. 'Surprisingly, I haven't been able to find anyone who collects pizza boxes besides people in the business and even those folks don't keep too many. 'People are shocked at first and don't understand how pizza boxes can be something to collect but then I show them a few photos and they are hooked. 'I published a book about them in November and that's really helping turn the tide and boost pizza box art, the book has become a great source of legitimacy for the collection and I'm even bringing an exhibition of 100 boxes to London this autumn.

"A vast collection of over 1,000 letters, postcards and manuscripts written by some of history's most iconic women from the 14th century onwards are going under the hammer. The auction, Women: Letters and Signed Manuscripts, will see letters collated by manuscript expert Thierry Bodin up for auction in Paris where they are expected to fetch thousands. One of the most interesting lots is a letter from Henry VIII’s first wife Catherine of Aragon begging the Pope to block their divorce. The historical artefact is expected to fetch up to £35,000 at auction. Scroll down for video . Historical artefact: A letter from Henry VIII's first wife Catherine of Aragon, left, begging the Pope to block their divorce is expected to fetch up to £35,000 at auction . In the note dated October 3, 1529, the Spanish-born Queen asks a cardinal from her home country to seek the pontiff’s help in halting the king’s bid to annul their marriage because she had failed to produce a son. Within the letter, she writes: 'I am completely innocent. I can assure you with certainty that here [in England] there is no decision that can be made that will not bring a great evil in the future.' Pope Clement VII’s eventual refusal to grant the divorce led to a schism with the Roman Catholic Church, with Henry appointing himself head of the Church of England. The Ader Nordmann auction house in Paris expects the letter to fetch between £25,000 and £35,000, making it one of the most lucrative items. The letter is among more than 1,500 from royalty and celebrities to go under the hammer in Paris next week. Vintage: The auction also includes a letter written by Brigitte Bardot in 1967, within which she asks a record company not to release her steamy duet Je t'aime moi non plus with Serge Gainsbourg . Explanation: It was re-recorded after Bardot's husband Gunter Sachs objected. Jane Birkin, who later became Gainsbourg's wife, then featured on the song . In one written by Brigitte Bardot in 1967, she asks a record company not to release her steamy duet ‘Je t’aime moi non plus’ with Serge Gainsbourg after husband Gunter Sachs objected. It was re-recorded with Jane Birkin  who later became Gainsbourg's wife. The lot is expected to fetch around £2,300. The auction, which also includes missives from Coco Chanel and author Victor Hugo's mistress Juliette Drouet, will take place in Paris on November 18 and 19. Speaking to The Guardian about the auction, which has been dubbed the first of its kind, Bodin said: 'It’s really the first time so important a collection in terms of both quantity and content and time period covered, has been seen. 'It covers women from all domains, historical figures, writers, actors, painters, scientists.' Friendly chatter: The Paris auction will also include a letter exchanged between Katharine Hepburn, left, and Coco Chanel. The postcard was sent to the fashion designer after Hepburn played her in a Broadway show . Legendary women: Amongst the 1,500 documents is manuscripts from Henry VIII's sister Mary Tudor, pictured, and Mary Queen of Scots . Amongst these women is a letter exchanged between Katharine Hepburn and Coco Chanel. Penned in French, the postcard was sent to the fashion designer after Hepburn played her in a Broadway show. There's also lots of manuscripts from royals, such as Henry VIII’s sister Mary Tudor, Mary Queen of Scots, and a note from Queen Elizabeth II to her hatmaker and stylist. Queen Elizabeth writes: 'I am really delighted with your present. And I can truthfully say it is just what I need, for my one white bag is grey now, and my maid was in despair!'. A letter from Catherine II of Russia in 1792 to her former lover Stanislas Auguste Poniatowski, says: 'You read my letters with very little attention. I've told you and repeated that I risk being assaulted from all sides if you put a foot back in Russia.' Style notes: A letter from Queen Elizabeth in 1950 to her hatmaker and stylist says: 'I am really delighted with your present. And I can truthfully say it is just what I need, for my one white bag is grey now, and my maid was in despair!' Another highlight of the collection includes a note from Princess Grace of Monaco, estimated to fetch  around £460, apologising to a teacher for her daughter Stephanie not doing her homework. She writes: 'Please excuse Stephanie for not having done her French lesson. She left her book at school, Wednesday. Grace de Monaco.' Sylvie Robaglia, spokeswoman for the auctioneers, Ader-Nordmann, also told the paper: 'The letters reveal how strong these women are. 'The letter from Catherine of Aragon is the centrepiece of the collection. In it we see her defending the throne for her children; she is showing herself to be a mother before all else, before being the Queen.' Edith Piaf wrote to husband Jacques Pills in 1956 (while she was in rehab for alcohol and morphine addiction): “Lovely man, have confidence in me as you have always had and you will see it’s the good side in me that will win, by the end of the detoxification! It’s not even two months … you will see that things can start again! I am always your good little wife.' Virginia Woolf penned this to André Maurois in 1929: 'I have been unwell otherwise I would have already thanked you for the very kind preface you wrote for the French translation of Mrs Dalloway. It’s a great privilege for me to come across so much intelligence and sympathy.' Catherine of Aragon wrote  to Francisco de Quiñones, the cardinal of Santa Cruz: 'Without cause, except, as I sincerely believe, at the instigation of an enemy completely without scruples [Thomas Cromwell] who has abused the king, my lord; the case, if examined without passion, will clearly show, I hope, that truth and justice are on my side' Juliette Drouet to Victor Hugo: 'When I left you my angel, you seemed sad and unhappy - My Victor, will I be attached to your life like a venomous scorpion that withers and exhausts it?'","Women: Letters and Signed Manuscripts, will see letters auctioned .

"Wayne Rooney admits he would swap his century of England caps to win a World Cup or European Championship with his country. The England forward, who wins his 100th cap this weekend against Slovenia at Wembley, has never been beyond a quarter-final with the national team. He said: ‘I could sit here saying I’ve got 200 caps and 100 goals for my country, but the ultimate is to win a trophy and that’s what we all want to do. Wayne Rooney is set to make his 100th appearance for England against Slovenia on Saturday . But the Three Lions captain says he wants to emulate Bobby Moore and win an international trophy . Peter Shilton - 125 . David Beckham - 115 . Steven Gerrard - 114 . Bobby Moore - 108 . Ashley Cole - 107 . Sir Bobby Charlton - 106 . Frank Lampard - 106 . Billy Wright - 105 . ‘That’s why we play football, to win. That’s the target and hopefully sometime soon we can achieve that. ‘Obviously I’m not going to be as big a legend as Sir Bobby Charlton – he’s won the World Cup with England, so to eclipse that I’d have to win the World Cup, which would be a massive achievement. ‘The thing that I’ve taken away from Brazil is the hurt at getting knocked out – it was hard to take. ‘But we have to move on, we know what a good squad we have - it’s a relatively young group. We all believe in each other, we believe in the ability we’ve got and we have to go and prove that as a team. Rooney is six goals short of Sir Bobby Charlton's (below) record of 49 goals for his country . ‘To get 100 caps for England, there’s not many players who have done it – would be a great achievement. I’ll be proud to join that club and is something that myself and my family would be honoured by.’ Rooney, who captains England following Steven Gerrarrd’s international retirement, admits he still gets nervous about representing his country. The England forward, talking in this weekend’s matchday programme, added: ‘The highlight for me is that feeling you get after you’ve sung the national anthem – you run off and hear the crowd, particularly in the big games and the tournaments - you hear the support and you know what it means to the fans and the country.’ Rooney says he is still relatively young and believes he can beat the scoring record .
