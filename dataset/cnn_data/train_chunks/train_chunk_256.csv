"New York (CNN) -- Mark David Chapman, John Lennon's convicted killer, was making his seventh try at parole Wednesday. Chapman's latest quest for freedom comes ahead of the 32nd anniversary of the death of the former Beatle, a British singer-songwriter who was gunned down outside his Manhattan apartment on December 8, 1980. Chapman was scheduled to be interviewed by two or three members of the parole board, according to Carole Claren-Weaver, a spokeswoman for the New York Department of Corrections. It was not known when the board will hand down its decision. Chapman's words on the slaying . He was last up for parole in 2010 but was denied because his ""discretionary release remains inappropriate at this time and incompatible with the welfare of the community,"" according to the New York State Division of Parole. He was also denied parole in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008. Chapman, 57, is serving a sentence of 20 years to life in prison and is being held at the Wende Correctional Facility in Alden. He is in protective custody in a single-person cell, Claren-Weaver said, and is allowed out three hours per day. Since his transfer from Attica this year, Chapman has reapplied to participate in a state program called ""family reunion,"" which allows inmates to spend more time with family members. Chapman has not had an infraction since 1994. It is not clear whether he currently has legal representation. Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow, in previous years has submitted a letter requesting that parole be denied. Her attorney reiterated her position in an e-mail to CNN over the weekend.

"(CNN) -- I have a mission for you. One so lofty, so arduous, so utterly impossible that many of you may abandon the cause. We're going to reclaim the Facebook Poke. Why? For the same reason we climb mountains, cross seas and eat an entire pie in one sitting: Because it's there. Yes, since the inception of the social networking site, the mysterious option to poke friends has been available -- and it hasn't really changed since then. In the early days of Facebook, a version of the FAQ noted that Mark Zuckerberg and Co. just wanted to create something with no real purpose. That's not really rational when you think about it. As Anton Chekhov said, ""One must not put a loaded rifle on the stage if no one is thinking of firing it."" Yup. A poke is basically equivalent to a loaded gun -- an apt description, really, considering it's become a kind of weird weapon over the years. What started as a mere bauble has morphed into a tool only regularly used by utter and complete creepers. We conducted an online survey of a few hundred of our friends, fans and followers, and 55 percent banished poking to the realm of ""ick."" Still, when asked whether they had ever poked anyone themselves, 59 percent of respondents said yes. So why the disdain for the digit, yet the predilection for the Poke? Herein lies the purpose of our mission. Yes, the Poke may have strayed into the realm of 4chan and tell-all web shows, but it has not yet gone the way of Friendster. On that note, we call upon you, individuals of the internet persuasion, to take back the Poke! Here's how: . Engage in a poke war with a friend . Yes, it seems entirely retro -- in the way that things from about six years ago seem retro -- but poke wars were all the rage among the socially starved denizens of the original Facebook, and it's time to bring them back. According to our survey, most of you -- about 60 percent -- would be down with poking a friend, so why not just keep going? Research suggests that social networking increases levels of oxytocin -- a trust/generosity chemical -- in our brains. So why not stimulate trust via a rash of digital violence most often favored by 5-year-olds? Remind a faded friend of your existence . ""Oh man, I haven't talked to Jimmy since high school -- you know, after he got all 'excited' while dancing with Erma, the foreign exchange student, and had to go home 'sick.' Still, me and Jimmy were tight back in the day. I wonder what he's up to?"" Give or take a few details, this has probably been your inner dialogue regarding some shade from your past at one time or another. While you may not feel entirely comfortable writing said friend an e-mail, or giving him a call -- like you still have his digits anyway -- a poke serves as a kind of, ""Hey! remember me? We were friends once! Let's reconnect!"" (Yes, exclamation marks are always inherent in the Poke). Think of it as the digital version of an enthusiastic chance encounter at the drugstore -- without all the awkward juggling of dandruff shampoo and condoms. Getting some action . Naturally, the Facebook Poke is replete with sexual connotations. In fact, about 31 percent of those surveyed said they would poke someone they want to sleep with. Michael Gallagher, whose comedy site Totally Sketch recently made a viral video titled ""Facebook Sex: Getting Poked,"" asserts, ""Poking is a way of saying 'Hi! You're cute and I'd like to have sex with you' -- it's more than flirting, but not a hard request for intercourse ... which means less impact of a 'rejection.'"" It's also a totally weak move. As one of those surveyed said: ""It's Facebook's creepy tool of socially acceptable sexual molestation."" So instead of just poking some dude you're into, might we suggest a more subtle form of flirtation? A method that the folks over at SuperPoke -- a popular Facebook application launched in 2007 that allows you to wave, roundhouse kick, etc. -- assure us is a true classic: Throw a sheep at him. If he's into weirdos, he'll be totally smitten -- and if he's unimpressed, he's probably into boring vanilla poking IRL, anyway.","Columnists: We should take back the Facebook Poke because it's there .
Casual survey says majority don't like the Poke, but that most have used it .
You can start a poke war with a friend or reconnect with an old acquaintance .
Don't poke with romance in mind; instead, use ""Super Poke"" and send a sheep ."
"(CNN) -- The south Florida lifeguard fired for leaving his post so he could save a swimmer outside his coverage zone said Thursday he has been offered his job back. But Tomas Lopez told CNN he does not plan to return to work. ""It's another chapter in my life closed and I am just going to continue to get my schooling finished and get on with my career,"" Lopez told CNN. The 21-year-old said his phone has been ringing off the hook with journalists trying to get his side of the story. Jeff Ellis Management, the company for which Lopez worked, had said lifeguards cannot go beyond the perimeter of the beach they are responsible for overseeing. Jeff Ellis told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" on Thursday evening that he didn't approve of the decision to fire Lopez. ""Clearly, he should not have been terminated for what had occurred,"" Ellis said. ""I know that he has tried to do the right thing."" Three other lifeguards quit in protest and two others were dismissed after saying they would have acted as Lopez did. ""They told us we would be liabilities and we had to be let go,"" lifeguard Travis Madrid told CNN. Ellis told CNN the company has offered to bring back those who were let go. Ellis told the Sun Sentinel newspaper he confirmed that no area of the beach was left unattended while Lopez assisted the swimmer. The incident occurred Monday at Hallandale Beach in on Florida's Atlantic coast, north of Miami. Lifeguard sues New York over revealing swimsuit rule . A beachgoer rushed to Lopez's lifeguard station to alert him to a man who was drowning. The man was some 1,500 feet outside the company's protection zone in an area where signs warn visitors to swim at their own risk, a supervisor with the company told CNN affiliate WPTV. Even though he knew it was outside the company protection zone, Lopez ran into the ocean toward the struggling man and pulled him ashore. The man, he said, had turned blue. ""He was having a lot of trouble breathing,"" Lopez said. A nurse at the beach tended to the victim until emergency medics arrived and rushed him to a hospital. The man was in good condition Thursday, according to Aventura Hospital. Lifeguard Szilard Janko said he guarded Lopez's zone while the latter aided the swimmer. ""They let him go after he performed the rescue,"" Janko said. ""They fired him basically on the spot."" After the near-drowning, Lopez said he was asked by his supervisor to complete an incident report. 15 things your lifeguard won't tell you . ""At that point I knew I was going to be fired. I knew I had broken the rule,"" Lopez said. ""In those cases, we are supposed to call 911 and hope they get there in time."" Did Lopez deserve to be fired? Share your thoughts . Company supervisor Susan Ellis previously told WPTV that Lopez was let go for violating company policy. ""We have liability issues and can't go out of the protected area,"" she told the TV station. ""What he did was his own decision. He knew the company rules and did what he thought he needed to do."" Lopez said he started the $8.25-an-hour job four months ago and had hoped to continue working there when he goes to Broward College in the fall. ""I have no doubts I did the right thing,"" he said Thursday. ""I believe I did what was right, and that if someone needs help you're going to go help them, regardless if you're a lifeguard or not.""

"(CNN) -- It's a new era for Goodyear's iconic blimp. You could call it the Age of the Zeppelin. Cue the guitars! The Ohio-based tire and rubber company started testing its next-generation airship last month at Goodyear's airfield near Akron. Yes, this is an actual Zeppelin airship, made in partnership with the German company that dates to before the infamous Hindenburg disaster. But don't panic, this new lighter-than-air vehicle is just as safe as its blimp predecessor. It's filled with helium, not hydrogen like the humongous airship that burned in New Jersey in 1937. Goodyear is finally closing the door on the GZ-20 models, which came off the drawing board 45 years ago. In the coming months, Goodyear plans to train more than 10 pilots to fly the Zeppelin NT. (NT stands for new technology.) If all goes as planned, we'll be watching this sleek new silver, yellow and blue airship hovering high above sporting events east of the Rockies this fall. More amenities on the new Zeppelin . So what's different about this one? It's faster, because it has three engines instead of two. It's bigger. It's more maneuverable. It can carry more passengers. Oh, yeah, and unlike the old model, this one's got an onboard restroom. Believe me, I can tell you from experience that will be a relief (literally). Oh, good. Seat belts. The new blimp's going to have seat belts. The older model didn't, which shook me up a little when we lifted off at a 25-degree angle with the engines screaming. Behind the scenes as Goodyear preps the new blimp . When Goodyear Capt. Matt Lussier let me briefly fly one of the older blimps over Atlanta on New Year's Eve, its engines maxed out about 50 mph. Top speed of these Zeppelins: 73 mph, increasing their range and allowing them to take part in more events. Lussier instructed me on how to turn the blimp left and right with pedals on the floor. The cockpit aboard the Zeppelin includes a joystick that will more easily allow the pilot to turn and to point up or down. Read more about how I ended up piloting the blimp . One thing that surprised me about the older blimp was its tiny gondola, which seats from three to seven people, including the pilot -- depending on whether it's covering a sporting event. The new Goodyear Zeppelin accommodates 12. It's got bigger ""wrap-around windows"" that Goodyear says offer improved ""sweeping panoramic views."" I have to tell you, the views on the older blimp were still pretty damn awesome. It felt like we were standing atop the world's tallest treehouse, looking out for a hundred miles in every direction. Massive enough to blot out the sky . When you stand underneath a blimp on a landing field, the thing is so massive that it blots out the sky. It's nearly the length of an American football field. But this new airship is even longer, measuring 246 feet from tip to tail -- 54 feet more than the current blimp. In the older blimps, the two engines are bolted to the gondola. But in the new ones, engines are attached to the ""envelope,"" the blimp's helium-filled ""bag,"" as the pilots sometimes call it. The bag on the new blimp is constructed with a semirigid skeleton to make it faster and more nimble. Compare the old and new blimps . It's all part of a phase-out plan of all three Goodyear blimps; the Spirit of Goodyear retired this year in Florida after a record 14-year career. Eventually, it's expected to go on display at an undisclosed aviation museum. The Carson, California-based Spirit of America will be decommissioned in 2015 or 2016, and finally, the Pompano Beach, Florida-based Spirit of Innovation is scheduled to retire in 2018. A Goodyear pilot shows how he flies the older blimp . Goodyear has launched an online contest to allow the public to name the new blimp. Tour offers Zeppelin-view of Paris . FYI, airship enthusiasts, Goodyear will continue to call these things ""blimps,"" even though technically, they're not. As any ""helium head"" will tell you, a blimp is an airship without an internal skeleton. These new airships have internal skeletons. But Goodyear loves the ""B"" word, so the company plans to keep calling them ""blimps.""","For the first time in 45 years, Goodyear begins phasing in a new type of airship .
Co-built by Germany's Zeppelin company, it's faster and bigger and has a restroom .
Testing began in March, and the entire fleet will be Zeppelins by 2018 .
Although technically it's not a blimp, Goodyear says it will still call it a blimp ."
"(CNN) -- The woman's voice wavered, just for a moment. Standing feet from the Ohio man who abducted her and chained her up in his Cleveland house, where for more than a decade she and two other women endured repeated beatings and rapes, she wiped away the tears and started again. ""My name is Michelle Knight, and I would like to tell you what 11 years was like for me,"" she told the judge Thursday, delivering an emotionally charged statement that was remarkable for both its hope and defiance. For days, there had been speculation about whether Knight and the women held with her -- Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry -- would attend the sentencing hearing of Ariel Castro, who pleaded guilty last week to 937 counts in a deal that eliminated a possible death penalty in exchange for life in prison plus 1,000 years. Castro son: I won't visit dad in prison . The speculation ended when the diminutive 32-year-old Knight, wearing a gray dress and purple-framed eyeglasses, stood in the courtroom after she was called by the judge. It was the first time Knight had been in the same room with Castro since she was freed from 11 years of captivity on May 6 after neighbors heard Berry's cries and broke down a door. Knight stopped on her way to the front of the courtroom, hugging Berry's sister and DeJesus' cousin who minutes earlier had read statements on behalf of the two women. ""...I worried about what would happen to me and the other girls every day,"" Knight told Judge Michael Russo as she sobbed, wiping away tears. ""Days never got shorter. Days turned into nights. Nights turned into days. Years turned into eternity."" Read Michelle Knight's full statement . In many ways, Knight is the least known to the public. She went missing on August 22, 2002, after being lured into Castro's vehicle with a promise of a ride. Castro has told the court he spotted her at a Family Dollar store and overheard her talking about needing a ride. Unlike the abductions of DeJesus in August 2004 and Berry in 2003, there was little made of her disappearance in the news. Knight's grandmother, Deborah Knight, told The Plain Dealer in May, that the family had concluded that Michelle had left of her own accord because she was angry that she had lost custody of her 2-year-old son. That conclusion was supported by police and social workers, she told the newspaper. But the missing woman's mother, Barbara Knight, told the newspaper that her daughter would never have broken all contact voluntarily. Even after Knight's mother moved to Naples, Florida, she often returned to Cleveland's West Side to search for her daughter, putting up posters seeking information about her, she told the newspaper. On Thursday, the world learned from Knight there was never a day that passed while she was in captivity that she didn't think of her son. ""I wondered if I was ever going to see him again,"" she said. Knight, DeJesus, Berry and Berry's 6-year-old daughter were held in Castro's 1,400-square-foot home with boarded-up windows and peeling paint on Seymour Avenue. DNA tests have confirmed that Castro is the father of the 6-year-old. Who are the three women freed in Cleveland? In court Thursday, Knight did not detail her abuse. But in a pre-sentencing evaluation, Frank Ochberg -- considered a pioneer in trauma science -- told the court that Knight suffered ""the longest and most severely"" at the hands of Castro. The evaluation -- using statements, medical records, videotaped interviews and transcripts -- painted a horrifying picture of physical and emotional abuse that included brutal beatings and repeated rapes that resulted in pregnancies that he would end by punching the women in the stomach. In one case, he threw Knight down the stairs to cause a spontaneous abortion. Under threat of death by Castro, Knight was forced to deliver Berry's child, Ochberg said. ""She served as doctor, nurse, pediatrician, midwife. She did the delivery. She did it under primitive conditions. When that little baby wasn't breathing, she breathed into the baby. She breathed life into that child,"" Ochberg testified during the hearing. ""She interposed herself so that Gina wouldn't get the assault, and she took it. She's a very courageous and heroic individual."" Read Michelle Knight's statement . Knight told the judge that DeJesus saved her life. ""Gina was my teammate. She never let me fall, I never let her fall. She nursed me back to health when I was dying from his abuse,"" she said. ""My friendship with her was the only thing that was good out of this situation. We said we will someday make it out alive, and we did."" With each sentence, her voice hardened. ""Ariel Castro, I remember all the times that you came home talking about what everybody else did wrong and act like you wasn't doing the same thing. You said, 'At least I didn't kill you,'"" she said. ""You took 11 years of my life away, and now I've got it back. I spent 11 years in hell, and now your hell is just beginning."" She never looked at Castro, who sat handcuffed at the defense table flanked by two attorneys. ""I will overcome all this that happened. But you'll face hell for eternity,"" she said. ""From this moment on, I will not let you define me or effect who I am. I will live on, you will die a little every day as you think about the 11 years and atrocities you inflicted on us."" She told him the ""death penalty would be so much easier."" ""You don't deserve that, you deserve to spend life in prison. I can forgive you but I will never forget,"" she said. As she neared the end of her statement, Knight was no longer crying. Her voice was no longer wavering and breaking. It was strong and clear. ""I know there (are) a lot of people going through hard times. But we need to reach out a hand and hold them, and let them know they're being heard,"" she said. ""After 11 years, I'm finally being heard. And it's liberating. Thank you, all. I love you. God bless you.""","Michelle Knight, 32, was kidnapped by Ariel Castro in August 2002 .

"(CNN) -- Conditions favorable to life may once have existed all over Mars, the European Space Agency said Friday. Two spacecraft have found evidence that liquid water was widespread over the red planet. The ESA's Mars Express and NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have discovered hydrated silicate minerals in the northern lowlands of Mars, a clear indication that water once flowed there, the ESA said. The two spacecraft had previously found thousands of small outcrops in the planet's southern hemisphere where rock minerals had been altered by water, it said. Many of these outcrops are in the form of hydrated clay minerals known as phyllosilicates. They indicate the planet's southern hemisphere was once much warmer and wetter than it is today. No such sites had been found in the northern lowlands until this week, the ESA said. The northern lowlands are covered in thick blankets of lava and sediments up to several kilometers thick and that had hampered efforts to probe what lay beneath. The ESA's Mars Express found the first hints of water in the northern plains, but the outcrops were small and more detailed observations were needed to confirm the evidence, the ESA said. NASA's Orbiter provided higher resolution data that showed at least nine northern craters with phyllosilicates or other hydrated silicates, the ESA said. The finding was reported this week in the journal Science. Those minerals formed in wet environments and were identical to those found in the southern hemisphere. ""We can now say that the planet was altered on a global scale by liquid water more than 4 billion years ago,"" said the report's lead author, John Carter of the University of Paris. Scientists said it's difficult to draw conclusions about the type of environment that existed on Mars when it had water, but they do have some clues. The sites ""are rich in iron and magnesium, but less in aluminum. Together with the close proximity of olivine, which is easily modified by water, this indicates that the exposure to water lasted only tens to hundreds of millions of years,"" said Jean-Pierre Bibring, the OMEGA principal investigator from the University of Paris. The scientists' search concentrated on 91 sizeable craters where incoming asteroids have punched down the planet's surface by several kilometers, exposing ""ancient crustal material,"" the ESA said. The results could also suggest sites for future Mars landers, because evidence of water during the planet's early history suggests conditions in those spots may have been favorable to the evolution of primitive life, the ESA said.","Liquid water was once widespread over Mars, scientists say .
Evidence was discovered by NASA and the European Space Agency .
It shows water once existed in the northern hemisphere .
Evidence of water previously had been found only in southern areas ."
"(CNN) -- The ceremony was held on a chilly November morning in 1981 on the front lawn of the Jewish Community Center in Wilmington, Delaware, and after three decades the plain cardboard program printed for the occasion still resonates: . ""Garden of the Righteous, Tree Planting Ceremony: In honor of the Righteous Gentiles who at the risk of their own lives and the lives of their families saved Jews during the Nazi Holocaust -- 1933-1945. ... This Tree Planting Ceremony by Holocaust survivors residing in Delaware is the first such tribute to the 'Righteous Among the Nations' outside of Jerusalem."" Patterned after a memorial at Israel's Yad Vashem, the grassy clearing had saplings with wooden markers bearing names of European Christians who had rescued Jews who came to live in Delaware. One by one that morning, swelling with emotion, survivors came forward to unveil markers. Also in attendance and honored with a tree was a Dutch Christian couple who lived in the state. My mother, Halina Wind Preston, a Jewish educator who had survived 14 months hiding from the Nazis in the sewers of Lvov, Poland, conceived and planned the garden, and she unveiled markers bearing the names of two Polish Catholic sewer workers who had saved her: Leopold Socha and Stefan Wroblewski. She died a year later at age 60, but she had fulfilled a sacred duty. Soon a monument was added, bronze plaques replaced the wooden markers, and on December 11, 1983, more than 700 people packed the center's auditorium to hear the Methodist theologian and Holocaust scholar Franklin H. Littell formally dedicate the garden. The story of the Wilmington garden, and the Lvov sewer-survival story -- dramatized in Agnieszka Holland's movie ""In Darkness"" -- are particularly timely because the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has designated ""Choosing to Act: Stories of Rescue"" as this year's theme for Yom Hashoah, the day of remembrance, Thursday, April 19. Because the Nazis intended that no Jews should survive, every survival story is sacred. Although my mother is not portrayed in the movie, she would have been gratified that it has given wide exposure to Socha's heroism. Still, Halina would have rejected the film's many fabrications concerning Wroblewski's equally valiant role. She would have been incredulous over invented characters having sex in the sewer for the sake of dramatic tension, or seeing a man who was instrumental in her rescue reduced to a caricature of a pious Jew. My cover story about my mother in the Philadelphia Inquirer Sunday Magazine on Mother's Day 1983 -- five months after her death -- was the first full English-language presentation of the Lvov sewer rescue. Socha died in 1946, but Wroblewski read my account and then shared with me many crucial details yet to be revealed in a documentary planned by the Polish filmmaker Maciej Pawlicki. The daughter of a poor Hasidic watchmaker in the Carpathians, Halina was just 22 on July 27, 1944, when she emerged from a sewer manhole in Lvov (present-day Lviv, Ukraine). Hundreds of Jews had tried to escape into the sewers on the night of the liquidation of the Lvov ghetto and almost all died in the raging river that flowed through the sewer system. My mother found herself in a group of 21 Jews whom the sewer workers had agreed to hide. Originally for money, but later even after the money ran out, the sewer workers brought them food, washed their clothes, moved them when their safety was in danger and visited them every day except Sunday. Some decided to leave as the ordeal wore on and were killed above ground, and one older woman died of natural causes. A baby was born and had to be suffocated lest its cries give away the group. My mother was among 10 who survived the entire 14 months, and this experience guided her life. She was among the first of Hitler's survivors to speak publicly. Throughout the months in the filthy underground hideout, she remained focused on a place she had never seen, the New York address 3080 Broadway, where her older brother, Leon, was studying at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. The prospect of reuniting with him gave her something to live for, and when she arrived into the waiting arms of Rabbi Leon Wind and his wife and son at La Guardia Airport in 1947, it marked the beginning of a new life dedicated to honoring both her Jewish heritage and her Catholic rescuers. An American audience first heard a survivor speak of the Lvov sewer episode on October 25, 1949, when Halina Wind, now a 27-year-old senior in the seminary's teachers institute, addressed the annual conference of the National Women's League of the United Synagogue of America, meeting in New York City. She later went on a speaking tour on behalf of the seminary with at least 36 appearances in seven states. One woman who heard her in Camden, New Jersey, introduced her to a cousin who had survived Auschwitz and Buchenwald. After a short courtship, Halina married George Preston, the former Grisza Priszkulnik, and they moved to Wilmington. I was born there in 1955, my sister six years later. During three decades in Delaware, my mother inspired students and audiences of all faiths with the story of the Lvov sewer workers who saved her, establishing herself as the state's eloquent representative of the victims and survivors of the Nazis. Her message was uplifting, about how goodness transcends religion and ethnicity and national boundaries, continuing from one generation to the next, from one culture to another. ""I had a mission,"" my mother said in 1978. ""I wasn't just saving my life. ... And when you have a purpose and when you have a cause, then you are able to endure everything. ... I was living for my parents. I was living for my brother. I was living for my yet-unborn children. I was living for the past, and I was living for the future."" My mother maintained contact with the Socha and Wroblewski families. (A third sewer worker, Jerzy Kowalow, disappeared after the war.) As a boy I watched her meticulously prepare parcels of clothing that she sent them throughout the difficult postwar years in Soviet-occupied Poland. She traveled to Jerusalem in 1977 to provide the sole testimony that led to Socha and Wroblewski and their wives being named ""Righteous Among the Nations,"" enabling the two families to receive monthly stipends and establishing them among 23,788 heroic figures from 45 countries upon whom Yad Vashem had formally accorded the honor at last count. As for the Wilmington garden, it's now a verdant landmark, but three decades of exposure to the elements have taken a toll. This summer it will be rededicated with a new entrance, a new monument and new plaques. In the fall, new saplings will be planted to recognize more Righteous Gentiles who helped other Delawareans. My mother, who didn't see a tree for 14 months, kept faith with her rescuers. Now only those of us who remain can keep the garden of memory blooming. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Preston.","David Preston's mother and nine others survived the Holocaust hiding in sewers for 14 months .

"(CNN) -- You won't find the word ""Englishization"" in the dictionary, but Google it and your search will lead you to links discussing imposed multilingualism and the loss of Japan's indigenous culture. Hiroshi Mikitani sees nothing wrong with the word, incorporating it easily into our discussion about Japan's future. The internet entrepreneur and CEO of Rakuten Inc, Japan's largest e-commerce site, intends to change his country from the inside out. ""And Englishization is a part of it,"" he says bluntly. With 6,000 employees and sales topping $3 billion a year, Mikitani intends Rakuten to keep growing into a global player. The goal: be as common a household name as Google in 10 years. The path to that goal, believes Mikitani, is to speak the global language of business, English. ""English is the only global language. We're doing a global business. I think this is the only way a Japanese service organization can become a global organization."" By 2012, Mikitani's pledge is to make Rakuten an English-only corporation. All communication, verbal and email, would be sent not in Japanese, but in English. It's a daunting task for a Japanese company headquartered in Tokyo. Last year's Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) rankings showed Japanese test takers scored second worst in the East Asia region, below North Korea and Myanmar. Only Laos ranked lower than Japan. Honda's CEO, Takanobu Ito, recently weighed in, saying publicly,""It's stupid for a Japanese company to only use English in Japan when the workforce is mainly Japanese."" Mikitani doesn't flinch at the criticism. In fact, he seems to relish it. ""The nature of our business is totally different,"" he says, pointing out Honda manufactures a hardware item and Rakuten deals with users on the internet. Then he jabs back at his elder corporate colleague: ""If you want to become successful in other countries, you need to internationalize the headquarters."" Rakuten is expanding despite Japan's macro-economic struggles. They are starting a Chinese version of Rakuten and purchasing e-commerce sites in the U.S. and France. ""One thing I know, the definition of 'country' is going to change. Definition of 'currency' is going to change,"" says Mikitani. ""There is going to be less importance which country you're operating from. And there's going to be global competition, not local to local."" Mikitani is everything ""Corporate Japan"" is not: young, a risk-taker, outspoken and fluent in English. He started his company with a friend in 1997, using their own money. The two friends grew the business into the public corporation and powerhouse it is today. The 45 year old, energetic CEO says he is, at the core, utterly Japanese. But he disagrees with how corporate Japan and the policy makers have run the economy and country. Look at the aging demographics and the economy of Japan, says Mikitani, and the writing is on the wall for corporate Japan. Growth, he says, can only happen if Japanese companies go outside of the country for expansion and look for opportunities outside of Japan's famously produced cars and electronics. ""I felt (sic) those kind of ages is over. Now we need to really dramatically change the structure of economy of Japan and IT is going to be an extremely important part of it,"" says Mikitani. ""But none of the Japanese... for example, politicians, truly understands from the bottom of the heart, how important that is."" Mikitani feels the two decades-long economic stagnation for Japan has fundamentally affected the country's young, which spells trouble for the country's future. ""Japanese society, especially younger people, are so inward looking. They don't even want to go to other countries. They want to stay here. They want to have a good life, they don't want to be rich. They want to have a good day to day life. That's it. And I think we need to be more sort of dynamic, outward looking,"" he says. The solution, hopes Mikitani, will be found in concrete economic policy from Tokyo's lawmakers and strong leadership from Japan's companies. Japan can produce innovative, high quality ideas and products, says Mikitani, but the talent needs a direction. He remains positive about his country's future, despite its problems. Rakuten means optimistic, he points out. ""I think that in absolute terms, we [Japanese] are lagging. We are slowing down. I don't think we need to be pessimistic, but our window is not so long.""","CEO of Japanese e-commerce giant says English should be first language .

"(CNN) -- ""Well, how do you remember any son?"" John Regelbrugge II asked in a telephone call from his home in northern California. The body of his son, Navy Cmdr. John Regelbrugge III, 49, was among at least 16 bodies recovered after a massive landslide Saturday swallowed houses and trailers in Washington's Cascade Mountains. At least eight more bodies await inclusion in the official count once medical examiners identify them. ""I mean, you know, he was just one hell of a man,"" his father recalled. ""He was a great boy, very active in sports. He loved to hunt. He was one of my hunting partners for years until he went to the Navy."" The Navy, where Regelbrugge served 32 years, said in a statement Thursday that it was still awaiting the coroner's official report before releasing information about ""our dear shipmate and his family."" But John Regelbrugge II, 72, had no doubt. The commander's brothers and two of his sons found his body in a debris field near where Regelbrugge lived with his wife, Kris, who also died. They had hoped to run into him helping the rescue effort, his father said. ""Actually, he's not officially dead yet,"" said his father, choking with emotion. ""You know how the red tape is, the medical examiner and all that crap. There's no two ways about it. I mean, the boy that called me says, he's laying at my feet dead. He had the dog next to him. They weren't going to give up until they found him."" His son's Navy uniforms and his officer's sword was across the river from where the two-story house once stood in the remote, mountainous area. His son appeared to have his arms up, perhaps trying to protect himself, his father said. Regelbrugge and his wife had slept in on Saturday morning, when they had expected to travel to Seattle to visit their daughter, Sara. ""His brother Greg lives up there and called him at 9:40 in the morning, and he said John just got up and they would get going in a little bit,"" John Regelbrugge II recalled. ""Unfortunately, shortly thereafter, the mud hit. They never got going."" Regelbrugge II and his wife raised their family in a rugged and isolated community northwest of Sacramento. That passion for the outdoors and the beauty of the mountains drew his son and his wife to Darrington. ""We live in the middle of nowhere as it is,"" the father said. ""Right now, I'm about nine miles north of a town of about 5,000 and six miles southeast of a town of a little over 1,000. When John went to school ... there were 800 people in town and a graduating class of 20 or 21 kids. He's always been in the country. He enjoyed being out. He used to love to ride the horses. He and one of his brothers would disappear up into the hills on the horses and come back hours later."" From Darrington, Regelbrugge commuted to his job at an area naval base, his father said. ""He bought that place in the middle of nowhere,"" said John Regelbrugge II. ""That's why it's so hard to believe that mudslide wiped anything out. I know they keep saying 30 homes. There were eight homes on Steelhead Drive and that's where he was. I never saw nothing but a few farms around there. Those eight homes are gone."" John Regelbrugge II said his son threw a big party the Saturday before St. Patrick's Day that was attended by neighbors from Steelhead Drive and the vicinity. ""All the neighbors were there -- 30 of them,"" he said. ""That was everybody that lived there. They were real tight. Everybody had a half-acre or three-quarters of an acre. There were like 30 people living there, and 20-something of them are dead."" Regelbrugge recently served aboard the aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis. A 2012 tweet from the Navy said that at the time, he had three sons in the service: Brian Regelbrugge was a cryptologic technician 2nd Class in the Navy; Kyle Regelbrugge was a Navy machinist's mate fireman; and Scott Regelbrugge was an Army corporal. The couple also had two daughters. ""He loved the Navy,"" John Regelbrugge II said. ""That was his big thing. He was his mom's sailor boy. He had over 27 years on his sea clock. He was out to sea a lot. He took the Navy like a duck takes to water."" Scott Regelbrugge left to work at a local sawmill before the landslide came, his grandfather said. When Regelbrugge joined the Navy, he would write poems to his late mother, Grace. ""She was so proud of him,"" the eldest Regelbrugge recalled. ""She passed away on July 28 at 10:35 in the morning. I'm still trying to get over that. She died of pancreatic cancer. That upset Johnny something terrible too."" Since his mother's death, Regelbrugge had called his father twice a day to check on him. ""He was worried about me,"" the father said. ""I prefer to be alone after my wife died."" Asked how he remembered his son, the father said simply: ""John just loved life."" How to help the victims .

"(CNN) -- Britain's Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrived in New Zealand Monday on a much-anticipated three-week royal tour of that country and Australia, the first trip for baby Prince George. While George is making the long trip with William and Catherine, it's not yet clear if he will be attending public events with his parents. Announcing the royal couple's planned engagements on the April 7 to 25 visit, the Prince's private secretary identified occasions at which the youngest royal might be present, but kept an element of suspense. ""George being just a little over eight months old by the time they travel, I'm sure you will appreciate that the couple will have to make a final decision on those moments much closer to the time,"" he said. With Prince William second in line to the British throne and his young son third, Queen Elizabeth II had to give permission for both to travel on the same plane. The royals touched down Monday in Wellington, New Zealand's capital. Battling windy conditions, Catherine held her son as they exited the plane and, along with Prince William, were greeted by dignitaries on the tarmac. After a 10-day tour taking in stops in Hamilton, Christchurch and Queenstown, the royals will travel on to Australia for the second leg of their trip. One of the engagements earmarked for a potential appearance for Prince George is the opening of the Bilby Enclosure at Taronga Zoo in Sydney. The Australian government made a donation to the zoo for its bilby preservation program when George was born, and the enclosure is to be named after him, the palace said. On its website, the zoo said the Australian government had given a bilby, a native nocturnal marsupial with large ears, to the young prince to ""adopt."" The royals will also visit the Blue Mountains near Sydney, where they'll meet residents affected by recent bush fires, Uluru and the capital, Canberra, while in Australia. Opinion: New Zealand prepares to go ga-ga over blue-blooded baby . Shared enthusiasm for trip . In February, Australasian media seized on reports Australia's incoming governor general had apparently let slip that George would make his first official visit Down Under. ""They'll bring with them Prince George, the little one,"" Peter Cosgrove was quoted as saying, after a visit to the Queen at Buckingham Palace. After reporters tried to clarify the comment, Cosgrove appeared to backtrack, saying, ""I hope he's coming."" Confirmation came in early March that George was indeed joining his parents on the official trip -- echoing his father's own childhood travels. Prince Charles and Princess Diana first took Prince William to New Zealand and Australia in 1983, and he was photographed taking his first steps on the lawn of Government House in Auckland, New Zealand. New baby photos of Prince George emerge . This will be Catherine's first visit to either country, while William last visited New Zealand after the devastating 2011 earthquake in Christchurch. On this trip, the royal couple will visit the city together and stop to remember the 185 people killed. They are looking forward to their trip to both countries ""immensely,"" Kensington Palace said. ""There's no hiding the enthusiasm for the visit by both the Duke and the Duchess. The Duke, because he has been before; and the Duchess because she has never been to either country but has wanted to do so as long as she can remember. ""The Duke has no doubt that his wife will fall in love with New Zealand and Australia every bit as much as he did, some years ago."" The kid's a natural . 'Competitive outbursts' The pair may not always be in complete agreement on their trip, however. Kensington Palace said the Duke and Duchess were ""just a little competitive"" and some of the events on the itinerary will pit husband against wife. The royal couple will board separate Team NZ America's Cup yachts for some informal racing in Auckland and coach rival teams in ""rippa"" rugby, a non-contact version of Rugby Union, in the South Island city of Dunedin. ""Again, I think we can expect some pretty competitive outbursts,"" the palace said. A century after the outbreak of World War I, the tour will also see William and Kate paying tribute to both countries' war dead and visiting military bases. Their last day will be April 25 -- ANZAC [Australian and New Zealand Army Corps] Day, which originally marked the landing of soldiers from both nations at Gallipoli, Turkey, in 1915. In the eight-month campaign fought there, 2,721 New Zealanders and 8,709 Australians died, before the allied forces withdrew. The day is now a tribute to those who have died in all conflicts. The Duke and Duchess will plant a seed from a pine tree at the site of the battle at the Australian War Memorial in Australia's capital city, Canberra, before returning to London.

"(CNN) -- Juventus scored a late goal to secure a 1-0 win against Lyon at the Stade de Gerland in the Europa League quarterfinal first leg on Thursday. The mountain that Lyon coach Remi Garde said his team had to climb in the build-up to the match got a little steeper as Leonardo Bonucci scored a precious away goal in the 85th minute. A scrappy game looked destined to end goalless after Juve substitute Mirko Vucinic -- on for Carlos Tevez -- squandered a great chance six minutes before the end, shooting over the bar from close range. But Bonucci spared the Montenegrin's blushes moments later firing home at the far post following an Andrea Pirlo corner. Victory gives Antonio Conte's team, who are currently eight points clear in the Serie A, the edge going into next week's second leg in Turin. ""It was tough as Lyon were trying to stop us from playing with man-marking all over the field,"" Conte said. ""I think the victory is a deserved result, but we know that we have achieved nothing yet, there is a second leg to play and a semifinal to achieve."" Portugal's Benfica also grabbed a vital away goal to beat Dutch side AZ Alkmaar 1-0 at the AFAS Stadion. Argentine forward Eduardo Salvio's 48th-minute strike keeps Jorge Jesus' side on course for a second consecutive final in the competition. Fellow Primeira Liga side Porto were also 1-0 winners, defeating Spanish side Sevilla at the Estadio do Dragao -- center-back Eliaquim Mangala with the goal after 31 minutes. The competition's other remaining La Liga side, Valencia also had a night to forget. Juan Antonio Pizzi's side went down 3-0 at to Basel at St Jakob-Park in a match played behind closed doors. The Swiss side was penalized by UEFA after fans threw fireworks onto the pitch in their last 16 match against Salzburg. Basel all but booked their place in the semifinals thanks to a first-half brace from Argentine midfielder Matias Emilio Delgado before Valentin Stocker added a third in injury time. The second legs of all four matches will take place on Thursday April 10.

"(CNN) -- ""I mean, I hate to gloat,"" Weird Al Yankovic said, ""but I'm extremely satisfied with my position in life and the way things have worked out for me."" For over a quarter of a century, Weird Al has made a career out of his two passions: music and comedy. His parodies and satirical songs and videos have amassed an army of devoted fans -- 2 million of them follow him on Twitter.  He's won three Grammy Awards and has sold more comedy albums than any other artist in history. Not bad for a nerd out of Lynwood, California. And now, the Hawaiian-shirt-wearing, accordion-playing, curly-haired pop satirist can also call himself a children's book author. On Tuesday, Yankovic's book, ""When I Grow Up,"" lands on shelves. The book, published by Harper Collins, brings Yankovic's signature brand of nerdy humor to what turns out to be a very sweet and empowering children's picture book. It centers on what Billy, an energetic 8-year-old, imagines he might be when he grows up. Sure, it seems like writing children's books is becoming a popular pastime for attention-loving celebrities. But Yankovic found inspiration in, of all things, his father's career advice. ""As my father used to tell me, the only true sign of success in life is being able to do for a living that which makes you happy,"" Yankovic said. And what made him happy turned out to be a career that, Yankovic admits, no one in his family ever thought would go in the direction it has. ""One of the reasons I was inspired to write this book was because my career path was sort of circuitous,"" he said. ""I went to college and got a degree in architecture, because when I was 12 years old I had a guidance counselor talk me out of my dream of being a cartoonist for MAD Magazine."" ""He said, 'Oh there's no future in comics, you're not going to make a living doing that.' He said, 'Well, you're good at drafting, you're good at math, you're creative, why don't you be an architect?' So I decided, OK, I'm going to be an adult, I'm going to grow up, and this is what I'm going to do for a living."" After three years at architecture school, Yankovic said, he realized it wasn't what he wanted to do. With the support of parents who weren't interested in pushing him into any specific career, but rather just ""really wanted me to be happy,"" Yankovic took a chance on his passion. ""I suppose I had my rock star fantasies while I was singing into my hairbrush in the bathroom mirror, but I never really consciously said, 'OK, this is what I'm going to do for a living and I'm going to be Weird Al.' My hobbies just sort of gradually became my vocation,"" he said. Of course, Yankovic also saw a children's book as the perfect opportunity to indulge his quirky humor. As Billy tells his classmates in the book, ""Maybe I'll be a gorilla masseuse, or an artist who sculpts out of chocolate mousse."" In typical Yankovic style, Billy also suggests ""professional pickle inspector,"" ""big sumo wrestler,"" and ""smelly pit-sniffing deodorant tester."" Listen to Weird Al read an excerpt from his book. Yankovic's favorite career in Billy's possible future? ""Master debater,"" he said, with that instantly recognizable laugh. ""I can't believe I got that through the censors. Actually I was on the speech team in high school so that probably is pretty close. "" ""I don't know if Billy is obsessive-compulsive,"" Yankovic said, ""but he seems to have a lot of ideas, his head is filled with a lot of random thoughts. I don't know if that's typical of all nerds, but that's sort of how my brain is. If I can extrapolate it, maybe that's something I share with Billy."" Lucky for Billy, Yankovic said, nerdy qualities come in handy professionally. He ought to know: Yankovic's unabashed and overt nerdiness was met with heavy rotation on MTV in the 1980s at a time when, he said, ""being nerdy wasn't quite so hip."" ""I mean, it's an extension of who I am, so I don't have a lot of choice in the matter,"" he said. Even Yankovic's recent album ""Straight Out of Lynwood"" rides the nerd wave to success. The video for ""White and Nerdy"" has been viewed online over 100 million times. Nerds are focused and probably obsessed about a few things, Yankovic said. ""Their field of vision is narrowed, that's part of the description of a nerd, I think, but it's that kind of laser focus and attention to detail and passion that also makes them very successful in their chosen field."" ""I think when Billy finally does walk into whatever he wants to do, he'll be able to settle down and focus a bit more."" What does Yankovic mean by focus? How about weeks-long debates as to whether one of the sentences in ""When I Grow Up"" needed a semicolon, a dash or a period? This was the first time Yankovic has ever worked with an editor, Anne Hoppe from Harper Collins. For someone who has enjoyed the unhindered control of an artist, it turned out to be a positive experience. ""Anne was a great partner in this,"" he said. ""I would write her four lines of verse and she'd write me back four pages of notes."" ""We finessed this text for a very long time and I'm very happy with the way it turned out. It was just really great to have somebody that I could have those kinds of dialogues with."" Likewise, Yankovic is happy with the presentation of his ideas by illustrator Wes Hargis. The whimsy Hargis brings to the collaboration is something Yankovic feels is just right. ""He really has a childlike quality and a very fun quality and a very imaginative quality. I think it was just the perfect partnership for this picture book and I'm very glad that Anne put us together,"" he said. Yankovic confesses he's been bitten by the children's book bug. ""Regardless of how this book does, and of course I hope it does very well, but I would like to write at least a few more. It was really a wonderful experience and I'd love to do it again."" What could be better news for longtime Weird Al fans who want to make their favorite satirist a family affair?","Weird Al Yankovic's first children's book hits shelves February 1 .

"(Health.com)  -- Diet drugs have had a rough year in 2010. In October, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) nixed not one but two new weight-loss drugs, lorcaserin and Qnexa, because of possible links to cancer (lorcaserin) and heart problems (Qnexa). But this week an FDA advisory committee gave the thumbs up to a third drug, Contrave, meaning there could be a new tool on the horizon for battling obesity. (The FDA doesn't have to approve the drug, but often follows its panels' advice.) And really, doctors could use one. Previous attempts to find safe diet drugs that work by controlling appetite have met with some success, but most have been doomed by side effects. Fen-phen, heavily marketed in the 1990s, caused heart valve problems while rimonabant became linked with suicidal thinking and depression, leading an FDA advisory committee to recommend against approving it in 2007. Health.com: 10 things to say to someone with depression . ""That was the drug we were waiting for,"" says Jacob Warman, MD, chief of endocrinology at the Brooklyn Hospital Center in New York. ""We thought it would be the next big blockbuster drug for weight loss."" It wasn't. Nor was Meridia (sibutramine), which Abbott Laboratories voluntarily withdrew from the market in October due to an increased risk for heart attack and stroke. All of the drugs worked through different neurotransmitters in the brain to suppress appetite. (The only drug on the market specifically approved for dieters is orlistat, sold as Xenical and Alli, which prevents the breakdown of fat in the intestines. It was the last diet drug approved by the FDA in 1999.) Health.com: 36 holiday foods you shouldn't eat . So what's different about Contrave? Unlike various predecessors, most of which fell by the wayside because of side effects, Contrave combines two older medications into one that experts hope will help push off the pounds -- safely. ""It's kind of a neat little approach. They've taken two drugs that have been around for a very long time with relatively good safety profiles and put them together, hoping that the combined action might be better at controlling eating,"" says Paul Kenny, PhD, associate professor of molecular therapeutics at Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter, Florida. ""It's a double whammy."" The two drugs are naltrexone, used to treat alcohol and cocaine addiction, and bupropion (known mainly as Wellbutrin), an antidepressant, which also helps people quit smoking. Health.com: 10 surprising facts about antidepressant . Together, the compounds affect both appetite or satiety and motivation, or the drive to eat, says Gene-Jack Wang, MD, a senior scientist with Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York. Naltrexone impacts the brain's opioid receptors, which are involved in feelings of pleasure and reward. ""One of the reasons we eat cheesecake or something that's really good is to stimulate the opioid system,"" Kenny explains. ""Naltrexone blocks that to some degree."" Bupropion increases brain levels of dopamine, the notorious ""feel good"" chemical that is also released when cocaine or amphetamines are taken. ""It gives you a little kick so you feel okay and don't have to look for food,"" says Dr. Wang. ""It's very similar to amphetamines, but it's not so effective, [which is] better because if it's too effective, it makes you more addicted."" Health.com: America's healthiest mall food . ""Many of the neurotransmitters bupropion increases are involved in satiety --  you've eaten enough,"" adds Kenny. ""Giving bupropion is one way of tricking the brain into thinking you're full."" In one study, the average weight loss for a group taking a higher dose (32 mg) of naltrexone plus bupropion for about a year was 6.1% while for a lower dose (16 mg) it was 5%. (People taking a placebo had an average weight loss of 1.3%.) However, only half the participants who started the trial actually finished it. People taking the drug combo were more likely to report nausea, headache, constipation, dizziness, and vomiting than those taking a placebo. And while promising, the drug is still not in the clear in terms of safety. The FDA committee was divided on Contrave's safety profile, with members ultimately voting in favor of conducting further studies on whether it might lead to heart attacks, stroke, and increased blood pressure. Personalized tips for managing diabetes: Take this test . ""Obesity is really a crisis,"" says Michael Aziz, MD, an internist with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. Two-thirds of the U.S. adult population is either overweight or obese while a growing number of adolescents are climbing into the danger range, many developing type 2 diabetes at younger and younger ages. Health.com: Could you have Type 2? 10 diabetes symptoms . Right now, there are few effective tools to aid in the effort, though, ultimately, many experts feel the answer to America's obesity lies not with a drug but, rather, lifestyle changes.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Homegrown movies dominated China's box office in 2013, as annual takings totaled $3.6 billion, up almost a third on 2012, official figures released on Wednesday showed. Only three of the 10 highest-grossing movies were Hollywood productions and domestic films accounted for 71% annual box office revenues, said Zhang Hongsen, head of the film bureau under the State General Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, to the state-run Xinhua news agency. This was a sharp reversal from last year when Hollywood movies captured more than half of all ticket sales and only three local movies made it into the top 10. The top grossing movie was adventure-comedy ""Journey to the West: Conquering Demons"" directed by Stephen Chow, grossing 1.25 billion yuan. ""Iron Man 3"" starring Robert Downey Jr. ranked second. Hollywood movies have been popular in China despite quotas on the number of foreign films that can be released in cinemas. However, China's movie industry, which had struggled to compete against Hollywood's big-budget, special-effect laden productions, has enjoyed something of a renaissance in the past couple of years. ""The growth of annual box office receipts is mainly driven by the continuously accelerated establishment of theaters across the country, as well as the improved quality of Chinese movies,"" Yang Shuting, senior analyst with Beijing-based EntGroup Consulting told The China Daily. In 2012, slapstick comedy ""Lost in Thailand"" became China's first homegrown movie to take more than 1 billion yuan at the box office. The upswing in the popularity of domestic fare at the Chinese box office comes as the Chinese market grows in importance for Hollywood studios. It became the world's second largest in 2012. According to the China Daily, almost 5,100 screens were added in across China last year, bringing the total to more than 18,000 . To appeal to Chinese movie-goers, Hollywood is increasingly making use of Chinese backdrops, themes, plot devices and actors in what some commentators have described as ""kow towing."" For example, ""Gravity"" which ranked 10th in box office takings, features China's Tiangong space station and the lead character, played by Sandra Bullock, makes her journey back to earth in a Chinese space capsule.","China's box office takings total $3.6 billion in 2013, up a third on 2012 .

"(CNN) -- Tunisians filled the streets with the help of Twitter. Egypt's protests were coordinated on Facebook pages like that of internet activist Wael Ghonim. Libyan dissenters spread the word about their ""day of rage"" last week the same way. And yet, in these heady days where the entire Middle East seems to be inspired to organize online in revolt against autocracy, it has become fashionable for experts to dismiss the role of social media in 2011's revolutions. ""People protested and brought down governments before Facebook was invented,"" the New Yorker's Malcolm Gladwell opined on February 2. A few weeks later, The Financial Times' Gideon Rachman reminded us that ""the French managed to storm the Bastille without the help of Twitter -- and the Bolsheviks took the Winter Palace without pausing to post photos of each other on Facebook."" True enough -- and utterly irrelevant. Those uprisings had a strong assist from contemporary technology too. The Bolshevik revolution would hardly have happened without the telegraphs and trains that spirited Lenin to the Finland station at the right moment. And what would the French revolution have been without the latest high-tech gadget, hot from the workshop of Dr. Joseph Guillotin? Yes, of course, technology alone doesn't make revolutions. The will of the people is the most vital ingredient. To foment revolt, first let their resentment simmer for a few decades. But that doesn't mean social media cannot provide wavering revolutionaries with vital aid and comfort. Remember the kids interviewed in Tahir Square the night Mubarak resigned? What struck me most was what they were doing while waiting for the reporter to finish his introduction: thumbing on their smartphones. Want to hazard a guess at the website they were checking? Consider what Facebook is: It's the internet, refined and focused like a laser beam that bounces off you and your acquaintances with unsurpassed speed. None of its features are particularly new. They're tried and tested. We've been sharing instant messages, blog-like daily details and rants, and coordinating projects and meetups online since those Tahir Square kids were babes in arms. We've just never done all that in the same place, in front of so many of our friends, for hours at a time. We've never created a club that's half a billion people strong and growing faster than ever, a club with room in it for literally any point of view. And we've certainly never carried that club in our pockets, around the world. Consider what else that makes Facebook: Democracy in action, or at least the closest thing we see in our daily lives. A cacophony of viewpoints explode out of the briefest statements. Could you imagine how many comments you'd get on your Facebook wall in the next 10 minutes if you posted ""I <3 Ghadaffi?"" (Go ahead, try it. We'll wait.) Now imagine you're a dictator trying to infiltrate those acres of free speech. Can't be done. Who wants to friend a Libyan secret policeman? (Ask your pals, they probably now think you are one.) Keeping a beady eye on who said what to whom in this cacophony could take a lifetime. You could, of course, shut down the entire internet. Mubarak tried that, and it quickly became apparent that he'd also cut off the country's lifeblood: commerce and tourism. Or you could do what China has done for the last two years, and block access to Twitter and Facebook specifically. In which case, you draw attention to their power, and give rise to homegrown copycats (such as Renren.com and Kaixin001, in China's case.) Gladwell is right to argue that only strong social ties create revolutions. But he is wrong to say that Twitter and Facebook constitute weak social ties. He may believe this because he is a highly productive writer, and may never have been sucked into a two-hour Facebook hole. Those of us who have know what it's like down there. It isn't some kind of vapid virtual bar scene. Okay, there is an element of that: The sense of perpetual party is what draws so many there in the first place. But what keeps us there is the fact that barriers between friends -- lack of time, too much distance, lazy years-long silences -- are annihilated. The faces of Egypt's Revolution 2.0 . Post a quick dumb comment on an old estranged friend's status update, and the next thing you know you're trading viewpoints like college roommates. Start a Facebook group for your passion project, and realize you were never alone in wanting to make your ideal real. It is impossible to live in that kind of environment -- and make no mistake, we are starting to live there -- without noticing how much the real world fails to measure up. As Facebook continues to spread -- the trend line suggests it will reach 3 billion users, or roughly half the planet, by 2017 -- more and more monolithic cultures are in for a shock.

"(CNN) -- How do you protect some of the world's rarest large mammals from rampant poaching in an area about six times the size of Manhattan? Conservationists in Kenya believe the answer could come from the skies. Nestled in the shadow of the majestic Mount Kenya, Ol Pejeta Conservancy is a 90,000-acre game reserve boasting a wide array of wildlife, including the endangered black and white rhinos, elephants, leopards, lions and chimpanzees. Since late 2009, it has also been home to four of the last seven northern white rhinos left in the world. Despite its vast size, the privately owned conservancy relies on a team of just 190 rangers -- 40 of whom are armed -- to safeguard the wildlife roaming its grass plains and acacia-dotted savannah. Rhinos, in particular, are in great danger as their horns, which are highly coveted in some parts of the world for their supposed healing powers, are increasingly being targeted by highly equipped criminal syndicates. Armed with big guns, chainsaws and night-vision equipment, poachers seem to prefer targeting privately owned game parks, where security is often a big expense that not all of them can afford. But now bosses at Ol Pejeta are planning to test an innovative solution to supplement their security efforts for the protection of the endangered animals: unmanned aerial drones that will help monitor and track wildlife across the reserve night and day, as well as providing immediate notifications over the presence of poachers. Read: Boy's website helps tourists spot big beasts . Last week, the Kenyan conservancy successfully concluded its campaign to raise $35,000 via crowd-funding website Indiegogo to help it buy its first drone from U.S. company Unmanned Innovation Inc. The electrically powered ""aerial ranger,"" with a final cost of about $70,000, will be fitted with a high-definition camera featuring a powerful zoom for day operations and infrared thermal imaging for night flights. Each aerial mission is expected to cover an area of 50 square miles over a 90-minute flight. It will fly three or four times a day, monitoring the locations of the endangered species and transmitting a live stream to a laptop on the ground, providing key information that will enable rangers to reach vulnerable areas and fend off any potential poaching dangers. Unarmed drones have been deployed by a number of conservancies across the world in recent years to protect endangered species but this is the first time they will be tested in East Africa, say Ol Pejeta staff. Rob Breare, who is heading up the Kenyan conservancy's project, says drones can be a key weapon against illegal hunters, adding to the efficiency of other measures adopted in recent years, such as intensifying staff training, installing a fully electrified perimeter fence and tracking each of the reserve's 110 rhinos every three days. ""On the most basic level, it's just a sheer deterrent factor,"" he says. ""If people hear them, if they know there's an eye in the sky, it's a huge deterrence to try anything."" He adds: ""The next level up is what we call observation -- the ability to use our camera footage to see what's going on in situations and direct our rangers to a location."" Rhino poaching has soared in recent years in parts of Africa. Ol Pejeta claims that a rhino horn can bring in $12,000, but exact prices are hard to measure. Some say a kilogram of rhino horn is more valuable than gold, though that is disputed by others. Read: Last of the bush trackers on the trail of a dying art . There are about 25,000 rhinos in Africa, according to conservation group Save the Rhino. Of those, about 20,700 live in South Africa and some 960 in Kenya. Recent data by the South African government showed that 668 rhinos were slaughtered last year in the country -- a nearly 50% jump compared to 2011. Richard Vigne, chief executive at Ol Pejeta, say that Kenya is losing similar numbers of rhinos as South Africa in percentage terms. ""It is very bad and getting worse for both rhinos and elephants,"" he adds, noting that Ol Pejeta lost seven rhinos in the 2010-2011 period but managed to control the situation over the last 12 months. Vigne says that strong demand for horns from China and the Far East has created a lucrative poaching market that's attracted organized criminals who are increasingly using more sophisticated methods in their illegal activities. ""The equation is simple,"" explains Vigne. ""The higher the prices obtainable for ivory and rhino horn, the bigger the risks people will take to obtain these commodities and the more attractive they become for organized criminal syndicates."" Read: Save wildlife trafficking . Ol Pejeta, which welcomes about 80,000 visitors annually, is hoping to be able to expand its drone fleet and ultimately share its experience with neighboring game reserves. But more than just a valuable anti-poaching tool, staff at Ol Pejeta believe that the drones have benefits that can extend to several other key aspects of conservation. They plan to chip the rhinos and other endangered animals with unique radio frequency ID tags, which the drones will be able to recognize and locate. Conservationists hope that this system will let them gather data on animal behavior that could prove to be useful for academic purposes as well as boosting tourism activities. ""What we ultimately want to get to is what we've been calling tracking,"" explains Breare. ""The ability to use the drones not only for anti-poaching operations but actually to track animal movement and animal behavior ... In the long run we can have some quite interesting ideas around how drones can be used in tourism.""

"(CNN) -- China's top court has banned the use of torture to extract confessions, the latest in a series of reforms to its criminal justice system. According to state-run news agency Xinhua, a document released by China's Supreme People's Court on Thursday stated that evidence and testimony obtained through torture and illegal methods such as forcing the accused to suffer extreme temperatures, hunger and fatigue -- must be ruled out by judges. Xinhua said that torture has been a practice of ""widespread concern"" and was used by some Chinese law enforcement personnel to wrap up cases quickly through forced testimony or a confession. ""Evidence must be valued,"" Xinhua quoted the document as saying. ""The traditional concept and practice of a testimony being the most paramount should be changed, and more attention should be paid to examining and using material evidence."" The court document came after China announced a series reforms following a four-day closed-door meeting in Beijing earlier this month. Last week, China said it plans to abolish the ""re-education through labor"" system under which tens of thousands are imprisoned in China without trial. The reform plan also promised to reduce the number of crimes that carry death sentences. Capital punishment should be handed down by seasoned judges and must be ruled out if evidence is not sufficient, the court document said. Human rights groups cautioned that the announcement by the Supreme People's Court, while an encouraging step, should not pass as real reform yet. Nicholas Bequelin of Human Rights Watch said that the document demonstrated that there were people inside the system pushing for progress, and that alone was significant. He said in a statement posted on the organization's website, that this was the latest step China had taken in recent years to try to address the ""most glaring"" defects of China's criminal law system and one paper document was not likely to bring about major changes. ""For one, it only speaks to the courts, while it's the police, a much more powerful institution than China's weak courts, that does the torturing,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Google recently announced that it would start including individual users' names and photos in some ads. This means that if you rate some product positively, your friends may see ads for that product with your name and photo attached -- without your knowledge or consent. Meanwhile, Facebook is eliminating a feature that allowed people to retain some portions of their anonymity on its website. These changes come on the heels of Google's move to explore replacing tracking cookies with something that users have even less control over. Microsoft is doing something similar by developing its own tracking technology. More generally, lots of companies are evading the ""Do Not Track"" rules, meant to give users a say in whether companies track them. Turns out the whole ""Do Not Track"" legislation has been a sham. It shouldn't come as a surprise that big technology companies are tracking us on the Internet even more aggressively than before. If these features don't sound particularly beneficial to you, it's because you're not the customer of any of these companies. You're the product, and you're being improved for their actual customers: their advertisers. This is nothing new. For years, these sites and others have systematically improved their ""product"" by reducing user privacy. This excellent infographic, for example, illustrates how Facebook has done so over the years. The ""Do Not Track"" law serves as a sterling example of how bad things are. When it was proposed, it was supposed to give users the right to demand that Internet companies not track them. Internet companies fought hard against the law, and when it was passed, they fought to ensure that it didn't have any benefit to users. Right now, complying is entirely voluntary, meaning that no Internet company has to follow the law. If a company does, because it wants the PR benefit of seeming to take user privacy seriously, it can still track its users. Really: if you tell a ""Do Not Track""-enabled company that you don't want to be tracked, it will stop showing you personalized ads. But your activity will be tracked -- and your personal information collected, sold and used -- just like everyone else's. It's best to think of it as a ""track me in secret"" law. Of course, people don't think of it that way. Most people aren't fully aware of how much of their data is collected by these sites. And, as the ""Do Not Track"" story illustrates, Internet companies are doing their best to keep it that way. The result is a world where our most intimate personal details are collected and stored. I used to say that Google has a more intimate picture of what I'm thinking of than my wife does. But that's not far enough: Google has a more intimate picture than I do. The company knows exactly what I am thinking about, how much I am thinking about it, and when I stop thinking about it: all from my Google searches. And it remembers all of that forever. As the Edward Snowden revelations continue to expose the full extent of the National Security Agency's eavesdropping on the Internet, it has become increasingly obvious how much of that has been enabled by the corporate world's existing eavesdropping on the Internet. The public/private surveillance partnership is fraying, but it's largely alive and well. The NSA didn't build its eavesdropping system from scratch; it got itself a copy of what the corporate world was already collecting. There are a lot of reasons why Internet surveillance is so prevalent and pervasive. One, users like free things, and don't realize how much value they're giving away to get it. We know that ""free"" is a special price that confuses peoples' thinking. Google's 2013 third quarter revenue was nearly $15 billion with profit just under $3 billion. That profit is the difference between how much our privacy is worth and the cost of the services we receive in exchange for it. Two, Internet companies deliberately make privacy not salient. When you log onto Facebook, you don't think about how much personal information you're revealing to the company; you're chatting with your friends. When you wake up in the morning, you don't think about how you're going to allow a bunch of companies to track you throughout the day; you just put your cell phone in your pocket. And three, the Internet's winner-takes-all market means that privacy-preserving alternatives have trouble getting off the ground. How many of you know that there is a Google alternative called DuckDuckGo that doesn't track you? Or that you can use cut-out sites to anonymize your Google queries? I have opted out of Facebook, and I know it affects my social life. There are two types of changes that need to happen in order to fix this. First, there's the market change. We need to become actual customers of these sites so we can use purchasing power to force them to take our privacy seriously. But that's not enough. Because of the market failures surrounding privacy, a second change is needed. We need government regulations that protect our privacy by limiting what these sites can do with our data. Surveillance is the business model of the Internet -- Al Gore recently called it a ""stalker economy."" All major websites run on advertising, and the more personal and targeted that advertising is, the more revenue the site gets for it. As long as we users remain the product, there is minimal incentive for these companies to provide any real privacy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bruce Schneier.","Bruce Schneier: It's no surprise that companies are tracking us more aggressively .
Schneier: Keep in mind that you're the product; their real customers are the advertisers .
He says for example, the ""Do Not Track"" law is essentially useless to protect consumers .
Schneier: Many sites run on advertising; companies have little incentive to provide privacy ."
"(CNN) -- Mark Webber will start on pole position for Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix but it was seven-time champion Michael Schumacher who qualified fastest after a flying lap which evoked memories of his finest years. The 43-year-old Schumacher brought a five-place grid penalty to Monte Carlo after his collision with Bruno Senna at the Spanish Grand Prix so will have to settle for sixth on the grid. But the form he showed in driving his Mercedes to a time of one minute 14.301 seconds suggested he has lost none of his former pace if supplied with a competitive car. To back that up, his teammate and fellow German Nico Rosberg will start on front row with Red Bull's Webber after producing the third best lap of the day. But all eyes were on Schumacher, who drove a lap of celebration with one finger in the air in celebration. Bernie: I'll run F1 until I die . ""I'm grateful to all the trust Mercedes had in me and supported me. I'm able to give back a little bit in qualifying and hope I can give more back tomorrow,"" he told gathered reporters. Australia's Webber also produced a brilliant lap to out qualify his teammate, two-time defending champion and championship leader Sebastian Vettel. The German will start from a lowly ninth on the grid. Webber sportingly accepted that it had been Schumacher who had claimed the spotlight, but he is well placed to repeat his 2010 win in on the classic street circuit. ""It is Michael's day,"" he told the official post-race press conference. ""That was a good lap from him. It was a tight session and lots of different people arrived at the back end of qualifying with different situations with tires. ""It was a pretty good lap and I'm happy with it. It's a very good position to be starting tomorrow."" Pastor Maldonado, who won the Spanish GP for Williams to become the fifth different winner this season in five races, qualified ninth fastest but was relegated 10 places. Stewards took a dim view of the Venezuelan impeding Sergio Perez of Mexico during an earlier practice session Saturday. Britain's Lewis Hamilton will go from third place on the grid but his McLaren teammate Jenson Button was only 12th best. Frenchman Romain Grosjean of Lotus will start fourth ahead of the two Ferraris of two-time champion Spaniard Fernando Alonso and Brazilian Felipe Massa. Finn Kimi Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion, was eighth for Lotus.","Mark Webber on pole for Sunday's Monte Carlo Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- A Chinese man was executed on Tuesday for keeping six women in a dungeon as sex slaves and killing two of them, state media reported. The official Xinhua news agency said that Li Hao had been convicted of murder, rape, illegal detention, organized prostitution and making pornography for profit in 2012. The 36-year old dug the dungeon in the basement of a residential compound he bought in 2009, Xinhua said. The six women Li tricked into coming home with him were held there for between two and 21 months. Li repeatedly raped the women, forced them to appear in pornographic web shows from March to April 2011 and made them have sex with customers for a brief period, it added. The death penalty had been approved by the Supreme People's Court, Xinhua said, after a higher court upheld the sentence handed down by the Luoyang Intermediate People's Court in November 2012. Li was executed ""according to law"" after meeting relatives in a detention house in Luoyang, Henan province, a statement issued by the Supreme People's Court said, according to Xinhua. Three of the women held captive were also found guilty of murder over the killings of two of their fellow captives, the report said. However, the court was lenient in its judgment of the women because of the circumstances in which they were held, finding they acted under instruction, and in one case coercion, from Li. One of the women was sentenced to three years in prison and the other two were placed on probation.","Chinese man executed for keeping six women as sex slaves and killing two of them .

"(CNN) -- It was Bayern Munich's first league defeat this season -- and the German club's first in 54 Bundesliga games. It even came against one of the team's Bavarian rivals. But coach Pep Guardiola is already looking ahead to a bigger prize. With the domestic title wrapped up in record time, the Spaniard rang the changes for Saturday's match against Augsburg as he introduced three teenage debutants. It backfired spectacularly, as an error by young defender Mitchell Weiser handed striker Sascha Molders a first-half goal that ultimately settled the match for the eighth-placed home side -- beaten 2-0 by Bayern in the German Cup in December. But for Guardiola, the main thing was his squad escaped unscathed ahead of Wednesday's Champions League quarterfinal second leg against Manchester United, which he described as ""a matter of life or death."" The defending champions will be without suspended midfielders Javi Martinez and Bastian Schweinsteiger following the midweek 1-1 draw at Old Trafford. ""We fought hard and tried different approaches. You can't always win. A defeat was on the cards sooner or later,"" Guardiola said. ""We accept that and we need to prepare as soon as possible for the game against Manchester United. We didn't lose because of the younger players. Hojbjerg and Weiser were the best players on the pitch. ""They've trained with us a lot, they know how we play and also know what I want. Hats off to the three of them. We're in a final on Wednesday. It's a matter of life and death."" Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer emphasized the importance of the upcoming European match. His team's only defeat this campaign came in the group stage against Manchester City, with qualification already assured. ""The main thing for us was that nobody got injured today. That's the crucial point,"" he said. ""It's all about Wednesday and the match against Manchester United. Nothing else matters."" Bayern's defeat meant second-placed Borussia Dortmund closed the gap to 20 points with a 2-1 win at home to Wolfsburg. Poland striker Robert Lewandowski, who missed Dortmund's 3-0 Champions League defeat at Real Madrid in midweek due to suspension, celebrated his return with the equalizing goal after Ivica Olic's opener. Marco Reus netted a 77th-minute winner. Third-placed Schalke could only draw 1-1 at Werder Bremen, while Borussia Monchengladbach moved above Bayer Leverkusen into fourth on goal difference with a 2-0 win at second-bottom Nuremberg.","Bayern Munich coach shrugs off club's first defeat this season .

"(CNN) -- Louis Oosthuizen successfully defended his Volvo Golf Champions title in Durban Sunday despite still feeling the effect of injuries which have derailed his career. The South African won the 2010 British Open at St Andrews and lost a playoff to Bubba Watson at the 2012 U.S. Masters but injuries ruined his challenge in the majors last season. All that was forgotten as he won on home soil for the fourth year running and extended his record of claiming a title on the European Tour every year for the last five. A run of four birdies in the last six holes saw him card a final round 68 for 12-under, one shot clear of compatriot Branden Grace and two ahead of Dutchman Joost Luiten and third round leader Tommy Fleetwood of England. Oosthuizen is hoping he can take a well-deserved break and go into the first major of the season in Augusta in good shape. ""I've got three weeks now that I really need to work on my back,"" Oosthuizen told the official European Tour website. ""It's still not 100 per cent. Luckily this week I didn't have to hit a lot of drivers, but once I get to Augusta I need to hit driver,"" he added. Grace birdied the final hole to put Oosthuizen under pressure, but he responded superbly with two birdies of his own to finish. ""I saw that Branden had made birdie on 18 so I knew that second shot was crucial to give myself a good opportunity and I hit it really close,"" he said. ""And then 18, everyone thinks you just need to make a birdie but around that green it's not easy and luckily I was far enough past where I could pitch it back into the grain and get it close."" Behind the title contenders, Ireland's Padraig Harrington, who has not won on the European Tour since his 2008 U.S. PGA triumph, came through the field with a 67 to finish tied fifth at nine under.","Louis Oosthuizen wins Volvo Golf Champions event in South Africa .

"(CNN) -- The daily toll of gun murders, and the increasing frequency and scale of mass shootings, have finally forced Washington to rethink gun policy. Predictably, emotions are running high on TV talk shows and congressional panels. So it's a good time to remind ourselves that Americans -- including gun owners -- actually agree about what to do now, and have for a very long time. From requiring criminal background checks on all gun sales to getting military-style assault weapons off our streets, Americans understand that it's entirely possible to respect the rights of law-abiding gun owners and do much more to keep people safe. The nation may be politically divided, but on guns there has long been a broad and enduring consensus. The only people who seem to disagree are the National Rifle Association's Washington lobbyists. What was once a modest gun rights and gun safety organization is long gone. Today, as New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has said, it is principally a marketing organization, and its flagship product is fear. Opinion: Gun extremists' alternate reality . This sad development was on full display during Wednesday's Senate hearing on gun violence, where NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre claimed that background checks for gun buyers -- a two-minute process that most gun buyers are happy to undergo -- will become ""a universal federal nightmare imposed upon law-abiding people all over the country."" As an alternative, LaPierre has suggested that the answer to guns is more guns -- in the hands of almost anyone, in almost every place in America: every classroom, every daycare center, every movie theater, every shopping mall, every place of worship. If more guns in more places is the NRA's proposal, we've run a pretty good pilot project -- and the results aren't good. The U.S. already has more firearms per capita than any other nation, making it the most heavily armed civilian population in the world. We have a gun murder rate that is about 15 times higher than other populous, high-income countries. This correlation has lost the power to surprise -- except perhaps for LaPierre, who believes ""the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun."" Complete coverage: The gun debate . If only it were that simple. This isn't just about good guys and bad guys. Very often, the good guys get shot by bad guys with guns. This is about smart policies and dangerous ones. Gun owners know this, too. Those like my dad, a former firearms dealer in Colorado, are mainstream Americans with mainstream views on guns. That's why 74% of NRA members and 87% of non-NRA gun owners believe all gun buyers should get a criminal background check. A CBS/New York Times poll released on January 17 found 93% of those living in households with gun owners and 85% in households with NRA members support background checks. They believe we have the right to bear arms, and they believe with rights come responsibilities. An instant background check is not too high a price to pay, when we know the current system -- even with big loopholes -- has saved many lives. We have the right to go to the movies without being gunned down in our seats. We have the right to pray in our houses of worship without being victimized by a mentally unstable young man and his assault weapon. More than anything, we have the right to send our kids to school in the morning with the guarantee that they'll return home in the afternoon. Opinion: Why the NRA fights for gun rights . Until lawmakers stand up to the gun lobby and stand up for the people they represent, the death toll will only continue to rise -- 33 people murdered with guns, every day, everywhere, in the world's indispensable nation. When they do, they'll have major police organizations, survivors of gun violence, faith leaders, domestic violence opponents, many millions of parents, and more than 850 Mayors Against Illegal Guns standing with them. If it's electoral retribution they're worried about, they should look at the last election. After investing more millions than ever to defeat President Barack Obama and elect pro-gun politicians, the NRA had one of the worst success rates of all political groups: a 0.83% return on a massive investment of its members' hard-earned money. We can pass commonsense gun laws that will save many lives. The American people are demanding it, the president is demanding it, the families of the dead are demanding it. It's time for our leaders to buck the NRA's Washington lobbyists. It's not as hard as they think. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"(CNN) -- From her very humble beginnings in Barranquilla, Colombia, she rose to be one of her country's most coveted beauty queens. At 21, Angie Sanclemente Valencia was crowned as Colombia's ""Queen of Coffee."" It was 2000 and the beginning of a career that would propel Sanclemente into the world of her dreams as an internationally acclaimed model. After winning the Colombian pageant, she quickly found work as a lingerie model in Mexico and other countries. She also started training as an actress and took theater lessons. But Sanclemente's career came to a screeching halt in May of 2010 when she was arrested in Argentina and charged with drug trafficking. Interpol had issued an arrest warrant against her in December of the previous year after she was connected to a 21-year-old woman who was arrested just before she was to board a flight to Cancun, Mexico, from Buenos Aires carrying 55 kilograms of cocaine (120 pounds). The fallen beauty was on the run for five months, hiding in Argentina. While on the run, Sanclemente continued to update her Facebook page. In a Facebook message to CNN in 2010, she denied any involvement in the case, writing, ""I'm very sad and hurt by the bad information. I don't know how the press can destroy an innocent person."" After being convicted in early November, Sanclemente is speaking from prison for the first time. It's quite a change from the life of glamor she lived before her arrest. ""I have been here [in prison] one year and seven months. I'm innocent of all of the accusations. It was all a big misunderstanding,"" Sanclemente said. Her 2010 arrest was an international scandal and her Interpol mugshot made headlines around the world. The former queen of coffee became known as ""the queen of cocaine."" Four men and two other women were also arrested in connection with the case. Argentinian authorities charged her with leading a ring of fashion models to smuggle cocaine from South America and into Europe, via Cancun. She says her Argentinian boyfriend and his uncle, who are also in prison, were indeed involved in drug trafficking, but not her. ""It may sound ridiculous and incredible, but I'm innocent of this farce they invented. My boyfriend made a mistake, and I'm paying the consequences. But I love him and I love him because he loves me just the way I am. I never found in anybody else what I found in him,"" Sanclemente said. Now 32 and sentenced to six years and eight months behind bars, the promising career she once had seems like a vanished dream. Nicolas Gualco, her boyfriend, and Daniel Monroy, Gualco's uncle, have also received the same sentence. Moving to Argentina from Mexico, Sanclemente says in retrospect, was a big mistake. ""I regret having taken the flight to Argentina, to be honest with you."" Sanclemente had expressed regret once before about making the wrong choices. She was dethroned as Colombia's queen of coffee for breaking the rules by having been married. Reports say that she was once married to a Mexican drug trafficker, but she's always denied that was the case. In an interview shortly after being dethroned, she spoke about the consequences of not listening to the woman who raised her as single mother. ""I'm very capricious and a lot of [bad] things have happened to me for not listening to my mother,"" Sanclemente says. Her words now seem prophetic. Journalist Jose Manuel Rodriguez in Buenos Aires contributed to this report .","Angie Sanclemente Valencia contends she is innocent .

"(CNN) -- If there's one fundamental truth about video games, it's that smash hits tend to leave a lasting impression. Since players often share their company for weeks, months and sometimes years on end, these titles' faces become as familiar and welcome as those of any friend. It's no surprise, then, that from ""Castlevania"" to ""Mortal Kombat,"" many series are making a comeback. Of course, fans can always replay classics via online services such as the iPhone App Store, PlayStation Network, Xbox 360's Game Room and the Wii's Virtual Console. But a number of new retail and downloadable outings actually promise to go one step further and rewrite gaming history by year's end. Each of these remakes or reboots lets you not just relive your misspent youth but revisit familiar faces in entirely new contexts. Whether you're a former arcade rat or a slave to the Super Nintendo, all should prove equal parts fresh and familiar. Below are just a few examples of retro gaming franchises making high-profile reappearances shortly, all of which should soon have thumbs happily waggling and eyes misty with déjà vu. ""NBA Jam"" (Electronic Arts, Wii) -- The arcade basketball game that single-handedly brought our GPA to its knees, this two-on-two baller picks up where its predecessors left off, offering more gravity-defying dunks and gleeful, rule-violating blocks. New features include boss battles, motion control support, secrets galore and a modern-day roster of huge-headed celeb athletes to pit against one another in smack-talking multiplayer showdowns. Don't be surprised if your former college roommate calls, wanting a rematch. ""Splatterhouse"" (Namco, PlayStation 3/Xbox 360) -- Notable at the time for their level of gore and horrific imagery, the 1988 cult classic arcade game and subsequent TurboGrafx-16 and Sega Genesis versions now seem quaint by today's standards. Adding more bloodshed (including gruesome finishing moves), greater freedom of movement and a spine-tingling shock horror aesthetic, the modern-day version introduces more combat moves and a high-definition makeover. Still, the plot remains a throwback, as skull mask-wearing hero Rick attempts to save his kidnapped girlfriend from a legion of grotesqueries. ""Donkey Kong Country Returns"" (Nintendo, Wii) -- This update takes the 16-bit classic, once noted for its striking graphics, and transplants its side-scrolling action to a modern context, layering 3-D effects on top of 2-D elements. Jump over yawning chasms, blast out of cannons or screech along in mine carts -- solo or with simultaneous help from a friend -- while battling bosses, nabbing bananas and hunting for hidden secrets. A heady mix of button-mashing thrills and platform-hopping excitement, the game lets you party like it's 1994.

"(CNN) -- During the past two years, I have been digging into the intimate relationships of 150 women, ages 20 through 90, for my new book, ""Sex After ... Women Share How Intimacy Changes as Life Changes."" I take readers from the honeymoon hots through tepid midlife to some surprisingly steamy senior sex. Many of my subjects describe easy and sexy romances; others are pushing through emotional and physical roadblocks. Here are snapshots of some of those stories of tough love. Postpartum blues . Between 10-15% of women suffer from postpartum depression that affects sexual desire and can cause serious rifts in a young marriage. Texas psychologist Christine Hall's struggle through the blues after childbirth led her to create a specialty practice in treating clients with postpartum mood disorders. Hall's own depression was so severe that for a flash she considered taking her own life. With the help of a supportive husband, therapy and anti-depressants, she fought her way back. Here is a snippet of our interview that appears in the ""Sex After Baby"" chapter: . I see in my practice that sex can really cause a lot of distance between the couple. The spouse is thinking, ""All right, the OB said we could have sex after six weeks. Let's go to it, honey."" And the new mom is telling me, ""Oh my God, I can't do this yet. I am still fat and sad and I am not ready to have anyone close to me -- other than the baby!"" I tell them my own story, that there is hope -- I'm at a really good place now. You go from not feeling sexy at all and trying to get across to your partner, ""Hey these are not your boobs right now' to feeling 'hey I'm ready, let's do it'. 'It's only a leg' Richaela's husband, Derek, was deployed to Afghanistan three weeks after their wedding. She was 20, and he was 22. Six months later, Derek stepped on an improvised explosive device and lost part of his right leg. To add to the bedlam of this tragedy, Richaela gave birth to their daughter, Madeline, early on in Derek's treatment at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. After excruciating hard work to become intimate again, emotionally and physically, they are now enjoying ""full-on sex,"" Richaela told me, and a very sturdy marriage. Here is a portion of her story: . When this first happened to Derek, I just felt helpless, like I would never get my husband back. He was so depressed and angry, and he also had post traumatic stress disorder. I felt like leaving the marriage, and it was hard to become intimate again. He'd want to have sex, but with the pain in his leg, he couldn't bear weight. Once we figured out how to finally do it, every time we'd finish with an orgasm, his leg would jolt with pain. It made me feel really bad because he would say ""I want to have sex with you,"" but it would hurt him afterward. Honestly, we don't have sex in long sessions any more like we used to because he just gets tired more quickly. I don't really mind. At least I have my husband! You come to realize that love in marriage comes from so many other things than what our bodies can do. It's only a leg; I've seen far worse when we were at Walter Reed. There were many men with two and three limbs missing, plus genital injuries. Sex after breast cancer . Five years ago, Sophia was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer at 37. She had her left breast removed and reconstructed, then endured months of chemotherapy and radiation that left her weak and bald and frightened that she would not live to see her two young kids enter kindergarten. Tanned in a low-cut sundress, today Sophia is cancer-free, and she offers a hopeful message to the one in eight American women who will be struck with breast cancer in their lifetimes. Here is a swatch of our conversation: . My husband was surprisingly turned on by my new look. It was like he got to sleep with another woman. Though I am not thrilled with the way my chest looks. I prefer to have sex with my shirt on now, because it makes me think less about how my breasts used to be. Recovering from cancer, while the physical intimacy was good, I would often feel like I needed more emotional support from him. And I should have asked for it; this is a lesson I can pass on to other women in my situation. I created the problem really, because in my efforts to be strong in front of the kids and to just keep going forward, I let my husband assume I was invincible. And he was so turned on by how tough I was, this Warrior Woman, I didn't let myself be weak with him. In retrospect, I should have told him the truth, that I was often tired. That I was scared the cancer would come back. That I was vulnerable and just needed him to hold me. Let's talk about sex ... and cancer . The midlife itch . The 15-year mark in a marriage is a popular juncture for divorce and infidelity. Affairs that are outed can either wreck a marriage or open communication lines, as remorse leads to forgiveness and potentially a more honest union. Increasingly, though, I found in composing this book that many people who take on lovers do so in secret, so as not to rock the boat. Pamela, 53, is a married mother of five who last year reconnected with the ""soul mate who got away."" They are now lovers, and she is determined to keep both men in her life. Here is part of her story in the ""Sex After Infidelity"" chapter: . This previous boyfriend was my first love and my greatest lover. And he still is. Yet I do not want to leave my husband and hurt him. My marriage is a good one. I love both men, and I have chosen to keep both men. A secret life can be very sexually affirming if it stays a secret. If I went to a therapist, she would say ""choose."" I can't choose. I get the best of both worlds: I have the stability and security of my husband, an intact family for my children, and I have the passion that I want and need in my life. Sex after widowhood . While researching ""Sex After ...,"" I looked for older women whose husbands had died recently and had been their only lovers. Those wives who had nursed husbands through long illnesses were clearly grieving, yet they admitted to some relief. Patricia was married for 55 years in what she described as a ""wonderful love affair."" Her husband suffered from a chronic heart condition for most of those years and finally succumbed to leukemia. At 80, she has found solace with an old friend her age who had also lost his wife. I love Patricia's story, a portion of which she tells below, and the hopeful stories like hers in the ""Giddy Golden Girls"" chapter that shatter myths of the little old lady as fragile and dried up. I never thought I would ever want to get involved with another man. Our friend Steven would ask me out, and I would say, ""I'm not ready."" He was very romantic and persistent, though. He would send me long-stemmed white roses every two weeks. I finally went on a date with him on New Year's Eve. But I was still afraid to touch another man. At midnight, I wouldn't go near him. Then about a year after my husband died, Steven asked me to go to Paris with him. I said, ""OK, I guess it's time to try you out."" My husband was the only man I'd ever slept with, so being intimate with another man was very scary. Without giving you details, let me just say things are going well. I feel wonderful, like a teenager. The love, the making love -- it's so romantic it's almost electrifying. After taking care of someone so ill for so many years, this is fantastic. Finding love in my 80s is like opening another world I never knew could exist. Not only do I have a golf partner and a life partner, but the sex part is very, very good. It is not ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" but it is definitely erotic and warm and beautiful. Do you have a story about acclimating to sex after a major life change?

"(CNN) -- Could reliability be an Achilles heel for Formula One world champions Red Bull this season? If the first two days of winter testing are anything to go by the answer could be yes. Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel was stopped in his tracks by an engine failure after completing just eight laps in the new Red Bull racer Wednesday. ""We've not had a lot of running and have a few problems to sort out,"" Vettel told reporters at the Jerez circuit in Spain. ""But with such big rule changes it is usual to have some teething problems. ""That's what tests are for, to sort those issues out. The next two days will be important to get some track time to prepare for the tests in Bahrain."" Vettel, who only managed three laps in the box fresh car on Tuesday, has now returned home to Switzerland and handed the keys of the 2014 Red Bull over to his new teammate Daniel Ricciardo for the remainder of the Jerez test. Preseason testing is always a tense time but a major rule change has heaped extra pressure on the teams hoping to get their cars race ready for the opening Australian Grand Prix on March 16. The cars are now powered by 1.6-liter V6 turbo engines which also rely on a greater use of hybrid energy -- recovered through braking and from the car's exhaust gases. Although engine suppliers Renault, Ferrari and Mercedes put their engines through their paces on dynamometers at their headquarters, they are running them on the cars for the first time this week. Red Bull, who along with the Lotus and Caterham teams use Renault engines, had to cut short Vettel's track time because of problem with the energy recovery system on his car. Engine gremlins also affected Toro Rosso, Red Bull's sister team, and driver Daniil Kvyat was not able to take his car out on track because of an electrical problem. McLaren recovered from the technical issues that had kept its car in the garage Tuesday to see Jenson Button set the leading time in its 2014 racer with a best lap of one minute 24.165 seconds among 44 laps overall. ""For our first day of actual running, we were able to get a good understanding of the car, and the way the engine and turbo behaves,"" Button told reporters. ""It's tricky, and very different to what we're used to, but I feel that these cars will be enjoyable to drive."" On Wednesday, McLaren also announced former Lotus team principal Eric Boullier as its new racing director as a restructure of the team continues. It was another solid day from Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, who set the second fastest time ahead of Valtteri Bottas in the Williams and Nico Rosberg's Mercedes. Rosberg underlined Mercedes' reliability by ticking off 96 laps, all the more impressive as the car had to rebuilt over night following Lewis Hamilton's crash on the opening day of the test.","Testing is cut short for Sebastian Vettel as his Red Bull is hit by engine problems .

"(CNN) -- A Canadian Forces crew calmly plucked a terrified crane operator trapped by a smoke-spewing fire in Kingston, Ontario. The Tuesday rescue was captured by television cameras and bystanders and posted to social media. The operator had moved from the cab of his crane to its very tip to escape flames and smoke from a building fire that broke out below him Tuesday, and bystanders captured the rescue in a series of images posted to social media. ""At first he was petrified, he didn't want to let go of the crane,"" rescue helicopter commander Capt. David Agnew told CNN affiliate CTV of the crane operator. The helicopter crew arrived to find smoke and flames everywhere and were concerned about the crane collapsing, Agnew told the network. A rescue specialist dropped out of the hovering helicopter on a line, secured the crane operator to himself before the air crew hoisted both back inside to safety. The crane operator suffered only minor injuries, according to CTV. The crane remained standing Wednesday, CBC reported, but engineers are concerned it could fall. A two-block area around the crane remained evacuated, the network said. The fire destroyed a student residence hall being built at Queens University, CBC reported.","Canadian Forces helicopter rescues crane operator trapped by fire .

"(CNN) -- On Sunday night ""12 Years a Slave"" took the Oscar for best picture. The film is must-watch cinema because it depicts the horrors of slavery through the eyes of a slave. Solomon Northup did all of humanity a favor when he wrote his book more than 150 years ago, and director Steve McQueen and producer Brad Pitt have earned our gratitude for turning his story into a transformative movie. Through it, viewers confront the horror of slavery, see the tearing of raw flesh from whipping, the rapes, the complete lack of privacy that slaves experienced. We see depicted the system that was designed to destroy human beings' free will during a shameful period of our nation's history. That was then, this is now. The good news is that slavery was repealed by the 13th Amendment and whites can no longer own blacks. The bad news is the troubling way that too many Americans talk about slavery in the 21st century -- or more accurately do not talk about slavery. Which brings us to Paula Deen. The celebrity chef and TV host, whose food empire tumbled over, among other things, her use of a racial epithet, has found $75 million in backing from a private-equity company and is trying to make a comeback. She's also opening a restaurant in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. My first thought on hearing this was ""Thank God it's not in my adopted city of Atlanta, Georgia."" But then I got very angry -- angry that I live in a country where someone who thinks like Deen can get a $75-million vote of confidence. Seriously?! I am not angry that in a deposition last year Deen admitted to using the N word. It is unfair to judge her based on only this, because no one is at his or her best during a deposition. No, I am angry because her views on race when she is in a more relaxed environment -- not under pressure, with plenty of time to think and choose her words -- are so wrongheaded that they require an apology. Now I fear that she has $75 million reasons to never look back. Paula Deen was interviewed by New York Times reporter Kim Severson in the fall of 2012. The interview was before a live audience and was recorded. Severson asked: ""Do you have a pride about the South that you can articulate and how do you place the racism and the slavery within that?"" Deen's response: ""I do. It's funny. My great grandfather was so devastated. The war was over. He had lost his son, he had lost the war and he didn't know how to deal with life, with no one to help operate his plantation. There were 30 something people on his books and the next year's Census I go to find there's like zero. Between the death of his son and losing all the workers, he went out I'm sure into the barn and he shot himself because he couldn't deal with those kind of changes. And they were terrific changes. I feel like the South is almost less prejudiced because black folks played such an integral part in our lives. They were like our family."" Let's acknowledge that it's sad when anyone takes his own life. But listen carefully to Deen's language. Never once does she mention slavery. Her great grandfather doesn't own slaves -- he has ""workers"" or ""people on his books."" He had no one to ""help"" operate his plantation. Is that what we're calling slave labor these days? According to Deen, whites in the South treated their slaves like ""family."" Let's travel back in time and ask, say, a man who might have been the Solomon Northup equivalent in her grandfather's plantation. We do not know how Paula Deen's forebears treated their slaves, but do you think a slave on that plantation would say he was treated like one of the family? Let's not forget that if he did tell truth, he could be punished or even killed for doing so. Only in Deen's altered universe could she think slaves were treated like family. She also tells us that Southerners are less prejudiced because of those very circumstances. Who knew that descendants of slave owners were less prejudiced ... because their relatives owned slaves? What anyone who has seen ""12 Years a Slave"" knows (if they didn't know it before) is that slavery was brutal and cruel. Somehow Deen cannot bring herself to even use the word, all the while taking credit for having slave owning relatives because that fact makes her and the rest of the South less prejudiced. Listen to Deen's words during the New York Times interview and you actually learn what her views on race are. For that she should apologize and lean in to the 21st century. Until she does, she is not worthy of a second chance. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dorothy A. Brown.","Dorothy Brown: ""12 Years a Slave"" offered harrowing depiction of slavery's horrors .

"(CNN) -- Social problems are now so prevalent in South Korea that, for the first time, an insurance company is set to offer cover for the victims of societal ""evils."" Dubbed ""four evils"" insurance, the new policy will compensate victims of the four biggest social problems of South Korean society today -- bullying in school, low-quality or ""adulterated"" food products, domestic violence and rape -- as defined by the Park Geun-hye government. An independent panel, composed of different interested parties including women's organizations and advocate groups, has been advising the insurance sector. The country's second largest non-life insurance company, Hyundai Marine & Fire, is currently ironing out the details of the new policy with the government, and will begin offering the product in March. Rooting out these societal evils has been a key initiative of Park's administration since the president came into office last year. While local media have reported that the monthly premium will be approximately â‚©10,000 ($9) to â‚©20,000 ($19) and there will be a payout limit of â‚©1 million ($930) for psychological damage claims, both the company and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) said the details are still under negotiation. ""We are not focusing on profit as we develop this new policy, but rather the social aspect of providing help to those who have been unable to receive [it] until now,"" Hyundai Marine & Life spokesperson Byung-ju Lee told CNN. While the idea was proposed to many insurance companies by the advisory panel, which isl dedicated to the eradication of the ""four evils,"" Hyundai is the only one currently developing the product. ""Municipalities would be able to take out insurance on behalf of its citizens, and schools would be able to do so on behalf of students,"" FSS non-life insurance division director Yoo Byung-soon told CNN. ""This insurance comes out of voiced needs to rescue those who cannot pay for insurance themselves,"" said Yoo. Instead of payouts being customized on a case-by-case basis, a predetermined compensation will be given once the insured meet the necessary criteria, as laid out by the company and the government. The new policy will also cover psychological damage to some extent -- a landmark move as insurance coverage for psychological services have been notoriously difficult to obtain in the past, to the point where it is widely believed that seeking psychological help will hurt insurance premiums and have a crippling impact on any future coverage. Rooting out evil . Far from being a sales gimmick, the new insurance policy is a studied reflection of the issues facing modern South Korean society. Domestic violence and rape carries a heavy social stigma, and the police and other law authorities are known to pressure women into dropping charges of sexual assault, resulting in only one in ten of cases being reported. Women's rights advocates say rapists who do get convicted serve little time and can easily avoid their sentences or fines. The Wall Street Journal reported that the number of people charged for sex crimes rose 38% in 2012, compared to four years earlier. Last July, Yonhap news agency reported that sexual assault cases had more than doubled within the past decade, but the arrest rate of perpetrators had declined by more than 8%. Along with stress from school grades, bullying is one of the causes known to contribute to South Korea's extremely high youth suicide rate. A report last year showed that the number of teen suicides in South Korea had risen 57% in 2011 compared to 2001 figures. South Korea's suicide rate among youth increased by 57% in 2011, compared to 2001, and was the biggest cause of death among teenagers in the nation. New policy . The new insurance is sure to be watched closely by other companies in addition to watchdogs and researchers. ""If the new policy is successful, out then it will give new business chances to insurance companies as well as benefits to consumers,"" Korea Insurance Research Institute vice president Ahn Chul-kyung told CNN. ""I may recommend it to consumers because it covers victims we really worry about, but to businesses, personally I'd say that in terms of risk management, other insurance companies need to see how it goes.""","Victims of school bullying, rape and other social problems will be covered under new insurance policy .

"(CNN) -- One person survived the crash of a military plane Tuesday in the mountains of eastern Algeria that left at least 77 others dead, a spokeswoman for the country's Civil Protection office said. The spokeswoman, who could not give her name in line with protocol, said there were a total of 78 people on board the plane. The man who survived has head injuries and was taken to a hospital, she added. Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika declared a three-day national mourning period and offered his condolences to the families of the victims, the state-run Algerie Presse Service (APS) reported. The Hercules C-130 was carrying members of the Algerian air force and their families, according to several media outlets in Algeria. Initial reports on the crash gave conflicting numbers, with some saying 103 people were on board the aircraft and as many as 100 had died. Others cited 52 deaths and more than two dozen missing. The plane was flying from Tamanrasset in southern Algeria to Constantine in the east, the Defense Ministry said in a statement. ""An investigative team has been created and sent to the scene to determine the cause and the exact circumstances of this tragic accident,"" the Defense Ministry statement said, adding that top military officials were heading to the crash site. The plane crashed in Mount Fertas, which is about 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of Algeris, according to APS. State radio, citing a military source, said bad weather was behind the crash. There was a snowstorm in the area when the plane went down, witnesses told the radio network.","NEW: Civil Protection office says 77 dead, 1 survivor .

"(CNN) -- It's a love match for Novak Djokovic. Tennis' world No. 1 announced his engagement to longtime girlfriend and fellow Serb Jelena Ristic, telling the world via his Facebook page and Twitter. ""Meet my fiancÃ©e and future wife :) So happy! Thank you for wonderful wishes #NoleFam and friends!"" Accompanying that tweet was a picture of Ristic kissing Djokovic on the cheek. No wedding date was given. Djokovic has been dating Ristic for about eight years. She is a regular in his box at major tournaments around the world and has modeled swimwear. But Ristic also obtained a master's degree in Luxury Management from the International University of Monaco and is the CEO of the Novak Djokovic Foundation. ""We are emotional partners,"" Ristic told Britain's Daily Mail in July. ""The emotional support we give to each other is very important. ""It's the same for me as well. He is very supportive and encouraging of the work that I do."" Only one member of the 'Big Four' in men's tennis, Roger Federer, is married. Like Djokovic, though, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray have been dating their girlfriends -- Xisca Perello and Kim Sears, respectively -- for many years. Djokovic's engagement comes days after he hit 100 weeks as No. 1, although he'll likely lose the top ranking to Nadal during the current Asian swing. Djokovic and Nadal are competing at next week's China Open in Beijing. Caroline Wozniacki is in the women's draw in Beijing -- and her high-profile relationship with golfer Rory McIlroy made news last month. An Irish newspaper reported that the former No. 1s in their respective sports split, although Wozniacki subsequently tweeted a picture of the two having breakfast together.

"(CNN) -- Despite Kate Gosselin's command to her twin daughters to just ""spit it out,"" neither Cara nor Mady Gosselin were interested in speaking much on the ""Today"" show Thursday. The 13-year-old twins, who became famous as kids on the TLC reality show ""Jon & Kate Plus 8,"" appeared on the morning show along with their mother for an interview with ""Today's"" Savannah Guthrie. The segment was supposed to be a chance for the twins to elaborate on the conversation they sparked with People magazine last week, in which they said their lives are pretty normal for having grown up under the lens of reality TV. The only problem was that neither twin wanted to speak up during the awkward sit-down -- instead, they glanced around at their mom and each other. Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy . When Guthrie asked Mady what she would say to the world about how her family is doing in their post-reality life, she was met with an ""um"" and a long pause. Mom Kate jumped in with instructions: ""Mady, your words,"" she said. ""It's your chance. Spit it out."" When that didn't work, Guthrie tried to get a response from Cara, who was just as quiet. ""This is their chance to talk, this is the most wordless I've heard them all morning,"" Kate told Guthrie. ""I don't want to speak for them."" After some coaxing and a few more lengthy silences, Mady piped up to speak for her sister. ""A lot of people think that filming our show has damaged us,"" she said. ""But it's only really helped."" The original series, ""Jon & Kate Plus 8,"" ended in 2009 along with Jon and Kate Gosselin's marriage. Kate Gosselin soldiered on with another reality show, ""Kate Plus 8,"" but that ended up getting canceled as well. Aside from the occasional celebrity weekly story or OWN interview, Kate, Jon, and their brood -- which includes their 9-year-old sextuplets, Alexis, Aaden, Collin, Hannah, Joel and Leah -- have mostly faded from view. But with the cover of People magazine's January 20 issue, Cara and Mady step back into the spotlight to correct any misconceptions the public has about their family. ""People expect us to be damaged,"" Cara said, as her sister chimed in that others ""think we're supposed to be so messed up, like, 'Ooh, the poor Gosselin kids, they're going to be scarred for life, waaaaah.' Here's the big news: We're not messed up."" ""It's so false,"" Cara said. ""We're fine. We're better than ever, actually."" Those words are likely a relief to anyone who caught the ""Today"" interview and wondered why the two were so quiet. According to Kate Gosselin, any press that they do are things that the twins agree to do. ""It's really frustrating when there is so much out there that is not true,"" she told Guthrie Thursday. ""We know the truth, and that's why they're here, even though they're tongue-tied this morning, to say, 'hey, we're OK, we're doing well.'""","Kate Gosselin and daughters Cara and Mady appeared on ""Today"" Thursday .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Jim Kelly, who parlayed his martial arts skills into a successful but brief career in action movies, has died. He was 67. Kelly's former wife Marilyn Dishman told CNN that the actor died Saturday of cancer, but did not elaborate. Kelly worked as a martial arts instructor in Los Angeles when he was tapped for his first role in the action movie, ""Melinda."" But he is best known for his work in the 1973 Bruce Lee film ""Enter the Dragon."" Kelly's appearance in the movie was brief -- fans lamented he was offed too soon -- but his electrifying Afro, lanky 6-foot-2 frame and his wisecracks left an impression. Producers came calling. And he capitalized on the attention by taking on the title role in ""Black Belt Jones"" the following year. A spate of other roles followed throughout the 70s, most notably ""Three the Hard Way,"" but then dried up. In later years Kelly took up tennis professionally, becoming a ranked player on the USTA senior circuit. ""I never left the movie business,"" Kelly told The Los Angeles Times in 2010, when a retrospective DVD set of his movies came out. ""It's just that after a certain point, I didn't get the type of projects that I wanted to do."" But he was never far from the screen or the spotlight. In 2004, he starred with basketball star Lebron James in a Nike commercial that spoofed another Bruce Lee film, ""Game of Death."" And he sometimes appeared at comic book conventions, much to the delight of his lasting fans. Among them is Anthony Bourdain, star of CNN's ""Parts Unknown."" ""RIP Jim Kelly, hero of my grind house youth,"" he posted on Kelly's Facebook page. The page posted the following announcement Sunday about the actor's death: . ""It is with sadness and regret that we must announce the passing of a great man and legend Jim Kelly. He will be deeply missed by all. Jim had great love for his family, friends, tennis and martial arts. We are devastated by Jim's passing but through faith and support from family, friends and fans-we are comforted, blessed and will remain strong. He was survived by his lifetime partner of 33 years and wife."" People we lost in 2013: The lives they lived .","Kelly's appearance in ""Enter the Dragon"" was brief .

"(CNN) -- More than 300 people on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship have become ill during a voyage, the Centers for Disease Control said on its website. According to the statement, 281 of the 3,050 passengers and 22 of 1,165 crew members of Explorer of the Seas reported vomiting and diarrhea. In a statement to CNN, Royal Caribbean International said those who fell sick have responded well to over-the-counter medication being administered on board the ship. Janet Diaz, spokesperson for Royal Caribbean International, told CNN that the ship skipped a planned stop in Haiti on Saturday and sailed directly to San Juan, Puerto Rico, where it underwent an extensive sanitizing. The agency said the cause of the illness was unknown. Diaz told CNN the use of special cleaning products designed to kill norovirus will continue to be used throughout the voyage.

"(CNN) -- It is a gruesome scene, even in a country that has seen its share of violence: three men, beheaded, with wounds peppering their bodies on all sides. The most surprising part? The attack happened inside a jail. A Brazilian newspaper on Tuesday released a video of this stomach-turning scene inside the Pedrinhas jail in Brazil's northeastern state of Maranhao. The video was recorded on December 17, the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper reported, describing how ""other prisoners pose with the bodies, showing them off like trophies."" A union of jail workers gave the gory footage to the newspaper. Many will view the video simply for the shock value, but behind this incident is a myriad of problems in the Brazilian penal system that allow an environment where something like this could unfold. The Pedrinhas jail was already under scrutiny even before the video was made public. A judge visited the jail just days after the decapitations and wrote a report demanding that the state government regain control of the inmate population. In all, 62 inmates were killed inside Pedrinhas in 2013. The judge, Douglas Martins, also documented violence against women, saying that female visitors were forced to have sex with the leaders of gangs inside the prison. ""The relatives of the powerless prisoners inside the jail are paying this price so that they won't be murdered,"" Martins told Brazil's judicial news agency. ""It is a serious violation of human rights."" Overcrowding is also a problem at this jail. There are 2,196 inmates at Pedrinhas, which was built to hold only 1,770, according to state jail officials. At the root of the violence at Pedrinhas is fighting between two rival factions -- inmates from the state's capital, and inmates from the interior of the state. In response, the federal government this week reached an agreement with the state to transfer the leaders of these warring factions to federal prisons, the state-run Agencia Brasil news agency reported. The woes at Pedrinhas are not unique to Maranhao state. Overcrowding and violence in jails are a problem in other parts of Brazil, as well as throughout Latin America. Along with the video, Folha de Sao Paulo identified the three decapitated inmates: Diego Michael Mendes Coelho, 21; Manoel Laercio Santos Ribeiro, 46; and Irismar Pereira, 34.","A newspaper releases a video of a gory scene .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Sohaib Athar was a 33-year-old IT consultant living in Abbottabad, Pakistan, last year when he settled in around midnight to get some work done. Then, something unusual happened in his quiet town. And, as many of us do, he took to Twitter to share. ""Helicopter hovering above Abbottabad at 1AM (is a rare event),"" he wrote. Unbeknownst to him, Athar was stepping into one of the year's biggest news stories: the U.S. military operation that killed notorious terrorist leader Osama bin Laden. In the days that followed, he'd become ""the man who live-tweeted Osama's death."" At the South by Southwest Interactive festival here on Saturday, Athar discussed that night, as well as how it thrust him into the still-emerging role of ""citizen journalist."" So, does posting on Twitter about a big event really make someone a journalist? Athar says yes -- even if he didn't think so at the time. ""The people who were talking, we were just trying to reverse-engineer what could have happened,"" he said. ""The media was not there at the time ... . ""We were just trying to see what could have happened because we knew the official story would probably not be the whole truth."" Athar's tweets may have been the first public account of the nighttime raid by the now-famous SEAL Team Six that killed bin Laden at his secret compound. But the significance of his posts wouldn't become clear until hours later, when President Barack Obama called a rare evening press conference to announce the news. In posts sometimes sprinkled with humor (""Go away helicopter - before I take out my giant swatter""), Athar's tweets evolved that night from his observations to messaging with a handful of other Pakistanis in Abbottabad and elsewhere to get to the bottom of things. And that, said Steve Myers, who studies media trends with the Poynter Institute, is what made him a journalist. ""Some people say tweeting about a helicopter doesn't make you a journalist and I would agree with that,"" said Myers, who shared Saturday's discussion with Athar. ""But the things he did next -- I think he acted very much in that way."" Those things included photographing bin Laden's compound, about a mile from Athar's home, the following day and conducting his own interviews with neighbors about their experiences living there. In an era when mobile-phone owners walk around with a video camera in their pocket at all times and tools like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube make broadcasting the results quick and simple, people like Athar can turn into journalists without even knowing it, Myers said. Some critics of the concept of citizen journalism note that non-professionals aren't trained to properly filter and communicate news -- that we wouldn't trust a ""citizen doctor."" But Myers notes that, in the case of accidents or emergencies, we do just that. ""It's 'first-aid journalism' or 'first-responder' journalism,"" he said. ""Later, they're going to hand it off to someone who has a more developed skill set, but they are similar skill sets."" In the days that followed his soon-famous tweets, Athar got a look at the inner workings of parts of more mainstream journalism, and wasn't always impressed. He was pressured to do exclusive interviews (about information he shared on Twitter with the world, he noted), offered money for his story and watched as some international journalists painted what he said was an inaccurate picture of Abbottabad by only focusing on poverty-stricken areas and conservative Muslims there. One tangible result of his brief fling with spotlight? The 750 or so Twitter followers he had the day before the raid swelled to about 105,000 -- before eventually settling in at around 70,000. The urge to become an international news source, though, has not been strong. ""I think I only wore the hat of journalism for a few days,"" he said. ""And then I took it off.""","Sohaib Athar was thrust into the spotlight last year by unknowingly tweeting bin Laden raid .

"(CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama announced Thursday that he has chosen former Sen. Tom Daschle to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. President-elect Barack Obama says health care must be addressed in order to fix the economy. Obama said Daschle would also serve as the director of the White House office of health reform. The president-elect said he has selected Jeanne Lambrew to be the deputy director of that office. ""[Daschle] will be responsible not just for implementing our health care plan. He will also be the lead architect of that plan,"" Obama said, calling Daschle ""one of America's foremost health care experts."" ""If we want to overcome our economic challenges, we must also finally address our health care challenge,"" Obama said. Daschle said he looked forward to that dual role of both generating and implementing reform. ""At a time that there is so much at stake, there is no question that fixing health care is and has been for many years our largest domestic policy challenge,"" Daschle said. ""Addressing our health care challenges will not only mean healthier and longer lives for millions -- it will also make American companies more competitive, address the cause of half of all of our personal bankruptcies and foreclosures, and help pull our economy out of its current tailspin."" CNN has previously reported that the 61-year-old former Senate majority leader from South Dakota would be Obama's choice, but the announcement date was unknown.  Watch Daschle talk about health care reform » . In November, Daschle said he was excited about the possibility of serving as point person in Obama's effort to change the nation's health care system. Daschle is on the health care advisory group of Obama's transition team and said he plans to write the health care plan that Obama will submit to Congress next year. ""I hope to have the plan enacted by next year, and then it will take several years to implement,"" Daschle said last month. Daschle said reforming health care in the United States must be a priority in the current economic climate. ""We can't afford not to do it,"" he said. ""If we do nothing, we'll be paying twice as much on health care in 10 years as we do today."" Daschle served as Democratic leader in the Senate from 1995 until he lost a re-election bid in 2004. Representing South Dakota, he was first elected as a congressman in 1978 and served in the House until he was elected to the Senate in 1986. He recently wrote a book on health care titled ""Critical: What We Can Do About the Health Care Crisis."" In the book, he pushed for universal health care coverage to reach 46 million uninsured Americans by expanding the federal employee health benefits program to include private employer plans together with Medicaid and Medicare. Most Republicans oppose any such plan, saying it would give too much power to the government. They've also questioned Daschle's recent work for a Washington lobbying firm. iReport.com: What do you think of Obama's cabinet picks? His wife, Linda Daschle, is a registered lobbyist for a firm that includes health care clients. But a source close to Daschle told CNN that Linda Daschle would be leaving the firm at the end of the year to set up her own company focusing on transportation lobbying in order to clear any potential conflicts of interest. As Obama continues to fill out his Cabinet, three Democratic sources say the president-elect is likely to name Steven Chu, a physicist who runs the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, as his energy secretary. The three officials said the announcement is expected next week in Chicago, Illinois, and that Obama will also name Carol Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Clinton administration, as the newly created ""climate czar"" inside the White House.

"Washington (CNN) -- The national trauma inflicted by the massacre of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School prompted an emotional and fierce debate on gun control, but the drive this spring for stricter limits led by President Barack Obama fell short in Washington. By summer, the issue had mostly faded on the political stage. It was replaced by troubling disclosures around national security leaks and U.S. surveillance, violent political turmoil in Egypt, alleged chemical weapons use in Syria, and another looming federal budget showdown. Then, an armed, 34-year-old former veteran shattered the late summer calm on Monday when he shot up the Washington Navy Yard, killing 12 people before, he, too, died. Headlines blared, first responders acted heroically, accounts of harrowing escape and sudden death filled the airwaves yet again in the United States. Another mass shooting, said the president, another test of the national psyche. And, yes, a new call for tougher gun control. ""When will enough be enough?"" Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-West Virginia, said Americas are ""becoming far too familiar with senseless, tragic violence"" and ""these repeated incidents demand our attention."" ""Congress needs to act,"" Rep. Mike Thompson said. But if the jolt delivered by the Newtown massacre last December in a first grade classroom couldn't serve as a catalyst in Congress for more extensive background checks than why would this latest incident move the debate beyond rhetoric? Initial indications are it won't even though a dozen people were slaughtered in the shadow of the Capitol. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, is still seeking the five votes needed to pass the expanded background check measure that failed last spring. But he told CNN's Dana Bash he didn't believe the shooting will impact legislation. But the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence argued the Navy Yard shooting was one more example of the failure of Washington to address the issue. ""While it is too early to know what policies might have prevented this latest tragedy, we do know that policies that present a real opportunity to save lives sit stalled in Congress, policies that could prevent many of the dozens of deaths that result every day from gun violence,"" Dan Gross, the group's president, said in a statement Monday. Did Obama strike the wrong tone on Monday? A more restrained response . Obama, who wiped away tears on the day of Newtown, briefly nodded Monday to the seemingly growing trend of such tragedies. ""So we are confronting yet another mass shooting,"" he said. ""And today, it happened on a military installation in our nation's capital."" Asked about the difference in his public reaction, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday the president was ""horrified"" by the Navy Yard killings. ""While it is a sad truth we in America seem to experience these mass shootings with all too much frequency, they are always horrifying,"" Carney said, adding that Newtown presented its own particular horror because most of the victims were so young. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, pointed to the Senate background check proposal, but stopped short of re-introducing the legislation. Rep. Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, believes the Navy Yard shooting will revive the debate, but argued outside groups opposed to any new restrictions make it unlikely that Congress will enact any new laws. ""If the past is prologue that prologue is not very helpful,"" Hoyer told reporters on Tuesday. Mark Kelly, husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, released a statement offering support to the victims' families, but did not make any calls for legislative action. However, he made sure to mention the context of the latest killings, saying they workers at the Navy Yard were not killed overseas but in ""a mass shooting here at home."" Giffords was severely wounded in a 2011 mass shooting that left six dead and 12 others injured . Dave Kopel, an adjunct professor at the University of Denver's law school, said he doubts the latest shooting will fire up Washington the same way Newtown did. Until December, Obama had largely stayed away from gun control, so his decision to lay out a series of proposals for the first time certainly fueled the post-Newtown debate, Kopel noted. ""But you can only do that once,"" he said. Opinion: Gun control is not the answer . A potential opening . Sen. Richard Blumenthal--D, Connecticut--said he believes the Navy Yard shooting makes a case for a stronger push on mental health. The shooter, Aaron Alexis, had recently made contact with two Veterans Administration hospitals for apparent psychological issues and had exhibited signs of mental problems, CNN has learned. His father said he suffered from post traumatic stress after working in 9/11 rescue efforts. ""Let us make mental health initiative a centerpiece of this renewal and reinvigoration of our effort to stop gun violence. Let us combine it with background checks and other commonsense measures,"" Blumenthal said on the Senate floor. Manchin agreed a mental health component could help nudge gun violence legislation forward. ""I'll support anything I can to rehabilitate people but also making sure people who are not rehabilitated should not be able to--because of their past and their record--not be able to purchase a gun,"" he told reporters Tuesday on Capitol Hill. Rev. Kenneth Blanchard, a Christian pastor and gun rights activist, encouraged a societal change on mental health issues rather than a ""microwave change"" through gun control. ""We failed him somewhere. Everybody around him failed. Nobody wants to put the finger on ourselves, but it's us. We're our own worst enemies,"" he said. Audit: Big problems with Navy program that screens contractors . Other factors at play . The powerful National Rifle Association has not weighed in on the latest shooting, but the organization tends to wait a short period of time after an incident before commenting. It's entirely plausible that the tone of the debate remains less-than-fiery as the country still processes the events that took place Monday. But there may also be an elephant in the room. Last week, two state senators in Colorado were booted out of office after voting in favor of the state's new gun control laws. The Navy Yard shooting represents the first national test of whether the recalls might have an impact on how Washington lawmakers react to the gun control, especially with the entire House and a third of the Senate facing reelection next year. ""(The recalls) suggest to a lot of swing elected officials, who maybe don't have deep convictions one way or the other on the gun issue, that banning arms as some sort of symbolic reaction to a crime by a mentally ill evildoer is not as politically popular,"" said Kopel, who also works as a research director of the Independence Institute, a conservative think tank in Colorado. The most recent polling, however, indicates just over half of Americans nationwide think gun control laws should be stricter. According to a CBS/New York Times Poll from early June, 51% of Americans favor stricter regulations, while 47% prefer laws are kept as they are or become less strict. Numbers in favor of tighter gun laws have dropped since the days following the Sandy Hook shooting. Mark Glaze, director of the Michael Bloomberg-backed group Mayors Against Illegal Guns, thinks the Navy Yard shooting will have an impact on the larger debate, even if the effects aren't immediate. ""It is the Chinese water torture of a series of mass shootings that are happening more rapidly and are growing more deadly,"" he said. His group will hold a previously scheduled rally Thursday on Capitol Hill, with protests specifically aimed at senators who voted against the background check proposal. CNN's Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","The immediate reaction to the Navy Yard shooting seems more restrained than after Newtown .
While some lawmakers are still calling on Congress to do something, other say action is doubtful .
Some argue mental health may be the next legislative path .
Others say Navy Yard adds to growing sense mass shootings are growing worse and more frequent ."
"(CNN) -- The world is undergoing a mobility transformation. Since Apple launched the first iPhone in 2007, more than 100 billion apps have been downloaded from app stores by consumers worldwide. Gartner, the market research firm, has predicted that by 2015, tablet sales will be higher than those of PCs and laptops combined. There are now more connected mobile devices on earth than there are people. This transformation is happening much faster than the dot-com revolution of the late 1990s, and businesses are catching on. Companies are already developing 20 to 30 apps on average in the three categories of consumer, business-to-business and (B2B) and enterprise. These are already changing the way we live and work, wherever we are. Additionally, they are changing the way businesses interact with other businesses, investors, media, customers and even their own workforce worldwide. Despite this, Gartner estimates that 60% of the Fortune 1000 companies will not have a mobile strategy in place by 2014. In my view, having a mobile strategy is not enough for businesses to succeed globally in the years to come. What businesses need is a ""mobile first"" strategy, placing mobile opportunities at the forefront of their international growth. Don't forget consumer apps . Personal media technology is already streamlining the way we deal with our daily tasks -- both in business and at home. American Express offers mobile applications that allow customers to manage their accounts on the move, improving the service as well as reducing call centre waiting times. Through similar technology, reading the Economist has never been more enjoyable (or widespread -- as the mobile and tablet apps have been downloaded six million times). The average UK family now has ten internet connected devices. The fact is that if consumers can't access your brand on multiple platforms, they will switch to one where they can. Creating effective mobile software is not easy. It requires solid software development and user interface design, not to mention thorough testing. This is perhaps why, while some 60% of organizations have consumer apps, their quality does not score high among consumers. It is not enough for the apps to be useful, people have to enjoy using them. User experience -- how an application feels -- is paramount. For ten years, Tigerspike has been working with customers who understand that user experience is about combining design and software skills with a deep knowledge of how back end systems operate. In the global market, good user interface must include the insightful localization, both in terms of language and content. These are the hallmarks of the most successful global consumer apps and when companies get them right, they build better relationships and channels of information for their customers in all countries. Enterprise apps for a global workforce . In the global work market, bring your own device policies are on the rise -- allowing employees to bring personally owned mobile devices to their workplace. Companies are therefore increasingly required to create apps for their staff -- and these need to be just as good as the consumer ones. Gartner expects 80% of businesses to support a workforce using tablets by 2014. Company leaders want mobile technology to increase productivity. In order to achieve this, it must be realized that the best apps are not always the ones that seek to bring the entire business to the smartphone or tablet, but the ones that are created to do a few things very well. The Innovation Lab at Tigerspike has recently received a patent for its quantum encryption mobile technology Karacell. It is our firm belief that this technology will transform how organizations and individuals can keep our mobile data safe on personal technology devices, with countless benefits to companies and organizations in global business. All about B2B apps . Mobile apps present new and exciting opportunities for businesses to communicate with other businesses. Some B2B companies have succeeded by using apps that support the sales process. For instance, creating presentations using an iPad allows for a more personal and engaging experience. Other companies have built deeper and more personal relationships with investors and journalists through apps -- regardless of geographical boundaries. The prime example here is Shell, whose award-winning iOS and Android apps benefit from innovative features and platform-specific functionality. At the same time, they keep the user experience consistent, making sure to deliver the most relevant content. Tigerspike's delivery of the Shell investor relations app led to a two-fold increase in dwell time and a 300 per cent increase in downloads. These are the kinds of rewards global companies cannot afford to miss out on. Future concerns: The internet of things . The mobility transformation has already given birth to another revolution: The Internet of Things. The change that we have witnessed in past years is only going to accelerate. It is expected that the number connected mobile devices will be five times higher than it is now by 2020. This will inevitably change the face of how companies deal with their global customer base. To succeed, companies must seize the opportunities they have to transform their businesses accordingly, to build more rewarding relationships and more productive workforces globally through the impact of personal media. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nic Newman.","Tablet sales are predicted to surpass PCs, laptops by 2015, says Gartner .
Yet 60% of businesses will not have a mobile strategy in place by 2014 .
Firms must have 'mobile first' strategy if they wish to go global, writes Nic Newman ."

"Washington (CNN) -- The head of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) on Friday gave the nation's 40,000-plus airport screeners the opportunity to engage in limited collective bargaining, pressing ahead on a hot-button issue that has separated Republicans and Democrats since the creation of the TSA after the 2001 terrorist attacks. When Congress created the TSA in 2003, it gave the administrator the authority to decide whether or not screeners should be allowed to engage in collective bargaining. Bush administration TSA chiefs opted not to endorse bargaining, saying it would impede their ability to protect the public. On Friday, TSA Administrator John Pistole announced he would allow airport screeners to select a union for collective bargaining, or to forgo bargaining. In a statement, Pistole said sitting down at a bargaining table with screeners would not jeopardize the nation. ""The safety of the traveling public is our top priority and we will not negotiate on security,"" Pistole said. Indeed, the paper outlining his decision precludes negotiations on security policies, pay, pensions and compensation, proficiency testing, job qualifications and discipline standards. It also will prohibit screeners from striking or engaging in work slowdowns. The announcement gives added weight to a recent Federal Labor Relations Authority decision to allow a vote granting sole union representation authority to a single union. The FLRA has tentatively scheduled a vote for March 9 through April 19 to determine which union will represent airport screeners. It will also give the screeners the option of having no union represent them. The unions vying for the job are the American Federation of Government Employees, part of the AFL-CIO, and the National Treasury Employees Union. Both unions called Pistole's decision good news. Congressional reaction fell along party lines. ""I want to commend Administrator Pistole for taking this positive step,"" said Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee. ""Collective bargaining does not diminish our security -- it can actually enhance workforce productivity and TSA's mission."" Rep. John Mica, R-Florida, called the move ""President Obama's biggest give to organized labor."" During the formation of the TSA, Congress limited airport screener's unionization powers, saying managers needed flexibility to address changing terrorist threats. Bush administration officials later cited the 2006 liquid bomb plot, when the TSA rapidly changed restrictions to prevent terrorists from smuggling explosive liquids on passenger aircraft. TSA officials say they did not have to consult with union representatives before changing screening protocols and work hours. But supporters of collective bargaining powers say that numerous other law enforcement agencies have broad union rights that do not hinder security. As a presidential candidate, Barack Obama promised to support collective bargaining for airport screeners. In a letter to a union chief just two weeks before the 2008 election, Obama wrote that if he was elected, ""I will work to ensure that TSOs [Transportation Security Officers] have collective bargaining rights."" He said he would make it a ""priority for my administration.""","TSA will allow screeners option of collective bargaining rights .
But screeners won't be able to negotiate on many issues .

"(CNN) -- Rocker and avid hunter Ted Nugent has agreed to pay a fine, serve probation and record a public service announcement as part of a deal to plead guilty to transporting an illegally killed black bear in Alaska, according to court documents. The plea deal, filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Anchorage, Alaska, stems from federal allegations that arose during a bear hunt in May 2009 that was filmed for Nugent's television show, ""Spirit of the Wild,"" on the Outdoor Channel. News of the plea deal broke a day after Nugent was questioned and cleared by the Secret Service over comments he made at an annual meeting of the National Rifle Association where he said he would be ""dead or in jail"" if President Barack Obama were re-elected. In the plea agreement, Nugent admitted to shooting and killing a bear using a bow and arrow during a hunt on Sukkwan Island in southeast Alaska, just days after he wounded another bear. Alaska limits licensed hunters to the bagging of one bear per hunting season. Under the law, the wounding of a bear counts toward the season's bag limit. ""Nugent failed to locate and harvest the wounded bear,"" the plea agreement said. Where the federal charge against Nugent -- a misdemeanor count of violating the Lacey Act -- comes in to play, according to court documents, is that he left the island by boat with the dead bear and ""knew or should have known, in the exercise of due care, that the black bear was taken, possessed or transported in violation of a law or regulation of the United States."" Neither the federal complaint nor the plea agreement revealed how federal authorities found out about the violation, though scenes from the hunt aired on Nugent's show. Nugent nor his attorney, Wayne Anthony Ross, immediately responded to a CNN request for comment. News of the plea deal comes as Nugent is promoting another bear hunt, this time in Quebec, Canada, on his web site. As part of the plea deal, Nugent has agreed to pay a $10,000 fine, not to hunt or fish within Alaska or on any other U.S. Forest Service lands for one year. The deal also includes two years probation. Additionally, according to the agreement, Nugent agreed to create a public service announcement that promotes the importance of a person's responsibility in knowing the rules and regulations of their hunting activities. The televised announcement, which must be approved by federal prosecutors in Alaska, must be at least 30 to 60 seconds in length and be broadcast every second week on his television show for one 12-month period, according to the plea agreement. A federal judge still must sign off on the agreement. Under federal sentencing guidelines, the maximum penalty is one year in prison and $100,000 fine. Nugent's attorney told the Anchorage Daily News on Friday that his client, who has previously hunted in the same area, was unaware of the law, which was introduced less than five years ago. He told the newspaper he watched the video clip from Nugent's show and the arrow ""touched"" the bear and stuck in the ground. ""There wasn't any blood trail that they could find,"" Ross said. ""There was a little blood apparently at the spot, but nothing that indicated the bear was hard hit."" On Thursday, the Secret Service said it resolved questions regarding comments that Nugent, a conservative activist and gun rights advocate, made about President Obama during a speech at an NRA convention in St. Louis, Missouri. Secret Service clears Nugent after interview . ""If Barack Obama becomes the president in November again, I will either be dead or in jail by this time next year,"" Nugent said, according to a video that the NRA posted on YouTube. ""If you can't go home and get everybody in your lives to clean house in this vile, evil, America-hating administration, I don't even know what you're made out of."" The video has since been removed. Many have questioned whether Nugent was alluding to violence against the president. Earlier Thursday, Nugent issued a statement confirming his meeting and describing it as a ""good, solid, professional meeting concluding that I have never made any threats of violence towards anyone. The meeting could not have gone better. I thanked them for their service, we shook hands and went about our business. God bless the good federal agents wherever they may be."" Nugent, the self-styled ""Motor City Madman,"" gained musical fame in the 1960s as a member of the psychedelic band The Amboy Dukes, then as a solo act in the 1970s and later as a member of the 1980s supergroup Damn Yankees. He is probably best known for the1977 rock anthem, ""Cat Scratch Fever.""","Ted Nugent agrees to plead guilty to a federal misdemeanor count .

"(CNN) -- It took Drake only one try to become one of ""Saturday Night Live's"" best hosts. On the January 18 episode, the rapper dusted off his acting skills -- honed on ""Degrassi: The Next Generation"" -- and seamlessly brought ""SNL"" back from its hiatus with its newest cast member, Sasheer Zamata. Zamata was recently hired after the NBC sketch comedy show was criticized for its noticeable lack of African-American women, and made her debut on January 18. Behind the scenes, ""SNL"" has also added two new African-American women writers, LaKendra Tookes and Leslie Jones. On Saturday, viewers were trying to figure out how ""SNL"" would address its highly publicized hire -- would the show again poke fun at itself by making her take on everyone from the first lady to BeyoncÃ© to Oprah in one sketch, as Kerry Washington did when she hosted last fall, or would it slowly introduce her with just one or two scenes? In the end, ""SNL"" went with a third option: It used Zamata liberally throughout the show as a supporting player, but her debut was virtually overshadowed by the night's host, Drake. In addition to performing, the 27-year-old artist participated in nearly every sketch and nailed them, from his opening monologue that recalled his bar mitzvah ... ... to his impersonation of comedian Katt Williams, and his spoof of colleagues Jay Z and Lil Wayne in ""Before They Were Stars."" In fact, the one person who won the episode more than Drake was Kate McKinnon and her impersonation of Justin Bieber in the cold open: . We weren't the only ones who thought so. ""(G)ive credit to host and musical guest Drake for shifting through characters as if he'd always belonged on the late-night sketch show,"" the Los Angeles Times said in a review. ""Drake showed he had a deft comedic hand on Saturday.""

"London, England (CNN) -- We've all seen them on the train or the bus. Chins glued to their chest, thumbs hovering and their eyes locked in a digitally-induced trance. But according to a British occupational psychologist, persistent monitoring of your BlackBerry will increase stress levels and most likely decrease productivity too. Amir Khaki from AK Consulting studied the BlackBerry habits of a group of executives in middle to senior management who were either high or low frequency users. ""High"" users would typically switch on their BlackBerry during the commute to work and would keep them on in the evenings and during weekends. ""Low"" users would generally allocate specific times to check their BlackBerry and respond to emails. ""People who fell into the high user category tend to have a distorted perception of their own usage and they equate their BlackBerry use with being dedicated to the job,"" Khaki told CNN. But these displays of enthusiasm didn't translate into efficiency. In one example Khaki observed a high frequency user trying to complete a simple spreadsheet. The task, Khaki estimates, should have taken about 20 minutes but ended up taking three times as long because of BlackBerry monitoring. The knock-on effect of this disruption is the anxiety it creates. ""You're not finishing what you are supposed to be doing. The dependency it creates when you can't find it, or it buzzes when you can't do anything about it because you are in a meeting causes stress,"" he said. While high users are driven to distraction, their partners are sometimes compelled to destruction. ""Many hated them. I heard a story of one being flushed down the toilet,"" Khaki said. Khaki advises companies whose employees have been issued with a smartphone to at least provide a basic level of training. ""You need to know how to use it properly. After all, we get training when every other technology comes online,"" Khaki said. He suggests companies try to encourage their employees to set a limit on usage. Of course, there are going to be exceptions -- but on the whole Khaki recommends a maximum of 12 hours use during the working week. On a personal level, Khaki advice is simple: ""At the start of any task, turn it off! Interruptions don't help anyone do anything better, faster or at a higher quality."" He added that research suggests people who respond to emails in batches take much less time doing it and are better at it. With more people upgrading to smartphones, issues over productivity and stress will surely rise as more executives find the line between work and leisure time blurring. It's a trend which concerns Cary Cooper, Professor of Organizational Psychology and Health at UK's Lancaster University Management School. ""We are finding that people are working on their paid work in what used to be their leisure time and that's having consequences both for their health and their productivity,"" Cooper told CNN. ""Remember, all these technologies are supposed to be our social support system. But what they've ended up being is an umbilical cord back to the workplace even in our non-work roles in life. ""I think what's ended up happening is the technology is managing the people rather than the people managing the technology,"" he added. Cooper believes the recession has perhaps compounded the problem as people feel more job insecure but he urges executives to seize the initiative. ""The thing that causes people the most stress in life is not having control. Use your BlackBerry rationally. If you are on holiday, access it once every two days, explain to someone that you are away and you'll deal with it when you get back.""","Executives constantly using their BlackBerry are less productive says study .
Stress levels heightened by overuse, which also feed feelings of dependency .

"(CNN)  -- Athletes from 97 nations will march in Vancouver tonight at the Opening Ceremony of the XXI Winter Olympic Games. Turn on your TV. Watch and cheer. Cheer for the sportsmanship and spirit shown at this highest level of competition among the world's nations. A fine example of this sportsmanship happened four years ago, when a ski pole, a race in Italy and maple syrup came together. It started when Norwegian cross-country ski coach Bjørnar Håkensmoen performed an extraordinary act. On February 14, 2006, Canadian cross-country skier Sara Renner began the women's team sprint competition in Turin with something to prove. After having placed no higher than eighth in four events at the Salt Lake City Games in 2002, Renner was determined to improve her performance in Turin. But in the middle of the final heat, something terrible happened. One of her ski poles broke. Suddenly, all seemed lost. Four years of intense training for this 17-minute race were about to amount to nothing. Then Håkensmoen saw what happened. Without giving it a second thought, he handed the Canadian skier the Norwegian team's spare pole. Renner and teammate Beckie Scott charged forward to finish in second place, earning a silver medal. Norway ended up fourth -- without a medal. An appreciative Renner thanked Håkensmoen with a bottle of wine. The Canadian people, touched by the selflessness of the Norwegian coach, established Project Maple Syrup, an organization designed to solicit donations of a Canadian national treasure. In all, 5.2 tons of maple syrup (7,400 cans) were shipped across the Atlantic to Håkensmoen and then on to Norwegians. Canadians also sent thank-you notes and recipes. In an instant, Håkensmoen reminded all those who were fortunate enough to witness his act of sportsmanship that the rings on the Olympic flag, intended to represent a color of every flag of every nation in the world, are interlocked and interdependent. The Olympics remind the world of the folly in thinking that anyone can stand alone. There are times when all people and all nations need a little help, whether that help comes in the form of a charitable donation, a word of encouragement or even a spare ski pole. Perhaps what is most remarkable about Håkensmoen's gesture that day was how unremarkable it was to him. When asked about his action by The Associated Press, Håkensmoen replied, ""It was natural for me to do it, and I think anyone should have done it."" Håkensmoen's act demonstrates why the Olympic Games matter: because sometimes -- in spite of skyrocketing salaries for professional athletes, increased illegal drug usage and waning loyalty between fans and their teams -- sometimes sports get it right. Today, cheer not just for the United States but for the other 96 countries as well. Cheer because any time so many nations congregate with common goals, under common rules and in peace ought to be cause for celebration. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Kaufman.","Robert Kaufman says there are many reasons to cheer Olympics, which begin today .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Relief organizations struggled to reach those in need Tuesday, one day after a 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck off Sumatra, Indonesia, triggering a tsunami and killing at least 112 people, officials said. Another 502 were reported missing. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the quake generated a ""significant"" tsunami. Some of the missing may include people who are unaccounted for after fleeing to higher ground, said Henri Dori Satoko, head of the Mentawai Islands parliament. Although communication with remote areas was difficult, some witnesses in West Sumatra reported seeing a wave 6 meters (nearly 20 feet) high. Other reports described the tsunami as being about 3 meters (almost 10 feet) high. Satoko said at least one village with a population of about 200 people was swept away, with only 40 people recovered. Nine Australians on board a tourist vessel that had been feared missing were confirmed to be safe, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said. Those aboard the ship, the MV Southern Cross, were not aware that an earthquake and tsunami had taken place, it added. The numbers of dead and injured were in flux because information was trickling in from remote parts of Indonesia, a country made up of myriad islands. The area believed hardest-hit was the Mentawai Islands, a popular surfing destination. In particular, Pagai Island was thought to have been affected, said Ita Balanda, a program manager for World Vision in Padang. ""There is no access for now,"" she said about the Mentawai Islands. ""We want to get help to these children and their families as quickly as possible, but it's still too dangerous to reach the island by boat."" Large waves were keeping rescue crews and aid workers from reaching the area. An Indonesian Red Cross assessment team had set out for the island but was forced to turn back because of high seas and debris in the water, said Gayat, spokeswoman for the agency, who like many Indonesians only uses one name. She said the team will try again Wednesday morning. The trip takes 10 hours, even under good conditions, Balanda said. U.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday he and and first lady Michelle Obama were saddened by the loss of life, and he offered support to the hard-hit region. ""As a friend of Indonesia, the United States stands ready to help in any way. Meanwhile, our thoughts and prayers are with the Indonesian people and all those affected by this tragedy,"" Obama said in a statement. The quake struck at 9:42 p.m. Monday, triggering a tsunami warning that was later lifted when sea level readings indicated the threat had diminished or was over for most areas. Its epicenter was 240 kilometers (150 miles) south of Padang, at a depth of 20.6 kilometers (12.8 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The magnitude was revised upward from a preliminary magnitude of 7.5. ""Big, slow, long earthquake last night, and a couple tremblers afterward,"" WavePark Mentawai Surfing Resort said on its website. ""Turns out it was a 7.5 about 70 [kilometers] south of us."" The resort said it saw ""about six waves on the beach after about 20 minutes"" but none was higher than usually seen during high tide. ""No damage here, but reports of damage to other resorts and charter boats further south,"" the posting said. ""The local residents in the Mentawai Islands reported seeing a tsunami as high as 3 meters [that] reached as far as 600 meters inland,"" said Mujiharto of the Indonesian Health Ministry. The Perfect Wave, a surf travel company that said it had 32 clients in the area, also described the wave in a statement as about 3 meters (10 feet) high, and said it washed through a bay where two boats with clients on board were docked. One boat hit the other, which caught on fire, and all the guests jumped overboard. Nine guests and five crew members were washed into the jungle and took more than an hour to make their way to safety, the company said. All those aboard were picked up by a third boat and were safe ""apart from suffering some smoke inhalation and minor scratches,"" the statement said. A surf guide aboard the third boat reported ""there was a lot of debris floating in the water including bar stools and other pieces of furniture from Macaronis Resort,"" the company said. ""No news on the state of the village at Silabu."" The resort, where six clients were staying, is ""all but gone,"" the statement said. ""It's very difficult to access the coast right now because the sea is quite bad,"" said Gilles Bordessoule, owner of the Siloinak Surf Resort. He said his property was unaffected, but his staff was attempting to help the Macaronis Resort, which was ""completely destroyed"" along with two others. Two of the Macaronis guests are missing, he said. He said the only means of communication with the affected area is by satellite phone, which is how he found out about the resort and received some other information. The fate of the other 130 kilometers (80 miles) of coastline is unknown, he said. Bordessoule said he had been in contact with authorities and residents of the area and was told between 150 and 180 people are dead and body bags are needed. World Vision's Balanda said her organization is working with the Indonesian government and the United Nations to figure out how to get to the hardest-hit area. Indonesian government resources have been sent to central Java, where Mount Merapi was erupting, she said, but said her group hopes one or two helicopters will be freed up to help with the quake and tsunami response. She said she is receiving information from a local nongovernmental organization as well as others in the region. The city of Padang and the Mentawai Islands are at the meeting place of two tectonic plates, making them vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis. On December 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off northern Sumatra. A tsunami generated by that earthquake killed more than 225,000 people in 14 countries -- mainly India, Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The Indonesian region of Banda Aceh was hard-hit: About 150,000 died there.

"(CNN) -- The 6-month-old girl whose parents created a ""bucket list"" blog for their daughter after doctors said she would not live past age 2 died Monday, her father said. Avery Lynn Canahuati, who was born in November with spinal muscular atrophy type 1, died of pulmonary complications related to the genetic disorder, Mike Canahuati said on the blog Tuesday. ""In short, one of her lungs collapsed and she went into cardiac arrest,"" said Canahuati, 31, of Bellaire, Texas. ""I immediately performed CPR on her and was able to bring her back to life, but only for a brief period of time before she passed away shortly after arriving at the hospital. ""Avery's passing this quickly came as a complete shock to all of us, as she had just been given a thumbs up at her last doctors appointment only three days ago,"" her father wrote Tuesday. ""While we were aware of the severity of her diagnosis, we never lost hope for Avery and even in her passing, we still have hope for our daughter and all of her friends."" The infant's parents had written the blog as though Avery would make it past age 2 and experience life's milestones as a healthy girl. Canahuati wrote Monday that there were two items he could now scratch off Avery's ""bucket list"": . 1. Not let SMA take my smile away. 2. Take one last breath, then take one more before I go to live with my Uncle Bryant, Nana Carolyn, Papa George and all my great-grandparents. He published the last photo the parents took of Avery, which he said showed her ""sitting on her mommy's lap looking at me and all it took to get her to smile this big was for me to keep saying 'Hi.' "" The blog began as an efficient way to keep family and close friends in touch about their baby's health. But when the father came upon the idea of writing a ""bucket list"" for his Avery -- a list of things to do before death, normally drafted for adults -- his blog went viral and now has 2.4 million page views. The ""bucket list"" is so sensitively penned that many of his readers are convinced that it's mom, not dad, typing the entries, he said. ""A lot of people, when they post on there, they say, 'you and your husband.' They obviously assume Laura is writing it,"" he said. The bucket list's entries are lighthearted, humorous and decidedly hopeful, though Avery had the worst order of an incurable disease caused by a genetic defect that attacks the muscles, especially the respiratory system. Only type 0 is worse, but that usually occurs with fetuses, the couple said. One in 6,000 babies is born with one of four types of SMA, according to the Canahuatis, whose daughter was diagnosed on Good Friday. One in 40 people is a carrier of the gene, and the Canahuatis had a one in 1,600 chance of both being carriers -- which they believe they are, the couple said. Writing in the first person as if his daughter were the author, Canahuati created new bucket list entries during the week on the family's averycan.blogspot.com website or their ""Avery's Bucket List"" Facebook page. They included: . 1. Wake up smiling. 2. Have a bad hair day. 3. Ride in an ambulance. 4. Get picked up by a fireman. 5. Meet a fan. 6. Talk to mommy & daddy. 7. Eat a cupcake & a Blow Pop. 8. Play with Play-Dough. 9. Play a practical joke on someone.

"(CNN) -- The Beatles appeared on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" on February 9, 1964, 50 years ago next month. Here are five things you need to know to understand Beatlemania and the significance of that performance. 1. Who was Ed Sullivan? Edward Vincent Sullivan was not what you think of as a TV personality. He was a baggy-eyed, malaprop-mouthed, stiff-bodied former newspaper columnist who looked like Richard Nixon. A wall had more charisma. Could Beatlemania happen today? But he was the perfect host. He said his introductions and got out of the way. His guests were the stars -- and he could book almost everybody, thanks to his deep contacts. You might compare his show to an hour of Web-surfing. It featured everybody from plate-spinners to comedians to theatrical performances to pop stars, all in one place. Animal acts, too. ""The Ed Sullivan Show,"" originally called ""Toast of the Town,"" went on the air in 1948 and lasted for 23 years. 2. Were The Beatles really unknown in America? Not completely. In Britain, they'd had No. 1 singles for several months, starting with ""Please Please Me"" in February 1963, and by fall Beatlemania was in full swing. (The word ""Beatlemania"" first gained wide currency in October after the band's performance on a major UK TV show, ""Sunday Night at the London Palladium."") Sullivan first encountered the band by accident -- he was stuck at London's Heathrow Airport when they returned from Sweden to thousands of fans on October 31 -- but the group was on the show's radar before then, Sullivan staffer Vince Calandra says. The show put out a press release about The Beatles' three-show booking in mid-December, and The New Yorker ran a small item in its December 28, 1963, issue. The Beatles had also appeared in several U.S. news reports. Did you get swept up in Beatlemania? Share your memories here . In December, the band's U.S. label, Capitol Records, started a marketing blitz -- ""The Beatles Are Coming!"" -- and by January their songs were all over the radio. ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" hit No. 1 in the United States on February 1, dethroning balladeer Bobby Vinton's ""There! I've Said It Again."" But for all that, The Beatles hadn't performed in America. With the Sullivan show, they had one of the biggest stages in the country. 3. Who was there? CBS received 50,000 requests for the 728 seats in New York's CBS Studio 50, since renamed the Ed Sullivan Theater and now home to ""The Late Show with David Letterman."" Among the celebrities who attended either the live show or the dress rehearsal: Kathy and Nancy Cronkite (Walter's daughters) Randy Paar (talk-show host Jack's daughter) and Julie and Tricia Nixon (Richard's daughters, invited by Randy Paar). Also there: future Monkee Davy Jones, who performed with the cast of ""Oliver!"" 4. Wait. It wasn't just The Beatles? No. The band played two sets, opening the show with ""All My Loving,"" ""Till There Was You"" and ""She Loves You"" and returning with ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and ""I Want to Hold Your Hand."" In between, acts included magician Fred Kaps, impressionist (and future ""Batman"" Riddler) Frank Gorshin, comedians Charlie Brill & Mitzi McCall, Welsh singer Tessie O'Shea, Broadway star Georgia Brown and the ""Oliver!"" cast, and acrobats Wells & the Four Fays. 5. What happened after the show? Though the audience loved them and millions of new fans were created that night, some reviewers were less enthusiastic. ""The cynical turnover in teen-age trauma received recognition last night in the businesslike appearance of The Beatles on the 'Ed Sullivan Show,' "" wrote the unimpressed New York Times TV critic Jack Gould. The ratings, however, were spectactular: 45.3% of U.S. TV households tuned in, representing 73 million people -- a record for an entertainment program up to that time. From New York, The Beatles took a train to the nation's capital, where they played at the Washington Coliseum on February 11, then returned to New York for two Carnegie Hall concerts on February 12. Then it was off to Florida for the group's second Sullivan appearance -- a performance at Miami Beach's Deauville Hotel on February 16. The ratings for the second Sullivan show were almost as good as the first. On February 22, The Beatles returned to Britain, where they were greeted by 10,000 fans at Heathrow Airport. The third Sullivan appearance, taped before the February 9 show, aired the next day.","50th anniversary of Beatles on ""Ed Sullivan Show"" is February 9 .

"(CNN) -- The 86th Academy Awards are in the record books. Here are five things that struck us about Sunday's broadcast: . 1. History for ""12 Years a Slave."" The subject matter -- the chronicle of a slave in 19th-century America -- was challenging, to say the least, more the stuff of educational documentaries than major motion pictures. Moreover, ""12 Years a Slave"" did not turn away from the brutality noted in Solomon Northup's memoir. It lacked a major star (except perhaps Brad Pitt in a small role), was made by a black British director and starred a black British actor. But the searing film was rewarded with three Oscars Sunday night -- including the big prize, best picture. ""This is for all the people who have endured slavery, and the 21 million people who still endure slavery today,"" director Steve McQueen said in his acceptance speech. 2. The most tweeted photo ever. Barack Obama, move aside -- you're now second to Ellen DeGeneres. During Sunday's show, the comedian and Oscar host went into the audience to shoot a selfie featuring some of her famous friends. The resulting picture included DeGeneres, Jennifer Lawrence, Channing Tatum, Julia Roberts, Kevin Spacey, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Lupita Nyong'o and her brother Junior, Meryl Streep, Bradley Cooper and Jared Leto's eye. (Cooper took the picture.) The 2012 photo of Barack and Michelle Obama was retweeted more than 778,000 times. The Oscar picture had exceeded 2 million before 1 a.m. ET Monday -- and put a strain on the social media service for a short time. The motion picture academy apologized for the traffic jam -- though its apology was retweeted ""only"" about 4,000 times. 3. Lupita Nyong'o's ""golden statue."" There were few memorable speeches at Sunday's awards, but newcomer Nyong'o -- who won best supporting actress for ""12 Years a Slave"" -- gave a standout. Paying tribute to Patsey, the enslaved woman she portrayed in the film, the 30-year-old actress at times struggled to keep her composure. ""It doesn't escape me for one moment that so much joy in my life is because of so much pain in someone else's,"" she said. ""When I look down at this golden statue, may it remind me and every little child: No matter where you come from, your dreams are valid."" 4. A big night for ""Gravity."" ""Gravity,"" Alfonso Cuaron's film about a space mission gone wrong, didn't win best picture, but it did the best by far of any nominated film, winning seven Oscars altogether. Though most were in technical categories, the film won a particularly sweet prize: best director for Cuaron, who spent four years putting his heart and soul into the technically demanding film, dazzling even the special-effects community. Cuaron is the first Latin American to win best director. One wonders what he'll do next. Always restless, his films have included a story set on a dying Earth (""Children of Men""), a Harry Potter film (""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban""), a moving drama set in modern Mexico (""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") and an adaptation of a children's classic (""A Little Princess""). Incidentally, there were two films with 10 nominations. ""Gravity"" was one. The other? ""American Hustle,"" which went 0-for-10. 5. A tame and unsurprising show. For the most part, the Oscar prognosticators were right: With the possible exception of Nyong'o, who beat Jennifer Lawrence for best supporting actress, all the winners were expected. Perhaps more surprising was the overall flatness of the show, which felt as sluggish as its 3Â½-hour running time. There were no spectacular song-and-dance numbers and few startling moments beyond Nyong'o's speech and Darlene Love's impromptu performance of the gospel song ""His Eye Is on the Sparrow."" Even DeGeneres wasn't always sharp. Her jokes were uneven, and some of her stunts -- notably an attempt to buy pizza for the audience -- didn't quite pay off. However, give the host credit: She's got that record-setting selfie. As best actress winner Cate Blanchett might say to all the complainers, ""Suck it.""

"(Departures.com) -- As travelers continue to swarm Europe every summer -- crowding the Michelin-starred restaurants of Paris and Copenhagen, stuffing into Tuscan villas for gnocchi-making classes and partying on the beaches of Saint-Tropez, Capri and Ibiza -- many locals have found secret hideaways that allow them to avoid the crowds at all costs. Unlike Americans (and, increasingly, Asians and South Americans), many Europeans don't view sightseeing, culture and history as essential components of a summer holiday, since they often have those experiences year-round in their hometowns and cities. ""Europeans are usually more concerned with quality hotel accommodations, good food and one-of-a-kind shopping,"" says Chrismar Kuhn, a Basel-based luxury travel agent and fan of Sylt, a German North Sea island. And those in the Mediterranean have been dodging tourists for centuries. Many chic Romans travel to the breezy hush-hush island of Panarea, the smallest and poshest of the Aeolian Islands, off the coast of Sicily; the French -- who try harder than anyone to avoid tourists -- hike in the Drôme, sail in Vannes or go ""glamping"" in Loire-Atlantique. Follow their lead and pay a visit to one of these 10 lesser-known European destinations. Departures.com: Amazing first-class air cabins . The Jura and Three Lakes Region, Switzerland . Nobody loves secrets more than the Swiss. But nobody loves St. Moritz and Gstaad more than moneyed Russians, Americans and Brits, eager to take part in boozy mile-high après-ski parties. Family-friendly Lenzerheide has lured Swiss celebs like Roger Federer, but the spectacular Jura Mountains in the northwest remain a rugged, undeveloped region that is an anomaly in the resort-speckled country. Located on the edge of the region is Neuchâtel and the Hôtel Palafitte (from $350; Route des Gouttes-d'Or 2; 41-32/723-0202; palafitte.ch), a contemporary favorite of the Swiss, who happily give up their fondue stübli for this modern gem. Bornholm, Denmark . The phenomenon of ""new Nordic"" cuisine has created a new Nordic invasion, and getting a table at one of Copenhagen's buzzy, Michelin-starred restaurants has become more challenging than navigating the city on a bike during rush hour. Fortunately, sensible Danes know when enough is enough. Come high season they flee the city limits for islands like Bornholm and Samsø, where they can get back to life's simple pleasures. Windswept Bornholm is known for its round churches, smoked herring and pottery. The tiny fishing village of Gudhjem is home to Stammershalle Badehotel (from $250; Sdr. Strandvej 128; 45/5648-4210; stammershalle-badehotel.dk), whose welcoming potbellied stove is all the luxury you'll need. Departures.com: America's best rooftop bars . Cavtat, Croatia . Though Dubrovnik remains a posh Adriatic go-to, its share of cruise-ship passengers and fortress wall-walking British, German and American tourists increases every year. Many locals sneak 30 minutes south to leafy, cultured Cavtat (pronounced ""Tsav-tat""), which has long been a secret weekend getaway for the affluent. The swank Hotel Croatia Cavtat (from $250; 385-20/430-830; alh.hr) overlooks the entire harbor. Its distinct 1970s James Bond-esque exteriors might be off-putting to tourists, but the luxuriously refurbished five-star hotel has swaddled many a VIP within its walls. Cheltenham, Cotswolds, England . Brits looking to escape the Olympics are renting out their homes in record numbers and temporarily heading for greener, less-crowded pastures in the bucolic countryside. Places reachable in less than fours hours -- such as Somerset, known for rolling hills and cider, and charming villages in the Cotswolds like Stow-on-the-Wold -- are especially popular. The upscale spa town of Cheltenham is the home of British steeplechase horse racing and the Montpellier Chapter (from $200; Bayshill Rd.; 44-1242/527-788; themontpellierchapterhotel.com), a posh inn filled with modern art and Eames furniture. Depatures.com: The world's most outrageous hotel perks . Fiskebäckskil, Sweden . As hordes of fans eager to get close to the setting of Stieg Larsson's ""Millennium"" trilogy swarm Stockholm, many Swedes head west to the ruggedly tranquil ""crime fiction coast,"" where renowned writers and readers alike hole up in places like blustery Marstrand, the rocky Väderöarna Islands and charming Fiskebäckskil, the former summer grounds of Ingrid Bergman and a source of inspiration for modern crime-fiction writer Camilla Läckberg, whose novel ""The Ice Princess"" is set there. After reading your fill of crime literature, plunge into the sea from the glass-enclosed sauna at the modern Gullmarsstrand Hotel (from $200; 451 78 Fiskebäckskil; 46-523-66-77-88; gullmarsstrand.se). 5 trips for crime fiction lovers . Grignan, Drôme, France . No one tries to avoid tourists more than the French, who have an annual six-week grand vacance to help them do so. As the world's most-visited country, many French travelers are forced to sacrifice popular destinations like Normandy and Provence for lesser-known but equally beautiful départements like Morbihan and the Loire-Atlantique. The village of Grignan in Drôme hits all the criteria for a secret French hideaway: It's historic, of culinary interest and offers Gauls a chance to reconnect with nature. Ditto for Le Claire de la Plume (from $150; 2 Place du Mail; 33-4/75-91-81-30; clairplume.com), a small inn once used as a truffle house by Picasso's girlfriend and today visited by Bernadette Chirac and chanteuse Arielle Dombasle. Depatures.com: Spectacular hotel rooftop pools . Nordmøre, Norway . Dodging tourists tethered to cruise ships in Norway's fjords is no easy feat. To get away, many Norwegians retreat to the jagged, UNESCO-free Lofoten Islands, but under-sung Nordmøre also gets its share of locals seeking refuge. Perched just off Norway's western coast, just 20 minutes south of Kristiansund, is Håholmen Havstuer (from $200; Kårvåg, 6530 Averøy; 47-71/517-250; haholmen.no), a renovated 17th-century fishing camp turned posh retreat. Take a ten-minute crossing on the hotel's private boat and enjoy fish soup and bacalao fireside atop the Håholmen dining room's burnished timber floor -- with nary a mega cruise ship in sight. Panarea, Aeolian Islands, Sicily, Italy . Known as the set locale for Michelangelo Antonioni's ""L'Avventura,"" Panarea remains a secret hideaway for the jet and yacht sets, but could very well become the Mediterranean's next Capri.

"(CNN) -- It gets more visitors than any art gallery and more clicks than any other single site on the Internet. Imagine getting your own drawing on Google's homepage. Google is giving aspiring student artists and inventors a rare chance to get their original artwork on the heavily trafficked Google.com. The company is kicking off a Doodle 4 Google contest, and any student in the United States, grades kindergarten through 12, can submit their own doodle between now and March 20. The theme of this year's contest is ""If I Could Invent One Thing to Make the World a Better Place ..."" If your idea is especially brilliant, you might want to patent it before showing it off to the entire world or having it turned into a top-secret Google[x] project. In addition to a $30,000 scholarship and a tech grant to their school, the winner will make a trip to Google headquarters and work with its Doodle team to turn their drawing into an animation. The winning entry will appear on Google.com on June 9. Even as ads and other detritus have filled search results, Google's search-engine homepage has stayed clean, sparse and almost always free of ads. (Google has made exceptions to push its Nexus 7, Nexus One and Motorola Droid devices.) The classic multicolored Google logo sits on top of the search bar in the middle of the white page. But over the years, the logo itself has been altered for fun and some smart brand marketing. These artistic ""doodles"" direct visitors to information on topics they might normally have overlooked, from filmmaker Ingmar Bergman to writer Zora Neale Hurston. ""It's kind of like the mission behind having a search engine that can bring you all the information in the world,"" Google Doodler Sophie Diao said. (Her business card actually lists ""Doodler"" as her job title.) ""We can help users find something or learn about things that they otherwise might not."" The first Google Doodle was posted in 1998, when the company founders took off for Burning Man and decided to drop a stick figure into the regular logo as a sort of ""Gone Fishing"" sign. Over time, the company started marking the occasional holidays with decked-out logos, and the doodle took off. Now they mark important historical occasions and bring attention to people and topics that might otherwise be overlooked, such as Simone de Beauvoir's 106th birthday, the 66th anniversary of the Roswell Incident and the 100th Tour de France. The doodles are usually created by a team of 20 Google employees, including 10 artists and three engineers, at the company's Mountain View, California, headquarters. They make about a doodle a day, though many are only for specific regions of the world, so not everyone will see them on their Google.com homepage. You can see every doodle from around the world at Google.com/doodles. The altered logos take different forms. Most are static illustrations, but there are also animations and games. Some of the biggest hits are elaborate interactive doodles, like the winter-themed Zamboni game, which can take months to create. Clicking on a doodle brings up search results for that topic. In addition to hosting the winner for a day, the Doodle team will help an official group of judges sort through entries and pick the best drawings. The public will be able to chime in and vote on their favorites. ""We're looking for doodles that kind of feel at once very personal and relatable and are also a showcase of the student's creativity,"" Diao said. Last year's Doodle 4 Google contest winner was 18-year-old Sabrina Brady, who created an image of a returning U.S. soldier hugging his young daughter. She has gone on to use her scholarship money to enter art school.","Google is giving student artists a chance to take over the Google Doodle .

"(CNN) -- An Indiana man missing for 18 years after his mother abducted him and her two other children to Mexico was reunited with his father after the son went to a U.S. consulate and declared he wanted to go home at age 23, authorities said. Nathan Slinkard's mother, Trena, lost custody of her three children following a divorce from husband Steven, and then she and the small children disappeared in October 1995, said Lt. Ted Munden of the Hancock County Sheriff's Department. Nathan Slinkard and his father weren't available for comment and asked for privacy as the son now stays in his father's home in Greenfield, about a 25-mile drive east of downtown Indianapolis, Munden said. But Munden was present for the reunion because he escorted the father, along with his sister, to meet his son at the Indianapolis airport last Wednesday. ""They were nervous,"" Munden said of the father and son. ""The dad asked me on the way there, 'Who do I do? Do I shake his hand or give him a hug?' ""I said, 'You will know when you see him.' ""Nathan immediately recognized us at the airport. He walked up and initiated a hug to his father,"" Munden said. ""It was neat. It was really neat. ""You could tell there was a lot of emotion,"" Munden said, but the men didn't become tearful. Nathan Slinkard also hugged his aunt, Munden said. The exact whereabouts of the mother, still facing an Indiana warrant, as well as the two other children, haven't been disclosed by the long-lost son, other than to say they're alive and well in Mexico, Munden said. The last time the father saw his son, the boy was 5 years old. Since then, the father worked as a paramedic in Indianapolis and is now a deputy coroner for Hancock County, working in the same building as the sheriff's office, Munden said. ""I've been involved in law enforcement for 17 years, and this is by far the most unusual and most rewarding thing I've been involved with,"" Munden said Wednesday. ""Unfortunately there are a lot less happy endings than there are good endings. Sometimes the kids are never heard of again. Or when they do, so much time has passed, they don't want any relationship, especially if they were young enough that they didn't have memories of their parent."" At the time they were whisked away by their mother, Nathan's sister, Sydney, was 3 years old and his brother, Andrew, was 7 years old, authorities said. Their mother, Trena Slinkard, now 46, still faces a state warrant carrying a charge of violating a custody order, a Class D felony, which is the least serious in Indiana, Munden said. At one time, she also faced a federal warrant for unlawful flight, but that was dropped in 2005 or 2006 because of cooperation issues with the Mexican government, Munden said. ""His mother and brother and sister were touchy subjects, and we didn't talk a lot about them,"" Munden said of his conversations with Nathan Slinkard. ""I think if he tells too much information, it's going to affect their lives. They're happy, healthy and alive. He told his siblings they're free to come back if they choose to do so."" Munden speculates that the missing mother and three children had probably been hiding in Mexico's larger cities. ""I would assume they would probably be living close to Mexico City or a large city. It's easier to blend in,"" Munden said. ""I think he was all over the place in Mexico."" Nathan Slinkard has apparently been using English regularly in Mexico because ""he speaks very good English as well as very good Spanish,"" Munden said. His English doesn't even have an accent, Munden said. ""It's just a pretty neutral English accent,"" he said. Most recently, Nathan Slinkard was living on his own in Mexico, and on January 27, he went to the U.S. consulate in Guadalajara and showed his Social Security card and U.S. birth certificate. He also showed surgical scars that matched his records, Munden said. Slinkard wanted to return to the United States ""to meet his father and start a new chapter of life,"" Munden said. On January 28, Slinkard flew to Houston, Texas, where he met with officials of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, who along with Indiana authorities have been searching for him, his mother and siblings. The next day, Slinkard arrived in Indianapolis to see his father for the first time in almost two decades. Slinkard now wants to attend school in the United States and enter the medical field as a cardiologist, physical therapist or nurse, Munden said. ""I told him the fact that he was bilingual, it's going to help him out a lot,"" Munden said. While on the run from the law, the mother apparently told her children they were free to return to the United States if they so chose, Munden said. Meanwhile, the case of the missing mother and two remaining siblings is ""an open but not active case,"" Munden said.","Nathan Slinkard was 5 years old when his mother absconded with him, two siblings .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- With tensions rising between the United States and Turkey over a resolution that labels the World War I-era massacre of Armenians by Turkish forces ""genocide,"" many are asking why the House is debating the resolution now. Rep. Tom Lantos says passage of the genocide resolution would help restore America's moral authority. The House Foreign Affairs committee voted 27-21 Wednesday to approve the nonbinding resolution, which declares that the deportation of nearly 2 million Armenians from the Ottoman Empire between 1915 and 1923 -- resulting in the deaths of 1.5 million -- was ""systematic"" and ""deliberate,"" amounting to ""genocide."" The Democratic leadership has not scheduled a final vote. Administration officials have lobbied against the resolution, saying good U.S-Turkish relations are vital to U.S. forces in Iraq. The Pentagon says 70 percent of the military's cargo heading into Iraq either flies into or over Turkey. But House Democrats view the resolution as part of their mandate to restore America's moral authority around the world. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Thursday said arguments that Turkey is too vital an ally to alienate has delayed the resolution for too long.  Watch Speaker Pelosi defend the timing of the debate » . ""I've been in Congress for 20 years. And for 20 years, people have been saying the same thing."" Pelosi said Thursday. ""There's never a good time. And all of us in the Democratic leadership have supported... reiterating the Americans' acknowledgement of a genocide."" ""As long as there is genocide, there is need to speak out against it,"" she added. And one of the chief supporters of the resolution, House Foreign Affairs Chairman Tom Lantos, D-California, was unmoved by the administration's arguments that Turkey would block the use of U.S. airbases on Turkish soil. ""The Turkish government will not act against the United States because that would be against their own interests,"" he told CNN. ""I'm convinced of this."" Lantos, the only member of the House who is a Holocaust survivor, says passage of the resolution would also help to bring a moral dimension back to U.S. foreign policy. ""One of the problems we have diplomatically globally is that we have lost our moral authority which we used to have in great abundance,"" Lantos said. ""People around the globe who are familiar with these events will appreciate the fact that the United States is speaking out against a historic injustice. This would be like sweeping slavery under the rug and saying slavery never occurred."" But Democrats are not united behind the measure, Armed Services Committee Chairman Ike Skelton, D-Missouri, has sent a letter to Pelosi on Thursday opposing the resolution, saying the resulting backlash threatened by Turkey could disrupt ""America's ability to redeploy U.S. military forces from Iraq,"" a top Democratic priority. And the top Republican in the House, Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Thursday that bringing the resolution up for a final vote would be ""totally irresponsible."" ""The fact is that Turkey is a very good ally of the United States. They are critical to our security, not only her to but our troops oversees,"" Boehner said.

"(CNN) -- ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"" stars Teresa and Joe Giudice face new bank fraud charges. The reality TV couple could spend decades in prison if convicted on the 41 counts alleged in an indictment returned by a federal grand jury in New Jersey. The Giudices allegedly faked documents and lied on applications to get more than $5 million in loans over eight years before they joined the ""The Real Housewives of New Jersey"" cast in 2009. They both entered ""not guilty"" pleas in August to the original 39 counts, including conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, bank fraud, making false statements on loan applications, and bankruptcy fraud. The husband and wife are due in court in Newark for the added charges on Wednesday, according to U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman. The new counts stem from a $361,250 mortgage loan that Teresa Giudice, 41, got in 2005, Fishman said. ""In the course of obtaining the loan, she and Giuseppe Giudice prepared a loan application which falsely stated that Teresa Giudice was employed as a realtor and that she had a monthly salary of $15,000,"" Fishman said. ""Teresa Giudice was not employed outside the home at the time."" Giudice lawyer Miles Feinstein told reporters in August that the couple would not be testifying against each other in the case, which he said they expect to win. Teresa Giudice, in a written statement released after she was charged in July, said she would stand by her man. ""Today is a most difficult day for our family,"" she said. ""I support Joe and, as a wonderful husband and father, I know he wants only the best for our lovely daughters and me. I am committed to my family and intend to maintain our lives in the best way possible, which includes continuing my career. As a result, I am hopeful that we will resolve this matter with the government as quickly as possible."" 'Real Housewives' star Jacqueline Laurita: 'Teresa is scum' The indictment accuses the Giudices of exaggerating their income by faking her employment history while applying for loans. They allegedly failed to disclose rental and business income after filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2009. The indictment also charges Joe Giudice with failure to file tax returns for tax years 2004 through 2008, during which time he allegedly earned nearly $1 million. The Giudices are free on $500,000 bond each, but they had to surrender their passports. If convicted, the couple faces up to 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine.

"(CNN) -- You know how good it feels when you fish a $10 bill out of your jeans pocket right before it hits the wash. Imagine coming into hundreds of dollars from a savings bond or a bank account you forgot about. Could there be a pile of money waiting for you to find it? You may get a letter from a company saying you have unclaimed money or property, and for a fee, you'll be able to reclaim it. But before you pay for this service, remember there are plenty of free Web sites that will help reunite you with your treasures. There's almost $33 billion in unclaimed money from old payroll checks, utility refunds, trust distributions, stocks, banking or checking accounts, certificates of deposit and the contents of safe deposit boxes, according to estimates by the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators. Property is considered abandoned if there has been no activity on it for more than three years, according to Steve Larson of NAUPA. Such money is turned over to the state of your last known address, and the state holds the money in its coffers until you or your heirs claim it. There is no time limit to claim most abandoned property. In fact, years from now, your great-great grandchildren could claim it. To find your hidden money, go to http://www.missingmoney.com/, an official database for the NAUPA that has records from most state unclaimed property programs. You can also link to your individual state unclaimed property program. If you come across records that indicate there may be money left in an old bank account, find out if the bank is still in business. For that, go to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Web site at www.fdic.gov. Look under ""Bank Find,"" and you'll be able to see the history of the bank, including any mergers. But if your bank failed, and you don't claim those funds within a year and a half, the money in your account is turned over to the FDIC. To search for the failed bank, go to www2.fdic.gov/funds/index.asp. If you don't claim the money after a few years, you'll lose what's in your account, says David Barr of the FDIC. ""There's quite a bit of unclaimed property out there,"" he says. Savings bonds . Anything you're supposed to keep for 30 years is bound to slip your mind. In fact, there are more than $15 billion worth of savings bonds that have stopped earning interest but haven't been claimed, according to the Treasury Department. If you have savings bonds that are still earning interest, but you have no idea where the documents are or how much they're worth, get in touch with the record-keeping office of the U.S. Treasury Department. As long as you have enough information -- like when the bonds were issued or the Social Security number on the bond -- the Treasury Department will replace or reissue your bond. If you stumble across savings bonds that have stopped earning interest, or you think you may have had a bond or two as a kid, go to treasurydirect.gov/indiv/indiv.htm and look under ""Treasury Hunt."" This search mechanism will tell you if there are any bonds in your name. If there are unclaimed bonds, a member of the Treasury Department can contact you. There is no statute of limitations on claiming savings bonds. No matter how old they are, the money stays there for you or your heirs to claim, and the Treasury Department must respond to a claim. ""We want to get those off our books,"" says Steve Meyerhardt of the Treasury Department. ""It doesn't do us any good to be hanging on to the funds."" Pensions . Pensions may be going the way of the dinosaur, but there's still plenty of cash left from people who forgot to claim them. There's about $133 million in unclaimed pension funds, says Gary Pastorius of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal pension insurance program. About 32,000 people may have pension money just sitting around. The PBGC takes over pension plans if a company goes out of business. If the employer can't locate people that have left the company, the PBGC tries to track them down. If you think you may have left a pension plan somewhere, you can check with the PBGC at search.pbgc.gov/mp/. There, you can type in your name and company in a search tool. Finding unexpected cash isn't hard as long as you know where to look. If an asset locator contacts you about unclaimed property, take the time to use the search tools. Asset locators generally charge a 10 to 20 percent fee to find your unclaimed funds. While this can be a legitimate service, you're being asked to pay for something you can do for free. ""These asset finders are providing something of value,"" says Joe Ridout of Consumer Action, a nonprofit consumer watchdog group. ""But you can do it yourself with a few mouse clicks.""

"Shanghai, China (CNN) -- Imagine China's urbanization drive as SimCity on steroids. The core objective of the video game is to build a metropolis while staying on budget and keeping residents happy. China has done it on a massive scale over the last three decades, but with disappointing results. For starters, inefficient spending has spawned China's empty mega malls and ""ghost cities"" of headline lore. And in those urban areas problems abound. China's city dwellers are forced to live in a severe concrete landscape of polluted skies and chronic gridlock. ""You've got 500 million people that have moved to the cities since 1980,"" says James McGregor, Beijing-based author and chairman of the consultancy APCO Worldwide. ""The lives they've been able to build, it's been incredible. But the question is: 'can they make it livable?'"" China's urbanization drive started decades ago when 80% of the population lived in the countryside. Today, China has more than 160 cities with populations of a million or more, with an urban population of around 700 million that represents more than half the total population. And yet, despite all the thoughtless construction and chaotic urban planning, China has managed to dodge at least one bullet: There are no miles of urban slums. There are no favelas dotting China's cities. China's newest urban residents -- its migrant workers -- have jobs to sustain themselves. But they are not entitled to the social benefits in the cities they work in. ""There are 260 million people who already have jobs (in the cities),"" says Tang Min, economic adviser to China's State Council and former chief economist of the Asian Development Bank. ""But they don't have the social welfare yet."" Chinese Premier Li Keqiang says he wants China's urbanization drive to focus more on human needs and to be friendly to the environment. His top priority? Urban social welfare reform. ""Li Keqiang's new urbanization drive is mainly addressing those already in the city who are not fully integrated to the cities -- those not fully entitled for urban social welfare,"" says Tang. The government recently announced planned reforms of the household registration system, or ""hukou,"" to gradually allow qualified migrants to receive benefits like education and healthcare in their new homes. ""Slowly, starting from small cities to medium towns then to larger cities, they're loosening up the registration requirements,"" says Peggy Liu, founder of JUCCCE, a Shanghai-based non-profit dedicated to sustainable development in China. ""In certain cities like Shanghai you can have a points system to actually buy into the hukou system."" China is taking small steps toward complete reform by 2020 because of specific concerns about the impact of a fully opened hukou system. ""This is very sensitive,"" Tang tells me. ""For those people who already have an urban hukou, they may sell it if a market exists. ""And for those who haven't got urban citizenship yet, if they sell (their rural land) and suddenly lose their job, they have no place to go. So the government is very cautious about this."" If land reform moves too quickly, China will lose its unique buffer for unemployment -- the migrant workers' rural homes, where they can always go back to if they lose their jobs. An unemployed migrant population lingering in the cities poses a threat to stability. That is Beijing's fear. But on the other hand, the government acutely feels economic pressure to provide migrant workers with social benefits in their new homes. ""The current economic model of state planning, state banks, state industry and all these mega projects is running out of gas. If they have got to keep growth going, it's going to be consumers and so this is all about creating consumers,"" says McGregor. ""The great social justice story of China is in order to grow you have to turn these migrants into full citizens and consumers."" China's high-stakes version of SimCity has reached a new level. Game on.","Half of population now lives in cities, but push to urbanize has had mixed results .

"(CNN) -- Chinese mobile technology leader Huawei unveiled the latest additions to its stable Sunday in Barcelona, ahead of the 2014 World Mobile Congress, including its ""hybrid"" fitness band/smart watch. CEO Richard Yu presented the TalkBand B1 at the company's launch press conference. Connected to a smartphone via bluetooth, the device functions as both a fitness tracker and a phone -- a detachable bluetooth headset adds voice and text functionality. It also improves upon existing fitness trackers by housing a USB port in its wristband for charging. It is touted to retail at $136 and expected to go on sale in China in Q1 2014 before being rolled out gradually across the rest of the world, although some in the tech community are less than enamored with its appearance. It is currently designed to work with Huawei smartphones but its compatibility will be expanded upon in the future. While it seems the world may be getting sick of smart watches that don't seem all that smart, and ""glassholes"" showing off their obtrusive technology, market research firm Canalys predicts that ""2014 will be the year that wearables become a key consumer technology.""

"(CNN) -- An Arizona mother of seven will be back in court on Wednesday as a judge weighs whether she will go free or remain behind bars in Mexico, her family said. It's a situation Yanira Maldonado's family said she never imagined when she boarded a bus to head back to the United States last week after attending a family funeral. Now she's facing drug-smuggling charges after Mexican authorities said they found 12 pounds of marijuana under her bus seat. Her family vehemently denies the charges and accuses authorities of arresting her to get bribe money. A Mexican state official also told CNN it appears that Yanira Maldonado was framed. Anna Soto, Maldonado's daughter, said it was devastating to see her mom in jail over the weekend. ""She's an honest woman. She's innocent. It's not a place for someone of her kind,"" Soto told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live"" on Tuesday night. ""It hurts just to know that she's there, to have seen her there. It's not fair."" Soto said she knows her mother has nothing to do with drugs. ""Never. No. She is not that kind of person. I don't think she's ever even tried a cigarette in her life or even drank a beer,"" Soto said. ""You know, she's one of those people that tries to stay away from those kinds of people or those kinds of things."" From a bus seat to a jail cell . Mexican authorities arrested Maldonado last Wednesday as she and her husband, Gary, were on their way back to Arizona. During a search of their bus at a military checkpoint in the northwestern Mexican state of Sonora, authorities asked everyone to get off. At first, authorities told Gary Maldonado that marijuana had been found under his seat and arrested him, his father, Larry Maldonado, told CNN. After the father contacted the U.S. Consulate in Hermosillo, Mexico, authorities said they were mistaken and released Gary. Then, they charged his wife. Gary Maldonado said he believes Mexican soldiers at the checkpoint wanted a bribe. ""It's about getting money here,"" he told CNN's ""Starting Point"" on Tuesday. A lengthy court hearing . Maldonado's court hearing had stretched for more than three hours on Tuesday afternoon, said Brandon Klippel, her brother-in-law. Military officers from the checkpoint were scheduled to testify on Wednesday, Klippel said after speaking with family members and a translator who were inside the Mexican courtroom on Tuesday. ""Although we are disappointed to hear that she will not be released today,"" he said, ""we are very encouraged by the strong evidence and witnesses proving her innocence."" Gary Maldonado told CNN affiliate KTVK that he was feeling optimistic after Tuesday's hearing. ""We're hoping for the best outcome. ... We don't think they have a case,"" he said. The Mexican Embassy in Washington said in a statement that a preliminary decision from the judge was expected soon. Questions about arrest . A Sonora state official with extensive knowledge of the case told CNN there are questions about the arrest. ""Can you imagine?"" asked the official, who was not authorized to speak to the media and did not want to be named. ""A passenger by himself or herself would have been unable to carry almost six kilos of marijuana onto a bus without being noticed. She must've been framed."" A regional office of Mexico's Defense Ministry said troops conducting a routine investigation stopped the bus Maldonado was riding in and and found 12.5 pounds (5.7 kilograms) of a substance that appeared to be marijuana under her seat. Troops turned the case over to the Mexican attorney general's office, the defense ministry said. Maldonado is being housed in a women's prison in Nogales, Mexico, while authorities decide her fate. The Sonora state division of the attorney general's office said the investigation is ongoing and declined to provide additional information about the case against Maldonado. Her husband was told by authorities that regardless of his wife's guilt or innocence, he would have to pay $5,000 to secure her freedom, the family said. He was able to cobble together the money but then was told it was too late. His wife had been transferred to another jail. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake is monitoring the case, his office said. ""Senator Flake is personally monitoring the situation, and he has had multiple conversations with the deputy Mexican ambassador this weekend,"" Flake's office said Monday. 'Blind mules' unknowingly ferry drugs across the U.S.-Mexico border . Fear grips family . But growing political and media attention toward the case has not lessened the fears of Yanira Maldonado's family. Family members visiting her over the weekend were told they would have hours to talk, but when they arrived they were given only 10 minutes, Klippel said. ""She was at a wire window with her fingertips up through the holes, touching her son's hand with one hand and touching her husband's hand with the other,"" Klippel said. ""She was just saying, 'I don't know how this happened to me. I've never done anything illegal in my life. Why has this happened?'"" After Tuesday's hearing, sister-in-law Veronica Anaya said the family remained very scared and upset. ""The family is very sad,"" Anaya told Canal 7, a local TV station in Nogales. ""They know she's innocent. She's the mother of seven children and a decent person. She's a Christian. This is an injustice."" Mormons reach out . While they anxiously await word from Mexico, family members say they've been turning to their church for strength. The Maldonados are members of a local Mormon ward in Goodyear, Arizona, Klippel said, adding that church leaders at the state and local level have offered spiritual and material support to the family. ""I feel very blessed, and I feel how powerful this network is,"" Klippel said. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as the Mormon church is officially known, has long been active in Mexico and other parts of the world, and is famous for its tight and socially active circles. A Facebook page Klippel and his wife founded to support Yanira Maldonado had garnered more than 12,500 members as of Tuesday afternoon, many of whom are fellow Mormons. A number have offered to connect the Maldonados with Mormon leaders in Mexico or media in the United States. Some in the Facebook group said that they are refraining from eating and drinking for a day on the family's behalf. ""To find out that hundreds if not thousands of people are fasting on behalf of my sister and praying to God that this is over soon is very humbling,"" Klippel said.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- More than 3,000 paramilitary forces and police descended on a small coastal village in China's Guangdong province -- many of them in helicopters and speedboats. In the early hours of Sunday, they conducted 109 raids in Boshe, a village of 14,000 people. In the massive crackdown on the region's illicit narcotic trade, police seized three tons of crystalline methamphetamine, also known as crystal meth or ice, and arrested 182 people with suspected links to 18 drug rings, according to a statement released Thursday by Guangdong's public security bureau. They recovered another 100 tons of raw materials for producing drugs, as well as guns, knives and a grenade, a spokesperson for the public security bureau told CNN on Friday. Some 77 drug factories were shut down in the raid, police say. Boshe is located inside the city of Lufeng, long considered by authorities as a hotbed for the production and trade of drugs. In the last three years, one-third of China's crystal meth came from the city, according to the security bureau's statement. In Boshe, more than one in five households are directly involved in the trade or production of drugs, the statement said. Since the 1990s, there has been little industry in the region and many residents have moved to nearby cities like Shenzhen in search of better opportunities. According to the Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper, growing numbers of villagers in Lufeng have turned their homes and farms into drug factories. Guangdong authorities did not give an estimated value of the drugs seized on Sunday, but the South China Morning Post newspaper said the haul would be worth around U.S. $232 million. Police in Guangdong have seized 8.1 tons of drugs and made 10,836 arrests since July 2013, when the province launched a campaign to crack down on narcotics, said Guo Shabo, the public security bureau's deputy director in a statement. According to a recent report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 70% of the 326 illegal drug-making facilities shut down in China in 2012 were manufacturing crystal meth. More than half of these laboratories were in Guangdong. Some 88 tons of methamphetamine were seized worldwide in 2011, the latest year for which figures are available, according to to the UNODC.","Police seize 3 tons of crystal meth in a village in Guangdong .

"(CNN) -- Franklin Gomez is dying. His ribcage heaves up and down as a machine forces air into his lungs, screaming and beeping as it synchronizes with bags bringing him fluid and morphine. His four kids watch over him. His wife, Rosanna, squeezes my hand and says through tears: ""He is going to die and I can't do anything."" I first met Rosanna weeks after our daughter, Luna, was born. My friends Mirta and Maite had employed her as their caregiver and adored her affectionate way with children. Luna was lying in her playpen screaming, her eyes freshly opened. I raced around the apartment in my pajamas at 4 p.m., trying to figure out how to breast-feed. Luna became calm almost as soon as Rosanna picked her up. ""A baby is a like clean slate,"" she said, smiling at our daughter. ""I get to fill the slate. The only thing I ask is that you not get upset if I fall in love with her. Some parents get mad, and I just can't help it."" She fell in love with Luna. And my partner, Mafe, and I fell in love with Rosanna, who brought so much more than help with diapers and cries of distress. Luna learned to eat and crawl, then walk, all on her watch. Then she began to talk in English and Spanish, thanks to Rosanna. Rosanna formed this big happy crew with all the other Latina caregivers. Luna and Jackie and Sydney and Sofia and Ana, a string of little ones right behind them, went on adventures to the water park yelling ""agua, agua"" and eating loads of rice and beans. Suddenly, this little person emerged who had adopted our caregiver's thoughtful, shy, demeanor, who ate more vegetables than we could provide and had this delicate humility that is missing in so many little kids. Rosanna had left their own babies behind in the Dominican Republic to come care for the babies of families in the United States. It's a typical story line in the Latino immigrant community. Rosanna and her husband, Franklin, wanted their children to have more opportunities, so they suffered a wrenching separation. Rosanna helped the babies of more privileged folks thrive while hers remained on an island, struggling with poverty. Franklin worked in restaurants, and eventually, they brought four children to this country, all of whom are now on the brink of citizenship. Luna was just beginning to talk when she accompanied Rosanna and her children to a critical appointment with their immigration lawyer. I still remember the story of how each of them identified themselves one by one -- Luis Franklin, Nicolas, Nathalia, Laura -- and Luna would say ""Luna Gomez, too."" She had truly become a part of their family. When we were finally able to tear ourselves away from our little girl, she spent a few weekends at their house and was indignant to find out that Rosanna and her husband shared the same bed. She wanted to sleep in between. Luna called Franklin ""Gomito"" and adopted a Dominican accent. She credited them with her first trip to Chuck E. Cheese's and talked about the Yankees since they lived in the Bronx. Rosanna and Franklin's grandson is close to Luna's age. So when Luna got into a great private preschool, I arranged for him to attend as well. How could I ask her to take my child to this great preschool when her grandson, Julian, didn't have a school? Franklin had no health insurance and didn't qualify for government programs. So when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, the prognosis was grim. I put out a call to the Latina Motherhood, that ethnic network that activates when there's trouble in a family. I called Ana and Evelyn, Soledad and all the Marias. If they didn't know someone, they knew someone that knew someone, a doctor or a lawyer or a nurse, or a guy with a big van who can move a wheelchair. Or they offered money to a family that has none. Soon, this ailing man with no health insurance was sitting in Lincoln Hospital getting chemotherapy and kind words. Everyone did everything they could, and then some. Her kids really hustled. The two boys and youngest daughter increased their work hours even as they struggled to pay for college. The other daughter trekked her son and newborn daughter over every day to help care for her father. Still, the cancer spread and their finances deteriorated. Franklin feared dying alone. All the families whose children and sitters were connected to Rosanna stepped in to help cover her hours and help with finances. Family members were able to take shifts, sitting by his side. Rosanna cared for him all night and all morning, before caring for my child and two others. She picked up every hour of work she could bear to make up for his lost income and prayed and prayed and prayed. On Wednesday evening, we sat our daughter down to tell her that ""Gomito"" had died. That her beloved Rosanna and her children will be very sad, and we will need to give all the help we can. We told her, as she cried softly, that every person is born and that every person dies, you just don't know when. That it's sad, but that all you can do is live your own life well and remember them fondly. We also told her that we are all in this life together.","Rosanna Gomez, a caregiver, has had a positive influence on Rose Arce's life .

"Sao Paulo (CNN) -- Motorola unveiled its new relatively low-cost smart phone on Wednesday, aimed at consumers in emerging markets and those on a tight budget everywhere. But the one country noticeably missing from the rollout of Moto G was China, thanks to the unfriendly relations with Motorola's parent company Google. The Moto G will cost just $179 without a contract in the United States, about a third the cost of an iPhone 5c and about half the cost of a Galaxy S4 Mini. Motorola launched the new device in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in a presentation beamed around the globe. CEO Dennis Woodside said Moto G has set its sights on the whole world. ""It's really designed to serve the half a billion in the world who next year will buy a smart phone for under $200,"" he told CNN ahead of the launch. Many of those people are in emerging markets, like Brazil, the world's sixth largest economy with a rising middle class and a major smart phone market. The Moto G won't be offered in the U.S. until January and it will eventually go on sale in about 30 countries. In Brazil, sales began Wednesday. The phone starts at 649 reais or about $280, compared to about $600 for the cheapest new iPhone without a contract. It's aimed at the country's emerging middle class -- people who often don't have computers at home. ""Brazil is an incredibly vibrant market,"" Woodside said. ""People are coming on to the mobile internet for the first time."" Industry observers at the launch said it should be a hot ticket heading into Christmas, with its price and features making it competitive. Those features include a big, high-resolution screen, the latest Android software a long-life battery, 8 GB of internal storage and a 5 megapixel camera. ""Most people in the world can't afford $500, $600 for a smartphone,"" said Woodside during the launch. ""We think the industry should provide more for the consumer dollar."" In the U.S., Moto G is being targeted at the pre-paid market, especially students and children. As for China, it is the world's biggest market for low-end mobile phones, but the government blocks many of the Google services -- like Gmail and Google Search -- that Motorola says will make Moto G the new smart phone of choice.","Motorola launches new phone to attract new markets .

"(Parenting.com) -- I was so anxious about the idea of circumcision that I actually hoped for a girl. I didn't get a girl. I got two beautiful boys instead, and therefore had to make the decision twice. Though our sons were born four years apart, my partner Abbie and I gave equal consideration to the question of whether of not to circumcise with each one. With our first son, Tommy, I had nightmares that if we chose circumcision, the doctor would make a mistake. I knew the statistics were low, but that rarely soothes an anxious mom-to-be. I worried the procedure was obsolete. When I looked around the room at my friends' sons, many if not most were uncircumcised. About a month before Abbie was due to give birth to Tommy, we visited my parents out on Long Island. At dinner, we talked about interviewing pediatricians in our Brooklyn neighborhood of Cobble Hill. We were looking for a doctor who struck a balance between holistic and traditional Western approaches to medicine and childcare. We had a few things down. Abbie planned to breastfeed -- or at least to try. We understood that antibiotics were at times necessary to treat ear infections. We believed in and felt adamant about vaccinating our child. Parenting: Mom confession: I wanted a girl . But the one place where we were both still unsure was on the topic of circumcision. Abbie and I didn't yet know the sex of our child, but admitting that we were even questioning whether or not to circumcise our son set off a slew of opinions at the table that evening. ""You have to circumcise him!"" said my sister Melanie, an emergency room doctor who has seen her fair share of infected uncircumcised penises and urinary tract infections, and whom I trust immensely. My other sister, Meredith, an amazing mother of three boys who were all circumcised, agreed. ""It's unsanitary,"" she said. ""I can barely get my kids to brush their teeth at night. And imagine him in the locker room when he's a teenager."" Our best friend and sperm donor, Tim, who is circumcised, was more aligned with Abbie and me. He questioned, like me, if the procedure was outdated and based more on social customs than medical necessity. And, like Abbie, he wondered whether the benefits outweighed the trauma. Health! Melanie reinforced. Hygiene! Meredith repeated. Is it really necessary? Tim asked honestly. Decline in circumcisions could cost billions . All of the impassioned arguments and questions raised during this discussion gave us plenty to consider. To be honest, as lesbians, neither Abbie nor I had spent a tremendous amount of time thinking about circumcision in the first place. But it was clear that as soon-to-be parents, we had a lot to learn. And so we began our research. Prior to this conversation, we'd been leaning toward not circumcising our child if he was a boy. We trusted that Tim could teach him how to be sanitary and avoid infections. We didn't care about the aesthetics. As two women and a gay man raising children together, we did not feel particularly bound to social custom or tradition. We researched the varied perspectives and we considered the ethics and our child's individual rights over his body. We knew that this was a big decision -- one of many -- and we took our responsibility seriously. Parenting: 'I figure nature can make a better penis than I can' We respected both sides of the argument, but the medical evidence supporting the use of circumcision to prevent STDs and penile cancer, and to reduce UTIs, compelled us. We were finally persuaded when the World Health Organization and UNAIDS issued a joint statement in 2007 supporting the link between male circumcision and HIV prevention. Suddenly we felt that we were making a decision that could not only protect the health of our child, but could save his life. We spoke with the pediatrician we'd chosen and our OB/GYN, who would be performing the surgery, and both agreed with our position. That said, when our OB/GYN first held up our newborn and announced that it was a boy, I soon returned to my earlier fear that something would go wrong during the circumcision procedure. I felt confident in our decision, but I was more terrified that our doctor would make a mistake during this operation than I was when she performed Abbie's C-section. The next day, I decided to go with Tommy for the operation. I didn't want to send him alone. He was given anesthesia and I pressed my face to his and I held his hand. All in all, the procedure did not take more than five minutes and was a success. Was it an easy decision to make? No. Do I think we made the right decision? Yes. Do I know that Abbie and I investigated, explored and considered all of our options and with the help of professionals and our own reflection decided on what was best for our child? Absolutely. Hearing that the American Academy of Pediatrics now also feels the benefits outweigh the risk only reinforces our decision. Parenting: Eight times you should absolutely call your kid's doctor . Before our second son, Teo, was born, we continued to educate ourselves on the procedure. Both Abbie and I were open to the idea that the evidence may have changed. We did not just assume that we'd follow the same path with our second child to make sure he shared this trait with his older brother. We approached the decision in much the same way and, again, in the end, we found the medical evidence to be the most persuasive factor. Just as I had with Tommy, I stayed with Teo during his procedure. I pressed my face to his face. I held his hand. I knew I'd made this decision with care and thought and I felt, and still feel, that it is one that will benefit him. I don't expect everyone to understand or agree with the choice that Abbie and I made for our sons. When Tommy and Teo are naked at the beach with friends, often they are in the minority because they are circumcised. And that's okay. For us it was never about fitting in or following customs. We made our decision based on the information that we had and trusted, and our own expectations and fears and hopes for our children's future. Parenting: Complete guide to circumcision .

"(CNN) -- Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher, quadruple title winner Alain Prost, and contemporary pacesetters Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso were all contenders in CNN's quest to find the greatest Formula One driver of all time. But In the eyes of Formula One's great and good it was two icons of the sport -- Ayrton Senna and Juan Manuel Fangio -- who proved inseparable. Senna's three world championships in the late 1980s and early 1990s made him an idol for modern stars like Lewis Hamilton. CNN Greatest F1 Driver . The Brazilian's death following a crash at Imola in 1994 led to three days of mourning in his homeland and his genius has gained almost mythical status with the eponymous documentary on the driver, which brought the Senna legend to a new generation of fans in glorious Technicolor. Fangio graced F1 tracks in the early days of the sport, in the sepia-tinged 1950s, an era when the Argentine's talents could not be truly captured on camera. But if you crunch the numbers, the Argentine shunts Senna over to the curb. Fangio collected five world championships, two more than Senna, winning a record 45% of the grands prix he entered compared to 25% for Senna. The Argentine started an unrivaled 55.8% of his races from pole position -- Vettel's current record is just over 33% -- while also qualifying for 92% of his grands prix on the front row. No one can match Fangio's record of winning the championship with four different teams, while he is also the oldest F1 champion, taking the 1957 drivers' title aged 46 years and 41 days. Although that comparison is arguably unfair as fate cruelly robbed Senna of the chance to match that particular achievement. One criticism that has been leveled at Fangio was that he always drove the best car, but as Stirling Moss told the sport's official website it was ""because he was the best bloody driver!"" ""The cheapest method of becoming a successful grand prix team was to sign up Fangio,"" added Moss. Blog: Alonso, Vettel on track for greatness? Perhaps what Senna inspires within those who admire him is not measurable in numbers. He was a maverick, driving with a cavalier flair which was best summed up when he proclaimed, ""If you no longer go for a gap, you are no longer a racing driver."" His six wins at the famous Monaco Grand Prix is an unparalleled feat, while his championship duels with McLaren teammate Prost were pure sporting theatre. Senna's win-at-all-costs approach was epitomized in 1990 when he led Prost in the championship heading into the year's penultimate race -- the Japanese Grand Prix. Prost, starting in second position, overtook polesitter Senna off the line. But, knowing if neither driver finished Senna would be crowned champion, the Brazilian forced Prost off the track at the first corner and cemented a second world title success. ""When you had Prost and Senna fighting it out in the same team, there's no question to the caliber of each driver, very different personalities and great drivers,"" 1996 world champion Damon Hill told CNN. ""Those epic battles stand the test of any sporting rivalry."" Senna was a perfectionist, taking risks which could turn certain victory into abject failure -- notably his crash at the 1988 Monaco Grand Prix when he was holding a 55-second lead over his nearest rival. If Senna took the sport to the very edge of sportsmanship, Fangio conducted himself with ""a sense of honor never seen before or since."" He shot to global fame in 1958 when he was kidnapped in Cuba by Fidel Castro-led revolutionaries. As was the case with everyone who met him, his captors were charmed by Fangio and they released him unharmed,"" it is claimed in a tribute to him on the sport's official website. When describing what made Fangio so special, three-time drivers' champion Jackie Stewart said: ""I think the dignity and style, the way he went about his business . ""Fangio is the one that, for me, would have written the whole book. You would want to do what he did and how he did it."" Over the course of their illustrious careers, the pair astonished with their ability and courage, pushing their vehicles to the limit in pursuit of the checkered flag. Perhaps it is fitting, then, that these two legends of motorsport proved inseparable.","Juan Manuel Fangio and Ayrton Senna voted as F1's best by motorsport greats .

"(CNN) -- Could you survive on four hours sleep a day? What about coming face-to-face with waves the size of three-storey buildings? Or not seeing your loved ones for an entire year? As the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race set sail from London on Sunday, 670 amateur sailors will soon find out if they have what it takes to complete one of the most grueling sporting challenges known to man -- sailing around the globe. Over the next year they will travel through the harshest conditions on the planet -- facing everything from wild storms in the Southern Ocean, to frustratingly calm seas near the equator. The 12 yachts, each measuring 21 meters, will visit 15 ports on six continents. While some sailors will join for a month-long leg of the journey, others will quit their jobs and say goodbye to their family and friends for the full 11-month circumnavigation. But despite the almost superhuman challenge ahead of them, many of the competitors had until recently never set sail in their life. From 18-year-old students to 70-year-old retirees, the gutsy sailors taking part in this year's race will -- quite literally -- be thrown in the deep end. ""For most people it will be the first time they're sleeping and living on a boat for a long period of time,"" said Nik Brbora, who completed the 2012 race. ""They'll have to get used to the uncomfortable conditions, lack of sleep, and shift work -- usually four hours on, four hours off. Then there's the weather -- in all your training you can't really experience your first big storm,"" added the 29-year-old IT engineer from London. Founded in 1996 by Sir Robin Knox-Johnston -- the first person to sail solo, non-stop, around the world in 1969 -- the Clipper Race revolves around the notion anyone can circumnavigate the globe, regardless of their experience. The only selection criteria is people must be over 18, pass a three-week sailing course and be physically fit enough to complete the epic voyage. But at around Â£43,000 ($67,000) per person for a full year-long voyage, it's not simply a huge physical undertaking, but a significant financial one. ""It's a little bit like moving country -- you have to say goodbye to everyone you know. All your possessions are broken down into one bag for an entire year,"" said Brbora. ""The Clipper motto is that 'anyone can do it.' I was just an average guy working in the city, not a massive adventurer like Sir Robin Knox-Johnston. But I did it, and I've come out of it so much stronger and with so much more self-belief.""","Clipper Round the World Yacht Race kicks off in London .

"(CNN) -- Victoria Azarenka unleashed a fierce volley of criticism at the Wimbledon tournament organizers after blaming the court conditions for her injury-enforced withdrawal. Azarenka was one of seven players to pull out of the tournament Wednesday with injury, joining Rafel Nadal's conqueror Steve Darcis, France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Czech Radek Stepanek, U.S star John Isner, Croatia's Marin Cilic and Kazakhstan's Yaroslava Shvedova on the sidelines. It is an unwanted statistic for the tournament, which has seen 10 withdrawals in the singles competition overall, with the record currently held by the 2011 U.S. Open when 17 competitors were forced out with injuries. Azarenka, the World No.2 suffered an injury to her right knee during Monday's first round win over Portugal's Maria Joao Koehler and withdrew just minutes before Wednesday's tussle with Italy's Flavia Pennetta on Centre Court. The Australian Open champion, who has reached the semifinal stage in each of the past two years, was clearly unhappy with the conditions of the court and hit out after seeing her Wimbledon dream crushed. ""The court was not in a very good condition that day,"" the Belorussian told reporters. ""My opponent fell twice; I fell badly; there were some other people who fell after. ""It would be great if the club or somebody who takes care of the court would examine or try to find an issue so that wouldn't happen. ""There is nothing I could have done to make that better. There is nothing I've done wrong that cost me to just withdraw from Wimbledon."" But the All England Lawn Tennis And Croquet Club responded immediately in a statement following Azarenka's attack. ""There have been no changes in the preparation of the courts and as far as we are aware the grass court surface is in excellent condition,"" it read. ""In fact we believe that it is drier than last year when the prevailing conditions were cold and wet. ""A grass court is a natural surface and will generally be slightly more lush in the first couple of days. Although a number of players have withdrawn injured, only one player has attributed this to slipping over on court."" CEO Richard Lewis also released a statement late Wednesday following the surprise number of withdrawals. ""There has been a high number of withdrawals at the Championships and we sympathize with all the players affected,"" he said on the tournament's official website. ""The withdrawals have occurred for a variety of reasons, but there have been some suggestion that the court surface is to blame. We have no reason to think this is the case. Indeed, many players have complimented us on the very good condition of the courts. ""The court preparation has been to exactly the same meticulous standard as in previous years and it is well known that grass surfaces tend to be more lush at the start of an event. ""The factual evidence, which is independently checked, is that the courts are almost identical to last year, as dry and firm as they should be, and we expect them to continue to play to their usual high quality."" Meanwhile, Tsonga, who had hoped to challenge for the men's title, was forced to retire during his contest against Ernests Gulbis of Latvia after complaining of knee and wrist problems. But the Frenchman, who had completed three sets before retiring, refused to blame the court conditions. ""There is nothing about this court. They're great,"" he told reporters. ""The only thing we can say is the weather we have had for a couple of weeks is humid and cold and windy sometimes."" Elsewhere, Darcis, ranked 135 in the world, suffered an injury to his right shoulder after a fall during his landmark win over Nadal. The 29-year-old had been set to face Poland's Lukasz Kubot in the second round, but failed to overcome the problem in time. ""I think when you beat a guy like Rafa in the first round, you want to show more, you want to play more matches. I was playing maybe the best tennis in my life here,"" Darcis told reporters. ""So not to go on the court today, it's the biggest disappointment I have had."" John Isner was another casualty after pulling out of his clash with France's Adrian Mannarino just two games into his second round game. Isner, who won the longest match in the history of the tournament against Nicolas Mahut in 2010, suffered a leg injury while serving early on. ""I just went to serve, and it was as I landed on my left leg, like I have done 20 million times playing this game. I just felt this sharp pain,"" 18th seed Isner told reporters. ""It just grabbed really badly and I knew I was in serious trouble then. I knew at that point it was not likely I was going to be able to play."" There was also bad news for 10th seed Cilic, who had hoped to reach the later stages of the tournament following his run to the final at the Queen's Club last week. The Croatian had hoped to face France's Kenny de Schepper before withdrawing with a knee injury, while Radek Stepanek was forced to retire at 6-2 5-3 down to Poland's Jerzy Janowicz after pulling his left hamstring.","World No.2 Victoria Azarenka pulls out of Wimbledon .

"(CNN) -- Hunter Moore was once dubbed the ""most hated man on the Internet"" and the ""Revenge Porn King."" But now, the brash Californian is at risk of getting a new title. A felon. Moore, the founder of a now defunct ""revenge porn"" website, was indicted and is accused of hacking into people's e-mail accounts to steal nude photos to post online, federal authorities said. Moore, 27, who the FBI says operated isanyoneup.com, was arrested in Woodland, California, on Thursday. Also arrested was Charles Evens, a 25-year-old man in Southern California believed to be connected to the scheme. 'You took the picture' In 2012, way before this arrest, Moore talked to HLN's Dr. Drew about the website. ""The site was just born, actually,"" Moore said. ""It was just a couple of friends and, you know, we had our hearts broken by a couple of girls, and we thought we would make a site. And it became Is Anyone Up. That's how it started. Of course. But when I did start the site, I was hurt, and so was my friends."" But later in the show, a woman who called in confronted Moore and said she regretted taking topless photos for a boyfriend and was devastated when the pictures appeared online. ""I don't know how you can point your finger at me,"" Moore responded."" You took the picture. I mean, I've been justifying this in my head for over a year and a half of the site. But at the end of the day, it started with you. You took these pictures."" Site got out of hand . The FBI says Moore and Evens conspired to peddle ""hundreds"" of nude pictures, without getting permission in 2011 and 2012. But according to an indictment, Moore allegedly pushed Evens to hack into computers to get more sexually explicit photos. Moore then would pay Evens for the photos and then post them on the site, according to the FBI. Both suspects are named in a 15-count indictment with charges that include aggravated identity theft and conspiracy. If convicted, they face up to five years in federal prison for each conspiracy and hacking-related charge. Moore shut down the website in 2012 and sold it to an anti-bullying group. ""Taking down the site has been something I've wanted to do for months,"" he said. ""It was just something I created that got out of hand. It was supposed to be for friends.""

"(CNN) -- Tyler Doohan, the 8-year-old upstate New York boy who rescued six relatives from a fire but died while trying to save his grandfather, will be laid to rest Wednesday with a ceremony and honor befitting a fallen firefighter, according to local fire officials. Penfield Fire Company has kept an honor guard standing by the remains of the boy during calling hours since Monday, and at the end of a church service on Wednesday, Penfield Fire Chief Chris Ebmeyer will declare Tyler an honorary firefighter and present his family with a special fire helmet inscribed with the boy's name. ""The young man acted with a lot of courage and bravery to try to rescue his grandfather after rescuing other members of his family,"" Ebmeyer said. ""He showed valor and strength, and paid the ultimate sacrifice."" Ebmeyer said he received calls from fire departments from Maine to California, saying something should be done to honor Tyler. At the service, firefighters from multiple fire departments will stand at attention in formal ""Class A"" dress uniforms with bagpipers playing -- the hallmarks of a traditional firefighter's funeral, Ebmeyer said. There will be no funeral procession at the family's request. ""We want to honor him in a way family and friends will remember and look at him as a hero,"" Ebmeyer said. ""He should be looked at as going above and beyond, even putting his life in danger... This is what firefighters do."" Tyler, an East Rochester resident, was staying at the home of relatives in Penfield on January 19 when he noticed a fire in the single-wide trailer, officials said. As firefighters and sheriff's deputies responded to a 4:45 a.m. emergency call, Tyler was able to wake six other people in the small trailer, including two more children, ages 4 and 6, the fire officials said. Then Tyler went back into the blaze to help his grandfather, who was disabled and would have been unable to get out of the home on his own. ""By that time, the fire had traveled to the back of the trailer,"" Ebmeyer said at the time. ""Unfortunately, they both succumbed to heat and smoke."" The pair were found together on a bed in the back room. It appeared that the boy was trying to lift his grandfather from the bed when he was overcome by the smoke and fire, fire officials said. The funeral Mass will take place at 10 a.m. Wednesday at St. John of Rochester Catholic Church in Fairport.","Tyler Doohan, 8, saved six relatives from fire .

"(CNN) -- Avalanches have blocked the only highway to Valdez, Alaska, cutting off all motor traffic to the coastal town of about 4,000 and leading town officials to urge voluntary evacuations of residences. The Richardson Highway will probably remain closed for about a week, officials said on the town website. The first avalanches started Friday, and more occurred Saturday. Valdez officials urged voluntary evacuations over the weekend because water started to accumulate behind the snow and debris created by the avalanches. A shelter was established in the high school and teen center for people who evacuated. It's unknown how many people moved out of their houses. According to the town website, Valdez has plenty of fuel on hand, but food and fuel can be brought to the town port by barge if necessary. Valdez is about a 300-mile drive from Anchorage, Alaska's largest city. Grandson of Vail co-founder killed in Colorado avalanche .

"(CNN) -- First it was McLaren, now it's the turn of Ferrari to unveil the car they hope will speed them to victory in the forthcoming Formula One season. The sport's oldest team, based in Maranello, Italy unveiled their new F14 T car on their website on Saturday. A raft of technical changes introduced for the 2014 season sees teams racing with, to the untrained eye at least, similar looking cars but vastly-changed setups -- most notably using smaller 1.6-liter V6 Turbo engines compared to the 2.4-liter V8 engines used last year. Read more: F1 rips up the rulebook . Other significant alterations this year include reconfigured rear wings, the introduction of a new Energy Recovery System and a limit of 100 kilos of fuel per race. Eagle-eyed observers will also note that the nose cone has been lowered and narrowed. Along with Ferrari's new car comes a new driver -- the quietly charismatic Kimi Raikkonen replaces Brazil's Felipe Massa -- and new hope that the Finn and Spain's Fernando Alonso can return the team to championship-winning ways. ""We both want to win and time will tell what will happen and if we can bring the championship back to Ferrari,"" Raikkonen told the Ferrari F1 website. ""We are more than capable, both of us, to be up there and fight for championships."" Raikkonen won the drivers championship in 2007 with Ferrari, the same year they won their last constructor's championship. This year's car is the 60th built by Ferrari for the F1 world championship with the F14 T name being chosen by fans via a poll on the Ferrari F1 team's website. ""It's nice to know the name of the car has been chosen by our fans,"" team principal Stefano Domenicali said. ""The amazing number of votes shows just how popular Ferrari has always been and this will be, as always, a further impetus for us to do well this year!"" Read more: Reliability not speed key to F1 glory in 2014, says Lauda . Twenty-four hours earlier it was McLaren who were unveiling their new car which they hope can wipe away the memory of a dismal 2013 season. The Surrey-based team finished a lowly fifth, 193 points behind fourth place Lotus, with neither Jenson Button nor former teammate Sergio Perez managing a podium finish in 19 races. The MP4-29 is a ""sensible and calculated response to the new regulations,"" McLaren said. Jonathan Neale, managing director of McLaren Racing said in a statement: ""We've never had such significant new regulations before; reacting to them, and managing those changes, while still pushing the performance limits, has been an extremely tough job. ""We've been relatively pragmatic about it. We know that the need for consistency initially outweighs the need for performance -- the winter tests won't be about chasing set-up or refining the car; the envelope of performance is likely to be so wide, and so relatively unknown, that the winter -- and to some extent the opening races -- will be about understanding the operational boundaries of the car as best we can."" Jenson Button, who will be partnered by Dane Kevin Magnussen this season, is looking forward to getting behind the wheel. ""I'm very keen to learn all about the new formula and our new car, and I want us to be in a position where we head to the opening flyaways feeling comfortable with our package, yet still ready to absorb and learn more as we go,"" Button said in a statement. Testing for the new season, which starts in Melbourne on March 16, begins at the end of January in Jerez, Spain.","Legendary Italian F1 team reveal the look of their new car for the 2014 season .

"(EW.com) -- It's good to be Kevin Hart and Ice Cube this weekend. The increasingly ubiquitous Hart, who recently told EW that Ride Along is ""my baby,"" scored big with a $41.2 million opening weekend for the buddy-cop comedy. That should jump to an estimated $47.8 million when one factors in the Monday MLK Jr. holiday. Not only does the impressive haul surpass expectations for Universal's leanly budgeted $25 million comedy, but it also breaks the record for a January opening. (If you're still not sold on the Hart/Cube pairing, whose chemistry lifted the film to an ""A"" approval rating with CinemaScore audiences, let this stupendous spot on Conan give you a taste of their chemistry.) Universal folks have further reason to thrust their chests out this weekend. Buoyed by rapturous word of mouth, the studio's real-SEAL heart-thumper Lone Survivor dropped just 38 percent to deliver an impressive $23.2 million in its fourth weekend. Director Peter Berg, whose Battleship bombed so badly, made Lone Survivor for $40 million and now can boast about a $74 million domestic total. Sliding into the No. 3 spot is Open Road Films' animated The Nut Job. With families looking for holiday entertainment, The Nut Job should swap places with Lone Survivor by the end of Monday. The squirrel comedy, which earned a solid ""B"" rating from CinemaScore audiences, managed to outperform its modest expectations. Alas, the same can't be said for Paramount's stab at rebooting its Jack Ryan franchise, with Star Trek actor Chris Pine playing the action-hero CIA agent who's previously been played by the likes of Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford. Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, which the studio made for $60 million, debuts at a rather limp No. 4 with just $17.2 million. A ""B"" CinemaScore rating shouldn't do much to attract moviegoers distracted by all the Oscar-nominated films they want to see before the big show. That said, Shadow Recruit fared better overseas, with $22.2 million from only half of the international markets. Frozen hung on in the No. 5 spot, with Disney's domestic kitty now totaling nearly $333 million. But hot on its heels was American Hustle, which earned 10 Oscar nominations and last night walked away with a SAG award for best ensemble cast. David O. Russell's caper, starring Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, and Jennifer Lawrence, enjoyed a 28 percent jump with a $10.6 million haul in its sixth weekend; its total gross rose to $116.4 million. The Meryl Streep/Julia Roberts family drama August: Osage County likewise enjoyed a jump in box office to $7.6 million as it more than doubled its theater count to 2,051; its cume stands at nearly $18.2 million. The only other other notable new release is Devil's Due, Eli Roth's found-footage horror movie that was hoping to benefit from its mega-viral ""Devil Baby"" campaign. The film failed to crack the top 5 and earned a dismal ""D+"" CinemaScore rating. That's a bleak showing, and yet the $7 million film already recouped its investment with an $8.5 million debut. The top five: . 1. Ride Along — $41.2 million . 2. Lone Survivor — $23.2 million . 3. The Nut Job — $20.55 million . 4. Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit — $17.2 million . 5. Frozen— $12 million .

"(CNN) -- The powerful but compact Hurricane Raymond drifted toward southern Mexico's Pacific coast Monday evening as it dumped heavy rains north of Acapulco, forecasters reported. At 8 p.m. (11 p.m. ET), Raymond was a Category 3 storm -- a major hurricane -- with top winds of 120 mph (193 kph). After sitting still for most of the day, it began moving slowly toward shore and was centered about 135 miles (217 kilometers) west-southwest of Acapulco, the U.S.-based National Hurricane Center reported. It had weakened slightly and its worst punch remained far out to sea, since hurricane-force winds extended just 25 miles from the eye. It was moving eastward at 2 mph, and its movement over the next day was expected to be ""slow and erratic,"" forecasters said. The hurricane center predicts Raymond will lose steam Tuesday and turn westward into the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday. But before then, it's projected to dump 2 to 4 inches of rain on the coast, and there may be areas in Michoacan and Guerrero states that receive as much as 8 inches. ""These rains could produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides,"" forecasters noted. A hurricane warning was posted for about 140 miles of coast, from the city of Lazaro Cardenas to Tecpan de Galeana, about 65 miles north of Acapulco. The warning means winds of 74 mph or higher are expected in the next 36 hours, and the storm could produce produce ""significant coastal flooding"" and ""large and destructive waves,"" the hurricane center said. A hurricane watch and tropical storm warning was posted from Acapulco to Tecpan de Galeana, meaning hurricane conditions are possible within two days, and winds of 39 mph or higher are expected within 36 hours. Raymond quickly strengthened overnight off the south-central coast, which was was hit hard by another storm in September. That storm, Manuel, triggered deadly mudslides and left about 40,000 tourists stranded in Acapulco, a popular tourist destination. On the other side of the continent, meanwhile, a tropical depression in the Atlantic Ocean has become Tropical Storm Lorenzo, the hurricane center said Monday. The storm was 635 miles east-southeast of Bermuda on Monday evening, moving into the deep Atlantic. The storm had top winds of 40 mph, and it was moving north-northeast at 7 mph. Lorenzo was expected to start fading Wednesday without reaching hurricane strength, forecasters projected. CNN's Ed Payne contributed to this report.","NEW: Raymond weakens slightly as it moves toward shore .

"(CNN) -- Bubbly water and politics haven't mixed well for Hollywood actor Scarlett Johansson. After recovering from a kerfuffle over a Super Bowl ad she appears in, she suffered a painful blow over it Thursday. Her starring role in the campaign for a machine that puts the fizz into water and soft drinks cost her her starring role as the public face of the charity Oxfam. Although she officially resigned, the poverty-fighting organization says her representation of the company that makes the machines is a conflict of interests. Oxfam and human rights activists accuse Israeli company SodaStream of manufacturing its product in Jewish settlements in the impoverished Palestinian territories. They view this as an exploitation of Palestinians and their resources. ""Oxfam believes that businesses, such as SodaStream, that operate in settlements further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the Palestinian communities that we work to support,"" the poverty fighters said in a prepared statement. ""Oxfam is opposed to all trade from Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law."" On its website, the company says it manufactures on the West Bank, as well as in Israel, Germany, Sweden, the United States, Australia, South Africa and China. Calls to SodaStream's headquarters were not answered Thursday. It touts its products as ecologically friendly, as they help consumers avoid buying plastic soda bottles. Johansson has been nominated for at least three Golden Globes and currently stars as the voice of a computer app in the popular feature film ""Her,"" according to her IMDb profile. She also has Jewish roots. For eight years, Johansson publicly advanced Oxfam's work for survivors of calamities from Sri Lanka to the Philippines. Oxfam thanked her for her service. The previous snag Johansson hit with the ad came from television network Fox, but was quickly fixed. Fox, which will broadcast the Super Bowl on Sunday, nixed Johansson's ad, which was slotted to run during the sporting mega-event. In it, Johansson dissed competitors Coke and Pepsi, which left Fox feeling uncomfortable. SodaStream made sure the mention quickly hit the cutting room floor for the Super Bowl version, but it has retained the jab in its online version of the ad. CNN's Aaron Smith contributed to this report.","Johansson stars in an ad for soda machine maker SodaStream .

"(EW.com) -- ""You gotta pull it together man,"" Andy Samberg, the final guest on ""Late Night with Jimmy Fallon,"" told his friend. ""You're moving up a time slot, across the hall, bigger stage, this is all good stuff!"" Fallon, who has proven again in his last week before taking over ""The Tonight Show"" just what a gracious, big-hearted guy he is, agreed that he was a mess. ""I'm an Irish mush!"" he said. And bless him for it. Jimmy Fallon gets emotional during last 'Late Night' show . Fallon navigated his final week with a sense of decency that was both unapologetic and generous. Three episodes were taped remembrances of the show's best digital shorts (like ""Jersey Floor""), musical performances (an acoustic version of ""Blurred Lines"" that somehow managed to rinse clean the scuzz of the song), and comedy bits (I could watch Matthew Broderick trying to make a taco with mannequin hands every night of the week). Meanwhile he was a sweet and respectful guest for Jay Leno, for long an easy butt of late night comedians but whom Fallon never shamed or undercut throughout this long transition. I admit to feeling confused by Thursday's penultimate show, as Fallon returned to his more traditional format. His monologue was pitch perfect, bowing down to ""The Tonight Show"" host of 22 years. ""The ratings have been so good I think we're going to have another week of saying goodbye to Jay Leno,"" he said. ""It was Jay Leno's last show tonight. That's a bummer. I like that guy."" He paused to point out the obvious to the always excellent Steve Higgins. ""I mean, in a way it's good for me..."" he said. Later, Colin Farrell came on and seemed uncomfortable pitching his underwhelming ""Winter's Tale."" Chris Pratt seemed better suited to the sense of growing nostalgia in the studio. ""Nice people deserve success,"" Pratt told Fallon in his congratulations before the lot donned ridiculous bubble suits and played elevator soccer. Jimmy Fallon writes Jay Leno a truly thoughtful thank-you note . That's where so much of the pleasure in watching Fallon is found. He's game and a goof, completely lacking in cynicism and guile. When he's playing the guitar next to Bruce Springsteen or hashtagging with Justin Timberlake he has the shiny glee of a kid let loose in a candy store. If this sounds like an unabashed enthusiastic fan note, maybe it's because I'm writing about a man with such unabashed enthusiasm. The only thing clearer than how much Fallon loves what he gets to do for a living is how much he leans on and respects the people he gets to do it with. Towards the end of the show, Higgins assured Fallon he was going to be great on ""The Tonight Show"" starring Jimmy Fallon. ""You're going to be so good because you're nice, you're sweet, you're super hilarious and you are the best person on earth,"" his friend said. ""You are perfect for this job."" In ""Late Night's"" final moments, after Fallon's low-key and tender performance of ""The Weight"" with the Muppets band, its host walked alone down the deserted hall of 6A. On the other side of the exit waited Fallon's exuberant cast and crew. He jumped into their celebratory scrum as the door closed behind him. It was at once the perfect ending and an auspicious beginning. There are so many great clips from ""Late Night"" but I also picked this weird one of Questlove throwing up because of Fallon's stunned and delighted reaction. Fittingly, it was one of the host's favorite memories from 969 shows. See the original story on EW.com.

"(CNN) -- They carry a bag for a living but these men can bring home six-figure incomes. They often spend more time with their bosses than their wives, and their working ""marriages"" can end in a messy divorce. Welcome to the world of a caddy -- the golf world's unsung heroes. At the top of the pile is Steve Williams, arguably the one superstar caddy in global golf, a bag man who has earned well in excess of most professionals thanks predominantly to his past partnership with Tiger Woods. His wealth is estimated at $20 million and he was once New Zealand's highest-paid sportsman. It has been enough to pursue his other, admittedly expensive, sporting passion of saloon-car racing with his own team, appropriately titled Caddyshack. He also founded his own racing series, which he funds, and does about 25 events a year. But how has he merited such big bucks? Well, 36 years into his career he has overseen 150 tournament wins -- more than any other caddy in golf history. Now working for defending Masters champion Adam Scott, Williams argues that key to his job is the ability to understand people. ""You can teach someone to do the yardage and read the course but being a good caddy, it's not easy to explain,"" says the 50-year-old, who previously worked for major champions Greg Norman and Ray Floyd. ""It's almost like you have to stand in a player's shoes, see what they're seeing and feel what they're feeling, to be them."" Before Williams, caddies were very much behind the scenes -- but no longer. When with Woods, he described his arch rival Phil Mickelson as a ""pr***"" and he was castigated for a racist barb against his former employer some time after the 14-time major champion had fired him. And then there was his over-the-top celebration and interview when Scott won the pair's first tournament together. Other caddies have been the subject of controversy too. En route to Matt Every's victory at the Arnold Palmer Invitational last weekend -- where Scott and Williams blew a winning position on the final day -- the American's caddy Derek Mason was caught on camera shouting ""f***ing lay-up"" after a particular shot. Williams clams up when asked about his relationship with Woods but he will always be known for his time with the world No. 1 -- hardly surprising given the American won 13 of his 14 major wins with the Kiwi in tow. ""You almost have to teach yourself the psychology side of things,"" explains Williams, who is extremely affable in conversation. ""I think I'm a good reader of people -- you have to be able to observe people over a long period of time. ""You need to see how they cope under pressure and you have to see them at both their best and worst to see how they tick."" In caddying terms, Williams is something of an anomaly. Most admit to stumbling into the job, but for Williams it was different. While friends at his stunning local course -- Paraparaumu Beach Golf Club -- dreamed of being the next Peter Thompson, the five-time British Open winner from Australia, the teenage Williams merely wanted to caddy for him ... and got his chance, the first time he ever carried the bag. Now, with potential retirement looming, Williams plans to either give up altogether at the end of this season or else do the job part-time so he can spend more time with his eight-year-old son in New Zealand. ""You have to keep your enthusiasm and find ways to keep refreshed. You can get that by changing jobs or in one job by changing your goals,"" he says. ""I've been lucky that I've caddied for players that haven't played loads of tournaments in each year. ""And it's been interesting working with different players. I think it takes six to 12 months to adapt properly to a player, to learn their idiosyncrasies. ""It just doesn't happen overnight but, if you do it properly, that's when you can help best when the chips are down. And the other trick is that you're always trying to improve."" Terry Mundy may not have enjoyed the riches of Williams as a caddy but, having worked for former women's world No.1 Laura Davies and with his current partnership with 2012 European Ryder Cup hero Ian Poulter, he has enjoyed the job's trappings. He has also experienced the lot of many caddies scraping around to make ends meet on the global circuit. ""I remember it used to be four of us to a room sometimes sharing two towels or whatever,"" he says. ""It's tough. You go to those flyaway tournaments and you're easily spending $1,000 on a flight and then there's the hotel. If your player misses the cut, you're out of pocket for that week. That can be tough but I'm lucky with Ian."" The Briton's foray into the role was somewhat fortuitous. Drinking in his local pub by Woburn golf course one day, he was asked to stand in for a sick caddy. The round went well and he was invited back. Not long afterwards he was offered voluntary redundancy in his printing industry job and he took the plunge to become a caddy full-time. ""It's a lot better but it's still not quite where it should be,"" says Mundy. ""At many of the American courses you get treated fantastically well but at others it's a case of 'what are you doing here?' and you're made to feel like you're getting in the way. ""It's odd as you'll get some caddies turning up in $80,000 to $100,000 cars and yet they're treated like idiots."" As for the trick to be a good caddy, Mundy argues he has to play many different roles. ""A caddy's a little bit of everything: you can be a coach, a psychologist, you're there to keep the good rounds going and to turn the bad ones around, you're there to offer advice, be a friend, a bit of everything. But at the end of the day I can't make him play."" One key piece of caddy advice is not to fall out with your boss, which is understandable given Mundy says ""we spend more time together than we do with our wives probably."" Chris Harmston is slightly lower down the caddying rung than Williams and Mundy in the relative infancy of his bag career, which began when his once promising playing days were curtailed by back and wrist injuries. He caddies for Englishman Ross Fisher, for whom he was the best man at his wedding. It is a fledgling partnership in its second full season that is clearly working, the pair having celebrated victory at the European Tour's Tshwane Open in South Africa this month. ""After Ross' win the other day, I heard him say that 'no one knows my game better than Chris,' and he's probably right as we've played for so long together,"" says Harmston. ""As friends, it makes it even more special to win together. ""With Ross, I like to take a step back and think what's the worst can happen in a situation and, if I have something to say, Ross will listen. ""He knows at the end of the day I'm there to help and he's in charge so, if he doesn't like the decision, he won't listen to it. ""But there's the balance of knowing when to shut up and also knowing when to take a player's mind off things -- just to talk about anything, really, as you're going around. There's an element of being an amateur psychologist to it."" Caddies are, in essence, the ultimate multitaskers -- but with a shelf life, very much at the whim of the players they work for. ""Often if a player is in a slump, they think the answer is to switch caddies,"" says Mundy. ""That's not usually the answer. ""You look at a lot of the top guys, like Phil Mickelson with his caddy Bones. Those players are pretty honest guys and they stick with their caddies, and usually see the benefits. ""The best players tend to have the longer caddy relationships."" It's those guys that are worth their weight in gold.","Steve Williams, former caddy of Tiger Woods, reveals secrets of being a great golfing bag man .

"(CNN) -- Toronto police Friday were investigating a threat against controversial Mayor Rob Ford, a police spokesman said. Two police officers were at the mayor's City Hall office. The nature of the threat was unclear, police said. The threat comes amid a raging debate about the raising of the rainbow flag at Toronto's City Hall in support of gay athletes in the Sochi Games. The rainbow flag was raised outside City Hall during ceremony Friday, the same day as the Opening Ceremony in Russia. On Friday, Ford tweeted, ""I am proud of all Canadian Olympians. #Toronto #CanadianFlag #Olympics2014."" The mayor, who in the past has refused to attend the city's gay pride parade, has said he believes the Canadian flag should be raised instead. Ford became infamous for admitting he had smoked crack and drank too much in the past. His problems began in May, when allegations emerged that he appeared to be smoking crack cocaine on a pipe on cell phone video taken months earlier, in winter 2012. After initially denying that he had smoked the drug, he admitted in November that he had. The city council later voted to strip him of most of his power as mayor, reducing him to primarily a figurehead.

"(CNN) -- ""The French, British and Americans have no understanding of what's happening here,"" a foreign diplomat posted in Syria told me in the summer of 2012. At the time it was still possible for an outsider like me, having recently arrived in Syria from London, to imagine Bashar al-Assad's imminent departure. Even a U.S. State Department official had dismissed his regime as ""a dead man walking."" But non-Westerners who had spent years in Syria were less hopeful. They rejected reports in the American press prophesying the demise of the government. Al-Assad, they said, was popular among the minorities. Besides, the army's loyalty to him was near-absolute. Today, Bashar al-Assad is more powerful than he was 15 months ago. For all the predictions of his impending overthrow, his Baathist machine remains the only stable feature in Syria. Despite the carnage, daily life in Damascus, al-Assad's bastion, largely continues as before. There have been no major defections, and most importantly the Syrian Arab Army, despite suffering more than 30,000 fatalities, continues to pledge its allegiance to al-Assad. In the past two months, it has reclaimed from the opposition territory outside Damascus. Yet, instead of recalibrating its response, Washington remains tethered to its same narrow policy goal: al-Assad's removal from power. John Kerry devoted his speech Wednesday in Switzerland, where representatives of the Syrian government and some opposition groups have assembled to hold peace talks, to reiterating this demand. This is an unrealistic expectation. Far from achieving al-Assad's exit, it will prolong the violence. Syrian government representatives did not go to the negotiating table to throw away his gains. The so-called Geneva CommuniquÃ© that forms the basis of Kerry's demand does not in fact call for Assad's removal. And he is unlikely to budge without a credible threat of force from the United States. Kerry claimed this week that such a threat was still ""on the table."" In truth, Washington's options are severely limited by the embarrassing fact that the opposition that has come to Switzerland to wrest power from al-Assad does not have a significant constituency in Syria. Its members hold little sway over the mujahideen fighting government forces. Much of the territory outside the government's control is held by groups linked to al Qaeda, and al Qaeda is opposed to the peace talks. It is aware that it could emerge as the unintended beneficiary of any Western attempt to dislodge al-Assad. Even the ""moderate"" elements of the opposition appear to be beyond Washington's control. The peace talks in Switzerland were deemed crucial by Washington. Yet members of the opposition repeatedly threatened to derail them if their demand to exclude Iran from the process was not met. Kerry had been attempting for weeks to get a seat for Tehran at the talks because he grasped that, as a regional power that has abetted Syria in its civil war, Iran's presence was vital to progress. This irked Saudi Arabia, the Sunni theocracy that is alarmed by the thaw in relations between Tehran and Washington. Saudi Arabia's intervention in Syria has always been part of its effort to blunt Iran's influence and cripple what it sees is a Shia corridor of power in the Middle East. As the principal backer of the opposition, Saudi Arabia has played a key role in transforming Syria into a haven for foreign jihadists cut from the same ideological cloth as the men who carried out the 9/11 attacks. Iran hurt its own interests by refusing to adhere to preconditions, which in Tehran's view bound it to an unfavorable outcome -- a Saudi-backed transitional government -- even before the talks had begun. But its abrupt exclusion from the peace talks is a triumph of Saudi policy. All of this explains why al-Assad, despite having presided over the slaughter of so many Syrians, was able to ridicule the negotiations as a ""joke."" His decision to dispatch a delegation to participate in them was in deference to his sponsors in Russia who, having labored hard to halt the threat of a U.S. military strike against their client last year, are eager to demonstrate the utility of diplomacy. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, was quick to cast the opening day as a success. ""For the first time in three years,"" he said, ""the sides -- for all their accusations -- agreed to sit down at the negotiating table."" But the framework for the negotiations already looks obsolete. Hammered out in 2012 by Kofi Annan, then the U.N. peace envoy to Syria, its terms -- calling for a transitional governing body by mutual consent of all parties, a national dialogue, free elections, and a comprehensive review of the constitution -- hark back to a time when al-Assad seemed weak, the opposition was unified, and the phrase ""Arab Spring"" could be spoken hopefully in the West. The major powers that helped forge the Geneva CommuniquÃ©, perhaps anticipating al-Assad's fall, refused to place their weight behind it when it mattered. Annan quit his job in frustration. To ordinary Syrians, the ongoing talks in Switzerland look like a meaningless sideshow. Al-Assad, feeling triumphant, refuses to go. An internally riven opposition refuses to temper its demands. The West, unwilling to intervene militarily and incapable yet of forcing change diplomatically, watches with impotent rage. Al Qaeda, once enfeebled, looks on expectantly. Syria is now a homicidal theater for a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran -- the Middle East's Sunni and Shia powers. A dialogue between the two may do more to halt the fighting in Syria than negotiations between Assad and his Syrian adversaries operating from abroad. Washington's energies are better spent in nudging the two rivals in that direction. More immediately, the United States' ambition should be to end the violence. Rather than push for al-Assad's departure, it should work toward obtaining a pragmatic power-sharing deal centered on reconciliation rather than regime change. Finally, it should press its allies in Saudi Arabia and Qatar to drop their support for radical Islamists. If not, the flames that are now devouring Syria may soon engulf the West.

"(CNN) -- As McDonald's opens its first restaurant in Vietnam, take a look at some of the big breakthroughs the fast food chain has made in the past -- from its first outlet in the Soviet Union, through the Kosher Mac and MacMaharaja, to the branch at Guantanamo Bay. Russia . It took McDonald's 14 years of intense negotiations to convince the Communist leaders of the Soviet Union to allow the chain to set up their first restaurant. Yet almost as soon as the Iron Curtain began to fall, the first McDonald's opened in Moscow's busy Pushkin Square -- on January 31, 1990. The restaurant seated 700 diners and its opening attracted thousands of people, who queued for hours to spend the equivalent of weeks' salaries on a single burger. The company says the Moscow branch is still the largest McDonald's in the world. Israel . McDonald's operates around 180 branches in Israel, of which over 50 are kosher, meaning they only serve food that meets strict dietary requirements. Unlike the non-kosher restaurants, these branches stay closed on Saturdays to observe the Shabbat and boast a unique logo with the golden arches sitting on a blue, rather than red background. McDonald's restaurants around the world cater to local demands by including their own versions of regional specialties on the menu: in Israel, that's the ""MacKebab."" Guantanamo Bay U.S. Navy base . The McDonald's within the compound at Guantanamo Bay naval base is the only branch of the fast food chain on the island of Cuba. The restaurant is only accessible to the base's personnel and the chain says it has no plans to open any other branches in Cuba. Bosnia and Herzegovina . McDonald's spent more than four years trying to break into the Bosnian market, but opposition from local shop owners, supported by the government, was fierce. The chain finally opened its first branch in the country in 2011. McDonald's Arabia . McDonald's has managed to succeed in many Middle Eastern countries, offering various culturally- and religiously appropriate specialties to its Muslim customers. The company's first venture into the Arab world was Morocco, where it opened its first branch in Casablanca in 1992. Most branches respect Ramadan, restricting service in fasting periods during the holy month, and offering special menus at night. Certified halal-quality food is widely available, and the restaurant tries to reflect the local tastes by offering the MacArabia Chicken Sandwich, served in folded Arabic bread. In Saudi Arabia, the chain adheres to local laws by segregating male and female diners -- much to the disapproval of international women's rights organizations. India . The global hamburger chain is a big success in India, where it operates 300 branches. McDonald's offers special meals to please the palates of local customers; it does not serve any beef or pork-based burgers, reflecting the religious beliefs of many Indians. Instead, it offers the Chicken MacMaharaja and the McAloo Tikki -- a vegetarian-friendly blend of spicy potatoes and peas. Iraq . OK, it's not really the real deal, but McDonald's could still claim it as a win -- of sorts... As on other U.S. military bases around the world, McDonald's food used to be available within Baghdad's Green Zone. And while the chain is not planning to expand into the country, a successful knock-off fast food restaurant ""MaDonald's"" in the town of Sulaymaniyah has been popular with locals since it opened there in the 1990s.

"(CNN) -- Everyone fantasizes about breaking free from life's constraints, but a curious koala at the San Diego Zoo lived the dream Tuesday. Mundu, a 2-year-old koala, escaped from his enclosure, spending the day sleeping in a tree high above his exhibit. Zookeepers discovered he was missing shortly after feeding and watering the koalas at about 9 a.m. PT, said Jenny Mehlow, a zoo spokeswoman. No one knows exactly how he got out. But Mundu is on the cusp of sexual maturity, Mehlow said. His hormones are raging and he is constantly testing limits. Because the koala was not in any danger and did not pose any risk to the public, zookeepers took shifts watching Mundu in the tree. When the zoo closed, they lured him back into his exhibit. Mundu was then checked by a veterinarian.

"(CNN) -- Just when it seems impossible for things to get uglier between the two heads of a key House investigative committee, they have. Hours after Democrat Elijah Cummings accused House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa of engaging in ""McCarthyism,"" Issa shot back with a letter to Cummings accusing him of obstructing the committee's IRS investigation, and even contributing to the agency's targeting of conservative grass roots groups. ""New IRS documents identified by the committee raise disturbing concerns about your possibly motivations for opposing this investigation and unwillingness to lend your support to efforts to obtain the testimony of former IRS exempt Organizations Director Lois G Lerner,"" Issa wrote to Cummings. Issa and fellow Republicans on the committee plan to hold a vote Thursday holding Lerner in contempt of Congress. Democrats say Republicans are trampling on Lerner's constitutional rights to remain silent, and released a Congressional Research Service report saying the only time in modern history Congress held witnesses in contempt was in the 1950s during the anti-communist McCarthy era, one of the darkest times in congressional history. At the heart of Issa's new allegations about Cummings are letters sent to a conservative group called True the Vote asking for information about the group. The head of True the Vote said Cummings tactics were the same as those used by the IRS, which she called ""unacceptable."" In addition, Issa is releasing what he says is new evidence Cummings contacted the IRS that Issa says may have helped spur inappropriate IRS questions to True the Vote. ""Several of your requests are virtually identical to the information requests sent by the IRS to True the Vote in February 2012,"" wrote Issa. ""This timeline and pattern of inquiries raises concerns that the IRS improperly shared protected taxpayer information with your staff,"" Issa wrote Cummings. Issa is also accusing Cummings of withholding information from committee Republicans about his communications with the IRS and True the Vote. ""The American people deserve to know the full truth. They deserve to know why the ranking member and minority staff of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform surreptitiously contacted the IRS about an individual organization without informing the majority staff and even failed to disclose the contact after it became an issue during a subcommittee proceeding,"" said Issa. Cummings points out that he only requested public information from the IRS, and that he posted his inquiry to True to the Vote on his website -- so he wasn't hiding anything. ""I have made no secret of my concern about True the Vote's political activities,"" wrote Cummings. Cummings argues that in the case of True the Vote, there was legitimate concern about IRS granting tax-exempt status, since the group had given $5,000 to a state Republican organization, which tax-exempt groups are banned from doing. ""This political organization has raised millions of dollars for Republican candidates and describes itself as ""the largest caucus of Republican state leaders and the only national organization whose mission is to elect down ballot, state-level Republican office-holders,"" said Cummings, in a response letter to Issa.

"New York (CNN) -- The New York City Board of Health unanimously approved a mandate Wednesday requiring all children under 5 enrolled in city-licensed preschools and day cares to receive the flu vaccine. It is one of outgoing Mayor Michael Bloomberg's final health initiatives, which the New York City Department of Health proposed to the Board of Health in September. ""Young children have a high risk of developing severe complications from influenza,"" the Health Department said in a statement. ""One-third of children under five in New York City do not receive an annual influenza vaccination, even though the vaccine safely and effectively protects them against influenza illness. Young children often pass influenza to other children and family members, who then spread the infection to others in the community."" The flu vaccine will be added to the seven other vaccines children under 5 are required to get, including measles, whooping cough and chicken pox. ""We know that influenza is a serious illness which affects an estimated 15% to 40% of children during annual flu season,"" said Dr. Jay Varma, who oversees infectious diseases as deputy commissioner of the New York City Health Department. Richard Kanowitz, president of Families Fighting Flu, lost his daughter at age 4 to the virus. ""This is great news for children,"" he said. ""Had the same law been in effect when my daughter was alive in 2004, she'd be alive today. She would not have gotten the flu."" ""Only 60 percent of children under the age of 5 in New York City get vaccinated,"" Dr. Varma said. ""In New Jersey and Connecticut, where they have this requirement, it's 80%."" The issue of vaccinating children is controversial. One consistent claim is that vaccines can cause autism. ""This was a very closed process,"" said John Gilmore, director of the Manhattan-based Autism Action Network. ""We will most likely be filing a lawsuit fairly soon to overturn this. From a legal standpoint, we see this as similar to the soda ban,"" referring to the mayor's unsuccessful attempt to ban sugary drinks. Varma said the myths that flu shots can cause the flu, or worse, are just that, myths. ""It does not cause you to get the flu; it does not cause you to get autism,"" he said. The flu vaccine is available in two forms -- shot or nasal spray -- and children are required to get vaccinated by December 31. ""To the extent that this saves lives, it's great news,"" Kranowitz said. ""I wish my daughter had had the vaccination because, I, as well as other parents, were unaware how the flu killed healthy children. So the only way to protect them is to get them vaccinated.""","Children under 5 in city-licensed pre-schools, day cares must receive flu vaccine .

"(EW) -- ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is yet another piece of evidence that Marvel's formula for its behemoth superhero film franchise is exactly what audiences want. The sequel to the 2011 original starring Chris Evans as the Super Soldier grossed an estimated $96.2 million this opening weekend, setting a record for best April opening and earning an ""A"" CinemaScore from its audiences. Its opening is all the more impressive when you consider that, while it falls beneath ""The Avengers"" and ""Iron Man 3"" and ""2,"" it outranks many of the stand-alone Marvel character debuts, including both ""Thor"" films and the original ""Captain America,"" which it out-grossed by 48 percent. (It nabbed an additional $110 million from audiences overseas.) 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is the most political superhero movie ever . And while it's not surprising that more men than women showed up to watch the latest episode from Marvel's team of superheroes, more couples were in the audience than families, with the majority of the audience between 18-49. ""Noah's"" audience was eclipsed dramatically by ""Captain America,"" and it had the drop to prove it. The Darren Aronofsky-directed biblical tale fell a steep 61 percent this weekend with $17 million, putting its new total at $72.3 million. With a budget of at least $125 million, it's going to be tough for this controversial tale to end up in the green. That certainly won't be the case for the YA hit ""Divergent"" from Summit Entertainment. Actress Shailene Woodley and Co. are now members of the $100 million club, with the adaptation of Veronica Roth's novel grossing $13 million this three-day period, a 49 percent drop that puts its domestic earnings at $114 million. ""God's Not Dead"" continues to surprise at the box office. The Freestyle Releasing film about one Christian college student's quest to defend his faith grossed an additional $7.7 million with 580 more theaters added to its release. Now in its third weekend in theaters, the film from director Harold Cronk stands with an impressive $33 million to its name. 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier': A reference guide . Wes Anderson's ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" rounds out the top five this weekend, earning $6.3 million for a total of $33.4 million.

Whether it can outgross Anderson's most commercially successful films ""Moonrise Kingdom"" ($45 million) and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" ($52 million) remains to be seen. Scarlett Johansson had a busy weekend at the box office, co-starring in ""Captain America"" and headlining the R-rated indie from writer/director Jonathan Glazer, ""Under the Skin.""

It was a far better outcome then Halle Berry experienced in this three-day frame. Though EW originally reviewed her ""Frankie & Alice"" back in 2010 as part of its one-week Oscar-qualifying run, the film languished on the shelves, only receiving its first theatrical release this weekend.

"(CNN) -- It could have been a scene lifted straight from the classic Sean Connery film ""The Hill"" -- a drama in which a military prison erupts into riot after an inmate dies following a repetitive drill on an artificial hill in the blazing desert sun. But in Taiwan's real life version of the film, 18 army officers have been charged, a defense minister has resigned and the parents of 24-year-old Hung Chung-chiu are still demanding justice after their son died following an arduous punishment drill in Taiwan's searing summer heat. Corporal Hung was just three days short of completing his military service last month when he was reportedly put in solitary confinement for bringing a mobile phone with a camera onto his military base, normally a minor military transgression. Later subjected to a series of tough punishment exercises, doctors say he died of organ failure brought on by severe heatstroke. Since then, Taipei has erupted in protest. More than 100,000 placard-waving people protested outside the Presidential Palace on the weekend, according to organizers Citizen 1985, and another large protest is scheduled for this weekend. The protest underscores the increasing unpopularity of military service, not just in Taiwan, but in Asia's other developed economies such as South Korea and Singapore where young people see compulsory military service as an unwelcome interruption to university and a career. Singapore, with a conscription period of 24 months and further 10 years of reservist obligations, has one of the longest periods of national service behind South Korea and Israel. ""Conscription takes away two years of a citizen's freedom in the name of 'national interests',"" said former conscript Gordon Lee in a Singapore political blog. ""Unfortunately, in the case of Singapore, where tensions are cool, these 'national' or 'security' interests do not outweigh two years of the lives of every male citizen."" ""Even though the government often compares Singapore to Israel, South Korea and Taiwan as being a small and vulnerable state, the fact is, they live in situations of greater tension (than we do in Singapore)."" The Singapore government promotes military service as a cheaper way of building a standing army and as a means of bonding recruits regardless of their backgrounds. ""If anything, Singaporeans are just further trained to blindly obey instructions from their superiors,"" Lee said in the post. ""This culture is detrimental to society as a whole, and seems to affect creativity in the society, which is important for the spirit of free enterprise. Surely two years of a person's life is more important than this 'bonding' that presumably takes place?"" The Singapore government has been criticized for responding to worried parents by making military service safer and softer for recruits -- in one case a conscript was famously snapped making his maid carry his military pack. For many, these responses are part of the civilianization of military life, throwing a question mark over the effectiveness of a popular -- rather than a professional -- army. ""I would say (these developments) are partly in response to worried parents, but they are probably due in large to a natural evolution of the society in which these institutions are found,"" Lee told CNN. ""For example, there has also been a larger appetite for health and safety measures in, say, the construction sector as well."" Efforts in South Korea to make military service more palatable and popular by making a special unit of celebrity K-Pop recruits was scrapped last month after it was found that too often celebrity lifestyles were inimical to the harsh realities of military life. Top brass and regular recruits took a dim view of unauthorized dates, drunken trips to massage parlors and other preferential treatment for the celebrity grunts in a country where military service is regarded as a solemn national duty. ""Although we initially formed the unit to promote the military, a number of unfortunate incidents damaged the public image of the military and lowered the morale of all the regular soldiers who are in the service,"" the ministry's vice spokesperson Wi Yong-seob said at a press conference. First formed 16 years ago, the celebrity unit acted as the military's public relations office by holding concerts for soldiers or performing at important anniversaries. The issue of celebrities enlisting in the military has long been controversial in South Korea where some argue that K-Pop stars should be exempt from military service because of the substantial foreign revenue they bring to the country. Psy -- the ""Gangnam Style"" star -- is perhaps one of the most high-profile military discipline cases, famously repeating his two-year service in 2007 after neglecting his duties by giving private concerts and TV show appearances. In Taiwan, meanwhile, Hung's death has dealt a severe blow to the public profile of the country's military. Already, the Ministry of National Defense is falling drastically short in its bid to attract volunteers: its target for 2013 is 17,447 people, but as of July 3 only 1,847 had signed up. Beijing still claims Taiwan -- which split with China in 1949 following the civil war -- as part of its sovereign territory and says it will take the island by force if necessary. A 2011 report by Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense states the Chinese People's Liberation Army has 10 times as many troops as Taiwan and a military spend of roughly US$78 billion, compared with Taiwan's US$9 billion. ""Yet, the People's Republic of China's actual military funding is somewhere between two to three times the figure it has disclosed. Therefore, the actual difference in defense budget on the both sides may reach up to 21-fold,"" the report stated. The Hung incident is being taken seriously by Taiwan's military whose plans to raise an all-volunteer force by the end of 2014 may be receding in the current hostile climate. ""There will certainly be an impact,"" Col. Hu Zhong-shi, director of the ministry's Recruitment Center of National Armed Forces, told a news conference. ""We are continuing to observe the extent of what that impact might be.""","More than 100,000 protest in Taipei after military punishment leads to conscript's death .

"(Health.com) -- Jell-O, Hawaiian Punch, Pop-Tarts, Skittles, and other brightly colored foods designed to appeal to children aren't exactly health food. But do they make kids hyperactive? Doctors and consumer advocates have long wondered whether hyperactivity might be tied to certain dyes and additives used in processed foods, but in decades of research no studies have been able to conclusively prove -- or disprove -- such a link. Now, the Food and Drug Administration is formally weighing the evidence, raising the possibility that the agency may eventually strengthen its regulation of these ingredients. In a two-day meeting beginning Wednesday, an FDA advisory committee will discuss the strength of the evidence surrounding food dyes and behavior changes in children, whether food labels should be changed to better protect consumers, and whether more studies on the subject need to be conducted. (The FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of its advisory committees, but it usually does.) Health.com: 9 food additives that may affect ADHD . The debate over the potential effects of food dyes has been simmering since the 1970s. Why is the FDA acting now? The main impetus appears to be a 2008 petition from a Washington, D.C-based watchdog group, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which asked the FDA to ban eight different food dyes including Yellow No. 5 -- found in macaroni-and-cheese mixes, lemon-lime Gatorade, Lucky Charms cereal, and many other foods. The FDA reviewed the petition and, in September 2010, decided that color additives didn't directly cause hyperactivity or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, a condition characterized by chronic attention and behavioral problems. However, it didn't rule out that they might exacerbate preexisting problems in children with ADHD. Health.com: What causes ADHD? 12 myths and facts . No one knows what the FDA committee will decide, but the research so far ""doesn't appear to be conclusive evidence that food additives actually cause ADHD,"" says Kate Ulbricht, cofounder of the Natural Standard Research Collaboration, an independent research group based in Somerville, Massachusetts. ""Some research suggests that they may be linked to exacerbated symptoms in people who already have ADHD."" Tying hyperactivity to specific food dyes or additives is especially difficult, Ulbricht adds, because ""most products contain more than one."" Indeed, some types of candy contain as many as 10. A long-standing debate . The first inkling that food additives might be linked to attention problems arose more than three decades ago, when California pediatrician Ben Feingold, M.D., developed a diet free of artificial dyes and flavorings that supposedly quelled hyperactive symptoms in children. Many people enthusiastically tried the so-called Feingold Diet, but the enthusiasm waned as the years went on and ""some very well-done randomized controlled studies"" questioned Feingold's theory, says Deborah Pearson, Ph.D., the director of the ADHD Research Laboratory at the University of Texas--Houston Health Science Center. ""I don't think there was a great deal of evidence suggesting that withdrawing food dyes and food additives were helping those children,"" Pearson says. ""For a very small subset of kids there might have been an indication but, for the vast majority, not eating cookies with that frosting with the red dye in it didn't make a difference."" Health.com: 10 kid-targeted junk foods . More recently, a pair of government-funded studies in the U.K. revived interest in the link between food dyes and behavioral problems. In one study, published in 2004, researchers found that a diet free of artificial colorings and the preservative sodium benzoate appeared to reduce hyperactive behavior among preschoolers. In the other, published in the Lancet in 2007, preschool and grade-school children seemed to be more hyperactive when given a juice drink with these same additives than they were after consuming an otherwise identical, additive-free drink. Both of these studies -- which inspired the CSPI's petition to the FDA -- marked a departure from previous research in that they looked at children without ADHD who were not suspected of being sensitive to food additives. ""Those studies were not definitive, but they extended the concern from children with behavioral issues to the general population,"" says Michael Jacobson, Ph.D., executive director of the CSPI. ""Almost every other study used as subjects children who were hyperactive or inattentive or suspected of being sensitive to dyes."" Health.com: Are food dyes really safe? Could food dyes be banned? Last year, the European Union placed warning labels on food containing the six artificial colors used in the Lancet study (three of which are not approved in the U.S.). And in 2009, the British counterpart to the FDA, the Food Standards Agency, asked food companies to voluntarily phase out these additives. The FDA has not said that it is prepared to take similar steps. And because food dyes are more prevalent here than in Europe, an outright ban on some or all of the additives would be very difficult to implement, Jacobson says. However, some food manufacturers are proactively reducing their use of food dyes and other additives, and some retailers are declining to stock products containing artificial coloring. Whole Foods, for instance, has had such a policy in place since the 1980s, says Joe Dickson, quality standards coordinator for the company. Health.com: Quiz: Do you have adult ADHD? The food industry, meanwhile, has defended the safety of its products. ""[Added] colors are safe and play an important technological role in foods.

"(CNN) -- Snow is bear-hugging parts of New England Tuesday. Again. For those shivering near Boston, you're not alone. The seemingly forever-frigid temperatures this winter have turned arcane weather terms viral. (Think: polar vortex) In fact, this onslaught of the white stuff has many cities close to marking their snowiest winter in history. Here are some potential record-breaking places, according to CNN's weather unit . Indianapolis . This season Indianapolis has been coated with 52 inches of snow. And that's not far behind the previous record, set in 1981-82 when the Indiana city had 58.2 inches of snow, according to CNN's weather unit tally. Philadelphia . The City of Brotherly Love has been hit with a little more than 58 inches of snow this season. That's the third snowiest winter ever, according to the CNN weather unit. Though there have been some blockbuster storms this year, it would take a monstrous blizzard to break the 2009-10 record when the area was hit with more than 78 inches of snow. Toledo . There could be a record snowfall in Toledo, Ohio, by the end of the week. As of Tuesday morning, 72.4 inches had fallen in the area, the second-most ever. That's very close to the record 73.1 inches that fell in 1977-78 . Detroit . The Motor City has been immobilized by snow this winter. More than 77 inches have fallen, the third-most in history. Detroit may not beat a centuries-old record, though. The all-time record is 93.6 recorded in the winter of 1880-81. Cincinnati . Compared to other regions, Cincinnati hasn't been hit that hard. The Ohio city has had 44 inches of snow this season. That's the fifth-snowiest winter in history. The record is 53.9, which fell in a winter of 1977-78. New York . The Big Apple has had its share, totaling a little more of 57 inches. That is the seventh-snowiest winter on record, behind the record 75 inches that fell in 1995-96. CNN's Sean Morris contributed to this report.","Several cities are close to record-level snowfall .

"(CNN) -- Being diagnosed with a chronic disease -- any disease -- is hard. But imagine first spending months or years going from doctor to doctor, trying to figure out what's wrong. Then, in the end, being diagnosed with a disease few people have ever heard of. Now think about all that happening when you're just a kid. Nearly 30 million people in the United States have a rare disease. What qualifies something as a rare? It's a specific disease or disorder that affects fewer than 200,000 Americans, according to the National Institutes of Health's Office of Rare Diseases Research. Scientists have identified more than 6,800 of these diseases worldwide. In honor of Rare Disease Day, CNN asked readers to submit their stories. We were inspired by these children living with rare diseases. They endure stares, disbelief and debilitating symptoms as they find joy in life's simple pleasures. Here are a few of their stories: . Mitochondrial myopathy . The fact that Sam Brinneman, 16, is alive and well is inspiring all on its own, says his mom, Chris. The Brinnemans knew something was wrong within days of Sam's birth -- he had a weak cry, wasn't nursing well and was ""floppy,"" Chris says. It took three years for doctors to diagnose Sam with mitochondrial myopathy. Since then, Sam has exceeded everyone's expectations. He's currently a sophomore at a rigorous college-prep high school in Fort Wayne, Indiana. He participates on the school's speech team and in architecture club. Last year he was the state's Goodwill Ambassador for the Muscular Dystrophy Association. ""He was so deathly ill at times as an infant and toddler, that he constantly amazes me with his abilities,"" Chris said. ""The thing that makes me most proud is the fact that he teaches acceptance wherever he goes. Because he is so open about his disease and so willing to share, he has rarely -- next to never -- been teased by his peers."" Sam struggles on a daily basis to get enough calories for optimal nutrition. He wears a breathing machine to bed to treat his sleep apnea. His parents are diligent about keeping him away from sick people, as his immune system is weak. Yet Sam never uses his disease as an excuse, his mom says. ""He has spoken with groups of all sizes, spreading the message about (mitochondrial diseases), including the need for quicker diagnosis, the need for treatment and the hope for a cure."" Read more about Sam's story on iReport . Cyclic vomiting syndrome . ""I never expected my little girl to have to fight a battle with a foe she couldn't see,"" Tricia Andersen said. But when her daughter, Ali, was 13 months old, she started throwing up and couldn't stop. For a day and a half, Tricia watched as Ali retched painfully and was admitted to the hospital for dehydration. When she was discharged the vomiting episodes continued -- every three weeks like clockwork. After a year of doctors' visits, Ali was finally diagnosed with cyclic vomiting syndrome. It took the family another six months and a trip to another state to find a medication combination that would work to ease her symptoms. Even then, she was hospitalized half a dozen times by the time she was 9. Ali is now 11 years old, and doesn't let CVS dictate her life, Tricia says. She does robotics at school, plays basketball and participates in several track and field events, even though she has to wear an ice vest to keep her body temperature from getting too high. ""She gets involved with the activities that make her happy,"" her mom said. ""[This] allows her to be a 'normal' kid despite having a chronic illness. Having CVS is a part of her life, not what controls it."" Read more about Ali's story on iReport . Cutaneous mastocytosis . When Kellie and Josh Ewell saw their baby, Gage, for the first time, they were shocked. ""His sweet body [was] covered from the tip of his head to the soles of his feet with blisters, hives, knots, and raw places where the blisters had come open,"" Kellie wrote on iReport. ""His skin the texture of an orange and fire-engine red."" Gage, now 2, has pediatric diffuse cutaneous mastocystosis. An overabundance of mast cells in his body causes severe allergic reactions to just about everything. His skin turns purple, he struggles to breathe and his parents can only watch as he tears at his skin, trying to find some relief. He is in constant pain, Kellie says. Despite his illness, Gage is ""a little boy anxious to learn and explore the world,"" his mom said. He loves people, laughing, playing outside and with the family boxer, Colt. He has never known a life without itching, aches or pains, but doesn't let that stop him. ""I want him to be anything that he wants to be and go after any dream that he has,"" Kellie said. ""I never want him to hold back out of fear of what might happen."" Read more about Gage's story on iReport . Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita . Kailen Carpenter is a ladies' man. The 12-year-old learned early that women love to help him with things like carrying his lunch tray or holding his hand as he climbs steps -- and takes full advantage of their companionship. Kailen was diagnosed with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, a condition that affects joint movement, shortly after birth. The condition was caused by his cramped quarters next to his twin in utero, his mom Kayawna says. His arms are locked in a straight position. He cannot bend his arms to put on his clothes, use a knife and fork, comb his hair or touch his face. Yet he teaches everyone around him the meaning of perseverance, she says. He's also a terrific dancer and a nearly straight-A student. ""This is an able-bodied world, and people like me have to learn how to live in it,"" Kailen said. ""I can't move like you do, but I hold my own... (People) should take every day and live it like you're awesome. I do."" Read more about Kailen's story on iReport . Leukodystrophy . MRI scans of Ryan Wright's brain show he has the white matter of a 6-month-old baby. Yet he speaks in five- to six-word sentences, rides his bike and goes to preschool. Ryan is 4 years old. He was recently diagnosed with a rare form of leukodystrophy, a progressive genetic disorder that affects the development of myelin in his brain. Myelin is fatty tissue that protects the brain's nerve fibers. The disorder affects Ryan's balance and muscle strength, and causes hand and eye tremors. His parents try to keep his life as normal as possible in between therapy sessions. He sees an eye doctor every three months, and a neurologist and geneticist every six months. ""It is very hard to tell the prognosis for children with leukodystrophy,"" his mom, Tricia, said. ""Some children stay the same for the rest of their lives, some children decline fast, and some children decline slow."" Ryan never gives up, Tricia says, and is fiercely independent. His geneticist says these traits will keep Ryan healthy longer. Read more about Ryan's story on iReport . Juvenile dermatomyositis . Tristan Coffey is 5 years old. In July, he developed a mysterious rash on his hands. Three months later, he was diagnosed with juvenile dermatomyositis, a rare autoimmune disorder. His immune system is attacking itself, causing painful inflammation in his joints, muscles and internal organs. The Coffeys call it the ""invisible illness"" because except for the rashes on Tristan's hands and feet, there is little obvious to the eye. ""Everyone looks at him and says 'Oh, he looks so great,' but they can't see his body attacking his heart, or his liver, or his veins, or his muscles,"" his mom Brianna said. ""They can't see how much he is in the hospital, all that he endures, all the treatments."" Juvenile dermatomyositis is treatable, but not curable. Tristan takes 11 to 14 medications a day. He has a catheter port in his chest for weekly steroid infusions and monthly IVIg therapy. These medications cause huge mood swings, and limit Tristan's ability to be outdoors in the sun. Despite all this, Tristan is always first in line to play soccer and at the playground with his friends. He's also one of the funniest kids you'll ever meet, Brianna says. ""He will always light up a room, the hospital, the grocery store -- wherever we may be."" He's also super sensitive to other people's feelings, she says. ""Occasionally he will catch me crying. He will put his little hands on my cheeks and wipe away my tears and say ""Mom, I just love you and I'm going to be OK. Don't cry, Mom.""

"(CNN) -- The first wave of India's 814 million eligible voters cast their ballots in the remote northeastern states of Assam and Tripura Monday, as the largest election in world history got underway. Any time the world's most populous democracy goes to the polls, it's a momentous undertaking. But with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh stepping aside after a decade in charge, analysts say voting will take on an even greater significance this time around, with the country potentially poised on the cusp of a new political era. Amid widespread public concern over corruption, rising inflation and slowing economic growth, voters face a choice between the young scion of India's most powerful political dynasty, and a populist, business-minded Hindu nationalist who is described as at once India's most popular and most divisive politician. ""This election is a battle of ideologies, it's a battle for (the) kind of India we want,"" declared 43-year-old Congress Party candidate Rahul Gandhi -- whose great-grandfather, grandmother and father have all served as prime minister -- in a recent speech. The outcome of the election, which will be held in stages over five weeks -- employing 11 million polling and security personnel and absorbing an estimated $5 billion in campaigning costs -- may have stark ramifications for India's identity at home and abroad. By the Numbers: The world's biggest exercise in democracy . Modi rides high . After a decade of coalition government led by the secular, center-left Congress Party (INC), which has ruled for most of the post-independence era, support is soaring for India's other major political party. Polling suggests a strong swing to the center-right, Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), with a recent survey by the Pew Research Center finding voters preferred the BJP to lead the next government by a margin of more than three to one. The party's support has been boosted by the immense popularity of prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, 63-year-old Chief Minister of the western state of Gujarat. Nearly 80% of those surveyed by Pew had a positive view of Modi, with 60% describing their impressions of him as very favorable. (By comparison, 50% held positive views of Gandhi, with just 23% giving ""very favorable"" responses.) WATCH: India heads to the polls . Modi's reputation as a tough, ""can-do"" administrator rests largely on his record in charge of Gujarat since 2001, a state whose economic success is often cited as an example for the rest of the country. The BJP's economic model under Modi, focusing on infrastructure, urbanization and eradicating red tape, contrasts sharply with the traditional approach of the Congress Party, whose focus on promoting inclusive growth involves a raft of welfare schemes. Dilip Dutta, director of the South Asian Studies Group at the University of Sydney, said Modi's model was widely seen as offering better prospects of economic development, particularly by the young voters tipped to play a key role in the election. About 100 million voters will be eligible to vote for the first time in 2014. ""They're getting some hope that perhaps Modi can steer the economy in the right direction so that they can get more in terms of job opportunities and economic growth,"" he said. ""These young voters are exposed through electronic media to the whole world, and have a dream of moving forward -- not lagging behind as their fathers and grandfathers have for decades."" Mohan Guruswamy, a political analyst at Delhi's Center for Policy Alternatives, likens Modi's economic vision for a ""right-wing, authoritarian corporate state"" as closer to the model in China -- India's neighboring superpower whose rapid economic ascent is eyed enviously from the subcontinent, where GDP growth has dropped below 5%. A Hindu nationalist at the helm? In contrast to the Congress Party's secularism, Modi is also notable as a Hindu nationalist -- a position that resonates with large swathes of an increasingly confident, assertive electorate, but gives pause to some among the country's religious minorities. ""Internationally, he would be a little more hardline on everything -- Pakistan, China, America. Indian interests would be aggressively asserted,"" said Guruswamy. ""It plays well with the electorate, the new generation coming up that's educated by the Internet -- they tend to be right-wing nerds."" Their nationalist perspective, he said, was informed by ""a sense of victimhood, that we've been victimized by foreigners -- by Muslim invaders, Christian invaders."" But for all the excitement around Modi, he comes with plenty of detractors. Chief among them are those who question his suitability to lead a country as diverse as India. In particular, his track record with India's 180 million-strong Muslim community, the country's second largest religious group, has come under scrutiny. Less than a year after Modi assumed office in Gujarat in late 2001, the state was wracked with anti-Muslim violence, in which more than 1000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed. Modi was criticized for not doing enough to halt the violence, accusations he has denied. The U.S. State Department denied Modi a visa in 2005 over the issue, but last month said it would welcome Modi to the United States if he wins. READ MORE: 11 things to know about the Indian elections . The effectiveness of his much-vaunted ""Modinomics"" formula in Gujarat has also been brought into question, with claims his influence has been overhyped. ""There is no 'Gujarat model,' and there are other states with faster economic growth,"" says Guruswamy. Many feel that economic development in the state has been unequally distributed, and not matched with corresponding gains in human development, he said. Modi's style of leadership -- perceived as decisive by admirers, as autocratic by detractors -- is also seen by some as ill-suited for the nation's top office. ""It's not a place where you can press buttons -- you have to work with people,"" said Guruswamy, who knows Modi personally. ""The prime minister of India has to be the supreme conciliator, reconciling the aspirations and demands of thousands of groups. It's not like China where you can turn off Weibo one day -- you can't be autocratic or they'll cut you out."" Gandhi: A prime minister-in-waiting? Yet any misgivings about Modi have so far failed to buoy the prospects of the Congress candidate Rahul Gandhi. With an unparalleled political pedigree as the son of assassinated former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and the Italy-born Congress Party president Sonia Gandhi, the 43-year-old has long been viewed as a prime minister-in-waiting. But his chances have been hampered by widespread voter displeasure with the Congress-led coalition government over high inflation, slowing economic growth and a run of corruption scandals, says Dutta. For all Gandhi's youth, his party is seen as the old order, with Modi widely viewed as providing the alternative to the status quo, says Guruswamy. ""I don't think Gandhi is in the game,"" he said. ""He's seen as undeserving, his mother's son. How many generations can you pull along like this? I think people are getting tired of it,"" he said. In contrast to what Guruswamy described as Modi's ""relentless drive to become prime minister,"" questions have been asked whether Gandhi possesses a genuine desire to lead, while his personal style has failed to excite voters. ""Like somebody said, he's got the charisma of cold pizza,"" said Guruswamy. Anti-corruption platform . While both parties pledge to target corruption, said Guruswamy, a lack of public confidence in either to effectively address the problem has paved the way for a new political force to enter the fray. Formed in late 2012, the Aam Aadmi (Common Man) Party, led by former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, won an unexpected 28 of 70 seats in the Delhi Assembly in 2013. Contesting its first general election, it will be fielding more candidates than either major party. Guruswamy said the anti-corruption party could prove to have some longevity. ""They're going to flag the agenda, they're making their presence felt this time around,"" said Guruswamy. ""By the time the next election comes around, they'll be a big force."" Dutta said a long-term commitment would be required to make any progress in tackling India's entrenched, endemic corruption problem. ""I wish (Kejriwal) will be able to succeed -- but it won't be overnight,"" he said. CNN's Sumnima Udas and Moni Basu contributed to this report.","India's general election will take five weeks and is the biggest election in history .

"(CNN) -- Facebook's billion-dollar purchase of Instagram this week may have been the first time that many Facebookers heard of the tech-world darling, which lets users turn their phone photos into sleek-looking, stylized images with a single touch. The acquisition shined a light on what's emerging as a nearly incontrovertible truth in tech circles: Mobile is the future of photography and the tools used to enhance and share phone-generated images have value that is only expected to climb. Instagram isn't the only player in that field, but it had quickly become its all-star. Barely a year-and-a-half old, Instagram had already racked up 30 million users on Apple's mobile system before opening up to Android users last week. Another 5 million signed up in less than a week, setting the table for Facebook to gobble up what until Monday was emerging as its prime competitor in mobile photo-sharing. Some early adopters complained that Facebook snatching up their favorite app takes some of the indie shine off of it. But there's no question that, by putting the tool in front of its hundreds of millions of users, Facebook could amp up what's already a quickly emerging sector of the mobile landscape. (For reference, witness what happened with music streaming when Facebook and Spotify signed an exclusive sharing deal). The appeal of Instagram and similar apps doesn't take much work to suss out: With minimal effort, they let pedestrian photographers share enhanced images with their friends. ""The strength of Instagram is in its simplicity,"" said Bill Jones, founder and editor of The Photo Argus, a photography resource blog. ""A few clicks and you have a once average image that now looks amazing and can be easily shared with your friends."" View featured comments, photos from readers . Instagram, he said, ""recognized a space that needed to be filled, and they filled it ... Mix in some luck and there you go, a billion-dollar acquisition."" While the Facebook-Instagram is the richest and most high-profile example, other Web bigwigs have clearly recognized that mobile is the future of photography. In 2010 (an eon ago in Internet years), Google led the charge by buying Picnik, one of the first sites to combine cool photo-editing tools with cloud computer storage. And last month, AOL (which had its own billion-dollar deal this week) bought Hipster -- an app that lets user create postcards out of their photos. Instagram's rapid growth -- it's more than doubled its user base in the past five months -- is just the latest evidence of the explosion of online and mobile photo sharing. In less than two years the app has already hosted more than 500 million images -- more than 30 times greater than the entire photo archive of the Library of Congress. That sounds like a lot until you realize that Facebook users have uploaded more than 170 billion photos to the social network, making it the single largest host of images on the Internet, according to statistics cited during a panel last month during the South by Southwest Interactive conference. Photographers on that panel, which included Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom, said the mobile-photography craze is important, even if it sometimes leads mundane, amateurish images flooding your social networks. ""Having 100 million more photos in the world isn't doing anybody any harm,"" said Richard Koci Hernandez, assistant professor of new media at the University of California-Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. ""It has value no matter what."" Jones, of The Photo Argus, agrees, and says mobile photography is likely to remain on the rise at technology improves. ""I think this purchase sends a signal that mobile photography is more relevant than ever,"" he said. ""Mobile photography is already overtaking the point-and-shoot market. I think this has been obvious for some time. But soon they will begin to really encroach on the (digital camera) market, as well. As the technology gets better, people might be more inclined to put their 'pro' camera in their pocket instead of purchasing one they need a backpack for."" Instagram is known for producing artful, filter-laden photos that would not look out of place hanging in an art gallery. But Systrom believes the most meaningful images on his network aren't necessarily the ones taken by professional photographers. He cited people in the Midwest who used Instagram earlier this year to document damage caused by tornadoes. ""How can we get the most important images out there -- not necessarily the most socially pleasing?"" he said at the SXSW panel, suggesting that Instagram in the future might highlight curated photos, not just the ones with the most ""likes."" ""How do we sift through that [all the images on Instagram] and present for you the most interesting and most meaningful photos? That's our challenge for the next few years."" ""My hope is that people feel at home on Instagram by posting just about anything,"" Systrom added. ""On Instagram, taking photos really helps you see the world around you in a whole new way."" While Instagram has clearly rocketed to the top of the pack in a short time, a rising tide has lifted the ships of other mobile apps as well. Those efforts stand to benefit from the increased attention the Instagram buyout will bring, as well as any Instagram users who may peel off as a sort of nose-thumbing at Facebook, the 800-pound gorilla of the social networking world. They include: . Cinemagram: Adds animation. With Cinemagram, users are invited to shoot a few seconds of video with their phones. Then, by selecting a few images from their videos, they can create what appear to be animated photographs. We're pretty sure this is how they did it at Hogwarts. Piictu: In a way, Piictu is the anti-Instagram. Users are encouraged to post plain, simple photos that communicate for them -- which is why the app has been called ""Twitter for pictures."" Like Twitter, photos are grouped together under trending topics, letting users share with strangers as well as friends. PIxable: If Instagram is a way to push your fancy, filtered photos to sites like Facebook and Twitter, Pixable lets you take photos already on those sites, fancy them up and share with other users of the app. Hipstamatic: A precursor to Instagram, Hipstamatic was probably the first way people started seeing grainy, old-fashioned photos popping up in their Facebook and Twitter feeds. Instead of instantly applying a filter, Hipstamatic lets users modify their photos through a series of tweaks to get just the right classic look. CNN's Brandon Griggs contributed to this report.","Facebook's Instagram purchase shines light on emerging mobile photo market .

"(CNN) -- Once upon a time, the Latino presence in the United States was largely a regional phenomenon, and outside the Southwest, a big-city one. Mexicans and Mexican-Americans were concentrated in the border and Western states, with an outpost in the Great Lakes states; Cubans in South Florida and the Northeast; Puerto Ricans in New York and its suburbs. Certainly not exclusively, but the pattern was largely in place by World War II and remained that way for decades. Then, a couple of things happened. As any student of history can tell you, events don't pass in some orderly procession, but happen in bunches and ricochet around the country. The immigration laws were rewritten, swinging the axis of new arrivals away from Europe -- after more than a century of enormous human flows from that continent -- to Latin America, Asia and Africa. New suburbs sprang up on America's urban peripheries, the national economy grew rapidly, and Latin America suffered both economic stagnation and Cold War-accelerated political turmoil. Whew! Dominicans poured into the Northeast, mostly to New York, escaping instability and poverty back home. Puerto Ricans saw their fortunes sink with those of their mainland capital of New York, and headed to Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania looking for a better life, while new arrivals from the island increasingly headed for booming Florida. Miami shifted from being a Cuban home away from home to becoming a financial and cultural capital of Latin America. And Mexicans, the largest of Latin America's constituent groups, spread everywhere, establishing new beachheads in cities large and small, in fading industrial towns and agricultural centers. They grew in places that had long been home, like Los Angeles and San Antonio, while tiny settlements became bustling communities in places as disparate as Washington state's Yakima Valley; Dalton, Georgia; and the Caribbean stronghold of New York City. Big things are happening both in the raw numbers of Latinos inside the United States, zooming past 50 million in the 2010 Census, and inside those numbers in distinct communities. Cubans are no longer a majority among the Latinos of Florida, as large numbers of Puerto Ricans concentrate in midstate counties around Orlando, and Caribbeans and South and Central Americans continue to flock to Miami-Dade. As Puerto Ricans continue to disperse through the Northeast, Dominicans may soon come to outnumber them in a place where Boricuas once lived in numbers that rivaled San Juan. This story is perhaps most stunning in the Southeast, in the states of the Confederacy. Through most of American history, the states from Texas to Virginia were among the most uniformly native-born places in the U.S. There was no southern Ellis Island era, no great wave of arrivals crowding ethnic ghettoes in Richmond, Birmingham, and Atlanta. Now the increases in the Latino population are being measured in hundreds of percentage points. The governor of Georgia appoints a commission on Latino affairs. School districts that never did so in their history now must hire teachers of English as a second language. Latinos are unique among American immigrants. Unlike the Italians, Irish, and Poles, and the Jews of Eastern Europe, they were already long-settled inhabitants of what would become the United States when the Declaration of Independence was written. America came to them in the form of purchase, invasion, and annexation. Then, later, when the modern borders of the continent-spanning superpower were established, Latinos came from their own countries too. It gave Latinos a unique cultural deposit in this country as it was forming, and a role to play in defining the culture in 2013 and for generations to come. Understanding the last 500 years will help you understand your country and your country's history better, and it is indispensable for making sense of what's to come. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ray Suarez.","Latinos were already living in what would become the U.S. before the nation existed .
U.S. Latino population is growing fast, and traditional demographic patterns are shifting .
Once, Latino presence was mainly in a few regions, but that has changed dramatically .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin went to great lengths to portray their phone call Friday as evidence the two leaders were working together to stabilize the situation in Ukraine. Absent were the accusations they traded the past two months over the future of the former Soviet republic. The Obama administration continues to dismiss the notion of a new Cold War with Russia. But the louder their protests, the more apparent the chill has become. It was on display Saturday in widely differing characterizations of a telephone conversation between Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, after news broke that Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych left the capital because of what he described as a ""coup."" Kerry said the two agreed on a need to resolve the political tumult in Ukraine without violence, and that he expressed to Lavrov the importance of both countries encouraging Ukraine to move toward constitutional change, according to the State Department. But Lavrov said he raised concerns about ""illegal extremist groups"" refusing to surrender arms and reiterated the conversation between their respective leaders. ""Putin called on Obama to use all opportunities to curb the radicals' illegal actions and settle the situation by peaceful means,"" according to a state-run ITAR-TASS report, which was tweeted by Russia's Foreign Ministry. In December, Kerry snubbed Ukraine after it rejected an agreement to increase trade with Europe. Instead he visited Moldova, which did sign the agreement. There, Kerry insisted the United States was not engaged in a bidding war with Russia over Ukraine or any of the former Soviet republics. Kerry raises idea of sanctions against Ukraine government . Similar statements ensued over the past few months, with the White House saying this week the Ukraine conflict is not reminiscent of the ""proxy conflicts of the Cold War era."" Obama put a finer point on showdown in Kiev this week, saying he didn't view U.S. and Russian differences over Ukraine, or Syria, through that lens. ""Our approach as the United States is not to see these as some Cold War chessboard in which we're in competition with Russia. Our goal is to make sure that the people of Ukraine are able to make decisions for themselves about their future, that the people of Syria are able to make decisions without having bombs going off and killing women and children, or chemical weapons, or towns being starved because a despot wants to cling to power."" U.S. talks tough, but options limited in Ukraine . Obama is right. It is not the Cold War. Today, the United States has the upper hand economically, militarily and diplomatically. But it does face a resurgent, defiant and increasingly authoritarian Russia. But, in essence, it is a chessboard. And the crisis in Ukraine illustrates the latest moves between Washington and Moscow as they compete for influence on the world stage. The disagreement between the two powers over Ukraine is not entirely dissimilar to their power play over the conflict in Syria. Until recently, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was able to challenge his opposition's pro-Western leanings with Russian political and financial backing, just as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in large part has been able to withstand three years of civil war and threats of American military strikes with Russian money, arms and diplomatic support. But in both cases, Obama matched Putin's moves with his own. Washington banned 20 officials from the Russian-backed government in Kiev from traveling to the United States, and has threatened further measures if government forces continue their violent crackdown against protesters. Frustrated with Moscow's failure to enact any compromises from the Syrian regime at U.S.-Russian sponsored peace talks in Geneva, the United States has now signaled it is examining its policy options in Syria, where the bombing by al-Assad's forces against civilians has intensified. Putin's desire to maintain a sphere of influence in the Middle East is in no ways limited to Syria. He has met U.S. ambivalence toward the military-led government by welcoming the de facto Egyptian leader, Field Marshal Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, to Moscow this month, giving him an endorsement for his as-yet undeclared candidacy for president and continuing discussions about a $2 billion arms deal for Egypt, even as the U.S. has suspended some military support to Cairo. The visit was a Russian bid to rekindle a relationship that foundered since the Cold War, when Egyptian President Anwar Sadat broke off ties with the Kremlin. The ties remained frosty during Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule. But the warm reception of Sisi and Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy also seemed designed to send a message to the United States that Russia still has clout in the region's most influential and populous country and is prepared to increase its military ties. Sport is not immune to the rivalry between the two nations. Obama declined to attend the Sochi Olympics, instead sending openly gay athletes in a clear jab at Russia's anti-gay laws. It was the first time in more than a decade a U.S. president, vice president, first lady or former president hasn't attended an Olympic opening or closing ceremony. The U.S. hockey victory over the Russians in Sochi, the first American win since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, added insult to injury, presumably made even more painful by the gloats of National Security Adviser Susan Rice, who tweeted ""U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A."" Overall, Putin's party in Sochi was a relative success. Dire predictions of political protests or a terrorist attack haven't materialized, and after a rocky start in terms of preparations at some hotels and the condition of some venues, the games were hailed by most athletes and the International Olympic Committee athletes. Putin was even on his best behavior as he made a visit to American athletes at the U.S. Olympic headquarters. But now that the Sochi games are coming to a close, Putin has even less incentive to play nice. With the truce in Kiev shaky at best, the U.S. is bracing for an even more audacious power grab for Ukraine -- whether that be financial blackmail or even sending in its own forces if the violence continues. It will then be up to the U.S. to contemplate its next move on this chess board. With Ukraine's future at stake, it's far from a game. CNN's Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- There's no question about it -- I hate to lose. On Tuesday, Alex Sink, a great Democrat running in a special congressional election in Florida, lost. When a campaign doesn't go my way, I always take a step back, look at the facts and try to figure out what we could learn from that experience. And we definitely learned some lessons from the Florida special election. First off, let's put this in perspective. Republicans held this congressional district for six decades. In the past decade, Congressman Bill Young won his seat by anywhere from 15% to 38%. Public polling in the run-up to Election Day showed that the electorate was going to skew toward Republicans by around 10%. The actual Republican margin of victory? About 2%. I don't like losing any race, but let's not overstate what this was. We saw a Republican win in a district that is traditionally held by Republicans -- by a significantly lower margin than in the past 60 years. So, what did we learn? There's the Republican dogma, bought by beltway pundits and some in the mainstream media, that it was a referendum on Obamacare. The appeal to repeal worked, so they say. But, as a great American once sang, ""it ain't necessarily so."" According to David Weigel at Slate, both David Jolly, the Republican, and Sink, the Democrat, ""rejected the national 'narrative' that the race was a clear referendum on Obamacare."" By a strong majority, Independents sided with the Democrat who was committed to fixing and improving Obamacare over the Republican who wants to repeal it. That wasn't enough to change the advantage Republicans held going into Election Day, but we came really close. How about money? Yes, Republicans pumped money into this race. Republican special interest groups are still committed to throwing money behind any candidate running with an ""R"" as a suffix. In this race outside Republican groups dumped in $5 million to squeak out a win in a district they carried by 15% in 2012. Money might have been a factor, but third party groups aligned with Democrats also poured in money to help get out the vote. So Democrats can't entirely say we lost because we were outspent. What, then, was it about? What are the real lessons? I think there are three: the message, boots on the ground and motivating the base. 1. Don't be afraid: The Republican message was, as is so often, ""be afraid."" Republicans accused Democrats of $716 billion in Medicare cuts. This was the same theme, as progressive activist Dave Johnson pointed out, that shifted the 2010 election to Republicans, and it helped again. It's ironic, of course, because Democrats want to fix healthcare, make it better and more affordable. It's ironic because, by a strong majority, independents sided with the Democrat who was committed to fixing and improving Obamacare over the Republican who wants to repeal it. It's ironic because from the start, Democrats introduced, pushed for, defended and protected Medicare. But the ""be afraid"" message works well for Republicans, in part because the Democrats don't counter it. ""Don't be afraid"" is just not that good of a message. 2. Hit the ground: The second thing we learned, not surprisingly, is that Democrats cannot win without a good ground game -- and turnout still matters. Let's face it, more Republican voters filed and submitted absentee ballots than Democrats, and more turned out on Election Day. As Johnson pointed out, 58% in precincts Mitt Romney won in 2012, and 48.5% in precincts Obama won. About 49,000 fewer people voted in this election than in the 2010 general midterm election (down 21%), and 158,500 fewer than in the 2012 presidential election (down 46%). We saw yet again that when fewer people participate in the process, when fewer people vote, Republicans win. Democrats believe that when more people vote, it's not just good for our party, it's good for democracy. 3. It's all about the base: The third lesson is Democrats must motivate the base and not rely in traditional methods to reach voters. In this week's election, turnout was lower than it was in the 2010 midterm elections, and much lower than it was in the 2012 presidential race. Low turnout in off-year races is always a challenge for Democrats. Many of our voters require information and must be contacted way ahead of Election Day -- and reminded of what's at stake. Yes, a little red meat helps because these voters tend not to be as seasoned when it comes to knowing the issues, like raising the minimum wage and creating good paying jobs. Luckily, we'll have another chance to win this seat back in November -- and with more people voting, we'll have an even better shot at picking up the seat. While we learned important lessons that will help us win in November, we won't fret over this loss too much. After all, the Republican in charge of electing Republicans to Congress said before the election, ""special elections aren't too predictive for either side going forward."" That was true before Election Day, and it's true today. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

"(Oprah.com) -- The Quilter: Kyra Hicks . Twenty years ago, a friend and I were visiting the Taft Museum of Art in Cincinnati and saw an exhibit of African-American quilts. I'll never forget one particular piece by the artist Faith Ringgold -- a family sitting at a Thanksgiving table, with their thoughts sewn into the fabric. I just knew right away: I wanted to tell stories with cotton. It's exciting to start on a quilt. I tape paper to my wall and sketch patterns and notes. Going to the fabric store for the right colors or prints feels as important as the actual sewing. And then I clear out a huge empty space in my family room, and I get busy. I don't know how to draw, so it amazes me that this magical, creative part of me comes out. Here's an example: A few years ago, when I was yearning for a date on a Friday night, I asked myself, ""How can I capture this feeling in fabric?"" So I made a quilt that reads ""SBF praying for a SBM to share my quilt."" The image is of a black woman, and if you look really closely, the background pattern is filled with couples. I love layering the story like that. I probably couldn't make a living quilting, and I'm glad of that. My 9-to-5 job as a product manager means I don't have to make quilts to sell. There's a freedom to being pure to the art, to not being motivated to pay the mortgage with it. My quilts are motivated only by my need to tell my story. Oprah.com: The 4-Step Plan to Get Your Life on Track . The Coach: Jennifer Smith . As a kid, I was a horse nut, a real barn rat. I would spend every Saturday at the stables, grooming horses, mucking stalls -- anything for extra rides. But when I went to college, my obsession fizzled out. I got a job in book publishing and started spending my days in front of a computer, stuck in my head. I like what I do, but as time passed, I just began to crave something wildly different. Then, three years ago, I came across a video about horses helping children with disabilities. I felt like it was speaking directly to me. On my first day as a volunteer, I was paired with a 9-year-old girl who had severe developmental and physical disabilities. My job was to walk alongside her for support. When she got in the saddle of a big brown swayback, her face lit up. She couldn't stop laughing! I saw other kids in wheelchairs -- kids who spend all day looking up at people -- sitting in the saddle and grinning like they were on top of the world. It felt magical. There's no office equivalent, no matter how much you enjoy your day job. I've since become a certified riding instructor. For six months a year, I'm at the stable on Saturdays from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. It's something I don't technically have time for -- I've missed weekends away with friends, and I schedule ""summer"" vacations for March because the program starts in April -- but you make time for things that matter. Oprah.com: 26 Ways to Tell Your Story and Share It with the World . The Cheese-Maker: Elena Santogade . My family is from Wisconsin, so I've always liked cheese, but my interest didn't get intense until a few years ago. I felt antsy at my desk job, so I started a club: Each week a coworker would bring in a few cheeses to share. For my turn, I visited a cheesemonger in a specialty shop. We shared a piece of Appenzeller -- sort of like a GruyÃ¨re -- and I could taste hay and onion. He said, ""Oh, the cow must've gotten into an onion patch."" I was standing in this busy, fancy shop in New York City and tasting a connection to a cow in Switzerland -- it blew my mind. Oprah.com: 6 Words That Can Change How You Look at Your Life . I started talking to other cheesemongers. They can be a grumpy group, but I'd visit again and again and ask for offbeat offerings. The more I learned, the more I wanted to try crafting simple ingredients into amazing flavors. Making cheese turned out to feel like a big brain stretch. You focus on basic things, like watching milk change, and your mind gets quiet. My apartment is tiny, but it has become something of a workshop. A kitchen hook drains soft cheeses into the sink. Two small fridges age my wheels of Cheddar and Manchego. I make cheese every week, and I've been teaching mozzarella classes as well, so huge pots and bowls are perched on shelves. Anyone who walks in can tell who I am: I'm a cheesemaker. Oprah.com: 4 Ways to Be Happier on the Job . The Pianist: Ria Dawn Carlo . The first time I saw a piano, I was in first grade. My teacher played ""When the Saints Go Marching In,"" and that was it: I wanted to play. When the others ran to recess, I would practice scales. My parents didn't go to church, but I went with my art teacher, to play piano there. I begged for lessons and finally began at age 9. At 11, I told my teachers that I wanted to be a concert pianist. They said the odds were slim, and that I'd have to win the Tchaikovsky Competition -- a one-in-a-million shot. That was pretty discouraging, and as time passed, I grew away from music and instead pursued mathematics. For years I worked as an astrophysicist and had time for little else. But three years ago, when I switched jobs, I found myself thinking of the piano. At age 34, I decided to begin again. As soon as I sat at the keys, I felt as if I'd entered a room made just for me. In the beginning, I used an electric keyboard and pretended I was on a grand piano. Buying a used Yamaha last year was a real commitment. It makes such a booming sound, my husband and I moved to a bigger apartment so I can play for an hour or two every day. Since I started practicing on my concert grand, I've won an international competition and performed at a fund-raiser at Carnegie Hall. Onstage, I could feel myself filling with light.

"Toronto (CNN) -- The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has propelled Mitchell Casado into the realm of aviation analyst celebrity -- and no one is more uncomfortable with that than Casado. I found him incredibly shy and modest, even by Canadian standards. Casado never wanted to be on camera. In fact, he was horrified when we at CNN suggested it. At 6-foot-2 and ""gargantuan,"" as he puts it, he hates to see himself on camera. Yet in the cockpit he transforms, and it's clear he has a gift that exceeds controlling a jumbo jet. His eyes light up, and his soft-spoken voice rises in level and confidence. You not only know he can fly, but he makes you want to fly, too. On TV, he's a natural and can take the most complex pieces of aircraft equipment or flight scenario and explain it in a way that's clear and simple. He shuns jargon and acronyms and, unlike other aviation experts, uses words we already know. He's a pilot for the people. But in a profession known for precision, he suffers for his everyman speak and appearance. His hipster facial hair and casual cockpit attire have earned him critiques from anonymous ""pilots"" sniping from online. The negative comments can cut him to the bone. The reality is he dresses not for corporate aviation but comfort, and his journey to becoming a pilot and aviation analyst is far from typical. Casado, 33, grew up in a tough, blue-collar suburb of Toronto. His father came from Central America, his mother from Europe. At age 7, a gift of a toy plane set him on the route where we find him today. Fascination about flying turned into obsession -- his word -- for all things aviation. At school he'd get in trouble for reading flying magazines tucked inside his textbooks. He wasn't good at math, but his sights set firmly on the goal of flying one day, he studied hard to master calculus and geometry. Because of a birth defect, he suffered almost constant, even violent bullying, and long before he started navigating jets through the air, he was plotting alternate courses home from school to avoid heckling classmates. After high school, he joined the Army to serve his country, and only after that did he turn his focus to flying. His parents helped him get his private pilot's license, but a commercial license proved much more expensive because it required flight school and significant flying time. He took any job he could to earn money, working in kitchens and fast food restaurants. His apartment, for a time, went without furniture. When he eventually had $14,000, he headed to a flight school in western Canada, thrilled to finally be on his way. But the dream turned to disaster when the flight school went bust, taking his money with it. Ocean Shield: A mission of hope and uncertainty in search for Flight 370 . That's when the darkest days of his life began. Homeless, he slept on park benches and in stairways until finally ending up at the place he knew best, the airport. By day, he'd sit in the terminals and at night, he'd sleep in the bathrooms. In the oversized handicapped stalls he would use a roll of masking tape to mark out runways and walk around them practicing approaches. He used a toilet seat for chair flying, imagining the controls and switches in his mind. Eventually he made it back home and began working once more to earn money to fly. It would take him years before that final check flight. When the pilot turned and told him he had passed, Mitchell couldn't help it: he cried. His dream had come true. By 2007 he was ranked in the top 10 of Canada's amateur pilots. Today, in addition to his multi-engine license, he has earned his seaplane rating, flown cargo routes and flown as a ""bush pilot"" in Canada and elsewhere. When he's not in the air, he works as a simulator instructor on Boeing 737s and 777s. And, of course, there's his new-found television talent. For his on air role, I have pushed him to do in the simulator what he would never attempt as a professional pilot. Hence, he has probably virtually crashed a 777 more than anyone. That's my fault. On TV we have had him fly a 777 at 5,000 feet in the Himalayas. I nearly lost my dinner on that one with all the banking and yanking. Then there was the time I made him attempt to land the plane on a ridiculously small runway on a remote island. Just to make it harder, I told him to make the weather stormy. He had one shot live on TV with countless people watching. To his credit, he landed with room to spare but was so exhausted from the attempt he couldn't answer our anchor's questions afterward. A few days later he got a message from someone at the Federal Aviation Administration congratulating him on the landing. The other day we made him simulate a scenario where the fuel runs out on a 777. It was awful. It was real. We both sat in silence for a minute when it was over. He apologized and left the cockpit. I had become caught up in the ""gee-whiz-what-if"" angle of the simulator. Casado had not. We may have flown in the virtual world, but as a pilot, Casado knew the heartbreaking loss for 239 passengers' families is real. Casado also has a life outside the cockpit. He's married to his childhood sweetheart, Deborah, whom he married three years ago. When the hours go long -- and they do -- he worries about Buddy and Snowflake, his two Netherlands dwarf rabbits waiting at home. Buddy's a rescue. He speaks to young people, often cautioning those who might be considering flying as a career that the airline industry isn't what it once was. The high-octane, high-paying days of commercial aviation are now a business. There's more he wants to do in life, but for now Casado spends most days flying and instructing in the 777 simulator where I met him. What's unique about the place is it's open to the public, so if you've ever fantasized about taking off from Los Angeles International or landing at Toronto Pearson, or even just doing touch-and-gos at Paris' Charles de Gaulle, Casado is the guy you want in the left seat. He knows a thing or two about dreams, what it takes to make them come true and how sometimes there can be a turbulence along the way.

"Petra, Jordan (CNN) -- In front of a cave deep in the monochromatic sandstone canyons of Petra, in southern Jordan, sits a bright pink 1982 Jeep Wrangler. The vehicle's owner, Ghassab Al-Bedoul, calls it the couch surfing flag. Al-Bedoul, 42, sports long black dreadlocks to his shoulders rather than the traditional Jordanian headdress. He was dressed, during this cave surfer's visit, in a pair of patched-up denim jeans. He's registered as a host in Petra on the popular CouchSurfing.com travel website. The site, which was founded in 2003, hosts a community of travelers who create profiles to share their extra couches or rooms with visitors. ""Couch surfers"" can then send a request to sleep on a couch rather than in a traditional hotel when they travel. Al-Bedoul, a Bedouin who was born in the same cave he lives in today, was taken with the idea. After spending many years traveling back and forth from Europe where he met travelers using the nontraditional lodging option, he thought, ""Why not in Jordan?"" About four years ago when he returned to Petra, he logged onto the site and posted, ""I welcome you in my cave anytime"" on his profile posted under the name Ghassab Al-Bedouine. The same week he registered his cave on the website, he received five requests from potential travelers. The following week there were six more, and within the next few months, he was hosting more than 15 people, sometimes 20, a month at his cave in the mountains of Petra. ""Since I started, I think I've had over 1,200 people come stay at my cave,"" said Al-Bedoul. ""Not all from CouchSurfing, but they hear about me. It's a pleasure to have people from all over the world to learn our culture. Just come and stay with us."" The Bedouin people, who were predominately desert dwellers, have inhabited the caves around Petra for hundreds of years. The ancient city, carved into the side of a mountain, dates back to nearly the 6th century BC and was active through the time of the Roman Empire. Tourists from across the globe descend on the ruins every day. Just a 10-minute drive from the ruins is where Al-Bedoul's family decided to make their home hundreds of years ago. Now the cave and the property belong to Al-Bedoul. The cave, which is no larger than 150 square feet, is uniquely modern. A row of solar-powered lights, a gift from a couch surfer, encircles the front of the cave entrance. When the sun sets past the Petra mountains, they are the only visible lights. The outside of the cave is hard stone, but Al-Bedoul has done some decorating on the inside. The roof is painted black with stars circling the room. Candlelight glows just bright enough to see some of the traditional Jordanian paintings he's placed inside; not included in that collection is the large Bob Marley poster near the cave's entrance. During a recent visit in April, a litter of newborn kittens had the run of the place. A guard dog, Monica, also lives at the cave. She's friendly, and well-trained, but when she sleeps outside, she tends to get into barking matches with her own echo in the mountains.  It's all part of the experience. So are the bathrooms. When asking Al-Bedoul for the washrooms, he points to the mountains, and says, ""far away please."" Then when it's time to sleep, Al-Bedoul lines the inside of his cave with thin mats. Everyone sleeps in the cave, which could easily fit around 10 people. ""I really didn't have a lot expectations besides being in a cave,"" said guest Sam Acker, 24, from Omaha, Nebraska, ""but it's really been the five-star experience, much more than I would have expected."" On a recent night in April, Al-Bedoul hosted Acker and his girlfriend, Maggie Sheehy, along with an English teacher from Australia and a backpacker from England. The backpacker, Phil Marsh, had to overcome his suspicions about why hosts would be so willing to let strangers stay in their house, or in this case, cave. ""I think there are some things being a bit Western that people worry about. Like you letting someone into your house, and why is it all free, but I think 99% of the time everything is fine, and you've just got to trust people,"" Marsh said. Al-Bedoul hosts his guests for free. It's part of the CouchSurfing policy, but he's done pretty well with gifts. Couch surfers often bring items from their home country to share with him. It's also polite to chip in for food, gas and drinks. For Al-Bedoul, hosting foreigners at his cave is now his favorite activity. He often brings them out into the mountains to a hiking route through the ancient city. On this trip, he acted as a personal tour guide, picking the group up in his bright pink jeep, a vehicle all the children wave at as it drives by. When he speaks about his city, his culture and his cave, you can see the pride in his eyes and hear it in his voice. ""I was born here. I stay here, and I live here,"" he said. ""My grandfather is here, my mother and father. So I travel and stay somewhere else, but one day, I must always come back to my roots."" And his sharing of his Bedouin family roots and culture in the form of hospitality to strangers makes visitors want to stay. ""Their flights always come, and they must always leave, but in their minds, they always want to stay longer.""","Ghassab Al-Bedoul welcomes overnight guests to his cave in Petra .

"Srinagar, India (CNN) -- Indian security forces Friday enforced a strict curfew in Srinagar and other major towns of Indian-administered Kashmir to stymie protests sparked Thursday when four civilians were shot and killed by the paramilitary border security force. Kashmiri separatists had called for a strike and Friday post-prayer protests in reaction to the deaths in the mountainous village of Gool in the Ramban district, 190 kilometers north of the city of Jammu. Early Friday, thousands of police and paramilitary troops fanned out in Srinagar and other towns to enforce the restrictions on movement of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The security forces had erected barricades at road intersections. Coils of razor-fitted wire also were used to enforce the curfew. Nonetheless, people staged protests at several places, sometimes clashing with the security forces. Two people were wounded in the clashes and were evacuated to hospital, according to police. The shooting erupted after scores of protestors attacked a security force camp Thursday morning, said the minister of state for home, Sajjad Kichloo. In addition to the four killed, 40 people were reported wounded. The villagers were protesting the alleged beating of the imam of a local mosque by the security force, officials said. India's home minister, Sushil Kumar Shinde ordered an investigation into the incident after the state chief minister, Omar Abdullah, spoke to him. ""It is highly unacceptable to shoot at unarmed protesters just because they were reportedly protesting manhandling of an imam of their area,"" Abdullah said in a prepared statement. ""There is no justification or rationalization of this deplorable act. This shocking act warrants and demands the severest of condemnation in the strongest possible terms."" On Friday, Abdullah, chaired a Cabinet meeting that sanctioned an extraordinary ex-gratia relief payment of ""rupees five lakh,"" or more than U.S. $8,000, to the next of kin of each of those killed. The Cabinet, apart from ""extending condolences to the bereaved families and sympathies with those injured in the firing incident, condemned the excessive use of force."" Traffic on the lone highway connecting the landlocked Kashmir valley to rest of the country remained suspended Friday, according to traffic police. In a separate incident, a leading cardiologist, Sheikh Jalal, was wounded in a militant ambush that left his two police guards dead Thursday in the south Kashmir town of Pampore, a police spokesman said. Jalal was shot and is being treated at a hospital. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. Militant attacks in Indian Kashmir have seen a sudden surge recently in the capital city, Srinagar, and other towns.","Kashmir separatists had called for a strike and protests Friday .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius killed Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year. Of that, there is no doubt. But was it murder? One of South Africa's toughest prosecutors, Gerrie Nel, fought for most of the month of March to prove it was. Starting Monday, one of the country's shrewdest defense lawyers, Barry Roux, will try to convince a judge that it wasn't. The verdict will hinge on two questions: . Did the Olympic sprinter know his girlfriend was behind the door in the bathroom of his house when he fired four hollow-point bullets through it in the middle of the night? And if he did not -- if he thought she was a burglar, as he insists -- did he act as a reasonable person would have? Critical testimony will come from the only living person who was in the house at the time, the ""Blade Runner"" himself. Pistorius is likely to take the stand for the first time Tuesday or Wednesday to tell the story he has been telling for more than a year now. He woke up in the middle of the night, went to his balcony to bring in a fan -- or two fans, in his most recent version -- heard his bathroom window opening, took his gun, went to the bathroom and fired through the door when he heard a noise in the toilet. ""It was pitch dark in the bedroom, and I thought Reeva was in bed,"" he testified when he applied for bail in the days after the killing. In that version of the story, Pistorius emphasized that he ""felt a sense of terror"" when he heard the noise, that he ""felt extremely vulnerable"" because he was not wearing his prosthetic legs, and that he ""has been a victim of violence and of burglaries before."" And, he said, ""We were deeply in love and I could not be happier."" If Judge Thokozile Matilda Masipa believes that story, Pistorius could be acquitted of murder. She could find him guilty of the lesser charge of culpable homicide -- similar to what would be called manslaughter in the United States -- or find him not guilty at all. Follow the live blog . The defense is likely to rely on three types of experts to support Pistorius' story: . Ballistics . Pistorius fired four shots. Three hit Steenkamp: one in the hip, one in the arm and one in the head. The shot to the head probably killed her almost instantly. But when did that shot hit her? The prosecution says it hit her last. That means she would have been able to scream between shots -- potentially giving Pistorius a moment to realize his mistake and stop shooting. Roux rejected the prosecution's order of shots in a heated exchange with police Capt. Christian Mangena, the prosecution ballistics expert. Roux said the defense ballistics expert would show that the order of shots was different, and that Pistorius fired the four shots in two quick bursts -- two ""double taps."" Mangena said it was ""impossible"" for the pattern of wounds on the body to be the result of two double taps, ultimately leaving Roux sighing dismissively and promising that his ballistics expert would explain. Pathology . Pistorius threw up repeatedly as Gert Saayman, who performed the autopsy on Steenkamp, described the devastating wounds Pistorius inflicted on her. But as gruesome as the testimony was, it is not critical to the state's case -- there's no doubt, after all, who killed Steenkamp or how. The most damning thing Saayman said was far less dramatic. Based on the contents of her stomach, the pathologist suggested that Steenkamp had probably eaten around 1 a.m., about two hours before she died. That's a direct contradiction of Pistorius' story that they were in the bedroom by about 10 p.m., her doing yoga and him watching television, and that they went to sleep after she finished her yoga. Roux hammered Saayman on the question of when Steenkamp last ate, going so far as to bring in academic articles for the pathologist to read, a clear sign that the defense considers it crucial to rebut that point. Saayman did not budge. A pathologist who attended the autopsy on behalf of Pistorius, Reggie Perumal, is due to testify for the defense . A police cell phone expert also may have found a similar inconsistency with Pistorius' timeline. Capt. Francois Moller, who downloaded the contents of Pistorius' iPhone, said it made an Internet connection for about five minutes an hour and 20 minutes before the shooting. The defense may put forward an expert of their own to explain. Psychiatry . Pistorius needs the judge to believe not only that there is a chance he made a genuine mistake in thinking Steenkamp was a burglar, but that his response was reasonable. Sean Rens, a gun dealer who was selling a small arsenal to Pistorius at the time of the killing, testified that the athlete had passed a test showing he knew what the law said about firing in self-defense. On the face of it, what Pistorius did in firing through a closed door, when he could not see an imminent threat, was neither legal nor safe, the Rens testimony suggested. But a psychiatrist may argue that Pistorius should be judged by a different standard of reasonableness because he is a double amputee who was not wearing his prosthetics at the time. His statement at his bail hearing implied that he should: ""As I did not have my prosthetic legs on and felt extremely vulnerable, I knew I had to protect Reeva and myself. ... I felt trapped as my bedroom door was locked and I have limited mobility on my stumps."" If the judge accepts that as true, Pistorius' disability could prove to be his greatest defense.","The defense will try to convince a judge that Reeva Steenkamp's death wasn't murder .
Did Oscar Pistorius know his girlfriend was behind a door when he shot and killed her?
And if he did not, did he act as a reasonable person would have?
Experts in ballistics, pathology and psychiatry expected to try to support Pistorius' story ."
"(Travel Leisure) -- When he's not doing 200 mph around the racetrack, NASCAR champion driver Kurt Busch is feeding a need besides speed: his love of sports. ""After the NASCAR schedule comes out, I strategically make plans to get to a unique sporting event at least once a month,"" says the passionate fan, making a point of visiting baseball parks and other sports attractions like museums and stadiums along the racing circuit. And he's hardly alone. Sports-related tourism is big bucks in America. Super Bowl XLVIII was widely touted (if disputed) as having a $600 million economic impact in the New York City region. Chump change next to the billions surrounding the XXII Olympic Winter Games in Sochi, Russia. But avowed sports nuts don't need big-ticket events to bring out their passion.

Time out: Dinner is a scene -- with all the black-and-white photos to prove it -- at St. Elmo Steak House, where hundreds of athletes and celebrities have dined since its 1902 opening. Cleveland and Canton: Rock the pigskin . In northeast Ohio, rock star quarterbacks and actual rock stars get equal air time. Canton's Pro Football Hall of Fame pays homage to the gridiron's greats and is fresh off a 2013 renovation/expansion that now includes interactive exhibits, like an Instant Replay challenge where visitors can play referee and decide whether to overturn or confirm rulings on the field.

Just three hours north, channel our modern Olympic legends during a Lake Placid Adventure: bobsledding, skeleton runs, skiing and ice skating at the Olympic Sports Complex, the very rink where the U.S. defeated the Soviet Union in what became known as the ""Miracle on Ice."" Time out: Craft beer is fast becoming another great American pastime, with Cooperstown's Ommegang at the forefront (brewery tours and tastings available). Iowa to Illinois: Baseball road trip .

San Diego: Skate and surf . Sunny San Diego is a mecca for action sports nuts: surfing, BMX biking, hang gliding, mountain biking, and of course, skateboarding (it's home to grinding legend Tony Hawk). Practice your tricks at one of the area's few dozen skateparks and surfing beaches, and celebrate the Golden State's iconic surfing culture at the California Surf Museum a bit north in Oceanside.

Time out: Whiskey fans will appreciate the area's proximity to the eight distilleries (and tasting rooms) on the Kentucky Bourbon Trail. Philadelphia: Yo, Adrian! Maybe it's ironic that the City of Brotherly Love is famous for a series of films where boxers go after each other with a fury normally reserved for Eagles fans after a loss, but that's part of what makes Philly a great sports town. (In fact, it ranks as the No. 1 most sports-crazed city in America.)

"(CNN) -- Believe it or not, more people in the world have a cellphone than access to a toilet. That's according to Water.org, a charity co-founded by actor Matt Damon. ""I was just shocked by this because I couldn't even relate to it,"" says the Oscar winner. ""As an American -- like, water? There's the kitchen sink, the bathroom sink -- you know -- there's water."" ""Every 20 seconds a little kid, a child dies because they lack access to clean water and sanitation. Every 20 seconds."" Damon, father of four daughters, says, ""Once you have kids it's impossible not to see their face in every child you see."" What was truly horrifying for Damon and Water.org's co-founder, Gary White, was how preventable water-related deaths can be. ""We've solved this in the West for 100 years,"" he says referring to the worldwide water and sanitation crisis. ""You know, imagine if we cure cancer tomorrow and in 100 years, three-and-a-half million people a year are still dying of it. I mean it's just unconscionable."" So, Damon decided to use his fame to help. ""If cameras were going to follow us around, why not make something good out of that?"" In 2006, Damon co-founded H2O Africa Foundation, which served to bring attention to clean water initiatives in Africa. Two years later, he met Gary White of WaterPartners at the Clinton Global Initiative. The two decided to combine efforts by merging charities and co-founded Water.org in 2009. ""We complement each other and Matt certainly has come a long way in water, not much for me in acting,"" White jokes. The nonprofit provides affordable access to safe water and proper lavatory facilities through microfinance loans. The loan program gives people the financial means to access their local municipalities or fund their own projects. Without the loans, they are forced to turn to the water mafia, who, according to Damon, dramatically mark up the cost of water. The other option is to fund their own projects through loan sharks, but that money comes with high interest. In India, White and Damon came face to face with a person who exemplifies how successful Water.org's loan program is. ""We met a woman who was paying 40 rupees every day for her family to go use the public toilet. They had to go pay a fee and they had to go purchase the water that they needed,"" White says. ""She was able to get a WaterCredit loan, that allowed her to pay her connection fee, that allowed her to connect to the utility and have a faucet in her home and allowed her to build a toilet in her home and her loan payment was 40 rupees a month. Once she gets that paid off over two years, that's another 40 rupees in her pocket. She'll pay a small bill for her water bill each month, but she'll come out way ahead."" Damon says he was moved by ""the sense of dignity that these women have when you talk to them and they've paid their loans off and maybe taking out a second loan for a toilet, the sense of empowerment you know, the sense that their life has been altered in this way, that they are now in control of their destiny."" This empowerment translates directly into social and economic growth for the community. According to White, 200 million hours are spent daily by women walking to collect water and 443 million school days are lost every year from children having to scout for water. ""Once you get this foundational piece in -- safe water that's close to the home or a tap at somebody's house -- then the whole family can start to take off and become much more economically self-sufficient. They can grow more food, they can spend time in a working job and kids can be in school. We all know that that's the thing that's really going to liberate people from poverty is an education. Water allows all of that to start happening,"" White says. Damon witnessed that firsthand in Haiti where he met a 13-year-old girl while attending the celebration of a new water pump. The girl had previously spent around three hours a day collecting water. ""I said, 'Three hours a day! What are you going to do now that you have all this time? Your homework?' "" ""And she looked at me and she goes, 'Shh! I don't need more time to do my homework. I'm the smartest in my class.'"" Damon prodded her some more, asking, "" 'But you have these extra three hours. What are you going to do?' And she looked me right in the eyes and she goes 'I'm going to play.' "" ""It was wonderful to know that this little girl was going to have time to play like every 13-year-old girl should have."" ""But you think about the hundreds of millions of kids for whom that's not an option -- and not only do they not have those three hours, they may not even be in school because they're scavenging for water. And so it's not just a life or death issue, it's a quality of life issue.""","780 million people lack access to clean water .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- A fire at a hotel in northern Iraq killed at least 28 and wounded 22 others Thursday night, Iraq's Kurdish Regional Government said Friday. A short circuit has been blamed for starting the fire, which broke out at the Soma hotel in the city of Sulaimaniya about 11 p.m. Thursday. Women, children and foreigners were among those killed. ""Our hearts go out to the families of the victims of this tragic accident, and we wish a speedy recovery to the injured,"" said Kurdish Prime Minister Barham Salih, who visited the scene of the accident and the hospital where the injured were being treated. ""I have ordered an immediate investigation into the accident to establish the causes of the fire and assess the emergency procedures that followed. We will spare no effort in making sure such tragedies do not occur in the future."" Sulaimaniya, in Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, is the capital of a province of the same name, one of the region's three provinces. It's about 280 kilometers (173 miles) north of Baghdad. During the summer, hotels in the city are usually packed with tourists from southern provinces because Sulaimaniya is considered a safer city and the weather is nicer. Tourists were among those killed, officials said. Jabbar Yawer, spokesman of the local security forces, told CNN that three Asians who work for a local cell phone company were among those killed. The company's headquarters is close to the hotel, and many visiting employees stay there. The Kurdish Regional Government said 14 Iraqi nationals and 14 foreign nationals were killed. The foreigners were from Canada, Australia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, Ecuador, Venezuela, Sri Lanka, Lebanon, Bangladesh and Cambodia. One victim remained to be identified, the government said. Earlier, other Kurdish officials said an American and a Filipino were among the dead. Heath officials in Sulaimaniya said that most of those who died were suffocated by smoke because there were no side stairs for an emergency escape in the hotel and the windows are thick and hard to smash. But officials said three young men were able to jump from the hotel's fifth floor in an attempt to save their lives. Two of them died and the third was critically injured, officials said. Kurdish Regional Government President Massoud Barzani asked authorities to investigate the causes of the fire and take steps to prevent another such tragedy. The Kurdish governmen said Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Al-Maliki issued his condolences and offered to help deal with the tragedy. Salih also ordered an immediate review of fire safety measures at all public buildings in the city and the Kurdish region. The Kurdish Regional Government is working closely with the embassies and consulates to inform the next of kin and to work out repatriation issues.","NEW: Kurdish Regional Government says 28 people were killed .

"(EW.com) -- Critics everywhere have hailed ""Bully"" as an important, engaging documentary. EW's Owen Gleiberman calls it ""sensitive and eye-opening""; the film has also earned a near-perfect 93 percent ""Fresh"" rating from the reviews aggregated by Rotten Tomatoes. But in an article posted late last week, Slate's Emily Bazelon alleged that some crucial parts of ""Bully"" are ""utterly one-sided"" and ""factually questionable."" Her piece focused on Tyler Long, one of the doc's featured subjects; when he was just 17, Long took his own life, apparently because he was bullied by his classmates. But according to Bazelon, that isn't the whole story. She wrote that Tyler also suffered from ADHD, bipolar disorder, and Asperger's syndrome; additionally, his girlfriend broke up with him a few weeks before his suicide. It seems likely that these factors contributed to Tyler's decision to commit suicide, Bazelon wrote. She asserted that by not mentioning them -- and by possibly exaggerating the treatment Tyler received in school â€” director Lee Hirsch and producer Cynthia Lowen oversimplified and distorted the facts to create a smoother narrative. Lowen responded to the allegations with an exclusive statement to EW: . ""Due to its glaring inaccuracies, misinformation and lack of journalistic integrity -- the filmmakers of 'Bully' would like to respond to Emily Bazelon's 'The Problem with Bully.' We are deeply disappointed by the author's neglect to gain a clear picture of Tyler's bullying in the Murray County School District, which is currently under investigation by the United States Department of Justice regarding allegations of ongoing bullying and harassment. Bazelon suggests that Tyler was NOT bullied in the days, weeks and months before his death. This is factually incorrect. There are literally hundreds of bullying events and incidents that have been testified to under oath by his fellow students. Multiple students testified he was bullied on a ""daily basis,"" and the pleadings reflect constant bullying his junior year, including the very day he killed himself. Bazelon erroneously cites Tyler's prior health history and its significance to the case: he was never diagnosed with Bipolar disorder, and Asperger Syndrome is not a recognized risk factor for suicide. That Tyler was on the autism spectrum is never something the filmmakers have hidden, it is something we have discussed in many interviews and post-viewing Q&A's. The fact that Tyler was on the spectrum does not reduce the school system's responsibility to provide a safe learning environment. As filmmakers we felt that was the bottom line. For this very reason, we chose not to introduce his autism in the film. The filmmakers are dismayed by Bazelon's failure to reach out to either the Long family or their legal counsel, so that they may have had the opportunity to address the Murray County School District's assertions."" When presented with Lowen's statement, Slate deputy editor Julia Turner responded with one of her own: . ""Emily Bazelon's central concern about 'Bully,' expressed in her review for Slate, is that the movie presents a one-sided and incomplete version of the events leading up to the suicide of Tyler Long. The movie includes no mention of the mental health issues Tyler faced, and it fails to note that the school district disputes the Long family's account of the causal role bullying played his death. The school district's legal papers tell us that Tyler was diagnosed with ADHD, bipolar disorder, and Asperger's when he was in sixth grade, and while the family's response brief objects to the bipolar diagnosis as ""immaterial,"" it does not factually challenge it. Perhaps more important for this conversation, no one disputes that Tyler was on the autism spectrum, and considerable research links Asperger's and autism to an elevated risk of suicide. (More helpful information on that here.) Emily has covered bullying for Slate for a few years now. Her reporting has taught her how complicated the issues around it can be, especially in the tragic cases when a student takes his or her own life. And her interviews with suicide prevention experts have taught her how important it is to avoid oversimplifying the facts, which can make suicide look romantic or appealing, especially to teen viewers. Emily's review was not intended to endorse the school district's view; merely to point out that an alternative viewpoint exists, and that the movie had a responsibility to address it."" Bully is currently showing in five theaters in New York and Los Angeles; TWC plans to expand that number to up to 150 theaters in the next few weeks. See the full article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Filipino government officials and Muslim rebel leaders signed a landmark peace deal Monday aimed at ending a long-running insurgency in the nation's troubled south. The provisional accord paves the way for a new autonomous region to be administered by Muslims in Mindanao, according to President Benigno Aquino III, who met with the rebels at the presidential palace in Manila. ""Today, we sign a framework agreement that can finally seal a genuine, lasting peace in Mindanao,"" Aquino said in a speech. The deal sets up mechanisms to tackle issues such as power structure and revenues in the southern region, which will be named Bangsamoro. The new region is expected to replace the current one by 2016, when the president's term ends, according to officials. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front has fought for decades to set up an independent Islamic state in southern Philippines, having been blamed for a host of attacks and skirmishes that have left tens of thousands dead. Yet even as this violence unfolded, rebels have been negotiating for 15 years with officials from the Manila-based government. Aquino has said the agreement ""brings all former secessionist groups into the fold,"" and that the Moro Islamic Liberation Front is no longer seeking to form a new nation. The rebel group's chairman, Al Haj Murad Ebrahim, was present at the agreement's signing. Murad's group is estimated to have 12,000 members, but military sources say it may have splintered when government troops conducted offensives in 2000. The new name of Bangsamoro ""symbolizes and honors the struggles of our forebears in Mindanao, and celebrates the history and character of that part of our nation,"" according to Aquino.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- ""Please set him free"" read the plea in stark black print on the front page of the New Express newspaper based in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou. In a bold move, the paper openly defied Chinese authorities this week by asking for the release of one its reporters, who has been detained by police in Hunan province. The move garnered sympathy online and China's media regulator vowed to protect ""lawful reporting rights,"" according to the state-run China Press and Publishing Media group. Chen Yongzhou was arrested on Saturday, police in the provincial capital Changsha said, months after the newspaper ran stories by Chen that claimed that a Hunan-based company Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science & Technology falsified sales numbers. The state-run company, which did not respond to a call for comment, makes construction equipment. The police said he had been arrested for damaging a business' commercial reputation, without giving further details. A police spokesman in Changsha contacted by CNN declined to comment. In May, Zoomlion temporarily suspended trading in its Hong Kong-listed shares to address allegations made in one of Chen's articles. In a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange, it said that all allegations relating to fictitious sales were ""false, groundless and misleading."" The paper said on Wednesday that it had verified all of Chen's stories about Zoomlion and only found one discrepancy: He wrote the company spent 513 million yuan on advertisements, when that money had been spent on ""advertisements and entertainment."" ""If Brother Policeman can find any evidence of shabby reporting on our part, please make notice of it and we will gladly doff our hat,"" the newspaper said according to a translation published by the University of Hong Kong's China Media Project. ""Because we still believe that â€” some day, at least â€” you will have the same full respect for the law that we have."" Open resistance by Chinese media against intimidation by authorities is rare but not unprecedented. In January this year, crowds gathered in Guangzhou in support of a protest by journalists against alleged government censorship. Journalists at the Southern Weekly paper claimed that an editorial calling for political reform was rewritten by censors as a tribute to Chinese Communist Party rule. The New Express released a statement from Chen's wife, who said that Chen was taken from his home in a black Mercedes Benz with Hunan license plates. ""My... life stopped at the moment,"" she said. On social media site Weibo, Chen's colleagues described him as a talented and hardworking business reporter, who ate instant noodles and couldn't afford to take his wife to Pizza Hut. ""We are very grateful that the society has given a lot of attention on this,"" a spokesperson for the New Express newsroom told CNN.

"(CNN) -- You may not even know such a kingdom exists, but it already has a king. Anthony ""Romeo"" Santos, known to his fans simply as Romeo, is the self-proclaimed king of bachata, and though he remains relatively unknown to the English-speaking world, he is poised to take the music world by storm with his unique bachata fusion. Bachata, which originated in the Dominican Republic, is music that predominantly speaks of heartbreak and sadness. The sound is a danceable track heavy on guitar and percussion. With his sultry voice, soulful lyrics and way of mixing the traditional island rhythm with more current hip-hop and R&B beats, Santos is considered a pioneer of the genre, nearly single-handedly making it a mainstream success. Santos began his career as lead singer of the group Aventura in the mid-1990s but has since ventured on his own. He just released ""Formula Volume 2,"" the sequel to his hugely successful first solo album, 2011's ""Formula Volume 1."" While ""Volume 1"" included vocals from the likes of Usher and Lil Wayne, ""Volume 2"" expands on these collaborations. ""When I was doing 'Formula Volume 1,' I had so many ideas that I knew one album was not going to be enough. In this album, I'm offering a fusion of bachata with different genres: Jamaican reggae, Bob Marley type of reggae and dance hall,"" Santos said. The new album features duos with Marc Anthony, Carlos Santana, as well as Drake and Nicki Minaj, both of whom offer vocals in Spanish. ""It's actually great for both of us, for the artist and for myself, because they're also trying to do something unique and different, and these types of collaborations allow that,"" Santos said. The album has already released various singles that have quickly climbed to the top of the charts. ""Odio,"" the track that features Drake, has become Santos' eighth No. 1 hit on Billboard's U.S. Hot Latin Songs chart. The track also debuted at No. 45 on the Hot 100, the highest-charting debut for a Spanish language song in the chart's 55-year history. Santos also recently announced that he will become the first Latin solo artist to headline a concert at New York's Yankee Stadium, and the first Latin act to perform at the iconic stadium since the Fania All Stars in 1973. ""I understand the big responsibility, and I'm honored,"" Santos said at a news conference at the stadium to announce the performance. ""I grew up in this neighborhood, near Yankee Stadium, and I would walk around with my cousin and we were just trying to buy tickets to see a baseball game. I never even imagined that I would be performing, and to just make it to this point in my career as a solo artist is just extremely wonderful, and I'm just like, wow, this is crazy."" It is a big-scale concert planned to meet the ever-growing demand for tickets to his shows. That's definitely a long way to come for the Bronx-born Dominican/Puerto Rican singer who says he found most of his musical influences on the streets of his old neighborhood. ""I grew up listening to bachata, to some of the greats of the genre. But it was very natural for me to create this type of fusion and to incorporate new beats,"" he said. ""I was born and raised in the Bronx, and growing up here, you would go down the block, and on one corner you would hear bachata, on another corner some salsa, and of course there was hip-hop and R&B all over the place. So for me, it is very organic to have these combinations."" Crossover, however, is not a term Santos is comfortable with. While both solo albums include English language tracks, he says bachata and Spanish are his strong suits, and rather than making an all-English album, Santos said he encourages the English-speaking audience to cross over, too -- into his world. ""I'm a bachatero for the most part; that's what I want to do. I offer one or two English language tracks on this album, but 'el fuerte' is always bachata,"" he said. ""When I reached out to these artists and said, 'Look would you consider singing with me, you don't have to sing in Spanish, but you know it's a Spanish record,' they accepted right away. And I have to say, it was actually Drake's idea to sing in Spanish. Nicki's, too."" Santos also happens to be a major heartthrob. He has amassed a huge fan base, mostly of women who swoon over his suave, romantic vocals, which, in traditional bachata style, speak of love lost and gained. But, he said, it wasn't always that way. ""Growing up, I wasn't the best-looking kid, and you know, I personally don't feel like a sex symbol. I think the girls like me because I'm very passionate, and I'm very romantic with my lyrics,"" he said, laughing, ""I'm not saying I'm the ugliest guy in the planet, but I am definitely no model."" Whatever the formula, it has been successful, something Santos credits to his upbringing. ""Having great parents has a lot to do with the success. Dedication, too. Anyone can achieve anything they want if they are just disciplined, if they have ethics, and then just try to reinvent yourself. Originality plays a big factor in anyone's career."" Are music fans ready for Romeo Santos' original view of the world? The odds look good.","Bachata music originated in the Dominican Republic and mostly speaks of heartbreak, sadness .

In a speech to a media luncheon, Obama described the measure -- prepared by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, and passed by the House -- as a ""Trojan Horse"" that is disguised as a deficit reduction plan but actually imposes a ""radical vision."" ""It is thinly-veiled Social Darwinism,"" Obama said. ""It is antithetical to our entire history as a land of opportunity and upward mobility for everyone who's willing to work for it -- a place where prosperity doesn't trickle down from the top, but grows outward from the heart of the middle class."" He added that ""by gutting the very things we need to grow an economy that's built to last -- education and training; research and development; infrastructure -- it's a prescription for decline."" The remarks signaled Obama's full engagement in his re-election campaign for the November vote as Romney has seized an apparently solid grip on the Republican nomination. For the first time this year, Obama mentioned the former Massachusetts governor by name in a speech, noting Romney's support for the Ryan budget plan. ""One of my potential opponents, Gov. Romney, has said that he hoped a similar version of this plan from last year would be introduced on day one of his presidency,"" Obama said. ""He said that he's very supportive of this new budget and he even called it marvelous, which is a word you don't often hear when it comes to describing a budget."" Ryan and other Republican leaders immediately criticized the Obama speech as a politically motivated appeal to populism, rather than a serious approach to budget deficits. ""History will not be kind to a president who, when it came time to confront our generation's defining challenge, chose to duck and run,"" Ryan said in a statement. ""The president refuses to take responsibility for the economy and refuses to offer a credible plan to address the most predictable economic crisis in our history. Instead, he has chosen tired and cynical political attacks as he focuses on his own re-election."" According to Ryan, Obama used his speech to ""distort the truth and divide Americans in order to distract from his failed record."" Obama, however, blamed a polarized political climate for an inability to make progress on such key issues as deficit reduction and entitlement reform, arguing that Republicans have shifted to the right and dropped support for moderate proposals acceptable to Democrats. ""The problem right now is not the technical means to solve it. The problem is our politics, and that's part of what this election and what this debate will need to be about,"" Obama said in response to a question at the end. ""Are we, as a country, willing to get back to commonsense, balanced, fair solutions that encourage our long-term economic growth and stabilize our budget?"" Obama has increasingly portrayed the upcoming election as a choice between maintaining his policies and vision for continued economic recovery and investment in future growth versus what he calls failed Republican policies of the past based on deep spending cuts and lower taxes intended to benefit the corporate class. ""In this country, broad-based prosperity has never trickled down from the success of a wealthy few,"" Obama said Tuesday. ""It has always come from the success of a strong and growing middle class."" In particular, he focused on the Ryan budget proposal for 2013 recently passed by the Republican-led House. The $3.5 trillion plan would lower tax rates and cut spending while reforming the Medicare and Medicaid government-run health care programs for senior citizens, the disabled and the poor. Ryan and other conservatives argue that major reforms are needed to subdue increasing federal deficits and debt, with particular focus on entitlement programs that are the main contributors to the budget imbalance. For example, the Ryan budget would convert federal Medicaid funding for states into block grants. Such a step could increase the cost burden on states, but would give them more autonomy about how to set up their Medicaid programs. As a result, a state could reduce how many people are eligible or increase enrollees' cost-sharing obligations. ""If the president were serious, he would put forward a plan to deal with our debt crisis and save Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for future generations of seniors without raising taxes on small businesses that are struggling in this economy,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement Tuesday. ""Instead, he has chosen to campaign rather than govern, and the debt crisis he is presiding over is only getting worse."" Obama, however, called the Ryan budget an attempt to shift the burden of deficit reduction to the middle class and the needy. He outlined what he said would be cuts in government programs that provide early education, student loans and research grants as examples of the sweep of the GOP proposal. The Ryan plan's proposal to alter Medicare -- the government health care program for senior citizens -- would provide vouchers to help pay for health coverage rather than the universal plan of today, Obama said. People would have to pay any cost increases or expenses beyond the vouchers, which amounts to shifting the cost burden to senior citizens, the president asserted. ""It's a bad idea and eventually will end Medicare as we know it,"" Obama said in targeting one of the most politically sensitive provisions of the Ryan plan. Obama also criticized tax cuts in the Ryan budget that he said would cost $4.6 trillion over the next decade. Such a move would benefit the wealthy while reducing tax breaks relied on by middle class families, such as the mortgage interest deduction, the president said. ""This is supposed to be about paying down our deficit? It's laughable,"" Obama said. He repeated his longstanding support for a balanced approach to deficit reduction that includes increased tax revenue through higher rates on the wealthy. Obama again called for adoption of the so-called Buffett rule, a proposal that would have all Americans making more than $1 million pay at least a 30% tax rate. The Senate is expected to vote on a form of the proposal named for billionaire Warren Buffett, who has complained that the current tax code allows him to pay a lower tax rate than his secretary. The Obama speech to a luncheon by The Associated Press at the American Society of News Editors convention occurred on the same day as primary elections in Wisconsin, Maryland and the District of Columbia. Obama also scheduled high-profile events on previous primary days this year, including a speech at a United Auto Workers conference on the day of the Michigan primary in February, a news conference on Super Tuesday in early March and a visit to an opening NCAA basketball tournament game with visiting British Prime Minister David Cameron on the night that Alabama and Mississippi voted.

"Off Aberdeen, Scotland (CNN) -- Against a bright blue sky, seagulls noisily squabbled above us as we set off aboard a crew boat, feeling rather small as we gently weaved our way past the gigantic vessels docked in Aberdeen harbor. The calm conditions that had allowed us to easily film inside the port quickly changed once we left the harbor, as we came up against 25-knot winds, rolling waves and spray soaking us from all sides. Having grown up on the northeast coast of England, this was the North Sea that I know and love. As we happily bounced around, we joked with the crew from Helix Energy Solutions' marine contracting business unit, Canyon Offshore, that we were -- despite having three cameras, a tripod, and two backpacks -- actually traveling light. About 2 miles (3 kilometers) out to sea, between the waves, we got fleeting glimpses of the MV Olympic Triton, the support vessel for remotely operated underwater vehicles. We could tell it was large, but as we drew closer to the 315-foot (96-meter) vessel it became clear it was not only large, but a serious piece of maritime engineering. Above its bow was a large helipad, and from the main deck a huge crane extended, with 9,800 feet (3,000 meters) of cable. As we approached the Olympic Triton, conditions were too dangerous for us to board and we had to wait for the massive vessel to turn to give us a bit of shelter. While waiting we filmed our first key sequence: the ROV being lowered into the water. Sequence recorded, next came the challenge of boarding. The tools used in the search . Sheltered from the worst of the weather we were still rising and falling in the water by as much as 10 feet -- which, in Tony's words, was making things a little ""lively."" To board, we had to wait for the bow of our boat to rise up and then throw ourselves at a small wood and rope ladder and hanging grab rope and pull ourselves aboard. Only sitting at the airport at the end of the day did we admit to each other that we could replace the word ""lively"" with ""terrifying."" Safely aboard, we were welcomed by Capt. Morten Stakvik on the bridge. After our safety briefing we did some more filming, followed by a tour of the Olympic Triton. Conditions on board the Norwegian-registered vessel were a credit to the crew. Everything was immaculate and beautifully organized. You can see why that matters when at any one time, there can be 100 people on board, working around the clock for up to four months at a time. Our filming schedule was pretty similar to our other CNN shoots: interviews, key sequences and unique shots that would allow us to paint the story with rich visuals. But filming on board a ship did present a few additional challenges. As the ship rolled in the waves the light kept changing. This meant photojournalist Tony adopted an Iron Man-style pose, waving a light in one hand while operating the camera with the other to counteract the changing light. There were also the stairs to contend with -- five decks of steep stairs. When you're hauling full broadcast equipment, it certainly adds up to a workout. Only moments after joking with one of the ROV engineers that you learn quickly not to forget things, I realized I'd left the spare batteries for the microphone on the bridge five decks up. Lesson learned. Ocean Shield: A mission of hope and uncertainty . Broadcast equipment and water don't usually go well together, and there was a danger that filming our underwater sequence would go wrong. Using the ingenuity of the ROV crew we securely attached our underwater camera to the arms of the ROV. But when the ROV and camera descended into the depths and as I watched the live feed turn from brilliantly clear shots to a murky green and eventually to black, I couldn't help but worry that this was the last time we would see this camera. Twenty-seven agonizing minutes later, the camera was back on deck and perfectly dry inside its case. As we reviewed the footage through a small monitor, our grainy images gave us an impression of just how incredible the ROV was. Its complexity, dexterity and adaptability not only made for great visuals for our viewers, but also began to give us an idea of how it could be used to help with retrieving items from the ocean floor. After filming some beautiful detail shots from around the ship -- sonar monitors, controls, compasses, barometers -- we concluded the shoot from the bridge, now drenched in the early evening sun. Looking back to shore we could see in the distance our crew boat crashing through the waves toward us, bringing an end to our time on this incredible vessel with its incredible crew. This also meant we had to face the rope ladder again. As we were now self-proclaimed experts at disembarking, with life jacket tightly fastened I went first. To ensure that we had something to show for our shoot, Tony kept hold of the camera cards in case I decided to copy the ROV and take a dip in the water. We only spent a short amount of time with the talented crew of the Olympic Triton, but we did get a sense of how good they are at what they do, and how incredibly difficult their work is. 6 missteps in the investigation .","CNN crew boarded a support vessel in the North Sea for demo of remotely operated vehicles .

"Washington (CNN) -- A series of blog posts on Monday purportedly by Edward Snowden said he leaked classified details about U.S. surveillance programs because President Barack Obama worsened ""abusive"" practices instead of curtailing them as he promised as a candidate. In 90 minutes of live online chatting, the person identified as Snowden by Britain's Guardian newspaper and website insisted that U.S. authorities have access to phone calls, e-mails and other communications far beyond constitutional bounds. While he said legal restrictions can be easily skirted by analysts at the National Security Agency, FBI and CIA, Snowden stopped short of accusing authorities of violating specific laws. Instead, he said toothless regulations and policies were to blame for what he called ""suspicionless surveillance,"" and he warned that policies can be changed to allow further abuses. ""This disclosure provides Obama an opportunity to appeal for a return to sanity, constitutional policy, and the rule of law rather than men,"" he posted. ""He still has plenty of time to go down in history as the president who looked into the abyss and stepped back, rather than leaping forward into it."" Obama bristles at suggestion he's shifted on snooping . Asked Monday if the NSA was following the online chat, the agency's press office had no immediate comment. Obama, top legislators and national security officials defend the surveillance programs as necessary to combat terrorism, arguing that some privacy must be sacrificed in a balanced approach. They say the law allows collection of metadata, such as the time and numbers of phone calls, and that a special federal court must approve accessing the content -- listening to the call itself. In the blog posts on Monday, the writer identified as Snowden contended the government's overbroad collection of information violated rights of innocent Americans who have no links to suspicious activity. Referring to a program that permits broader access to foreign communications than is allowed for domestic monitoring, the writer said authorities sidestep regulations. For example, a phone call from overseas can mean automatic inclusion of a U.S. number in the record-keeping, according to the writer. ""The reality is that ... Americans' communications are collected and viewed on a daily basis on the certification of an analyst rather than a warrant,"" one Snowden post said. ""They excuse this as 'incidental' collection, but at the end of the day, someone at NSA still has the content of your communications."" Another post warned that restrictions against unauthorized access to the content of communications -- such as listening to phone calls or reading e-mails -- were based on policy rather than technology and therefore ""can change at any time."" CNN poll: Obama numbers plunge into generation gap . Snowden said he leaked details of the surveillance programs because Obama campaigned for the presidency on a platform of ending abuses. However, Obama ""closed the door on investigating systemic violations of law, deepened and expanded several abusive programs, and refused to spend the political capital to end the kind of human rights violations like we see in Guantanamo, where men still sit without charge,"" a blog post said. Snowden also said that he had to get out of the United States before the leaks were published by the Guardian and Washington Post to avoid being targeted by the government. The U.S. government ""predictably destroyed any possibility of a fair trial at home"" by ""openly declaring me guilty of treason,"" Snowden said. Snowden, who is believed to be in Hong Kong, also wrote that the truth about surveillance programs he disclosed will come out, and ""the U.S. government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me."" Details on NSA-thwarted plots coming, lawmaker says . The blog post rejected accusations that he had or might provide classified information to China, saying he only leaked to journalists and calling such a charge a smear tactic intended to turn public opinion against his effort to provide Americans with full information about how their government monitors them. A CNN/ORC International poll released Monday showed 54% of respondents didn't approve of Snowden's admitted actions, while 44% backed the leaks. Snowden's father told Fox News that he hoped and prayed his son ""will not release any secrets that could constitute treason."" The father, Lon Snowden, also said he wanted his son to return to the United States ""and face this,"" adding ""I love my son."" Snowden, 29, worked for the NSA through a private contractor firm until May, when he decamped to Hong Kong. He went public earlier this month as the source of articles by the newspapers, saying the agency's efforts pose ""an existential threat to democracy."" The revelations about the NSA's collection of millions of records from U.S. telecommunications and technology firms have led to a furious debate within the United States about the scale and scope of surveillance programs that date from the days after the 2001 al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington. Opinion: Did NSA snooping stop 'dozens' of terrorist attacks? Defenders say the programs -- approved by Congress after a warrantless surveillance effort under the Bush administration was revealed in 2005 -- have protected American lives by helping agents break up terrorism plots. And they argue that the program is under close oversight by all three branches of government, including the congressional intelligence committees and a court set up under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that hears cases in secret. But Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian columnist who broke Snowden's story and moderated the chat, said the safeguards placed on the program is ""a very symbolic and empty oversight that really ought not to give the assurances to anybody that these powers aren't being abused."" ""They go once every six months to the FISA court,"" he said. ""The FISA court rubber-stamps these vague guidelines that the NSA says they're using to make sure they're complying with the law. And once that happens, the NSA can force telecoms and Internet companies to give them whatever they demand under the guise that the FISA court has blessed their guidelines."" Bigger threat: Snowden or NSA? Critics call the programs an unconstitutional overreach of authority under the Patriot Act, the law that authorized increased government surveillance in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. In a new development, the Guardian reported Sunday that Britain's electronic intelligence agency monitored delegates' phones and tried to capture their passwords during an economic summit held there in 2009. Targets included British allies such as Turkey and South Africa, the newspaper reported. The Guardian cited documents provided by Snowden. According to the newspaper, the documents show that the British ""signals intelligence"" agency GCHQ used ""ground-breaking intelligence capabilities"" to intercept calls made by members of the G-20 conference delegations at meetings in London. Facebook, Microsoft disclose information on user data requests . Analysts received round-the-clock summaries of calls that were being made, and GCHQ set up Internet cafes for delegates in hopes of intercepting e-mails and capturing keystrokes, the Guardian reported. One briefing slide explained the intercepts would give intelligence agencies the ability to read delegates' e-mails ""before/as they do,"" providing ""sustained intelligence options against them even after (the) conference has finished."" GCHQ is Britain's equivalent of the secretive NSA in the United States. The Guardian reported that the NSA had attempted to eavesdrop on then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev during the conference as his phone calls passed through satellite links to Moscow and briefed its British counterparts on the effects. The latest report was published on the eve of a smaller economic summit hosted by the British government -- the Group of Eight gathering in Northern Ireland. Shawn Turner, a spokesman for the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said Sunday he was aware of the Guardian's latest report but declined to comment on it. ""What we should be focused on is how irresponsible and egregious these recent leaks are,"" he told CNN. ""It's impossible to know exactly how much damage is being done by these disclosures, but they will have an effect on our counterterrorism efforts."" Cheney defends NSA, calls Obama's credibility 'nonexistent' Retired Gen. Michael Hayden, a former NSA director, said on CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" that what the agency collects are ""essentially billing records"" that detail the time, duration and phone numbers involved in a call. The records are added to a database that agents can query in cases involving a terror investigation overseas, and agents can't eavesdrop on Americans' calls without an order from a secret court that handles intelligence matters, he said. If a phone number related to an investigation has links to a domestic phone number, ""We've got to go back to the court,"" he said. GOP tries to keep focus on IRS targeting scandal . However, critics such as Sen. Mark Udall, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, had raised questions about the scale of the program even before Snowden's leak. Udall said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday that he doesn't believe the program is making Americans any safer, ""and I think it's ultimately, perhaps, a violation of the Fourth Amendment."" ""I think we owe it to the American people to have a fulsome debate in the open about the extent of these programs,"" said Udall, a Colorado Democrat. ""You have a law that's been interpreted secretly by a secret court that then issues secret orders to generate a secret program. I just don't think this is an American approach to a world in which we have great threats."" Obama does not feel that he has violated the privacy of any American, his chief of staff, Denis McDonough, said on the CBS program ""Face the Nation."" McDonough said the president will be discussing the need to ""find the right balance, especially in this new situation where we find ourselves with all of us reliant on Internet, on e-mail, on texting.""

"(CNN) -- Investigators have made three arrests in connection with the theft of a missing police captain's truck and have linked the vehicle to a Sunday night robbery in which one person was shot, Virginia State Police announced Wednesday. But while detectives have made ""a significant amount of progress in a short amount of time,"" they have not yet found 45-year-old Kevin Quick, who has been missing since Friday night, state police spokeswoman Corinne Geller told reporters. Two sisters and a brother were arrested Tuesday night at a hotel in the Washington suburb of Alexandria, Geller said. Daniel Mathis and his sister Mersadies Shelton have been charged with grand larceny in the theft of Quick's 1999 Toyota 4Runner, while the second sister, Shantai Shelton, was picked up on an outstanding warrant from Louisa County, east of Charlottesville, where Sunday night's armed robbery took place, she said. The 18-year-old Mathis also was charged with robbery, malicious wounding and a variety of weapons-related charges in connection with the Sunday night robbery, but no details of that holdup were released. Mathis and his sisters were being held without bond Wednesday evening, Geller said. Donald Lowe, chief deputy sheriff in Louisa County, said the Sunday night holdup took place at a rural home. Investigators ""were able to capture information"" about a vehicle that led to the arrests Tuesday night, but no further details were disclosed. ""We're very limited on what we can actually release at this time,"" Lowe said. Quick is an auxiliary police captain in Waynesboro, west of Charlottesville. He was last seen at his mother's house in Afton about 10:15 p.m. Friday, and was reported missing after failing to show up for a brother's birthday party Saturday afternoon. The 4Runner was captured by surveillance cameras at automatic teller machines twice. The first time was in the town of Fork Union, about 50 miles from Afton, about 11:40 Friday night; the second was in Manassas, on the outskirts of Washington, on Saturday night, Geller said. Each time, the same two people were in the picture, she said -- but authorities haven't said which, if any, of those arrested were in the image. The 4Runner turned up parked under a carport in Mineral, more than 30 miles northeast of Fork Union, on Monday. Investigators combed that area on foot Wednesday in hopes of finding some sign of Quick, said Sgt. Brian Edwards, a Waynesboro police spokesman. But that search ended unsuccessfully, Geller said. Virginia State Police say they suspect foul play in his disappearance, and civic leaders have put up $30,000 in reward money for information that helps find him. ""Capt. Quick is a very outgoing person,"" Edwards said. ""He had a lot of street credibility. He automatically commanded respect."" Fork Union is one of two towns where Quick's silver 1999 Toyota 4Runner has been spotted since he was last seen. The other was a sighting later in Manassas, near Washington -- nearly 100 miles away. Police have linked two men to Quick's SUV and released a photo of one of them: The man wears a hooded sweatshirt that covers much of his face. Authorities hope the public can help them track him down for questioning. Quick had planned a big bash Saturday for his brother's 40th birthday -- hiring a DJ, hanging decorations and inviting friends and relatives to join in the fun. But the host never showed, prompting his family to start searching for him. ""When he never showed, that was when people could tell there was something really wrong,"" Edwards said. ""Family was really important to him. He wouldn't just ditch out on the family."" Quick's family is deeply rooted in Waynesboro, a city of about 21,000 residents along the edge of the Appalachian Mountains, and has strong ties to its police department. Kevin Quick's late father joined Waynesboro police's reserve arm in 1983. His eldest son joined him in 1990, ascending the ranks over the subsequent years. The middle brother, Glenn, is an officer with the U.S. Capitol Police in Washington and has joined the search around Fork Union, Edwards said. Quick worked in the reserves while working day jobs, including the past 15 years as a production coordinator for the synthetic fabrics company Invista. He was laid off three weeks ago, according to court papers, and given a severance package in what Edwards called an ""amicable"" separation. The severance package had not yet been accounted for, according to a police affidavit filed as part of a request for a search warrant. The application asked Quick's bank for records of his transactions since January 1. Quick had been legally separated from his wife since 2007, but their divorce was not final, Edwards said. He said another woman gave birth to Quick's daughter four months ago, and he was headed to their home in Charlottesville when he disappeared. He had been living with his mother in Afton and took her to breakfast on Friday -- the last time his credit card had been used, Edwards said. He spent that day prepping for his brother's surprise party, then texted his child's mother to tell her he was on the way. His phone has been turned off since just before 11 p.m. Friday, according to the search warrant paperwork. When the party's 1 p.m. Saturday start time rolled around and there was no Kevin, his family suspected something was up. According to Edwards, authorities have already ruled out the possibility that he disappeared of his own accord. He was not involved in any undercover or large-scale operations: His duties involved administrative issues and training, Edwards said. He was off-duty at the time and had no known adversaries or enemies, but his status as a police officer ""does bring into question whether or not he could have been targeted,"" the spokesman said. Authorities have ""traced every possible route that he could have taken"" between the various locations as part of extensive air and ground searches, Geller said.

"(EW.com) -- A couple of high-profile openers couldn't force the animals of ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"" into their cages. The animated comedy topped the box office once again this weekend, while ""Rock of Ages"" and ""That's My Boy"" delivered majorly disappointing debuts. Dreamworks' $145 million effort ""Madagascar 3"" roared a second time following its $60.3 million start. The CG-animated film dipped 41 percent to $35.5 million this frame. That's better than the second weekend decline of its predecessor, ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa,"" which fell by 45 percent and had earned a slightly softer $116.9 million at the same point in its run. ""Madagascar 3"" has grossed $120.5 million over ten days, and is headed to a $180 million finish domestically. Worldwide, the 3-D film has grossed a robust $278 million, and will likely finish near $600 million. Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" prequel ""Prometheus"" finished in second place for its second weekend, despite dropping by a hefty 60 percent to $20.2 million. Fox's $130 million sci-fi thriller has earned $88.9 million since invading theaters 10 days ago, and it may struggle to match it production budget domestically. Thankfully, the conversation-spurring flick has found $92.7 million overseas, giving it a worldwide total of $181.6 million. Although many prognosticators expected ""Rock of Ages"" to vie for the number one spot this weekend, the hair-metal Broadway adaptation couldn't convince audiences to join the mosh pit. Ages dropped like a rock, earning an abysmal $15.1 million in its debut — far less than comparative Broadway adaptations like ""Mamma Mia!"", which began with $27.8 million in 2008 and ""Hairspray"" (also directed by ""Rock of Ages'"" helmer Adam Shankman), which started with $27.5 million in 2007. Warner Bros. says the film cost $65 million to produce, and there's little chance it can match its production budget domestically after audiences, which skewed heavily female and decisively older, issued the film a mediocre ""B"" CinemaScore grade, suggesting that it won't benefit from word-of-mouth. Some are claiming that Rock of Ages' awful debut is a sign that Tom Cruise, who plays rocker Stacee Jaxx, may have lost his Midas touch at the box office. While the A-list star appeared heavily in ads for the film, in all actuality, he only serves as a minor character, and the musical is so far outside his action/drama wheelhouse that it's not a totally apt criticism. If there's a star to blame here (and, to be clear, I'm not sure there is — I'd bet the amateur look and sound of the movie is what kept audiences away), it's lead actress Julianne Hough, whose first three music-and-dance features since leaving ""Dancing with the Stars"" have all been relative box office disappointments. ""Burlesque"" found just $39.4 million in 2010, and ""Footloose"" achieved only $51.8 million last year — not a terrible result given its $24 million budget, but far below expectations. Hough may be Hollywood's go-to starlet for dance-heavy roles, but she's not yet a legitimate box office draw, and her ""Rock of Ages"" co-lead, Diego Boneta, certainly is not either. In fourth, Universal's $170 million tentpole ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" dipped just 40 percent (following a 59 percent decline last weekend) to $13.8 million in its third weekend. The Kristen Stewart/Charlize Theron showdown has earned $122.6 million so far (and another $124.6 million internationally) and seems headed for a finish of about $145 million domestically and $325 million worldwide. Whether those grosses are fair enough to justify the ""Snow White"" sequel reportedly in the works seems doubtful. Rounding out the top five is Adam Sandler's latest, ""That's My Boy,"" which, despite the presence of Saturday Night Live favorite Andy Samberg, earned only $13 million over Father's Day weekend. That's about half of what Sandler's last comedy, the Razzie-festooned ""Jack and Jill,"" earned in its debut ($25 million), and his smallest opening for a traditional live-action comedy since ""Happy Gilmore's"" $8.6 million bow in 1996. ""That's My Boy"" received a discouraging ""B-"" CinemaScore grade from audiences (which were 54 percent male), with patrons under 18 giving the raunchy title an ""A-"" and those 50 and up issuing it a ""D-."" If ""That's My Boy"" didn't carry an R-rating, perhaps more enthusiastic youngsters would have turned out over the weekend. The failure of ""That's My Boy,"" which cost Sony about $70 million, marks a pivotal moment in Sandler's career. For years, he reigned as the most consistent box office draw in Hollywood. Though his comedies — like ""Mr. Deeds"" (which earned $126.3 million), ""Click"" ($137.4 million), and ""Grown Ups"" ($162 million) — were usually critical misfires, they almost always opened in the $30-40 million range (or higher), and reaped major profits. It's not just that Sandler was starring in these films, either — he executive produced each of his 12 comedies that has earned over $100 million domestically. As a business-oriented filmmaker, no one could knock Sandler. But something changed with the release of Jack and Jill in late 2011. Critics utterly savaged the cross-dressing comedy, and audiences who had been willing to laugh at the silly antics of Sandler's amateur man-baby characters decided they had had enough. Jack and Jill became the star's first live-action comedy (I'm not including dramedies ""Funny People,"" ""Punch Drunk Love,"" or ""Spanglish"" — none of which Sandler produced) to miss the $100 million mark since 2000′s Little Nicky, and Jack and Jill finished with a weak $74.2 million. ""That's My Boy"" will be lucky to earn even half that amount. It seems that Sandler (and his longtime studio partner Sony) may need to rethink their strategy moving forward. His formula worked wonders at the box office for 15 years, but Sandler's shine is wearing off, and many of his formerly faithful paying customers are no longer amused. Elsewhere on the chart, ""Men in Black 3"" took in another $10 million and passed the $150 million mark.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Army hopes it can do a better job of preventing mental health problems in the ranks with more aggressive screening of troops -- before they ship out to a war zone. After nine years of fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, the military is coping with a wave of mental health issues, from post-traumatic stress disorder to depression and suicide. Army medical experts have been studying the results of a just-released study of the benefits of pre-deployment evaluation of soldiers and follow-up treatment while they were in Iraq. The study found that improved screening reduced later behavioral problems by 78% and reduced thoughts of suicide by more than half. The service is struggling with a troubling suicide rate. At a news conference at the Pentagon later Wednesday, officials will report that while the number of suicides in the active-duty force declined in 2010, the number of suicides in the Army Reserve and National Guard increased, a senior Army official said. The Army Surgeon General's office said Tuesday it hopes to have new screening and treatment procedures in place in six months. The changes will be based in part on the research published by the American Journal of Psychiatry Tuesday. ""The most important part about the study, even more than the screening, is that they identified which soldiers could benefit from follow-up treatment in-theater,"" Col. Rebecca Porter told CNN. Porter is the director of behavioral health for the Surgeon General of the Army. ""That's important for the mission and it is important for individual soldiers, to see the fight through."" The increase in Reserve and National Guard suicides is among troops who are in the United States and not activated for duty. The senior Army official said more than half of those troops were never deployed to a war zone. Researchers looked at more than 21,000 soldiers bound for Iraq in 2007 and 2008. Roughly half were evaluated before they deployed and were provided with follow-up visits and care when they arrived in Iraq. The study concluded that this evaluation -- before, during and after the stresses of a combat -- pays off in fewer problems. ""This predeployment screening process was associated with a decreased need for clinical care for combat stress, psychiatric and behavioral disorders, and suicidal ideation,"" the report said. Suicidal ideation is the planning of suicide or other suicidal thoughts. The authors said the study provided the first direct evidence to support pre-deployment mental health screening across the Army. ""Soldiers in screened brigades had significantly lower rates than those in unscreened brigades for clinical contacts for suicidal ideation, combat stress, and psychiatric disorders, as well as lower rates of occupational impairment,"" they said. In the pilot study that was the basis for the research, some soldiers were not cleared to deploy, others required additional treatment before they deployed and others received follow-up visits at their bases in Iraq. And the study found that both the individual soldier and the unit stood to gain from the increased care, as medical problems, emergency treatment and evacuations were reduced. ""These results show that an aggressive program of mental health screening, tracking, and coordination of care may enhance a unit's functioning while decreasing negative soldier outcomes,"" the study said. Porter said that an additional benefit of enhanced screening would be reducing the stigma that hinders some military personnel from seeking mental health assistance until their condition worsens. The American Journal of Psychiatry is not the only professional publication to focus on mental health problems in the military. A special edition of the journal American Psychologist also examines how to improve the psychological readiness of U.S. military personnel. ""Like our physical fitness program, I believe that psychological resilience development can become not just something we in the Army 'do,' but rather a critical component of our culture that will be integrated throughout our community to develop better soldiers,"" Gen. George Casey, the Army's chief of staff, wrote in the introduction to the article in American Psychologist. Brig. Gen. Rhonda Cornum, a doctor with the Comprehensive Soldier Fitness program, agreed. ""Modern warfare is characterized by demanding missions, extreme climates, sleep deprivation, cultural dissonance, physical fatigue, prolonged separation from family and the ever-present threat of serious bodily injury or death,"" Cornum wrote. ""Waiting for illness or injury to occur is not the way commanders in the U.S. Army approach high-risk actions, and it is not the way we should approach high psychological risk activities.""","The Pentagon will report on Army suicide rates for 2010 Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- The past year saw a mild winter give way to a balmier-than-normal spring, followed by a sweltering summer and high temperatures that lingered into the fall, all punctuated by extreme drought and intense storms. Now 2012 is officially in the books as the hottest year on record for the continental United States and the second-worst for ""extreme"" weather such as hurricanes, droughts or floods, the U.S. government announced Tuesday. The year's average temperature of 55.3 degrees Fahrenheit across the Lower 48 was more than 3.2 degrees warmer than the average for the 20th century, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration reported. That topped the previous record, set in 1998, by a full degree. Every state in the contiguous United States saw above-average temperatures in 2012, with 19 of them setting annual records of their own, NOAA said. Meanwhile, the country faced 11 weather disasters that topped $1 billion in losses each, including a lingering drought that covered 61% of the country at one point. That drought shriveled crops across the American farm belt, leading to an expected rise in food prices in 2013, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. It also turned forests of the mountain West into stands of tinder that exploded into catastrophic wildfires over the summer, scorching millions of acres and destroying hundreds of homes. Climate change, extreme weather linked . And then there was Superstorm Sandy, a late October post-tropical cyclone that killed more than 110 people in the United States and nearly 70 more in the Caribbean and Canada. Damage estimates from the storm run around $80 billion in New York and New Jersey alone. The report is likely to fuel new concerns over a warming climate. Seven of the 10 hottest years in U.S. records, which date back to 1895, and four of the hottest five have now occurred since 1990, according to NOAA figures. The year also saw Arctic sea ice hit a record low in more than 30 years of satellite observations and studies that found the world's major ice sheets have been shrinking at an increasing rate. Scientists are quick to point out that no single storm can be blamed on climate change, but say a warming world raises the odds of extreme weather. ""I think unfortunately, 2012 really may well be the new normal,"" said Daniel Lashof, director of the climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a U.S. environmental group. ""It's the kind of year we expect, given the global warming trend is ongoing."" The science of global warming is politically controversial but generally accepted as fact by most researchers, who point to heat-trapping carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels as the major cause. Lashof's group is trying to press the Obama administration to tighten limits on carbon emissions, but he said those steps ""are not going to reduce the threat of extreme weather overnight."" ""We need to take greater preparations, anticipating the kind of storms and droughts that we saw are going to continue to be more frequent as we go forward,"" he said. Wildfires race across Australia . Though parts of the country such as the Pacific Northwest and the Gulf Coast had wetter-than-average years, average precipitation was nearly 2.6 inches below normal -- the 15th driest since records started being kept in the 1890s, according to NOAA. The two remaining U.S. states, remote Alaska and Hawaii, saw a mixed picture in 2012. Alaska was slightly cooler and wetter than normal, while nearly two-thirds of Hawaii's island chain faced moderate to exceptional drought conditions by December, NOAA said.

"(CNN) -- When I first arrived in Rwanda's capital in 2012, I deliberately did not visit the Kigali Genocide Memorial. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I did not want that experience to influence how I approached the country and its people. In my mind, Rwanda was going to be this country that was still on the brink of economic disaster. It would be very poorly set up, with a bad road system and difficult telecommunications. Frankly, I despaired of working with the government, thinking it would be extremely challenging to work with. I remember 1994 well. I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in West Africa and the Rwandan genocide, right on the heels of Nelson Mandela's election in South Africa, was big news across the continent. The child-run household I met after the genocide . When I was assigned to Rwanda 18 years later, my first thought was the genocide -- this is probably true for most people. But when I asked friends and colleagues who had lived there for advice, they spoke highly of the country and her people. I started seeing this as another adventure on this continent that I love, though I had visions of the film ""Hotel Rwanda"" resounding in my mind. Those preconceptions were quickly dispelled once I got there. When you get to Rwanda, you are hit by the incongruity that strikes so many: How could such a horrible thing have happened in such a beautiful country? The nickname Land of a Thousand Hills is not an exaggeration. Rwanda's countryside is dotted with what appear to be literally a thousand hills that are a mixture of mountains, volcanoes and hillocks. The beauty is reflected in the people: Rwandans are incredibly friendly and hospitable. But just as you cannot see the other side of a mountain, you cannot always tell what is going on behind those eyes. Rwandans obey their country's many rules. I love that, to reduce pollution, plastic bags are forbidden and even taken from you when you arrive at the airport! For anyone who has spent time in Africa, it's incredible to see people actually wearing helmets on motorcycles, drivers and passengers alike, both in Kigali and in the countryside. National pride and a commitment to the idea that Rwandans should lead the development of their country are strong. From them came the concept of Umuganda, or community service. During the last Saturday of each month, citizens do some type of community work in their neighborhood, like picking up garbage or cutting the grass. If they do not show up, they're fined an amount determined by the neighborhood leader. (These days the neighborhoods are like anywhere else: Some are made up of different tribes and ethnicities and others are homogenous.) Amid the beautiful parks and tea plantations are the somber genocide memorials found in virtually every community. They serve as a daily reminder to never forget the atrocities. At the same time, they allow for personal reflection on mankind's capacity for both evil and resilience. Four months after my arrival, I was ready to see the Kigali Genocide Memorial. I was glad I had waited. You walk alongside slabs of cement: a mass grave where over 250,000 people killed in Kigali are buried. At the end of one of the cement tombs is a wall with names, an attempt to identify some of the souls lost during the tragic 100 days of the genocide. You almost weep when you realize they will never identify them all. One room tells the tale of other genocides or ""cleansing"" events in history around the world, reminding us that the international community has not been diligent about the oft-quoted pledge, ""Never again."" And in the room dedicated to children who were killed -- you see their names, what they enjoyed doing and who was their best friend -- your heart starts to tear. I was never able to actually read all the remembrances to these children. Though I have always considered myself a pretty tough and realistic humanitarian worker, I had never seen anything like this. A single visit ensures that the memorial realizes its purpose -- you will never forget. It's an experience that makes you wonder how any society can come back together after something that tears so deeply. But I know from what I had seen, and from my organization's work, that it is possible. Many genocide survivors and perpetrators have since been able to seek and grant forgiveness and now live peacefully, side by side. I watched a woman tear up and embrace a man who had killed her family. Witnessing these scenes is almost surreal, but deeply moving and humbling. Could I ever forgive? Could I ever confess and ask for forgiveness? Looking at Rwandans today with a certainty that such an atrocity can never happen again, you wonder ""How did this ever happen in the first place?"" When Rwandans say ""never again,"" I believe them. But when I look at the international community, those words don't have the same meaning. Are we really a community in which most of us watched this suffering and death from the sidelines? It will happen again somewhere else. We've seen it in history. In March of this year, I was asked to head our program in the Central African Republic. The lessons from Rwanda still echoing in my head, I was compelled to say ""yes"" to a country being torn apart by intercommunal fighting, just as Rwanda had been. My time in Rwanda has shown me the limitations of what the international community will do in situations like this, but also taught me lessons and given me hope. Just 20 years ago, Rwandans went through genocide, but they came back and they came back quickly. I attribute a lot of that to the strong will, the leadership and most importantly, to the resiliency of the Rwandan people. Peace is possible. Reconciliation is possible. I pray that we can realize the same here in Central African Republic. And we can, with a little influence and a lot of political will.","April 7 marks 20 years since the start of the Rwanda genocide .

"(CNN) -- It must have been a galling week for the Russian President. While presiding over a safe, well-run Sochi Games, President Vladimir Putin's key foreign policy objective -- to hold sway over Ukraine's place in the world -- has slipped through his fingers. At the very moment of his crowning Olympic glory, Putin probably had the second worst week of any world leader -- after Viktor Yanukovych. It is tiring to repeat truisms but this is not the Cold War and Russia is not the Soviet Union mark II -- not with 2% of the world economy and a tanking workforce population. Yet in spite of such disadvantages, Russia still desires respect, seeks attention and makes claims to greatness. And in many respects, Russia really is a ""great"" country: historically, culturally and geographically. A stroll around Moscow and St. Petersburg attests to this. So does the character of its people. Unfortunately, in the eyes of the Russian leadership, true greatness requires something more: the ability to dominate in many areas (technological, military etc.), but particularly geopolitically in large parts of the Middle East and Eastern Europe. And in its former empire above all. But this need for control over neighboring states is having precisely the opposite of its intended effect. It's too expensive for a start. The $3 billion it has spent so far in sweet-talking Ukraine to stick with Mother Russia isn't coming back. And that would have come in handy for much-needed social and infrastructural projects -- and for keeping key officials loyal to the Kremlin. But far more than money, there's an even more important reason why attempts at influence are having the opposite effect: in the long run, it can't work. It is to the West's immense and rare credit that post-Soviet state sovereignty has been a bedrock of policy since 1991. The five countries of Central Asia, the three countries of the South Caucasus, the three Baltic States, Moldova and even Belarus are universally recognized as independent countries. As is Ukraine. True, the West wobbles at times. The British government has been particularly weak of late in its unwillingness to confront Russia in case it desists from enhancing business cooperation. But by and large the West has stuck to this one principle well - at least rhetorically. Russia, on the other hand, cannot bring itself to do this even in words, let alone in actions. Naturally, everyone is now nervously looking to Putin for his next move. The press writes about the worst-case scenario, the most extreme course of action possible. And since Russia did cross international borders in anger in 2008, this is understandable. But Ukraine 2014 is not Georgia 2008. Military intervention in Ukraine would undo Russia's methodical work in discrediting the previous Mikheil Saakashvili government in Georgia and justifying its actions (protecting 'Russian' citizens) not to mention its recent diplomatic agility in Syria. These are ""achievements"" worth protecting. Reputation matters to Russia, as Sochi showed. A Russian military response with little certainty of success (unlike Georgia) is a nice fantasy for Russian hawks, but it would shatter Russia's chances of exerting influence anywhere else. So what then? Trade restrictions? Gas cut-offs? Fomenting trouble in Crimea? Russia does most of these already -- and will continue to do so. But there are no fresh moves left. Russia has lost this round, but it will live to fight another day, even as more and more statues of Lenin fall in the former provinces. The other reason for Russia's objection to Ukraine's revolution is that ""this could happen to us."" The thought that Yanukovych's fate -- or Slobodan Milosevic's or Saddam Hussein's -- could one day be theirs, cannot be a pleasant one. Clearly Putin is far from the extraordinarily inept politician that the Ukrainian president was. This buys him time. But who knows how much? Russia learns fast and is far more secure than Ukraine ever was. But all power erodes over time -- in democracies and autocracies alike. Maybe Ukraine is a mirror reflecting Russia's long- or even its medium-term future. This has been a bad week for Vladimir Putin, but it was probably a very good week for Russia. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Nixey.","James Nixey says Putin's bad week may be good for Russia .
He says for Russian leaders greatness lies in domination .
And that is especially true for the nations that were part of its empire .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A former Los Angeles public schools official is suing the system over settlements with dozens of students who were awarded $470,000 each, alleging that a teacher sentenced to prison on charges of lewd behavior never came into abusive contact with those children. The lawsuit, by former chief risk officer Gregg Breed of San Bernardino, accuses the district of corruption, lawyer cronyism and incompetence in the way it settled the lawsuit against former teacher Mark Berndt of Miramonte Elementary. Berndt was recently sentenced to 25 years in prison for putting pupils in bondage, and then photographing them with semen-filled spoons held at their mouths and 3-inch cockroaches crawling across their faces. Berndt had pleaded no contest to felony lewd acts on 23 children. The scandal led to almost 200 students suing the district, claiming that they, too, were victims. In a CNN interview Wednesday at his Beverly Hills attorney's office, Breed said he urged the system to wait until a conviction in the Berndt case before settling the student claims. Among the student allegations was that they were forced to eat cookies with semen on them, Breed said. ""There's clearly some children where there was no evidence that they ate a cookie, had semen in their mouth or fluid in their mouth. They are alleging, but it's not necessary true,"" Breed said. ""I did not agree with settling, but they felt it was politically better and they felt the pressure"" from the scandal, he said. ""But my view point was to wait and see because we really don't know if there was semen in the classroom. ""This is a sad case,"" he added. ""There is corruption at LAUSD sadly, and there's a lot of people in place supervising that don't have the level of expertise needed to see (the corruption)."" Last June, the school system sought a court injunction imposing ""a gag order"" on Breed to keep him from publicly discussing ""the Miramonte settlement fiasco,"" his suit said. But a judge dismissed the district's request as long as Breed never mentioned the names of the alleged student victims, Breed said. On Wednesday, a media consultant hired by the school district to be its spokesman dismissed the allegations as ""frivolous"" and described Breed as a disgruntled employee. ""The allegations are false. There was a rigorous processing of all the settlements,"" said Sean Rossall, the consultant serving as spokesman for the system's general counsel. ""There had to be substantial information before any settlement was made. ""These are nothing more than baseless allegations by a disgruntled former employee,"" Rossall continued. ""He's simply trying to latch on to the attention being paid to Miramonte to try to line his own pocket with millions of dollars, taxpayer dollars. ""It's really unfortunate that he would choose to do this and impact the families that are already impacted by the incident in Miramonte and take this money from our students and schools with baseless allegations,"" Rossall added. Last year, General Counsel David Holmquist told CNN that the district was paying $30 million to settle what now amounts to 63 of 190 students' claims alleging they were victims of sexually lewd acts by Berndt. Holmquist called the agreements ""good settlements"" at the time. The remaining students' claims are still pending. Breed's lawsuit, which seeks at least $10 million in damages, claims Los Angeles Unifed School District Chief Business and Compliance Counsel Gregory McNair and Holmquist ignored a school list of approved outside attorneys. Instead, the lawsuit claims, they hired outside representation based on McNair's ""personal relationships"" with those law firms. Those newly hired legal firms didn't have experience in sexual assault and molestation cases, but still represented the system in handling legal claims filed in the Miramonte abuse case, the lawsuit claims. One outside counsel was a law firm where McNair once worked, and another was an attorney who was a law school classmate of McNair's, the suit charged. McNair and Holmquist couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday. School spokesman Rossall said he was speaking on their behalf. Under an alleged ""cronyism"" arrangement, the outside attorneys were paid between $390 to $450 an hour -- more than twice the $175-an-hour rate that the board typically paid on its approved list of outside attorneys, the lawsuit claims. When asking about the legal fees, school spokesman Rossall said the Miramonte case ""is a different size of scope in litigation than is typically seen."" ""We really need specialists who understood the issues and had the bandwidth to handle the amount of claims being brought forth,"" Rossall said. Breed found ""numerous errors"" in vetting each student claims, such as the lack of signatures verifying information, lack of Social Security numbers, and the wrong names when compared to school classroom rosters, the lawsuit claims. For example, one pupil who received $470,000 ""did not attend classes with the abuser"" and ""essentially maintained others wanted and got money so he should get some as well,"" the lawsuit states. In another example, a girl ""was touched just once on the shoulder by the accused teacher,"" and when this issue was raised, the outside counsel contacted the mediator, who ruled he couldn't change the settlement, the suit said. ""Because the proper vetting process was not followed, LAUSD will be forced to pay $470,000 for a single act of touching on the shoulder,"" the lawsuit said. Breed, who has 30 years of experience in risk management, was hired by the district to serve as chief risk officer from April 2012 to June 2013 at a salary of $14,438 a month, the lawsuit said. Breed claimed that when he acted as a whistle-blower in reporting his allegations, his contract was not renewed in an act of retaliation, and he was denied more than $14,000 in annual contributions to his retirement account. At the time the school district announced the $30 million settlement, Holmquist said taxpayer money and possibly school insurance funds would cover that cost, but those insurance carriers are now refusing to indemnify the school system and fund the settlement because of ""attorney incompetence by corruptly selected counsel,"" the lawsuit contends. A second teacher at Miramonte Elementary, Martin Springer, was also charged with felony lewd conduct with a girl under age 14 in the aftermath of the Berndt case in 2011. Springer has pleaded not guilty, and his case is pending.","NEW: School board felt it was ""politically better"" to settle claims without conviction, ex-official tells CNN .

"(CNN) -- An Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper was suspended Wednesday for five days without pay following a highly publicized scuffle with a paramedic in Okfuskee County in May, according to the Highway Patrol. This is an image from a video that captured an Oklahoma trooper's scuffle with a paramedic in May. The incident, which was caught on dash-camera and cell-phone video, showed Trooper Daniel Martin pulling over a Creek Nation ambulance for a traffic-stop violation. During the incident, Martin is heard repeatedly using profanity and twice getting into a scuffle with one of the paramedics. Both paramedics and family members of the patient in the ambulance informed Martin several times by there was a patient inside, but he did not allow the paramedics to continue to the hospital while the video continued. In a news conference Wednesday, Oklahoma Highway Patrol Captain Chris West said Martin ""failed to recognize that it would have been more reasonable and appropriate to immediately allow the ambulance to continue to the hospital once he understood there was a patient onboard the ambulance.""  Watch the confrontation » . West also said Martin had ""probable cause to make the traffic stop and justification to arrest the paramedic for obstructing a police officer"" but that the incident ""resulted in conduct unbecoming an officer."" Martin's attorney, Gary James of Oklahoma City, did not immediately return a phone call from CNN. In a disciplinary letter sent to Martin, Oklahoma Public Safety Department Commissioner Kevin Ward, concluded that the ""disregard for the welfare of the patient [justified] severe discipline."" Martin will also be required to take an anger assessment, West said. The trooper had no previous discipline action in his record, according to West. On Tuesday, the paramedic involved in the scuffle, Maurice White, filed a lawsuit against Martin in federal court claiming his civil rights were violated. CNN's Mayra Cuevas-Nazario contributed to this report.","May incident was caught on dash-camera and cell-phone video .

"(CNN) -- Authorities say Silk Road, the shadowy ""deep Web"" site shut down by the FBI this week, was the Internet's biggest destination for drugs and other illegal goods. It had nearly 1 million registered users, the bureau says, and was used for roughly $1.3 billion in transactions over the past two or so years. But shuttering Silk Road and arresting its owner won't be the end of the shadowy black market on the Web, where drugs are far from the only products that can be bought illegally. The so-called ""deep Web"" consists of sites only accessible using tools like Tor, which includes a browser designed to hide the user's identity by routing their activity through a series of remote connections. Many sites use intentionally cryptic web addresses -- Silk Road's last was ""silkroadfb5piz3r.onion"" -- that spread stealthily via word of mouth. Here is a look at just some of the illegal goods that have been documented as offered for sale on these underground sites. (We're not linking to them, sorry.) Drugs . Maybe it should be no big surprise, but hours after Silk Road was shut down, Web users were flocking to online forums with one question: ""Where can I buy my drugs now?"" The answer? Take your pick. Sites with names like Sheep Marketplace, Black Market Reloaded and Deep Bay were just some of the ones being mentioned as possibilities. Another, called Atlantis, had emerged earlier this year as a Silk Road competitor with an aggressive social-media campaign. In June, someone claiming to be the site's owner even conducted an AMA (""Ask Me Anything"") session on Reddit. ""We want to bring attention to the site and bring our vendors more buyers,"" that person said during the session. ""Law enforcement is going to be aware of us (and probably already is) regardless of the way we choose to put our product out there."" Two weeks ago, Atlantis announced it was shutting down due to ""security reasons outside of our control."" Weapons . Illegal guns can be found on similar sites, as can legal weapons by people who may not pass a background check or otherwise be allowed to buy them. Last year, Gizmodo reporter Sam Biddle spent some time on The Armory, an offshoot of Silk Road devoted to weaponry. As part of his reporting, he posed as someone arming a paramilitary group bent on ""taking on a 3rd world government organization."" The helpful responses poured in. ""I can provide: tec9, scorpion, ak47 and one single vietnam war 'thumper', but its ammo costs,"" read one, the final reference being to a grenade launcher. ""Absolutely, we can accommodate your request, but we need more parameters such as your exact arms needs and destination country,"" read another. ""We only deal with small arms and equipment, but if you need artillery, MANPADS (Man-portable air-defense systems), ordinance, APCs, Helos we do have resources and can make certain introductions for a fee."" About a month after the Gizmodo piece ran, Silk Road's owner announced it was shutting down The Armory, citing high prices and lack of interest. Exotic animals . The International Fund for Animal Welfare calls the illegal sale of wild animals online ""one of the major wildlife conservation challenges of our generation."" ""The rise of the Internet has revolutionized the way we exchange ideas, information and merchandise. ..."" reads a report from the group. ""However, as a result, the Internet is also facilitating the illegal trade in wildlife, which is having a devastating effect on animals, ecosystems and the communities that rely on them worldwide."" The report, in which the group tracked activity on 183 websites, documented the sale of elephant ivory, birds of prey, tigers, large snakes and other rare or endangered creatures. The relative anonymity the Web provides, combined with a patchwork of laws from state to state and country to country, make policing animal trafficking a tough job, the group said. Fake documents . Along with drugs, firearms and solicitations of hackers, Silk Road also had forged documents for sale, the FBI said. In July, the FBI says it intercepted nine false IDs bound for Ross William Ulbricht, who they say is ""Dread Pirate Roberts,"" the man behind the site. ""Roberts"" had been soliciting fake identification documents on Silk Road to use in buying more server space for the site. It shouldn't have been hard. A simple Google search for fake passports renders websites like FalsePassports.cc and IdentificationConsulting.com. Need a ""novelty"" driver's license? Several sites offer those, and you can get a diploma and Social Security card while you're at it. ""For your own personal use and amusement,"" notes Global Intelligence ID Cards Solutions.

"(CNN) -- Remains discovered in Virginia earlier this week are those of missing police officer Kevin Quick, a Virginia State Police spokeswoman said Saturday. Earlier, police had said the officer was dead and charged five people in connection with the killing, but had not identified his remains. On Saturday, police confirmed that a man's body found Thursday was indeed Quick's. Quick was a reserve captain -- a volunteer officer -- in the small central Virginia city of Waynesboro. Authorities have not said how, when or why Quick died. Nor have they specified his relation to those involved in his disappearance and death, including whether he knew them personally, was targeted for his police work or perhaps was randomly targeted. State Police spokeswoman Corrine Geller said three people were arrested Thursday in connection with the case -- 22-year-old Gert Wright, 49-year-old Leslie Hope Casterlow and 31-year-old Anthony Stokes Jr. All three are being held without bond at Henricho County Jail on felony charges of being ""a principal in the second degree"" to Quick's death and of gang participation. This is in addition to previously announced arrests of three siblings Tuesday night at a hotel in the Washington suburb of Alexandria, Virginia. Daniel Mathis and his sister, Mersadies Shelton, have been charged with grand larceny in the theft of Quick's 1999 Toyota 4Runner. A second sister, Shantai Shelton -- who has not yet been charged directly in Quick's case -- was picked up on an outstanding warrant from Louisa County, east of Charlottesville, where Sunday night's armed robbery took place, Geller said earlier this week. In 1990, Quick joined his father in the reserve arm of the Waynesboro police department -- members of which aren't paid but hold ranks, have badges and carry firearms like full-time officers. He rose up the ranks while working paying day jobs, including the past 15 years as a production coordinator for the synthetic fabrics company Invista. His position there was eliminated in what Waynesboro police Sgt. Brian Edwards called an ""amicable"" separation.","Police identified the remains of a missing reserve police officer .

"(CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden made some waves last week when he announced that he was still thinking about running for the presidency in 2016. Appearing on ""The View,"" Biden said, ""My knowledge of foreign policy, my engagement of world leaders, my experience uniquely positions me to follow through on the agenda Barack and I have of bringing world peace that is real and substantive."" Most experts are predicting that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will be the ""inevitable nominee"" for the Democratic Party in 2016 -- with over 80% of Democrats saying they want Clinton to run, and only 42% saying the same about Biden, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll. But the vice president is refusing to give up this dream and still considering the possibility that he will try to succeed President Obama. Although Biden's shortcomings are well known, such as his proclivity toward gaffes -- in 2007, he said of his then-opponent Barack Obama, ""I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,"" and on another occasion he said that ""jobs"" was a three-letter word -- he also brings many assets to the table, including his knowledge of foreign policy and popularity among working- and middle-class Democrats who appreciate his defense of government programs that benefit them. Biden has also been willing to take a much stronger tack against the GOP than Obama has. ""This is not your father's Republican Party,"" he said to one group of Democrats. Many also consider him the most genuinely human of the potential candidates. But even if Hillary Clinton doesn't run, Biden would face long odds to succeed. The record of vice presidents who won election to succeed their predecessors has been meager. After John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Martin Van Buren, the only other vice president to win the election after his president stepped down, was Republican George H.W. Bush in 1988 (or in the case of Jefferson, to defeat the president under whom he served). The others who have taken on this challenge since World War II -- Richard Nixon in 1960, Hubert Humphrey in 1968, and Al Gore in 2000 (though some say that he did indeed win the election) -- have not fared well. While 14 former vice presidents have become president, nine of those took office as a result of the death of their predecessor and then went on to win the election (such as Lyndon Johnson). Richard Nixon was elected president in 1968, but that was seven years after leaving the vice presidency in 1961 and after carefully rebuilding his image as a party statesman. Why is it so hard for vice presidents? The biggest liability is that they are running at a time when their predecessor has usually become most controversial. Hubert Humphrey, once the darling of the Democratic base, was bogged down by Lyndon Johnson's record in Vietnam when he ran in 1968. Even when departing presidents have strong approval ratings, their decisions in the White House have created many issues and earned many enemies. The luster of the early years that an administration enjoys in the White House has worn out. Supporters of the opposition party usually hate everything associated with the incumbent, while there are often huge tensions within the president's party as well. ""I have a f**king target on my back,"" Politico reported Biden told a confidant in 2012, referring to Democrats who were upset with him about the 2012 budget deal. It is relatively easy for an opponent -- like John F. Kennedy in 1960 when he beat Vice President Richard Nixon -- to present himself as the fresh voice in politics, in contrast to a tired and potentially worn-out face. Vice presidents are rarely comfortable as candidates running on their own and relating to their predecessor. On the one hand, they want to derive the benefits from everything that Americans like about the president. Yet, as was the case with Gore, they want to be their own person and separate themselves from the baggage that comes with the existing White House. The result is that vice presidents running for the presidency flip back and forth on how much they want to attach themselves to the president, never achieving a level of comfort that their opponents can claim. In the post-Watergate era, railing against Washington is always in fashion, and vice presidents are often the victim. Other than a president himself, nothing symbolizes the establishment more than the person who is second in command. A vice president who runs for office offers a perfect foil to members of his or her own party, as well as to the opposition party, to paint the race as a contest between Washington and those who want to change Washington. This is true even if the opponent is also a member of the political class. Nothing would be more helpful to Hillary Clinton than having Biden run in the primaries, because it would allow her to distance herself from the capital -- even though she served in Washington as first lady for eight years, senator for eight years and secretary of state for four. Finally, the vice president simply does not get the same credit for achievements that presidents enjoy. Even in an age when vice presidents have become much more powerful and enjoy a substantial amount of autonomy during their time in the White House, the public doesn't really see them as central figures in the political debate. They often work behind the scenes, pushing policy in one direction or another outside the public eye. Other than Biden's famous statement on gay rights, where he got ahead of the president in announcing his support for same-sex marriage, most Americans are unaware of what he is doing, including work on economic policy and the war in Afghanistan. The only modern exception to this pattern was George H.W. Bush, who was able to score a healthy victory in 1988. He did not face a strong primary challenger -- Sen. Robert Dole did not have great public appeal, and the preacher Pat Robertson veered so far to the right on cultural issues he set up Bush perfectly as the candidate of the center. Democrat Michael Dukakis' candidacy imploded in the fall with a weak campaign, while the dramatic changes that would ultimately lead to the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the ending of the Cold War created a bias toward stability and continuity in foreign policy. Perhaps most importantly, Bush conducted a slash-and-burn campaign under the direction of Lee Atwater that helped win him the election. So while Biden has a considerable amount of experience and what many might consider an impressive record, the odds of his winning in 2016 are slim. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Vice President Joe Biden said he's thinking of running for the presidency in 2016 .

"(CNN) -- The iconic image of the neighborhood drugstore and wise and friendly pharmacist were once part of the American social fabric. The local pharmacy was where we went to pursue romance over an ice cream soda, share gossip with members of our community or acquire our most basic supplies. Pharmacists were our friends, our neighbors and those we looked to for help and aid. But increasingly, as the local pharmacy transformed into the large chain drug store, the analgesics and advice were joined by something quite different and deadly: tobacco products. Along with medicines, greeting cards and cosmetics, large retailers and pharmacies like Walmart, Rite Aid and Walgreens sell cigarettes and other tobacco products, despite the fact that we know they are harmful. But on Wednesday, CVS/Caremark stepped up and declared loud and clear: Cigarettes and health care cannot and should not coexist under the same roof. We applaud CVS for taking the bold and socially conscious step to stop selling cigarettes and other tobacco products effective October 1. More than 7,600 CVS stores across the nation will no longer sell these products -- impacting thousands of customers across the country and helping to promote longer, healthier lives. Despite intense competition in the industry, CVS had the vision and the conviction to do what is right for its customers. Each year in our country, more than 480,000 Americans lose their lives to tobacco-related diseases, including heart disease, cancers, emphysema and stroke. Tobacco use also takes a huge toll on our economy, from lost productivity to the medical care costs of treating sick smokers. But tobacco-related disease is wholly preventable. Proven tactics such as raising the price of tobacco products, clean indoor air laws, and effective public education campaigns can help drive smoking rates down. For years, these have been the tools of government and nonprofit organizations like Legacy Foundation. CVS brought a critical additional tool to bear -- limiting access to tobacco -- and issued a clarion call for retailers to join the fight to change the culture around tobacco use to make it less socially acceptable. Removing tobacco products from pharmacy shelves -- where they are often both an eye-level temptation for youth who are open to smoking and a trigger for smokers struggling to quit -- will help foster positive changes in our attitudes toward smoking. We challenge other large retailers to take the same step and put their customers' health and well-being ahead of their profit margins. CVS's decision shows that the for-profit sector can truly do good. Increasingly, America's pharmacies are positioning themselves as health care providers. Instead of a traditional visit to a doctor's office, many people may now visit their pharmacy -- like CVS's Minute Clinic -- for a quick assessment or diagnosis or to receive an on-the-spot prescription for whatever ails. To be seen as trusted health care providers, pharmacies must reconcile the inherent contradiction of offering those services while also selling lethal tobacco products to those very same customers. Providing medical services in one part of the store while offering harmful products at the cash register is a paradox that couldn't be clearer. CVS recognized that to be a true leader, you have to not only talk the talk but walk the walk. In a business climate with brutal competition and the persistent pressure to deliver short-term results, estimates are that this move by CVS could cost the nation's second largest drugstore chain about $2 billion in annual sales. But smart businesses look toward the big picture. By taking tobacco products off its shelves, CVS has an immediate opportunity to introduce other -- potentially profitable -- product lines to its customer base. With a new commitment to offering customers healthier choices, it has a longer-term opportunity to foster relationships with health care providers and medical staff -- all synched with CVS's vision to be a trusted neighborhood resource for short-term care. And CVS's act of social responsibility also has the potential to deepen existing customer relationships. Already, anecdotally, I've heard colleagues and friends who have been affected firsthand by the issue of tobacco use or lost a loved one to tobacco-related disease say to me, ""CVS is now my pharmacy for life"" -- based on the action it took this week. For that, the public health community and the chain's customers are cheering. We hope its peers quickly follow suit. Once they do, we will likely reach our bold goal to reduce smoking prevalence in the U.S. to under 10% in the next 10 years. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robin Koval.","CVS/Caremark announced that it will stop selling cigarettes and tobacco products .

"(CNN) -- The Iranians are coming! The Iranians are coming! Well, OK, maybe not. But if a couple of vessels flying the colors of the Islamic republic do appear off American shores sometime soon, don't panic. Even if it happens -- something U.S. officials have called into question -- the point of any such voyage appears to be to make a public-relations splash. ""What this does is, to people who don't know anything about sea power, which is a fairly substantial number of people in the developing world, it looks like a major gesture,"" U.S. military analyst Anthony Cordesman told CNN. ""Within Iran's sort of politics, it follows a long theme of Republican Guard and other statements that Iran can defeat the United States."" But Cordesman, who holds the Burke Chair in Strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the reported Iranian flotilla -- led by an aging frigate the U.S. Navy once nearly sunk -- poses no risk to the world's biggest naval power. ""Deploying a military museum is not going to threaten to the United States,"" he said. The semi-official Iranian news agency Fars quoted the head of Iran's navy over the weekend as saying an Iranian flotilla ""is approaching the United States' maritime borders"" as a response to the U.S. decision to beef up its naval presence in the Persian Gulf. Adm. Afshin Rezayee Haddad said the Iranian ships were nearing the southern tip of Africa en route to the Atlantic Ocean. A U.S. military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was no information to support the claim, and there was no other corroboration of the report from Tehran. Iran announced plans to send ships toward the U.S. maritime borders twice in 2011; neither deployment materialized. But Iran's Press TV reported in January that the frigate Sabalan and the supply ship Kharg, which also carries helicopters, were headed to the Atlantic ""to provide the safety of Iran's shipping lines in international waters and to provide training for the new recruits."" The 300-foot Sabalan went into service in 1972. It was heavily damaged in a skirmish with American forces in 1988, when U.S. warships were dispatched to protect international oil tankers during Iran's war with Iraq. The announcement comes as Iran prepares to mark the 35th anniversary of the revolution that toppled Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi. The Pentagon sounded unfazed by the Fars report. ""Aspirations not new. Freedom of seas applies to all, so long as they understand responsibilities of that freedom,"" Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon's press secretary, posted on Twitter. Most of Iran's navy is made up of small attack craft, about two dozen of which are armed with missiles, according to the authoritative Jane's Fighting Ships. Its biggest warships are the Sabalan and its four sister frigates, along with two smaller and lighter corvettes and 14 diesel-electric submarines. Tehran previously dispatched ships to patrol the Gulf of Oman and Indian Ocean for Somali pirates, capturing 13 during a 2012 engagement. It also dispatched warships to the Mediterranean Sea via the Suez Canal in 2011 and 2012 -- moves billed as carrying messages of ""peace and friendship"" to the region, but which also tweaked the nose of regional foe Israel. But the navy's main mission is to defend its home waters in the Persian Gulf and control the Strait of Hormuz. While it has the potential to attack its rivals in a hit-and-run fashion, ""That's not the kind of force you can deploy outside the Gulf,"" Cordesman said. ""Iran can sort of make demonstrative gestures and sail in international waters off the U.S. East Coast, or West Coast for that matter,"" Cordesman said. ""But it's not much more threatening than if somebody showed up in a rowboat."" Iran touts launch of new missiles; U.S. says it's watching closely .

"(CNN) -- Sometimes it takes just one. One person-- one idea -- to ignite a movement that changes lives. Helping the millions of people who've fled the war in Syria may seem a challenge far too big for small relief efforts. The U.N. calls it the worst humanitarian crisis in a generation. The needs are staggering. And yet, for some people, it's just not an option to do nothing. I AM NOT A TOURIST . Tanya Khalil says she refuses to be a neutral observer. Her country, Lebanon, is taking in more Syrian refugees than any other -- nearly 1 million at last official count -- despite its tiny size. The university student says it's impossible to walk the streets of Beirut without seeing reminders of the suffering -- some refugees searching for food, others sleeping on sidewalks. ""We cannot think somebody else will take care of it,"" Khalil says. ""We are that somebody. Each and every one of us is that somebody and it is our duty towards one another to be caring and compassionate souls."" Khalil started a group called I AM NOT A TOURIST. The name was meant as a wake-up call to her fellow Lebanese -- that the Syrian crisis was now on their doorstep and they could no longer act like bystanders. She couldn't stand the thought of Syrian refugees shivering in brutally cold temperatures while she and her friends were sleeping in their warm beds. They began collecting winter clothing and blankets for refugees in Akkar and the Bekaa Valley in north Lebanon. Khalil estimates 4,500 people donated items, filling 25 huge trucks. ""We ended up with more than 10,200 'bags of love,' "" she says. Unlike other host countries, Lebanon has no formal refugee camps. Refugees there are scattered across some 1,600 locations, complicating aid distribution. Khalil partnered with established NGOs to help with logistics: Sawa for Syria and War Child Holland. The United Nations estimates nearly 2.5 million Syrians are seeking shelter in Lebanon and in other neighboring states, but that accounts for only registered refugees. The true number could be much higher. And the crisis is only getting worse, as thousands of Syrians flee across the border each day. Sweaters for Syria . Ranya Alkadamani was half a world away when she felt compelled to help. It all started with a conversation with her brother. An Australian citizen living in Perth, Alkadamani has Syrian parents and family in Beirut. Her brother was heading to Beirut and asked if she had any old sweaters that he could take for a U.N. relief effort. She said sure -- and then realized she could do something even bigger. She sent an e-mail to work colleagues, asking if they had any sweaters to contribute. The note touched her boss, who called her and said he wanted to help start a campaign and that he would pay for shipping the sweaters. It became known as Sweaters for Syria. Alkadamani says she was overwhelmed by the response. She was worried that they wouldn't receive enough donations to fill even one container, but ""in two weeks, we pretty much filled the Salvation Army's warehouse with 1,000 bags."" The campaign inspired people across Perth. One 6-year-old boy is said to have collected 600 sweaters on his own. ""When people know there's something tangible that they can do to make a difference, they'll do it,"" Alkadamani says. She cried when she saw all the bags piled up in the warehouse -- 100,000 sweaters in all. ""Everyone was so generous and they cared as much as I did, and they're not even Syrian,"" she says. ""That was overwhelming."" The bags were delivered to the UNHCR for distribution in Turkey and Jordan. Alkadamani visited Jordan this month, helping to hand out sweaters to refugees who were crossing the border. She also visited Zaatari, a sprawling camp in the desert now home to nearly 125,000 refugees. That effectively makes it one of the largest cities in Jordan, and one of the largest refugee camps in the world. Life is harsh there, a far cry from the comforts of home refugees left in Syria. The war doesn't discriminate -- people from all walks of life have been forced to leave behind virtually everything they own. Alkadamani says she wants the world to understand that ""the people in those camps are just like you and me."" Khalil also stresses that point. She says Syrian refugees are just normal people -- from doctors to pharmacists to teachers -- with normal lives before the war tore their world apart. You can do something too . Major aid agencies like UNHCR are overwhelmed with the sheer scale of this crisis, so grassroots efforts can play an important role in filling the gaps. Aid organizations also encourage groups to raise cash donations, as they provide the flexibility to meet particular needs by trained relief workers. In all of these ways, individual efforts can make a difference in the face of enormous suffering. It starts with a simple idea -- and the willingness to act.

"(CNN) -- Alec Baldwin is still an actor. He's just no longer in show business. As his one-time ""Orphans"" co-star, Shia LaBeouf, did last winter, Baldwin has given a public statement that he's ready to retire from public life. He does so in an essay told to New York magazine, covering a lot of ground recounting the tumultuous events that led up to this decision. While 2013 wasn't all bad for the 55-year-old star -- the actor and his wife, Hilaria, welcomed their daughter, Carmen, in August -- it also wasn't the best. There was his conflict with LaBeouf on the set of a Broadway production of ""Orphans,"" the death of his friend James Gandolfini, his angry Twitter exchange with a Daily Mail journalist in which he called the writer a ""toxic little queen,"" and then an altercation with a paparazzo in November that led to a domino effect for more criticism and lost work. During that standoff, Baldwin was accused of calling a photographer a ""c**ksucking f*g."" That incident, combined with his Daily Mail dust-up, caused a significant shift in Baldwin's life. ""I'm not a homophobic person at all,"" he says in the New York magazine essay. ""But this is how the world now sees me. I haven't changed, but public life has. ... Now I don't want to be Mr. Show Business anymore."" The former ""30 Rock"" star says he can no longer enjoy New York the way he once did, now that ""everyone has a camera in their pocket,"" combined with the ""predatory photographers and predatory videographers who want to taunt you and catch you doing embarrassing things. (Some proof of which I have provided.) You're out there in a world where if you do make a mistake, it echoes in a digital canyon forever."" As someone who once relished being out in his home base of New York, where people were generally ""very kind"" to him, Baldwin says he's now ""bitter, defensive, and ... misanthropic"" with a distaste for the media that he's never had before. And while he does see the irony in criticizing the media in a magazine, he promises ""this is the last time I'm going to talk about my personal life in an American publication ever again."" Presumably to make good use of this ""last time,"" Baldwin goes on to recount in opinionated detail the conflicts he's faced over the past 12 months, lingering on November's altercation in particular. Although Baldwin's been accused of lobbing an anti-gay slur at the photographer, he claims he never said it. ""I'm self-aware enough to know that I am to blame for some of this. I definitely should not have reacted the way I did in some of these situations,"" the actor says. ""Do I regret screaming at some guy who practically clipped my kid in the head with the lens of a camera? Yeah, I probably do, because it's only caused me problems. But -- I'm sorry, I can't let go of this -- do people really, really believe that, when I shouted at that guy, I called him a 'f****t' on-camera?"" As it would seem from the chilly public reaction, which Baldwin chronicles in his essay, many people definitely do. In the end, that November confrontation appears not only to have cost Baldwin his newly formed talk show at MSNBC but a necessary aspect of his reputation, and particularly in New York. Now, as a result, Baldwin is saying goodbye to ""public life in the way that you try to communicate with an audience playfully like we're friends, beyond the work you are actually paid for."" ""I want to go make a movie and be very present for that and give it everything I have, and after we're done, then the rest of the time is mine,"" he continues. ""I started out as an actor, where you seek to understand yourself using the words of great writers and collaborating with other creative people. Then I slid into show business, where you seek only an audience's approval, whether you deserve it or not. I think I want to go back to being an actor now.""","""I don't want to be Mr. Show Business anymore,"" Alec Baldwin tells magazine .

"(CNN) -- It has been said that a democratic republic such as ours is a do-it-yourself enterprise. People change the course of this country through conversation, debate and, eventually, consensus. As the 2012 elections near, these debates, particularly the upcoming presidential and vice presidential debates, take center stage. In light of what has been a long and tumultuous political season, here are my strongest arguments for Mitt Romney, Rep. Paul Ryan, and fellow conservatives to explain to their fellow Americans why President Barack Obama does not deserve a second term. Obama's handling of the economy: The U.S. is mired in the midst of the worst recovery since the Great Depression: 43 straight months of unemployment over 8%. The unemployment rate when Barack Obama took office was 7.8% and today it is 8.1%. Worse, the labor force is shrinking to record lows. People are giving up looking for work. In August the labor force participation rate fell to 63.5%, its lowest level since September 1981. For men, the August participation rate in the labor force was 69.8%. That's the lowest ever on record. Furthermore, half of all recent college graduates are underemployed or unemployed. Since Obama took office, median household income has declined more than $4,000. More people are on food stamps than ever before -- 46.7 million. The poverty rate is around 15%, the highest since 1993. The average retail price of gasoline has more than doubled under Obama, rising from $1.84 per gallon to more than $3.80 per gallon. In spite of this, he stopped the approval of the Keystone pipeline for further review. Opinion: Obama on world stage -- more hope than change? Obama inherited a bad economy, but his policies have made it even worse. The $800 billion stimulus package failed, according to the standards promised by an Obama administration economist. With Democrats in control of Congress, Obama then spent the next two years of his political capital on health care reform. Subsequently, the nation, mired in a debt crisis, underwent its first-ever credit downgrade. With our national debt exceeding $16 trillion, he has offered no credible plan for the nation's long term fiscal health. Our country is hurtling toward a fiscal cliff in January 2013. Foreign policy: Obama ascended to the presidency promising a new era of American foreign policy. Apart from the killing of Osama bin Laden, the death of Moammar Gaddafi and and the successful expansion of drone strikes, the foreign policy record of this administration has largely been one of capitulation, indecision and weakness. In the first true foreign policy test of his presidency, Obama failed to back the pro-democracy Green Revolution in Iran, saying he didn't want to ""be seen as meddling."" The uprising was crushed. Tell us: Do you know who's getting your vote? When the Arab Spring erupted, the president then decided to meddle in Egypt, calling for Hosni Mubarak to step down. Today, a country that was once a valuable Middle East ally is under the majority control of the Muslim Brotherhood. But when the Arab Spring spread to Syria, a longtime proxy of Iran, he didn't intervene, even when Bashar al-Assad began massacring his own people. The president has given some of our enemies a pass and some of our allies the back of the hand. He was caught on open mic badmouthing Benjamin Netanyahu and hasn't visited Israel once in his presidency. He left our ally Poland out to dry by canceling the missile defense system in Europe, but was heard on an open mic assuring Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he will have ""more flexibility"" after the election to deal with missile defense. America's two most important investments in the Middle East -- Iraq and Afghanistan -- are hanging by a thread. Ignoring the recommendations of his generals, Obama pulled troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan prematurely. Most recently, an American ambassador and three other Americans were killed in Libya. Yet, for nearly two weeks the administration blamed their deaths on a movie before finally admitting it was a terrorist attack, and took too long to make a forceful defense of the First Amendment. Obamacare: President Obama's crowning legislative achievement, whether he likes to admit it or not, is Obamacare. Mitt Romney has promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act and he should make his argument with these reasons: First, Obamacare is not Romneycare. Romneycare was a state mandate; Obamacare was a federal mandate. Second, Obamacare is terrible federal policy. It is a massive tax increase over the next 10 years that will fall largely on middle-class families; it steals more than $700 billion from Medicare to pay for the expanded coverage under ObamaCare; the unelected Independent Payment Advisory Board will ration and control Medicare costs and services without the say of doctors and patients; the Department of Health and Human Services is granted virtually unfettered powers, like the contraception mandate. Obamacare is bad policy. It was over 2,700 pages of complex rules and regulations passed behind closed doors with backroom deals -- exactly the opposite of what Obama promised when he campaigned in 2008. Opinion: Can Romney get back on track? The imperial presidency: Throughout his first term in office, the president has repeatedly ignored or gone around Congress and arrogated his own agenda through executive fiat. He instituted his own version of the Dream Act; his administration granted waivers to welfare reform without the approval of Congress; he refused to help Arizona enforce its immigration laws; he ordered his Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act in court; he gave states waivers to avoid No Child Left Behind requirements; he claimed executive privilege on Operation Fast and Furious to protect the faults of his Justice Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobbaco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF); and when the Senate refused to confirm his nominations to the National Labor Relations Board, he proclaimed the Senate was in recess and appointed them on his own. His own runaway EPA has waged regulatory war on coal plants resulting in the closure of six plants and possible closures of many more. Broken promises: If you think I'm being too hard on the president, let's hold him to his own words and promises. He promised to cut the deficit in half in his first term. He sought in Cairo in 2009 a ""new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world."" He promised to change the ""tone"" of Washington. His economic team promised that his $800 billion stimulus package would keep the unemployment rate under 8 percent. In 2008, he promised to tackle entitlement reform in his first term. Before Obamacare was passed Obama promised to ""cut the cost of a typical family's premium by up to $2,500 a year"" and that ""If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan."" Americans realize the president has over-promised and under-delivered.

"(CNN) -- A private religious school in Texas has denied admission to the daughter of a lesbian couple who wanted to enroll the child in preschool, citing its ""clear teaching of the Christian faith"" for the refusal. In a statement e-mailed to CNN sister network HLN, the dean of St. Vincent's Cathedral School in the Dallas suburb of Bedford, Texas, said the school is standing on its principles ""in matters of marriage and sex outside of marriage"" by refusing to seat 4-year-old Olivia Harrison. ""St. Vincent's School as a ministry of St. Vincent's Cathedral upholds the clear teaching of the Christian faith, the Holy Bible, and the Anglican Church in North America,"" the Rev. Ryan Reed said. ""We based our decisions about enrollment on what is best for the children of St. Vincent's as a whole and in conformity with the above standards,"" he said. ""We regret the disappointment the mother feels, but also do not understand why she would want to enroll her child in a school that would undercut her own personal values at home."" Olivia's mother, Jill Harrison, told HLN's ""Prime News"" that was fine with her. ""I absolutely would not want her to partake in a school where they did not believe or condone the relationship that we have together,"" she said. St. Vincent's is part of a conservative movement that broke away from the U.S. Episcopal Church in 2008, in part over the Episcopal church's positions on gay and lesbian rights. The Anglican Church in North America claims about 100,000 adherents. In a follow-up e-mail, Reed said that the school had no problem with a single mother, ""lesbian or not, living chaste"" -- but said St. Vincent's has taken a hard line in other cases. He said it has rejected an earlier preschool applicant who came from a gay household, fired an unmarried teacher who became pregnant and removed a man ""from leadership roles in the school"" after he left his wife for another woman. Reed said Jill Harrison had told the school's admissions director she was going through a divorce. But Jill Harrison told HLN that she had listed herself as Olivia's mother on the application and put her partner's name down as a mother as well, after scratching out ""father"" on the application. She and her partner, Tracy Harrison, said the school appeared to have no problem with admitting Olivia until after they attended a recent parents' night at the school. Tracy Harrison said she was raised in a strict Baptist home, she and her partner thought St. Vincent's could give Olivia a good education and impart ""the basic Bible teachings ... follow the Golden Rule, the Ten Commandments, be kind to your neighbor."" ""The God that I know and the God that I love will love me and love my children no matter what,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- A lawmaker's remarks at a roast for Sheriff Joe Arpaio made audience members chuckle and applaud. But critics of the controversial Arizona sheriff say they aren't laughing. Comments made by state Rep. John Kavanagh, they say, were racist jokes that used Latinos as the punchline. The tumult comes after the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization that has criticized Arpaio in the past, posted audio recordings from the recent roast on its website. ""Sheriff Joe is the kind of guy that you gotta love, as long as you have papers,"" Kavanagh quips in the recording. ""Going out with Joe is always an adventure,"" he continues, ""because usually when we walk into a restaurant, most of the waitstaff and cooks dive out the back window, and when they don't, I never know what the hell's in my food."" It's comments like that, the law center claims, that show why conservatives have a hard time connecting with Latinos. ""There is a fundamental lack of respect,"" the center said. Kavanagh declined CNN's interview request. But in a written statement, he called the Southern Poverty Law Center's post a personal attack. ""The jokes I made at the Sheriff Joe Arpaio Roast, at his invitation, were satirical comedy. The jokes were not directed at minority group members but at the target of the roast -- Sheriff Arpaio. The jokes were jabs against the sheriff based upon allegations of his department's engaging in racial profiling,"" Kavanagh said. ""The Southern Poverty Law Center edited out selected portions of a much longer roast on many topics not related to racial profiling. The humor was typical of roasts and had I made the same jokes against Sheriff Arpaio at their annual dinner, I suspect that they would have been laughing as much as this audience laughed. Likewise, had these jokes been made on a TV comedy or variety show, there would also be no controversy."" Kavanagh, a Republican, was a major supporter of Arizona's just-vetoed religious freedom bill and also supported its 2010 law cracking down on illegal immigration. The clip posted online included about six minutes excerpted from remarks that lasted around 20 minutes at the roast. In his roast, Kavanagh also joked about Arpaio's age and other topics, including singer Justin Bieber's legal problems. Arpaio, who calls himself America's toughest sheriff, told CNN there's no basis for allegations that Kavanagh is racist. ""It was a roast. John Kavanagh's my friend. I support him. He's not a racist. He's very funny,"" Arpaio said. ""So, he made these comments, I can't speak whether he went too far."" The sheriff accused people criticizing the roast of having a double standard. ""Everybody's talking about him. What about all the activists and the civil rights (groups) that called me Nazi and Hitler? For four years, they've been doing that, on street corners and everywhere else,"" he said. ""Why isn't there an uproar about going after me, calling me every name in the book? Why are they worried about just some roast?"" Last year, a federal court in Phoenix ruled that Arpaio's handling of people of Latino descent was not tough enforcement of immigration laws but instead amounted to racial and ethnic profiling. The judge later ordered a federal monitor to keep tabs on Arpaio's office and make sure officers weren't racially profiling anymore. The monitor was also a subject of jokes during Kavanagh's roast. ""It's OK. I'm not the federal monitor,"" he said. ""How many Hispanics did you pull over on the way over here, Arpaio, huh?"" Arpaio's tough, headline-grabbing punishments have earned him diehard supporters and fiery opponents. He's issued pink underwear to the men detained in the county's jails and said he is saving taxpayers money by removing salt and pepper from prison meals. In January, Arpaio said inmates who allegedly defaced American flags placed in their jail cells would be punished with a diet of bread and water.

"Washington (CNN) -- Get real, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told America on Monday in proposing a scaled back, modern military that would cut the Army to its lowest troop level since before World War II, retire the A-10 ""Warthog"" attack jet and reduce some benefits for fighting forces. ""This is a budget that recognizes the reality of the magnitude of our fiscal challenges, the dangerous world we live in, and the American military's unique and indispensable role in the security of this country and in today's volatile world,"" Hagel said in unveiling the Defense Department spending plan for 2015 and beyond. ""There are difficult decisions ahead,"" he added. ""That is the reality we're living with."" Downsizing due to modernization and budget constraints began under Hagel's predecessor, Robert Gates, and the proposal outlined on Monday described a new phase in the transition. ""Not a war-footing budget"" ""For the first time in 13 years we will be presenting a budget to the Congress of the United States that's not a war-footing budget,"" Hagel said in response to reporters' questions. ""That's a defining budget because it starts to reset and reshape."" Under it, the former senator from Nebraska said the military would become a smaller, more tactical force capable of fighting on one war front and maintaining effective defenses for a second while shifting to more specialized capabilities. ""Our analysis showed that this force would be capable of decisively defeating aggression in one major combat theater -- as it must be -- while also defending the homeland and supporting air and naval forces engaged in another theater against an adversary,"" he said. The proposal endorsed Monday by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey, who appeared with Hagel at the Pentagon news conference, is certain to face strong opposition in Congress -- especially with midterm elections coming up in November. Hagel's budget will be formally proposed next week and legislators from states or districts with major military bases or a heavy presence of contractors are expected to rail against it. In recent years, Republican hawks have battled military force reductions under President Barack Obama's attempts to reduce defense spending as part of overall deficit reduction. Conservative Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a possible GOP presidential contender in 2016, questioned the planned cuts in forces at a time of varying threats and a U.S. shift in emphasis to the Asia-Pacific region, saying it ""does not make strategic sense."" ""It's going to be a far slimmer military,"" noted CNN Military Analyst and retired Maj. Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks, predicting a rough reception in Washington. ""This is the toughest part -- the political part."" Retired NATO commander: It's necessary . Retired Army Gen. George Joulwan, a former NATO supreme allied commander in Europe, said he thought the changes were necessary. ""Whether it's smart or not is yet to be seen. But I think it's necessary to do, given the constraints that we face fiscally within the United States,"" he told CNN. For now, the Pentagon budget for the rest of this fiscal year and for 2015 is about $500 billion for each, as set by a congressional compromise in December. Hagel acknowledged the changes he proposed mean assuming more risk, but said the military would be better situated to respond to the evolving security challenges facing the country. The recommendations in the budget plan for 2015 and ensuing years ""favor a smaller and more capable force -- putting a premium on rapidly deployable, self-sustaining platforms that can defeat more technologically advanced adversaries,"" Hagel said. He added that the proposal includes ""important investments to preserve a safe, secure, reliable, and effective nuclear force."" All military forces, both active and reserve, would be cut under the budget plan. It calls for reducing the Army to a level of 440,000 to 450,000 troops, which would be the lowest total in more than 70 years. At its height, the Army had 570,000 troops after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and currently has about 520,000. According to Hagel, the budget proposal protects funding for cyberwarfare and special operations, and preserves money for the controversial and costly F-35 fighter jet. Warthogs retired? His plan would retire the A-10, which Hagel called a 40-year-old, single-purpose aircraft designed for Cold War operations, at a cost savings of $3.5 billion over five years. Separately, Hagel said 900 additional Marines would be assigned to bolster security at embassies around the world under his proposal. Diplomatic security has received close scrutiny since a terror attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Also, Hagel said the plan envisions increasing special operations forces from 66,000 today to 69,700 in the future to better meet tactical needs of a modern military requiring counterterrorism and crisis response. Other provisions would reduce some benefits for military personnel, resulting in them having to shoulder more of their housing and medical costs. Reducing the federal subsidy to commissaries would mean smaller discounts for groceries on U.S. bases. Through his remarks, Hagel warned that if Congress fails to eliminate planned across-the-board spending cuts beyond 2016, the military reductions would be on a greater scale and significant enough to compromise U.S. national security. Some of those forced cuts, known as sequestration, were eased for this year and next under the budget deal worked out by Congress in December.

"(CNN) -- Here's a record-setting job that qualifies as a ""heavy lift."" On Thursday, workers in Indiana and Kentucky finished sliding a new nearly half-mile-long, 30 million-pound bridge from one set of piers to another, making it the ""longest bridge in North America -- and perhaps the world"" -- to slide laterally into place, according to the Indiana Department of Transportation. The Milton-Madison Bridge spans the Ohio River, linking U.S. 421 between Madison, Indiana, and Milton, Kentucky. Starting Wednesday, workers moved it 55 feet from temporary piers to permanent refurbished piers. High winds across the river forced a delay in the job, until it could be completed the next day. Here's how they did it: Workers placed polished steel sliding plates on top of the refurbished piers. Then, they pulled the bridge from the temporary piers to the refurbished piers with steel cables and eight computer-controlled hydraulic jacks. Bridge geeks call this a steel truss bridge. It measures 2,428 feet long and 40 feet wide. For drivers, it has two 12-foot-wide lanes and shoulders measuring 8 feet. For folks who prefer to walk, officials plan to add a 5-foot-wide sidewalk to the bridge during the coming months. After inspections and and the completion of road connections, the bridge is expected to reopen to traffic in about a week. Deterioration of the 85-year-old original bridge prompted the estimated $131 million project. The old Milton-Madison Bridge was only one of more than a half-million aging bridges nationwide. A report released last year by Transportation for America labeled the bridge ""structurally deficient."" Drivers and passengers expect this critical infrastructure to be safe and reliable every day. How safe is that bridge you're driving over? The average age of all 607,380 bridges in the United States is 42 years, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. About 25% of them are classified as deficient, according to a 2013 report by the Federal Highway Administration. To make all necessary repairs to America's bridges, the federal government estimates that it will cost $76 billion, according to the engineer group.","Workers move new Ohio River bridge into place between Indiana and Kentucky .

"(CNN) -- Mariam Khaowleh moans softly as the nurse gently removes the straw from her raw lips. Her entire body is covered in bandages. Mariam, a Syrian refugee, in her 40s, a mother of four, her wounds not a product of the violence raging in her homeland, but self-inflicted. Mariam's husband, Ahmad al-Daher, peers into the room from behind the glass, shock and sorrow lining his face as he listens to the woman whose smile he fell in love with 24 years ago. ""I chose death, I chose death rather than seeing my children die a million times in front of me,"" she says, speaking to us through the intercom. Only medical staff are allowed inside the room. ""It's hard, it's hard for a mother to want to feed her children. They burned my heart, they burned my heart before they burned my body. I was like an insect to them."" Targeted aid . Mariam's story of frustration, humiliation, desperation mirrors that of countless other refugees. But so deep was her agony that something inside this woman -- described as being strong, eloquent -- must have snapped. Mariam and her family fled to Lebanon from the Syrian city of Homs nearly two years ago. Life as a refugee was hard, making ends meet always a struggle especially putting the children -- aged 13 to 22 -- into school and university. Three of Mariam and Ahmad's four children have a blood disease which makes it difficult to digest certain foods and can lead to hemolytic anemia. The family relied on aid to get by, but about six months ago the UNHCR and World Food Programme conducted a vulnerability assessment and concluded that around 30% of refugees can meet their own needs. That resulted in a targeted aid campaign, and Mariam's family was excluded. There is a process to appeal the exclusion, which Mariam's family says is why she made repeated visits to a UNHCR registration center in Tripoli. ""I went to them over and over, I said you must have made a mistake."" She tells us. ""They lied to me, they mocked me, they shouted at me, get out of here."" ""I said to them if you don't give me anything where am I going to get it from?"" Mariam continues. ""I am going to set myself on fire, how am I going to feed my children? Feel my pain, feel what's in my heart, feel that I have four children."" Mariam torched herself. Eyewitnesses say she arrived outside the registration center, exchanged a few words with someone before dousing herself in gasoline. Within seconds she went up in flames. ""She fell to the ground and just started burning,"" one of the men who runs a food stall recalls. U.N. response . CNN spoke to U.N. personnel at the center and guards outside. They told us Mariam had not been mistreated. Still, the U.N. says it takes these allegations very seriously and is looking into them. Mariam does have a protection file with UNHCR and in January an assessment was done regarding her children's medical condition, but they have no record of her appeal. UNHCR says the family was also offered resettlement into communal housing, which they refused, saying they feared for their daughters' safety among strangers. The U.N. is also following up on the family's eligibility for re-inclusion in the food program and covering all of Mariam's medical costs. ""I am a mother, my children were getting dizzy from the lack of food, one said I can't lift my head, the other said I can't move my legs"" Mariam recalls, regret for her actions compounding her already penetrating physical and emotional pain. ""My heart burns for my children. I hope that God forgives me, I want my voice to reach all the mothers, each person who has a conscience,"" she pleads. ""I want my children to be independent, I worked very hard for their education, I worked a lot in this life for them to be able to reach university."" Ahmad, her husband, wipes his eyes and turns away as she says she doesn't want her children to see her like this. She wants them to remember her the way she was.

"(CNN) -- They thought the tonsil surgery would help her. She feared she'd never wake up. Now, a 13-year-old girl once known for smiling, giggling and dropping off her sister every day at kindergarten lies motionless in a California hospital bed, hooked up to machines that doctors say are the only thing keeping her heart beating. There have been days of prayers and protests for Jahi McMath. There was a fierce court battle as a devastated family fought to keep her on life support and doctors argued she had already died. The case drew national attention and fueled debate. Doctors and a judge have declared her brain dead and said there's no chance Jahi will come back to life. A deadline loomed Monday as a judge had said the hospital could disconnect the machines after 5 p.m. (8 p.m. ET). But shortly before Jahi could have been cut off, that same judge extended his order to 5 p.m. (8 p.m. ET) on January 7. ""This child was sitting on death row,"" said family attorney Christopher Dolan. ""This was a facility that was hell bent on ending this child's life today, and a court stepped in."" Children's Hospital Oakland spokesman Sam Singer said the hospital would comply with the order. Earlier, the girl's family told reporters it had located a facility in New York willing to take Jahi. The Oakland hospital, however, ""refused to agree to allow us to proceed in that matter,"" according to the girl's uncle, Omari Sealey. Attorneys for the family are filing a new complaint in federal court requesting a temporary restraining order and an injunction to prevent the hospital from disconnecting Jahi from life support, he said. They also are filing an appeal with California appellate courts. Asked about the New York facility, Singer said that the hospital has had no ""substantive"" conversations with any such place. It's unclear what will happen next. But one thing is certain, the spokesman said. ""There are no winners in this very tragic case,"" Singer told reporters. Bleeding, cardiac arrest and brain death . Family members say the 8th grader was alert and talking after doctors removed her tonsils, adenoids and extra sinus tissue in a surgery earlier this month. Doctors had recommended the surgery to treat pediatric obstructive sleep apnea, a condition which made her stop breathing in her sleep and caused other medical problems. Before the surgery, Jahi said she was worried that she would never wake up, according to her uncle. She seemed fine after the surgery, but asked for a Popsicle because her throat hurt. It wasn't long before something went terribly wrong. In the intensive care unit, the girl began bleeding profusely -- an image her mother told CNN would be forever seared in her mind. According to family members, Jahi went into cardiac arrest. Days later, she was declared brain dead. Hospital officials have said privacy laws prevent them from discussing details of the case. In court documents and public comments, they've maintained that there's no doubt that McMath is brain dead, describing the condition as irreversible. An independent doctor and a judge supported that conclusion last week. ""No amount of prayer, no amount of hope, no amount of any type of medical procedure will bring her back,"" Singer said Monday. ""The medical situation here in this case is that Jahi McMath died several weeks ago."" Family raises money, searches for answers . But Jahi's family members maintain that they're hoping for a miracle and want to transfer the girl from Children's Hospital Oakland to another facility. The girl's uncle told reporters Monday that Jahi moves when her mother speaks and touches her. Sealey also said that a pediatrician has seen Jahi and has sworn she is not dead. When asked about the girl's possible movement, the hospital spokesman, citing privacy laws, said he would not comment directly on any claims the family makes. However, Singer said it is ""quite common"" for the muscles of brain-dead patients to move, stressing it's ""not a sign of life."" Media reports suggest one earlier treatment location option fell through. The attorney representing Jahi's family did not respond to requests from CNN for comment on the matter. So far the family has raised $27,000 on GoFundMe.com to move her. According to the site, more than 800 people have donated money in three days. When 'life support' is really 'death support' Court document reveals details . Medical ethicists, meanwhile, say the high-profile case fuels a misperception: that ""brain death"" is somehow not as final as cardiac death, even though, by definition, it is. The case is ""giving the impression that dead people can come back to life,"" Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center, told CNN last week . CNN has obtained a copy of a medical report, contained in a court filing, that lays out in extensive detail the testing that supports the hospital's conclusion that McMath has no hope of recovery. The report was prepared by Dr. Paul Fisher, Chief of Pediatric Neurology at Stanford University, who was appointed by Alameda Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo to examine the girl and report his findings to the court. Fisher found that the girl's pupils were fully dilated and unresponsive to light and that she did not respond to a variety of intense stimuli. His report also says McMath showed no sign of breathing on her own when a ventilator was removed: ""Patient failed apnea test."" While the family has referred to Jahi's heart beating, the report says it is only beating because of the mechanical ventilator. In addition, an imaging test showed no blood flow to Jahi's brain, while another showed no sign of electrical activity. Fisher's conclusion: ""Overall, unfortunate circumstances in 13-year-old with known, irreversible brain injury and now complete absence of cerebral function and complete absence of brainstem function, child meets all criteria for brain death, by professional societies and state of California."" Family criticizes hospital . Jahi's family has criticized the hospital's handling of the matter, accusing doctors of pressuring them to disconnect life support. ""We wish to acknowledge that Jahi's case, and our stance regarding her right to life, and her mother's right to make decisions regarding her child, has stirred a vibrant, sometimes polarizing, national debate. This was never our intention,"" the family's statement said. ""We have our strong religious convictions and set of beliefs and we believe that, in this country, a parent has the right to make decisions concerning the existence of their child: not a doctor who looks only at lines on a paper, or reads the cold black and white words on a law that says 'brain dead' and definitely not a doctor who runs the facility that caused the brain death in the first place."" Singer, the hospital spokesman, described the situation Monday as tragic ""by every measure of the word."" ""There has been some limited conversation between the hospital's attorney and the family's attorney, but that's a privileged communication and I have no update on behalf of the hospital at this moment,"" he said, ""other than to say our hearts, our sympathy, go out to this family and the young woman's body on the respirator at this hospital."" When routine surgeries go wrong . CNN's Mayra Cuevas, Cristy Lenz, Janet DiGiacomo, Elizabeth Landau, Dana Ford, Dan Simon, Michael Martinez and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","Move means the hospital cannot disconnect the girl until January 7 .

"(CNN) -- It had all the elements of an irresistible story, but ultimately it was too good to be true. A popular celebrity. Breathless media chronicling his every move. And an affluent Atlanta neighborhood up in arms over a possible new neighbor. Well, two out of three ain't bad. Amid rumors that pop star Justin Bieber was considering a move to Atlanta, the Regular Guys, a morning show on Atlanta radio station Rock 100.5, put together a fake neighborhood group and pulled the wool over the eyes of the world's news organizations. They convinced the media that the newly formed Buckhead Neighborhood Coalition wanted no part of Bieber setting up his new digs in the midst of their old-money mansions. ""The Buckhead Neighborhood Coalition is an organization put together by 'the Regular Guys Show,' "" host Larry Wachs admitted Monday after the show's cast completed its ""protest"" in front of an on-the-market mansion. The Regular Guys' Tim Andrews played the role of Harold White, becoming the face of the fictitious protest, doing interviews with CNN, the BBC and a host of other news outlets. ""@theregularguys show got 33 international media outlets including TMZ to generate 45,000 plus news stories,"" Wachs claimed on air. Andrews, as White, claimed to be a retiree and long-time resident in his interview with CNN. ""We're concerned he'll bring the wrong type of element into a quiet, residential area,"" he said over the weekend. ""It is our position that a person with his means could certainly find a neighborhood more suited to his eclectic lifestyle."" The ploy also included a fake wife he said started a Facebook page to organize the protest. It warned that ""Justin Bieber's relocation to Atlanta can be nothing but bad for our children, as well as the community. Some can't even let their children play in the driveway without fear; he has raced vehicles under the influence, before. What's to say he won't do it again?"" After the mock disgust, the Regular Guys were all smiles on Monday. ""That's a big win,"" Wachs said of the prank. ""That's a huge win."" They marveled at how eager news organizations were to report the story, missing the potential warning signs of new Twitter and Facebook accounts. ""And the great thing was, only one outlet kind of thought it was a troll, and that was Creative Loafing,"" Wachs said. As the prank swirled, no one in Bieber's camp commented on the rumored move, which began with a TMZ report. Still, the very idea of Bieber deciding to make the Georgia capital another home was too good to ignore. There had been numerous Bieber sightings across the Atlanta area: skating rinks, a fast-food restaurant and a nightclub. Add to that, Bieber has had several encounters with law enforcement authorities in recent months. He was recently arrested in Toronto, accused of assaulting his limousine driver in December. He also faces charges of drunken driving, resisting arrest and driving on an expired license after being stopped by police in Miami Beach, Florida, last month. The Los Angeles County district attorney is considering whether to charge Bieber with felony vandalism in the alleged egging of a neighbor's house on January 9.

"(CNN) -- The state visit of the President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins to Britain this week is the culmination of a series of contacts at head of state level over 21 years, the most important of which was the successful State visit by Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh to Ireland in May 2011. I had been surprised to learn, in the spring of 1991, that as the seventh President of Ireland I would become the first to visit Britain as president. It is difficult to believe now but no previous Irish president in the history of the state had traveled to ""mainland"" Britain for official business. There was a problem, for example, with how to describe me. Because of Northern Ireland, the British would not agree to call me ""president of Ireland""! The occasion of my visit was to accept an honorary degree from Cambridge University, conferred by its chancellor, the Duke of Edinburgh and join President Vaclav Havel in London to decide on the logo and values for the Bank for Reconstruction of Eastern Europe. This was one illustration of the fact that relations between the two countries were not normal because of the disputed claims at the time by Britain and Ireland over Northern Ireland. My first meeting with Queen Elizabeth II occurred in May 1993 when she invited my husband Nick and me to take tea in Buckingham Palace. This was neither a ""state visit"" or an ""official visit""; it was a sui generis, carefully orchestrated meeting at head-of-state level between two countries with a troubled past seeking, in a symbolic way, to begin reconciling. We both understood the symbolism of that moment, captured in photographs of the two women heads of state smiling side by side. In 1995 I joined the Queen for an event in St. James Palace, London, commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Queen's Colleges which had been established in Belfast, Cork and Galway (although only Belfast retains that name and original structure). In June 1996 I was honored to be invited on an official visit to Britain by Prime Minister John Major, which included a lunch with Queen and Prince Edward, preceded by an inspection of the guard of honor at Buckingham Palace. That was the most emotional moment for me, standing beside the Queen and hearing the Irish national anthem played. President Mary McAleese had a number of opportunities to strengthen the personal relationship in meetings with Queen Elizabeth during her 14 years as president and ultimately was her host for that memorable state visit in 2011. There is understandable anticipation on both sides of the Irish Sea for the return state visit of Higgins to Britain next week. During and since my presidency of Ireland, a difficult peace process was undertaken and came to fruition. I remember hosting a lunch in my official residence in 1995 for Senator George Mitchell, who had been asked by U.S. President Bill Clinton to help organize an economic conference in Belfast, so that those still fighting in the streets there might begin to think of a future peace dividend. Later Mitchell's role changed to that of an effective mediator at the beginning of the peace process. The Good Friday Agreement was signed during the first year of McAleese's presidency and, being from Northern Ireland, she was able to support in symbolic and diplomatic ways the further progress in establishing peace and shared political power in Northern Ireland. Trade and cultural relations between the two countries intensified during this period, helped by the fact that both countries are members of the European Union and share many common interests. Important amendments were made to the Irish constitution, which requires a referendum of the people, that both permitted the State to comply with the Belfast Agreement and provided for the removal of the ""territorial claim"" contained in Articles 2 and 3. The Northern Ireland referendum, to approve the agreement was held on the same day as the Irish referendum thereby symbolizing that the citizens of the land had the power to realize a change. As the relationships at all levels improved there was a growing pressure for this to be recognized at the highest state level, and we are about to witness the final act in that formal process. In my current work as U.N. special envoy to the Great Lakes in Africa, I am required to be in Rwanda at the time of the state visit next week, marking the 20th anniversary of the terrible genocide in that country. When I can, I will be glued to a television set, hoping to see coverage of a state visit that will evoke many memories and bring about the full normalization of the relations between two close and historic neighbors.

"(CNN) -- The first thing Arsene Wenger may do upon waking these days is pinch himself to check that everything really is as it seems. As if topping the Premier League and progressing in both the Champions League and FA Cup were not enough, the Arsenal manager has now been handed another gift -- a hefty slab of cash. For too many years since he took charge in 1996, Wenger has been financially handcuffed in the transfer market following the strict spending criteria determined by the Arsenal board. But Monday's announcement that the Premier League side and the German kit supplier Puma had signed the largest commercial deal in both companies' history has cast such caution to one side. For the Frenchman can not only invest in the next Mesut Ozil but also shape the Gunners' future for years to come. Coming into effect on July 1, the five-year deal with Puma is worth nearly $250 million according to media reports. ""The money will begin to flow in (in July) and will be available for us to invest in the team,"" Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis told CNN World Sport. The tie-in with Puma ends a 20-year association with rival sportswear company Nike, with Arsenal believing that their new partner can not only give them bespoke attention but also help drive inroads to important ""markets like Asia and the Americas."" As he spoke with a mix of excitement and pride, Gazidis was adamant that Wenger would soon be signing a new contract that would enable him to continue his transformation of Arsenal. ""We have always been committed to Arsene and he's always been committed to the club,"" he said. ""I'm sure Arsene will commit his future to the club, and we will commit ours to his. That will be done at the right time -- quietly -- and then we will let you guys [the press] know."" The coach's contract is set to expire at the end of the season, but Wenger may well put pen to paper on more than just the deal that will continue his 18-year tenure. ""We will invest in not just big-name signings but also right across the club -- in the youth academy, scouting network, facilities,"" Gazidis explained. ""There are a lot of things that go into a football club like this."" Arsenal hopes its relationship with Puma can finally put the Londoners on an equal financial footing with some of Europe's biggest clubs. Arsenal came eighth in the annual money table of the world's richest clubs published last week by business firm Deloitte. But the Gunners' revenue of $384 million was dwarfed by that of Real Madrid, who topped the table for a record ninth consecutive year given the Spanish giants' income of $702 million. Despite lying just three places higher in fifth, even French champions PSG boasted a far greater revenue of $538 million. Famously without a trophy since 2005, Arsenal's fallow period may soon bring forth years of plenty following a phase of reconstruction, albeit one that has not sat too well with the club's fans. Nonetheless, Gazidis believes the times are certainly changing. ""The football landscape has changed dramatically over the last decade and Arsenal has made some difficult decisions along the way to put ourselves in a position to compete in the longer term,"" he added. ""I do think we are now progressing as a football club, making some big steps forward -- both on and off the pitch -- and the off-the-pitch stuff is important to drive what we do on the pitch. ""As we look forward over the next five years, we are very excited about the future of the football club."" Less than eighteen months ago, there were widespread claims that Arsenal -- the longest serving member of England's top flight and a 13-time champion to boot -- had been reduced to a selling club. The clamor of dissent was impossible to ignore in August 2012 as star striker Robin van Persie joined Manchester United, a controversial sale that followed on from those of leading assets Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri among others a year earlier. Fast forward to September 2013 and Arsenal made its greatest statement of intent in over a decade as Ozil was signed from Real Madrid, his transfer fee of $66 million eclipsing the Gunners' previous record outlay by more than $40 million. ""Our goal has been clear -- which is to be one of the leading football clubs in the world -- and we're driving towards that,"" said Gazidis. ""We want to be able to compete with the very best in the game. ""The move to the [Emirates Stadium in 2006] was a critical part of our long term plan but the new commercial partnerships that we are entering into are just as critical."" Meanwhile, Puma now add Arsenal to a portfolio that includes the Italian football federation, Germany's 2013 Champions League runners-up Borussia Dortmund and Jamaican sprint king Usain Bolt.","Arsenal and Puma announce biggest commercial deal in companies' history .

"(CNN) -- Thandi Zulu was single, pregnant and staying at a women's shelter in Houston, Texas, when she received a mysterious letter one day. Single mom Thandi Zulu says she was duped by a work-at-home scam. A company told Zulu that she could make big money working at home in a data-entry job. No résumé or experience was needed. All she had to do was pay a $200 fee. You probably know what happened next. Zulu called the company, gave them her checking account number and then tried to stop herself because she realized that she was doing something stupid. ""The moment I did it, I said 'Damn, this is a scam,' "" Zulu said of her 2001 nightmare. ""I put them on hold, and then I tried to call them back, but nobody was home."" Financial guru Bernard Madoff is grabbing headlines because he is accused of swindling wealthy clients out of $50 billion in a massive Ponzi scheme. But work-at-home scammers are also plundering the paltry savings of ordinary people like Zulu every day. Work-at-home-scams are on the rise, consumer watchdog groups say. Scammers are busier than ever because tough economic times are making people more desperate to make money, says Christine Durst, CEO of Staffcentrix, a company specializing in home-based careers that sifts through home-based job leads every day. iReport.com: Do you have a business at home? Tell us . Durst says people are searching more for home-based jobs to save money on gas, clothing and child care. Seniors are also looking to supplement their dwindling retirement income. Durst says Staffcentrix researchers screen about 5,000 home jobs leads every week, and there is a ""54-to-1 scam ratio."" ""This means that for every 55 [work-at-home] leads we investigate, only one passes our legitimacy standards,"" she said. Work-at-home scammers have traditionally used letters, television commercials and magazine advertisements. But the Internet is becoming their favorite hunting ground, says Karen Hobbs, an attorney with the Federal Trade Commission, the federal agency responsible for consumer protection. ""The Internet is a boon for this industry, because it's a very cheap method for reaching consumers across the U.S. and the world,"" Hobbs said. Catching work-at-home scammers is difficult because they use online facades and fake identities, and they constantly change names and mailing addresses, Hobbs says. Those who are caught, though, can face serious time. One work-at-home scammer was sentenced to 22 months in federal prison last year and ordered to pay $293,619 in restitution, Hobbs says. But many scammers often act as if they're too clever to get caught, Durst says. ""We have over the years engaged in e-mails with them, and frankly, they're quite cocky,"" Durst said. ""It's a craft for them. They really pride themselves on understanding the human psyche."" Be wary of ""palm trees, beaches and bikinis"" A consumer's best defense against these clever predators is to develop their own guile, Durst says. First, they should learn how to spot the warning signs of a work-at-home scammer. Any advertisement that contains the phrase ""work at home"" is immediately suspect, because working at home is not a job title, Durst says. Scammers use that phrase to bait their victims. Other warning signs: You're required to pay a fee for additional information, promises of ""unbelievable pay!"" and claims that no experience is necessary or résumé is needed. Durst also says to watch out for ""palm trees, mansions, beaches and bikinis."" ""If the ad you're looking at features palm trees, a mansion and a Ferrari, it's probably a scam. Successful scammers often bag their prey by dangling enticing things in front of them, much like kidnappers do: 'If you get into my car, I'll give you this candy bar,' "" Durst said. There are other rules people should follow as well: Never forward any money to an ""employer,"" never give personal information like a Social Security or bank account number over the Internet and never agree to cash checks for a percentage under any circumstances, consumer watchdog experts say. Those who think they've been scammed can still get help. They can contact the FTC (http://www.ftc.gov/), the Better Business Bureau or the attorney general's office in their state. Why do people still fall for them? Despite the publicity generated by work-at-home scammers, why do so many people still fall for the scams? Some consumer watchdog groups say it's too simplistic to say that people are gullible. For example, many of the people who say they lost money in Madoff's alleged Ponzi scheme were celebrity actors, writers, wealthy people -- people with abundant smarts.  See some of the celebrities » . Hobbs, from the FTC, says work-at-home scams appeal to that can-do spirit in Americans. ""Americans have an entrepreneurial sprit,"" she said. ""Many people will want to work independently, and they're looking for those opportunities, especially in hard times."" Durst, the CEO of Staffcentrix, cites another reason. ""It's desperation,"" she said. ""It's the same reason people play the lottery: They think today could be their lucky day."" Zulu, the single mom, subscribes to Durst's theory. ""I didn't pay attention,"" she said. ""When you're desperate and you're looking for something, you just go ahead. I was pregnant, and I didn't have a job. I wanted to work at home."" Zulu says she finally found a legitimate job. She moved to Laurel, Mississippi, and now sells medical and dental plans through a company called Ameriplan USA. She even calls people and tells them that they can sell Ameriplan from their own homes. But sometimes she runs into an unexpected problem. ""They don't believe me,"" she said. ""People think we're scammers.""","Single mom Thandi Zulu says she lost $200 in a work-at-home scam .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Scientists have discovered a new species of giant rat in a remote rainforest in Papua New Guinea. The newly discovered rat is similar in size and weight to this one found by scientists in 2007. Measuring 82 centimeters (32.2 inches) from nose to tail and weighing around 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds), the species is thought to be one of the largest rats ever to be found. The discovery was made by a team from the BBC Natural History Unit inside the crater of Mount Bosavi -- an extinct volcano in the Southern Highlands province of Papua New Guinea. ""This is one of the world's largest rats. It's a true rat, the same kind you find in the city sewers,"" said Kristofer Helgen, a biologist from the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, who was part of the expedition team. Initial examinations of the rat -- provisionally named the Bosavi woolly rat -- suggest that it belongs to the Mallomys -- a genus of rodents in the muridae family which are the largest living species of rodent. In 2007, a similar species of giant rat was found in the Foja Mountains in the Papua province of Indonesia in New Guinea Island. The team of scientists which made the new discovery included experts on bats, birds, mammals and reptiles found a number of new species. George McGavin, a Research Associate at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and The Department of Zoology of Oxford University told CNN: ""It's hard to be sure exactly how many new species we have found, but it is more than 30. ""To find new species of insects in this region isn't uncommon, but we found sixteen new frog species, one new bat species and at least three new fish, and this giant bloody rat -- the size of a cat. Amazing!"" McGavin said the inside of the crater -- which he says measures around three kilometers in diameter -- was spectacular. ""The animals inside this crater were unafraid of humans, pretty much because they hadn't seen them very much,"" McGavin said. Most local inhabitants, McGavin explained, tend to hunt outside the crater. ""They don't really go into the crater to hunt because it's such a trek up and back down from it."" The newly discovered rats aren't the world's largest rodent species. Native to South America, capybaras -- which look more like hairy pigs than rats -- weigh in at around 55 kilograms and can be up to 1.5 meters long. McGavin and the team spent six weeks in the region investigating species. During that time it became abundantly clear to the team just how endangered these habitats are. ""What we are trying to do,"" said McGavin, ""is highlight the fact that these habitats are terribly threatened. In fact, only 20 miles away from where we were the wood was being extracted."" Research published in the journal Biotropica in June 2008 estimated that over a quarter of Papua New Guinea's forests had been either destroyed or damaged between 1972 and 2002. ""Humans can't seem to agree on anything, but we should at least agree that forest habitats like this one should be conserved; not only because 80 percent of the world's species live in forests, but if we are going to avoid the worst affects of global warming we've got to keep these forests,"" McGavin said. Next March, the team is traveling to Bhutan in search of more new species.","Scientists find new species of giant rat in rainforests of Papua New Guinea .

"Washington (CNN) -- Shortly after Kathleen Sebelius was tapped to carry out President Barack Obama's signature health care reform effort, the head of Health and Human Services found herself in the crosshairs of Republicans determined to repeal the law. The two-term Kansas governor-turned-Obamacare-chief-defender is resigning as health secretary. She's leaving after a problem-plagued rollout of HealthCare.gov, the federal website portal critical to the law's implementation, but with the administration taking a victory lap after unexpectedly reaching and then exceeding its sign-up target of 7 million. Obamacare hits 7.5 million sign-ups, Sebelius says . A tweet by David Axelrod, former senior adviser to Obama, perhaps best sums up the tension Sebelius faced as she tried to navigate implementing the controversial law familiar as Obamacare. ""When all is said and done, Sebelius has lots to be proud of including the surprisingly strong finish on exchange signups after a rocky start,"" Axelrod wrote. That sentiment is ""a little passive aggressive,"" said Ryan Lizza, a CNN political commentator. ""They want the message to be: blame Sebelius with the problems with Obamacare especially as they go into a midterm election where this is going to be a big issue. I think that's a little unfair to her."" It wasn't always this way. She once was seen as a Democratic Party rising star when she was tapped to deliver the Democratic response to President George W. Bush's final State of the Union address. She was the Midwestern girl whose political blood ran blue but flourished in a red state. Her father was a former Democratic governor of Ohio. She was a fan of NASCAR and college sports, running and the Rolling Stones. She ran for the governor's office with promises to improve government efficiency and create a more business-friendly climate within the state. She navigated a judicial order to boost school spending during a time when her state was facing one of its worst budget crises since the Great Depression. She was also able to help lead the state to an economic recovery and lower unemployment, according to the state's website at the time. In 2008, Newsweek magazine called her ""one to watch"" and Time magazine dubbed her one of four ""rising stars from the heartland,"" and put on the short list as one of the country's five best governors. Democratic blogger Markos Moulitsas in 2006 predicted on his Daily Kos Web site that Sebelius would be on the shortlist for vice president on the party's ticket. He also gave her kudos for wooing frustrated Kansas Republicans. She wasn't Obama's first choice to head Health and Human Services -- Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota was forced to withdraw over a controversy with his tax records and questions about work some considered lobbying. It was hoped that her background as someone who worked across the aisle could help Obama as he set about the herculean task of health care reform. Despite an initial controversy over what she called ""unintentional errors"" in tax returns and pushback from both pro-life and pro-choice advocates, she sailed through Senate confirmation on a 65-31 vote. GOP senator: Sebelius the 'laughingstock of America' As the Affordable Care Act neared implementation, she faced increasing scrutiny from Republican members of Congress who wanted to forestall Obamacare's momentum. That pressure and criticism only increased after the mandate became law in 2010 without Republican support. She, her agency and the administration faced blistering criticism about the law's legality -- challenges that were decided by the Supreme Court. She was routinely grilled at congressional hearings about whether the law could be implemented on time, was financially sustainable and if the administration would hit enrollment targets. And she was hammered in hearings over the Web portal's disastrous roll out in October. HHS chief: President didn't know of Obamacare website woes beforehand . There were calls for her resignation from a number of House Republicans and several senators amid the HealthCare.gov debacle. Obamacare enrollment eventually exceeded its target of 7 million -- but not without a last-minute surge in the days before the deadline in March. And senior administration officials say Sebelius told the President last month that it would reach its goal and that would be a good time for her to go. The Obama official said Sebelius' decision to leave had little to do with the initial uproar over the website. A White House official praised her overseeing ""one of the most consequential initiatives of this administration"" as well as her efforts to ""improve children's health, expand mental health care, reduce racial and ethnic disparities, bring us closer to the first AIDS-free generation and promote women's health."" Republicans paid her backhanded compliments. ""She had an impossible task: nobody can make Obamacare work,"" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor tweeted. Obama acknowledged the botched rollout of the enrollment website under Sebelius' watch. ""She's got bumps. I've got bumps, bruises,"" he said on Friday. But ""the final score speaks for itself."" But some see the administration's handling of Sebelius' departure as damning with faint praise. ""I mean, this is one of those classic Washington dances where the administration praises the person but the at the same time you want the message to sort of suddenly be that we weren't so happy with what she did and this -- and we couldn't of course get rid of her when the website was a disaster, right,"" Lizza said. Members of her party back in her home state told the Kansas City Star they were stunned by Sebelius' move but could well understand her motivation. ""I think she has had the toughest job in Washington over the past four years,"" Jim Slattery, a former congressman and U.S. Senate candidate, told the paper. ""She has done a good job under the worst possible circumstances you can imagine."" Sebelius told the Star in an interview on Thursday that she always knew she would not ""be here to turn out the lights in 2017."" During Friday's event, where Obama also nominated her successor, Sebelius stood next to the President. And she described her time as health secretary as ""the most meaningful work I've ever been a part of."" She leaves the job in May. CNN's Jim Acosta, Jake Tapper and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Sebelius became the face of Obamacare's rocky roll out .

"(CNN) -- Three months after a thyroidectomy to remove cancer and one month after radioactive iodine to treat it, Julie Seitz found herself in an operating room again, this time for a lumpectomy to remove breast cancer. Seitz's prognosis was good, although doctors said she would need radiation. She's not alone: Fifteen percent to 20% of people diagnosed with cancer are diagnosed with a second cancer, according to Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society. However, he says, it's unusual for those diagnoses to happen simultaneously. Seitz's diagnoses came after she sought a second look. She heeded the recommendation to follow up for a spot on her thyroid even though she was told it was probably nothing, and then she was insistent after being given an all-clear following a mammogram. In both cases, Seitz, 51, of Atlanta, followed her instincts, and she was right. One patient advocate applauds that. ""She moved the bar in her own favor by being proactive and trusting her intuition,"" said Trisha Torrey, who was not involved in Seitz's case. ""I have a high-demand job,"" said Seitz, director of Workplace 2020 Global Business Services for Coca-Cola. ""This is like a second job, and no one else is going to do the research."" Her thyroid spot was seen during an annual physical. Even though doctors told her it probably wasn't cause for concern, Seitz followed up with an endocrinologist four months later and underwent a biopsy. A week later, she got a call saying that it was probably cancer and that doctors would know for sure after surgery to remove it. Her philosophy: tackle cancer and move on, she says. She had a thyroidectomy. ""It was the easiest surgery ever. The next day, I was on a plane going somewhere for work with a bandage and wearing scarves,"" she said. Eight weeks later, she had radiation iodine treatment: She took a radioactive pill and stayed isolated in her house for a week and then limited outings for another week. Two weeks before she took the pill, she felt something unusual during a breast self-exam and asked about it during her scheduled mammogram a week or so later. She got an all-clear but didn't trust it and went in for an ultrasound. The radiologist sent her for a biopsy, which confirmed that she had breast cancer. Once again, she geared up to tackle the disease. ""It's another specialty, and you start over from scratch,"" she said. After her lumpectomy, Seitz had 25 days of radiation. Now, she takes medication for both cancers. Seitz offeres this advice about taking charge of your care: . Ask your medical network . When looking for a surgeon to remove her thyroid, Seitz asked everyone from her dentist and orthodontist to her gynecologist. ""It doesn't matter what their specialty is. They all know each other, and I've learned you have to ask multiple doctors,"" she said. Instead of asking them ""Who should I go to?"" Seitz asked, ""If you were in this situation, who would you go to?"" She got a list of about nine names when looking for a surgeon for her thyroid and chose the doctor whose name was recommended four times. She followed this same procedure before her breast biopsy. Brawley recommends casting a wider net, including anyone in the health care field. ""The nurses who work in the ORs at hospitals, they know who the best surgeons are. These are not necessarily those who rank in the lists of best doctors,"" he said. Give a deadline . The first time Seitz visited her oncologist, she explained that she and her husband were leaving on an African safari, their ""trip of a lifetime,"" the first week in August. Seitz wanted to mark her 50th birthday by going somewhere new. She told her oncologist she had to be better by then. Her last radiation treatment was 10 days before her flight to Africa, which gave her time to recover before takeoff. Doctors may not have a deadline, she says. ""If I have something else happening, I am going to find a reason to give them a deadline, because things happen much quicker."" Don't rely 100% on mammograms . Even if they must pay for it out of their own pocket, Seitz recommends that women undergo a mammogram every other year, along with an ultrasound. If you feel something or there is any uncertainty about the scan, she says, insist on an MRI instead of a second mammogram. Things would have turned out differently, she says, if she had accepted her clear mammogram report and not insisted on an ultrasound. The American Cancer Society recommends annual mammograms for women starting at age 40. Brawley agrees that mammograms are not foolproof but cautions that ultrasound and MRI screenings are meant to get a better look at something, not to replace a mammogram. Have a positive attitude . Seitz decided right away that she would not let her diagnosis dominate her life. She focused on the things she enjoys in life and maintained her daily routine. ""I thought, if I stop and change my routine, I give this thing more power,"" she said. There's no doubt that having a positive attitude helps in terms of quality of life, Brawley says. The jury is still out on whether it prolongs life. Stay off the Internet . ""If ever you are diagnosed with something, never read the Internet,"" Julie concluded after spending an afternoon reading some websites about thyroid cancer before her surgery. ""It was negative; it was horrible; it was pitiful. I said, 'No, I am not going to be like these people.' It was pretty depressing, and I just decided no, this is not who I am. I never conquered anything in my life this way, and it's not going to be this either."" Though Brawley says it's an individual decision, he says people should be careful about where they seek information online and ensure that it's a reputable source such as the National Cancer Institute. When, not if . Seitz believes that a sea change is needed on how cancer is viewed: People should think of it as ""You are going to get cancer, so how can you stay on top of tests and getting checked and getting monitored so you are diagnosed earlier?"" Most cancers are curable at stage 1 or 2. Torrey says this preventive approach applies not just to cancer to but to all illnesses and conditions. ""You're going to catch something, and you have to be prepared,"" she said. Meanwhile, Seitz says, don't put off fun. ""Don't wait to retire to do all the fun things you want to do.""","Julie Seitz was diagnosed nearly simultaneously with thyroid and breast cancer .

"(CNN) -- Less than a day after officially concluding 12 tumultuous years as mayor, Michael Bloomberg sat stone-faced in the front row at the inauguration of his liberal successor, Mayor Bill de Blasio, as one speaker after another made blistering, thinly veiled attacks on Bloomberg's legacy. The Rev. Fred Lucas, one of the clergymen who delivered the opening invocation, asked God to turn ""the plantation called New York City"" into a better place. Actor Harry Belafonte used his turn at the podium to call for an end to what he called the city's ""deeply Dickensian justice system."" And the newly elected public advocate, Letitia James, ticked off a litany of criticisms of Bloomberg's police, education and economic policies. The attacks, which dominated an inauguration ceremony that is normally a celebration of municipal unity, jarred many observers. ""As outside observer, hard to understand the bitter partisanship at De Blasio ceremony,"" noted an Israeli journalist on Twitter. ""There's a time for everything, and this isn't it."" Things got so heated that, an hour into the event, former President Bill Clinton, who administered the oath of office to de Blasio, tried to reset the tone by offering the first praise of Bloomberg, noting that the departing mayor ""leaves the city stronger and healthier than he found it."" De Blasio himself departed from his prepared speech to ask the crowd to applaud Bloomberg. The criticism was partly a matter of political overreach: Polls suggest that a majority of New Yorkers, while ready to turn the page on the Bloomberg years, also think the city is on the right track. Forty-nine percent approve of what Bloomberg did for the city, including innovative programs aimed at low-income residents. But over the years, Bloomberg -- a Wall Street veteran and a multibillionaire with a chilly managerial style -- became an irresistible target for those who decry the gap between rich and poor. At a time when homelessness in New York has soared to a record-high 50,000 people (PDF) sleeping in city shelters every night, Bloomberg's habit of jetting off to a home in Bermuda on weekends was fodder for criticism from opponents. The same was true of Bloomberg's free-spending ways: One conservative estimate places Bloomberg's spending on his campaigns and other political efforts at an eye-popping $650 million from his personal fortune, overwhelming liberal Democratic challengers in 2001, 2005 and 2009. It was easy for liberal politicians to point the finger at Bloomberg as a symbol of inequality, but as de Blasio will soon discover, the issue won't vanish with the Bloomberg administration. Slate business correspondent Matthew Yglesias has wisely suggested that progressives not get too giddy over what the de Blasio equality agenda can deliver in the foreseeable future. ""Everyone should take a deep breath or two,"" he wrote in August. ""Economic inequality is a serious issue and municipal governance is a serious matter, but the fact is that the two have relatively little to do with each other."" Poverty has bedeviled New York and other cities for centuries, and mayors have scant power to affect broad trends like the decline of manufacturing, the loss of low-skilled jobs to foreign countries and the destruction of jobs by automation and the information revolution. But New York's newly-elected mayor won last November on a campaign promise to use the power of government to attack yawning gaps of wealth and income between rich and poor. Even before taking office on New Year's Day, de Blasio began ratcheting up the rhetoric, explicitly positioning his new administration as a place the rest of the nation should watch for clues about how to address economic inequality. On Wednesday he told the inauguration crowd, ""We are called to put an end to economic and social inequalities that threaten to unravel the city we love.""

"(CNN) -- Even if you're a real nowhere man living under the sea in an octopus's garden, you probably already know that 50 years ago (February 9, 1964, to be exact) the Beatles kicked off Beatlemania in the United States with their first appearance on ""The Ed Sullivan Show."" The Fab Four's subsequent globetrotting blazed a trail that, half a century later, remains worth following. Particularly if you can avoid an overload of gratuitous Beatles song titles along the way. Here are some of the world's best places to relive the original magical mystery tour. 1. Liverpool, England . The city where it all started has traded heavily on the Beatles as part of efforts to transform itself from a declining industrial seaport into a tourism and cultural destination. Mercifully it works. Obvious attractions include the well-executed Beatles Story (Britannia Vaults, Kings Dock Street, +44 151 709 1963); the reconstructed Cavern Club (10 Mathew St., +44 151 236 9091); and tours that hit childhood homes and lyricized locations such as Penny Lane. These are balanced by non-Beatles attractions. The city has impressive Anglican and Catholic cathedrals, the iconic ferry across the River Mersey, the Tate and Walker art galleries and the wonderful (and free) waterfront Museum of Liverpool. The latter of these pays homage to the city's maritime heritage and a musical legacy that goes far beyond John, Paul, George and Ringo. 2. Hamburg, Germany . Lured by the prospect of regular paychecks, the embryonic Beatles packed their guitar cases for Hamburg in 1960. Here they refined their act and lineup during several seasons of relentless gigging in front of indifferent crowds in grimy nightclubs. Fans can take tours or simply explore Reeperbahn, a seedy-in-places district of brothels and nightspots where the band played several venues during their time here. The Kaiserkeller (36 Grosse Freiheit, +49 40 317 778) is among the most famous. Modern Hamburg is a vibrant source of new, mainly electronic, music and nightlife. Like Liverpool, it has a distinctive church, the baroque St. Michaelis (Englische Planke 1, +49 40 376 780) and a museum exploring the city's maritime past (Peter Tamm Sen. Stiftung Kaispeicher B Koreastrasse 1, +49 40 30 092 300). 3. Rishikesh, India . By 1966 the Beatles were experimenting -- musically and pharmaceutically. Their altered outlook took them to Rishikesh, in northeast India's Himalayan foothills, to attend the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, an Indian guru who developed and taught transcendental meditation. These days the ashram, which once overlooked the Ganges, is closed and is slowly being reclaimed by vegetation. But Rishikesh, an important Hindu center, remains open for business -- billing itself as India's leading destination for yoga and adventure sports, although probably not at the same time. Proximity to Delhi makes it a good escape from the Indian capital for some whitewater rafting or a stay at one of its many yoga ashrams (among them Parmath Niketen, +91 135 243 4301). Not a precisely Beatles experience, but in the world of transcendental meditation, close is sometimes all you get. 4. London . The Beatles lived and worked at various venues in the English capital (yes, there are tours), but few locations have as much of a connection with the band as Abbey Road Studios (3 Abbey Road, near St. John's Wood tube station). The Fab Four recorded several albums here, including 1969's ""Abbey Road,"" which features a hirsute Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr striding over the nearby pedestrian crossing. There's no public access to the studios, which still host top music acts. But that hasn't stopped thousands of visitors scrawling their names on the building's boundary wall or halting traffic to recreate the famous crossing image. As a bonus, McCartney still lives nearby, and sightings aren't unknown. 5. Amsterdam . Newlyweds John Lennon and Yoko Ono began their 1969 honeymoon with a highly publicized ""bed-in"" at the Amsterdam Hilton (Appollolaan 138, +31 710 6000), where they invited the press into their room to promote ""bed peace"" and ""hair peace."" The room is now known as the ""John and Yoko suite"" and can be reserved by guests. The couple wound up in the Dutch capital after their own mini-tour of Europe. They'd tried to marry on a ferry across the English Channel (P&O run a regular service, but still no weddings) before succeeding in Gibraltar -- a fact the British territory continues to celebrate thanks to the number of international weddings it now hosts. 6. Obertauren, Austria . After Amsterdam, John and Yoko zipped down to Vienna for another peace-based press conference, this time in the city's luxury Sacher hotel (Philharmonikerstrasse 4, +43 1 514 560) -- until then famous only for giving the world a preposterously rich chocolate cake. This wasn't Austria's first brush with the Beatles. In 1965, the band decamped to the charming central Austrian ski resort of Obertauern to film snow scenes for their movie ""Help!"" The band stayed at the Hotel Eidelweiss, the modern incarnation (RÃ¶merstrasse 75, +43 6456 7245) of which avoids any mention of the Beatles on its website, although it does depict them in what appears to be the men's toilets. 7. New York . Lennon had wanted to take his bed-in to New York, but was prevented from setting foot in the United States at the time due to a previous conviction for cannabis possession. He and the Beatles, however, paid several other significant visits to the city. First there was the historic February 9, 1964, television appearance at the now-named Ed Sullivan Theater (1697 Broadway, +1 212 975 4755). More history was made several days later when The Beatles became the first rock band ever to play Carnegie Hall (881 7th Ave., +1 212 247 7800). The band returned to play New York the following August, but that trip was eclipsed a year later when they performed at Shea Stadium in Flushing Meadows. This is believed to be rock and pop music's first-ever stadium gig. Shea was torn down in 2008 to provide parking space for the New York Mets' new Citi Field (123-01 Roosevelt Ave., +1 718 507 6387), but there are plenty other non-Beatles attractions nearby, particularly the space age relics of two World Fairs (Grand Central Parkway, +1 718 760 6565). John Lennon, of course, later lived and was killed in New York outside his residence at the Dakota Apartments (corner of 72nd Street and Central Park West in Manhattan). Along with the Dakota, the adjacent Strawberry Fields (near Central Park West between 71st and 74th Streets) is a 2.5-acre area of Central Park that pays homage to Lennon. 8. The Bahamas . Another double-hit destination for Lennon, who flew here with Yoko on the next stage of his bed tour, but swiftly left after checking into the Sheraton hotel in Freeport (now unlisted), reportedly declaring: ""We can't do a bloody bed-in here. Let's go to Canada."" More successful was Lennon's 1965 visit to the islands with the other Beatles, again to film scenes for ""Help!"" The band stayed at the Balmoral Club, a hotel on Nassau's Cable Beach now renamed the Sandals Royal Bahamian (West Bay Street, Nassau, +1 242 327 6400). They filmed scenes on Paradise Island, now home to the Atlantis resort (+1 888-877 7525), and Rose Island, an uninhabited private island popular for day trips and wedding parties. 9. Montreal . And so, at last, to John and Yoko's final bed-in venue: the Queen Elizabeth hotel in Montreal (900 Rene Levesque Blvd. W., +1 866 540 4483). Here the couple commandeered four rooms and invited friends including LSD fan Timothy Leary and Beat poet Allen Ginsberg to join them recording ""Give Peace a Chance."" According to the hotel's website, Lennon has since been followed to the Queen Elizabeth by other sometime peaceniks, including Nelson Mandela, U.S. president Jimmy Carter, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and the Dalai Lama. 10. Chelyabinsk, Russia . OK, the Beatles never actually visited this tank-producing Russian city east of the Ural Mountains, but that didn't stop the citizens of Chelyabinsk taking the Fab Four to their hearts. Even though few in the Soviet Union were able to buy or listen to Beatles songs at the height of the Cold War, many drew inspiration from a band that was later credited with hastening the demise of communist rule -- even if their classic ""Back In the U.S.S.R."" was more about girls than politics. Post-Soviet Chelyabinsk has repaid the favor by changing the name of a street from Lenin to Lennon. Lately, however, Chelyabinsk is obsessed with a new star -- or falling star, in the shape of the huge meteorite which smashed into the region last year. Reports say the city hopes thousands of tourists will be attracted by this asteroid from -- sorry, it can't be helped -- ""Across the Universe."" Barry Neild is a freelance journalist based in London.","From India to the Bahamas, Beatles pilgrimages remain popular .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- The students in Alita Richard's art class at Mcdonough Elementary School #42 work diligently, quietly with a laser-like focus. Schoolchildren create whatever they choose to decorate the ""Fundred Dollar Bills."" What kid doesn't like to draw, especially given a great deal of freedom to choose his or her own subject? They are creating Fundred Dollar Bills. Think of a five-dollar bill, and instead of Abe Lincoln's face the students create whatever they choose to fill in the oblong space. This fake money has a very real purpose. Mel Chin, a conceptual artist from New York, dreamed up the idea as a unique way to fund an extensive effort to clean up the dirt in New Orleans. ""I came to New Orleans after Katrina to try to help like many people, and I began to discover problems that preceded Katrina, "" Chin said. ""The problem specifically is lead in the soil at such high levels that it threatens people that live within 86,000 properties within the city of New Orleans."" A couple of things are important there. It is a problem that pre-dates the punishing effects of Katrina, and it is so widespread it threatens land that covers a great deal of the city. Some of the lead came from exhaust belched by old cars back before the days of unleaded gasoline. Some comes from factory emissions. But a lot of it comes from old lead-based paints that were used on homes. ""And, what has happened is these particles have floated around and have ended in the soil,"" Chin says. ""The soil is now the sink and the source of the lead, and our specific project, 'Operation Paydirt,' is to transform that threat."" Chin quotes a host of medical studies that show ingesting lead can lead to horrific health problems, especially for the young. ""Because lead is readily absorbed, it goes to the brain and the blood, and the bones of a child,"" he says. ""It affects mental capacities. It creates aggressive tendencies."" Kids play in dirt. They track into houses. Inadvertently they wind up ingesting a certain amount of dirt. Parents may not like it, but it's what kids do. Effects are especially tough on children from birth until they turn about three -- the time, doctors say, the brain is developing. ""The levels are much higher than the allowable levels that have been set by the EPA,"" Chin said. That's the problem. The traditional solution to deal with lead in soil has been to simply dump clean dirt on top of the contaminated dirt. That only covers up the problem. And, in a city like New Orleans, it is unrealistic to think you can find enough fill-dirt to adequately deal with widespread contamination. Working with soil scientists Chin found out about a different way to combat lead in the dirt. Researchers have discovered that by mixing a low-level calcium phosphate in contaminated soil, it basically neutralizes the harmful effects of lead, cadmium and other harmful metals. ""That is why 'Operation Paydirt' is promising. It wants to be transparent. It wants to deliver the message that there's a problem,"" Chin said. ""It wants to deliver the solution to that problem.""  Watch how ""Operation Paydirt"" works » . Dr. Andrew Hunt, a soil scientist at the University of Texas in Arlington, says it doesn't take the lead out of the soil, but the phosphate allows the contaminants to pass relatively harmlessly through the body. As you might guess, this solution doesn't come cheaply. It is estimated it will cost about $300 million to add phosphates to the soil. And that brings us full-circle back to the Fundred Dollar Bills. Chin wants to create $300 million worth of Fundred Dollar Bills. ""And then we'll take all the bills to Congress, where we will ask for an even exchange of 300 million real dollars,"" Chin said. He has a Web site called Fundred.Org and anyone can go on and create a Fundred Dollar Bill and send it in. The conceptual artist has what he calls a Safehouse in the 8th Ward, in a neighborhood called St. Roch. The building really looks like a safe. The walls are adorned with Fundred Dollar Bills, some coming from celebs like Uma Thurman. But most, the talkative artists says, came from schoolchildren. ""We go to schools because that's where children are,"" Chin said. ""And since lead compromises educational capacities, we felt that was appropriate."" Chin has a long way to go. But he is passionate. And he is convinced that as more people tune in to the idea of Fundred Dollar Bills, they will agree it's the best way to clean up the dirt.","Lead in New Orleans' dirt is at dangerously high levels .

"(CNN) -- They were tears of pride, of relief, but most of all, tears that marked the end of Phil Mickelson's 22-year battle to conquer the greatest test in the game of golf. The wind, the weather, the firm ground, the prohibitive rough -- all components of nature that make links golf one of the biggest challenges to any player. Until the final Sunday of the 142nd British Open at Muirfield, Mickelson didn't know if he had in his locker all the elements to suppress Scotland's elements. But the emphatic answer came in a frenzied final few hours of the championship, a blizzard of birdies propelling 'Lefty' towards his fifth major title, and the sweetest of his career to date. Surging through the field with four birdies in the final six holes he cast aside the likes of 14-time major winner Tiger Woods and Masters champion Adam Scott to conclude a journey that began on the links of Lancashire in England back in 1991. At the 20th time of asking, the British Open crown was his. ""Winning this Open Championship -- the tournament that has been the most elusive and the most difficult for me to play my best in -- is probably the greatest accomplishment of my career,"" he told CNN World Sport. ""It's special to be part of the Championship, to be on the Claret Jug, to have won this tournament. Muirfield is a special golf course, a very demanding test, but all Open courses are demanding. ""Any win here is special because the links style of golf is so unique and to finally break through and conquer links golf is a great accomplishment for me and my career."" Resilience has been a steadfast theme in Mickelson's make up throughout his time as a professional. Just five Sundays ago Mickelson suffered the heartbreak of yet another second-placed finish in the only major championship that continues to elude him -- the U.S. Open. It was the sixth time he'd finished runner-up in the tournament and he left the viciously difficult Merion course distraught that England's Justin Rose had beaten him by one shot. But after stewing on yet another near miss for a few days, he resolved to work even harder on his game, the fruits of which poured forth on the course beside the Firth of Forth. ""Part of golf is dealing with failure, dealing with losing,"" he explained moments after conducting his first press conference as British Open champion. ""The U.S. Open was a very difficult loss for me because it was a tournament that I've wanted to win so badly throughout my career. I've come so close and to let it slide at Merion was a huge disappointment. ""But after a few days of sulking I was able to reassess and see that I was playing some of the best golf of my career and that I didn't want to let a tournament that got away affect these future events. ""I used it as a motivating factor to work a little harder and get ready for these upcoming majors."" Mickelson's dozen . It was a sensational final half dozen holes that catapulted Mickelson into the lead, a run that none of the other contenders could match. By the time he reached the 17th the 43-year-old knew the championship was in his sights and two shots he described as ""screaming bullets"" helped him land a fatal blow on his rivals. Playing at 575 yards, and into the wind, Mickelson struck two perfect three woods, to roll his second onto the green, take two putts for a regulation birdie putt and clasp one hand on the Claret Jug. ""I've been playing some of my best golf these last few months, striking the ball better than I ever have,"" he added. ""But there are two areas of my game that have really changed. One is putting -- you saw today -- I'm putting the best I've ever putted in my career, I'm making everything. ""The second is driving the ball off the tee. I have a club now -- a three wood -- I hit long and I hit it straight. ""On 17 I hit two three woods where not many people are getting there in two -- these screaming bullets down the middle of the fairway when I had to hit the fairway -- then onto the green for an easy two-putt birdie. ""It's what won me this British Open and it's what's giving me a chance to compete and contend in these big events now because I'm able to get the ball on the fairway without any of the problems I've had in the past."" Team Mickelson . After another birdie on the final hole, the emotion that Mickelson had been wrestling with in the closing stages poured out, as he embraced long-time caddy Jim 'Bones' Mackay. And he paid tribute to the team around him, and his family, after a triumph that enshrines his name amidst 142 years of Open history. ""I'm really lucky to have such special people in my life,"" he said. ""Bones is Bones, he's the best at what he does and to have him my entire career, I'm so lucky. ""And then to have a life partner like Amy and to have three healthy children, to have those people in my life makes moments like this even more fulfilling to be able to share it with them.""","American Phil Mickelson has waited 22 years to win the British Open .

"(CNN) -- Adam Scott, bidding to become just the second man in more than two decades to win the Masters in back-to-back years, kicks off his title defense in the company of Jason Dufner and Matthew Fitzpatrick. Scott, who downed Angel Cabrera in a second playoff hole in 2013, and Dufner share at least one thing in common: They won their opening majors last year. In Scott's case, it ended years of near misses at golf's biggest events. The famously laid-back Dufner -- ""Dufnering"" is a phenomenon -- captured the PGA Championship about four months after Scott became the first Australian to wear the famous green jacket and 19-year-old Fitzpatrick has earned a reputation, too. Last August he became the first Englishman to claim the U.S. Amateur Championship in more than 100 years. They begin round 1 at Augusta at 10:41 a.m. local time Thursday. Scott, the highest-ranked golfer in the field because of Tiger Woods' absence, has already been on the course this year, playing a round with his father last week. ""No doubt he had a great time,"" Scott was quoted as saying by the Golf Channel. ""And so did I."" Scott, according to British bookmaker William Hill, is the joint favorite with former No. 1 Rory McIlroy, who starts alongside Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed 11 minutes after Scott. Phil Mickelson, Ernie Els and Justin Rose -- who own a combined 10 majors -- are the second-last trio to get underway, at 1:48 p.m. on Thursday. Three-time Masters champion Mickelson enters the tournament under an injury cloud, pulling out of the Texas Open with a side injury late last month.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- A 32-year-old man was arrested and charged Friday in the beating of two New York Rangers fans outside a landmark restaurant after the Winter Classic hockey game on January 2. Dennis Veteri, of Glassboro, New Jersey, is charged with aggravated and simple assault, conspiracy and recklessly endangering another person, according to the Philadelphia district attorney's office. Veteri turned himself in after an arrest warrant was issued and was arraigned shortly after 2 a.m., according to Philadelphia police. The brawl occurred outside Geno's Steaks about an hour after the New York-Rangers Philadelphia Flyers game at the Wells Fargo Center. It was caught on video and posted on YouTube. Police are still looking for additional alleged assailants. The video showed two males in Rangers jerseys being punched and kicked by three males wearing Flyers jerseys. The assault left Neal Auricchio, an off-duty Woodbridge, New Jersey, police officer and Iraq war veteran, unconscious and requiring stitches. ""It is a vicious beating with the conclusion of a knockdown punch which knocks the police officer unconscious to the ground upon which he's further assaulted on the ground,"" said Capt. Laurence Nodiff. Veteri is out on $100,000 bail. He is scheduled to appear in court on January 31. The district attorney's office will appeal the bail amount in court next week and seek an increase, according to spokeswoman Tasha Jamerson.","NEW: DA seeking increase in bail .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to leadership and personal responsibility, President Barack Obama has made his stance very clear: ""The buck stops with me."" It's a phrase he's echoed countless times in the past. But now, he's dealing with an accountability double-whammy -- fallout from the botched Obamacare website and global fury over the wiretapping of some allied leaders' conversations. So what all did the President know, and when did he find out? Depends on who you ask. Some U.S. officials have said that Obama didn't know about problems with the health care enrollment site before it launched and that he only recently learned about a National Security Agency operation that wiretapped German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone for a decade. ""It is my understanding that President Obama was not aware Chancellor Merkel's communications were being collected since 2002,"" Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein said. ""That is a big problem."" But other officials said Obama -- or at least his White House staff -- did know about it. Questions about what the President knew and when he knew it have important implications, analysts say. If Obama was aware, that could mean he isn't being clear with the American public now. And if he wasn't aware, that could mean his own staff kept him in the dark. ""There's really no good answer,"" said Republican strategist Kevin Madden. ""If he knew, essentially we're being misled by different people in the administration about the extent of the President's knowledge. If he didn't know, it's an abdication of even the most basic responsibilities of the command and control over very important parts of his administration, and that becomes a problem."" White House: Don't tie issues together . In an exclusive interview with CNN last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said the President didn't know of problems with the Affordable Care Act's website until after its fumbled launch on Oct. 1 -- even though insurance companies had been complaining and the site crashed during a pre-launch test run. White House spokesman Jay Carney declined to detail what Obama knew and when. On Monday, he said tying topics like problems with the Obamacare website and reports about NSA spying is ""conflating a bunch of very disparate issues."" Carney said he wouldn't ""get into individual reports about specific programs,"" and would provide more details once a White House review of U.S. surveillance is complete. Feinstein said the White House has told her that data collection on U.S. allies will stop. But a senior administration official said Feinstein's statement was not completely accurate. The official said some changes have been made, but they are not across-the-board changes in policy like terminating intelligence collection aimed at allies. Germany's not the only country seething over the reports of U.S. spying. Spain has summoned U.S. Ambssador James Costos to discuss an El Pais newspaper report that quoted unnamed sources as saying the NSA spied on Spanish officials and politicians. Much of the focus is on expanded surveillance under the Patriot Act passed in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Many of the secrets spilling out about the NSA's surveillance program came from leaks by former agency contractor Edward Snowden, who was granted temporary political asylum in Russia. Experts: Not every detail disclosed . It's plausible that Obama wouldn't know about specific surveillance targets, said CNN National Security Analyst Fran Townsend, a member of the CIA external advisory board. She said overall intelligence collection priorities are well-known by the White House. ""Specific targets, however, (like) Angela Merkel's cell phone, are not the sort of thing discussed with the President of the United States."" No one should expect the President to know everything the NSA is doing, said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. ""But when you're talking about the surveillance of world leaders, and an issue that's been controversial for a while now, you would expect that there's some knowledge either by the President or people surrounding him. ... I do think there's surprise that this was off the radar in the inner circles of the White House."" Time for change? Republican Rep. Peter King, a key member of the Homeland Security Committee, said if the surveillance happened without the President's knowledge, it has larger implications. ""I would say if the President did not know, that raises very serious questions about what he's doing as chief executive. The fact he would be going into negotiations and discussions and meetings with Angela Merkel or French leaders -- or any leaders for that matter -- and not be aware that there was surveillance going on of the private phone calls, to me either something is definitely wrong in his administration or he just has a totally hands-off attitude. To me, this is unacceptable."" Ross Douthat, a CNN political commentator and a columnist for The New York Times, wondered whether some officials would lose their jobs if the President really wasn't informed. ""The question becomes, why do the people who failed to keep him in the loop still have their jobs?"" he asked. No matter what Obama knew, or when, some say it's time for a new approach. ""He has often said that he didn't know what was going on with the (HealthCare.gov) website. ... He can't pretend he doesn't know and walk away from problems anymore, because he has been caught too many times out of the loop,"" said A.B. Stoddard, associate editor of The Hill. ""He can't do his job that way."" CNN's Tom Cohen, Jake Tapper, Jim Sciutto, Elise Labott, Brooke Baldwin and Jim Acosta contributed to this report.","Senate Intelligence Committee chair: Obama should have been told of some spying .

"(CNN) -- The building at Fort Hood, Texas, where Army Maj. Nidal Hasan massacred 13 people and injured 32 four years ago will be demolished, the military post said this week. The deployment processing center where the shootings happened had been fenced off as a crime scene, but now that Hasan has been convicted, it will be torn down, said Brian Dosa, the post's public works director. The post has not said when the demolition will begin. Hasan shot fellow soldiers at the processing center on November 5, 2009. Prosecutors maintained that the American-born Muslim underwent a progressive radicalization that led to the massacre at the sprawling central Texas base. The Army psychiatrist picked that day because it was when the units he was scheduled to deploy with to Afghanistan were scheduled to go through the processing center, prosecutors said. Hasan, who became a paraplegic when he was shot by police officers to end the attack, was convicted in August of premeditated murder, and a military jury recommended that he be put to death. An Army general will review the proceedings and eventually make a binding decision on whether to accept the guilty verdict and capital sentence.

"(CNN) -- The FBI is mourning the deaths of two special agents killed Friday during a training exercise off the coast of Virginia Beach, Virginia. The agents, Christopher Lorek and Stephen Shaw, were assigned to the FBI's Critical Incident Response Group. The FBI said the cause of the incident is under review. ""We mourn the loss of two brave and courageous men,"" FBI Director Robert S. Mueller said in a statement issued Sunday. ""Like all who serve on the Hostage Rescue Team, they accept the highest risk each and every day, when training and on operational missions, to keep our nation safe. Our hearts are with their wives, children, and other loved ones who feel their loss most deeply. And they will always be part of the FBI Family."" A law enforcement official said the agents were killed while training to use a rope for landing on a ship from a helicopter. The official said the helicopter encountered weather difficulties and the agents fell into the water rather than making a landing on the ship. The official believed winds were a factor but did not know if it was raining at the time. The official said the agents died as a result of the impact rather than drowning. The accident took place about 12 nautical miles off shore, the official said. Special Agent Lorek, age 41, joined the FBI in 1996. He is survived by his wife and two daughters, ages 11 and 8. Special Agent Shaw, 40, joined the FBI in 2005 and is survived by his wife; a daughter, age 3; and a son, age 1. The Hostage Rescue Team is part of the Tactical Support Branch of the FBI's Critical Incident Response Group. It is based at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia.

"London (CNN) -- It's not unusual for a visiting head of state to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in London's Westminster Abbey -- but when it happens on Tuesday, the gesture will be anything but routine. This is history in the making. The commemoration by the President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, will take place during the first state visit by an Irish leader to the United Kingdom. It follows on from Queen Elizabeth's trip to Dublin in May 2011, the first by a British monarch to the republic since it gained independence from London in 1921. The countries are close neighbors but have a long, contentious, often violent history which has left thousands dead, among them Lord Mountbatten, a relative of the Queen who was killed by an Irish Republican Army (IRA) bomb in 1979. The very fact that the British and the Irish once fought with each other under the same flag is still very difficult for many Irish Republicans to stomach. But the relationship between the two countries has gradually normalized since the peace process of the 1990s. That will be formally acknowledged when Higgins pays his respects at the tomb of an unknown British soldier who died during World War One when Ireland was under British rule. Diplomats from both countries are stressing the significance of the five-day trip. Dan Mulhall, the Irish Ambassador to London, has said that Dublin is ""now willing to look at the facts of history"" rather than shying away from them. Meanwhile a Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson has said that the visit is about acknowledging the past but also ""demonstrating that the relationship is moving on and looking to the future."" The spokesperson stressed that both state visits are ""pivotal moments in our shared history."" The Queen's trip nearly three years ago included a visit to Croke Park, a Dublin sports stadium where 14 people were killed by British forces in 1920 during the war of independence. She also spoke in Gaelic during a dinner in Dublin to audible gasps in the room; and visited Northern Ireland in June 2012, when she shook hands with former IRA commander Martin McGuinness, now the province's deputy first minister. These were all highly symbolic moments that politicians couldn't create to the same effect -- and Buckingham Palace is well aware of that. A palace spokesperson said last month that the Queen herself has become a symbol of the warming relationship between the two countries. The significance of this week's state visit will be further underlined by the presence of McGuinness at a reception hosted by the Queen on Thursday afternoon at Windsor Castle - a move unthinkable only a decade ago. The palace spokesperson confirmed that the Queen is heavily invested in the state visit and that it is personal for her, adding that ""the Queen is across every detail."" Expect the Irish President to have everything laid on for him, with all the pomp and ceremony that the royal household can muster. Tensions still remain in Northern Ireland: while the bloodshed of previous decades has largely stopped there are still occasional incidents which pose a threat to life and tensions remain between the communities. But Anglo-Irish relations are improving with each symbolic moment -- and this week's state visit is as symbolic as it gets.

"(CNN) -- Amongst the clouds of dust kicked up from the desert by the hundreds of new arrivals who pitch up every day at the Zaatari refugee camp -- just 15 kilometers from the Jordan/Syria border -- Abeer Rantisi is planning her next lesson. The twenty-six-year old is short, hair tied back, her thick-rimmed glasses sitting wonkyly at the end of her nose. She is standing outside a large marquee where a group of Syrian men is being taught the basics of soccer coaching. ""'Football,"" she tells CNN, her eyes moving to a group of young children nearby, screeching with laughter as they kick a football around on a sand pitch, ""We all speak football."" Rantisi is a star for the Jordanian women's national team, who are preparing for a tournament that could see the kingdom qualify for the World Cup finals for the first time in their history. But, for now, she has more important work to do. She coaches soccer for Syrian girls and young women who have fled the horrors of civil war and found themselves in what has become one of the biggest refugee camps in the world. The sound of a child's laughter is rare in Zaatari. Since the start of the Syrian civil war-- the conflict marked its third anniversary in March -- this tiny hamlet has been transformed into one of the biggest cities in the country. As many as 150,000 people live here now. Hundreds come every day, sometimes more, sometimes less, depending on the brutality of the fighting just a few kilometers away. They have built a life of semi-permanence. According to the United Nations there are now close to 700 shops in the camp and nearly 60 mosques. You can buy cable TV from one of the many tents set up to supply the growing population. There's a wedding cake shop, a place to buy wedding dresses and even a pet shop. It costs $1.6 billion a year to run Zaatari, but the human cost is immeasurable. Almost every player Rantisi coaches says they have been confronted with the unimaginable: bombings, the death of entire families, assault, rape. ""The main thing we can work on is self-confidence,"" Rantisi explains of the fragile emotional and physical state her players arrive in. ""To bring those people here and tell them they can achieve whatever they want. We have to make them resilient because they were suffering in Syria."" Dealing with the emotional scars of a civil war is a tough job, but there is also the added obstacle of social conservatism to overcome. Almost everyone at Zaatari has come from Syria's southern, rural, conservative Sunni population. Young girls have simply never played football in that environment. The biggest issue in such a sprawling, impersonal camp, according to Rantisi, is privacy. ""They have all come from conservative communities and are not allowed to play in public so we have to make sure that they are hiding all the time,"" she says. ""It's a really big problem here. Because you can see the camp it's open from all angles so we have to find a safe place for them to play. We have to find private places just for the girls to come."" In private, away from the gaze of men, Rantisi works with her players, but it takes time for her to earn their trust. ""The women in Zaatari have no idea about sport at all,"" she explains. ""In the first lecture we say: 'We are national team players. We have come here to talk about sport.' They ask: 'What do you mean? What is sport?'"" It is not an uncommon question in the region. While women's soccer has boomed around the world, the game in the Middle East has been fraught with religious and cultural opposition over the past decade. In Kuwait a nascent women's national team was effectively banned in 2007 after lawmakers decided it was 'un-Islamic' for women to play soccer. The Palestinian women's national team had to fight social conservatism within its own communities to build a mixed team of Muslim and Christian players. Saudi Arabia still has no women's team. But attitudes are changing. The Jordan team has only existed since 2005 and has been backed with money and support from Prince Ali bin al Hussein, the young half-brother of the king, who was recently elected as a vice-president on FIFA's powerful executive committee. Fifteen new training centers for young girls have been built and Prince Ali has been instrumental in pushing through a rule change that allows Muslim women to wear a modified hijab to cover their hair during FIFA matches. Originally they had been prevented from doing so on the grounds that the hijab was a religious symbol. But the change could revolutionize the game in the Middle East and open soccer to millions of women who would otherwise be prevented from playing. In the past few years alone national women's teams have been set up in the UAE, Qatar and now, finally, Kuwait too. The greatest success story, though, has been the Jordanian national team with Rantisi, who cites French World Cup winner Zinedine Zidane as her inspiration, in the heart of midfield . ""I'm from Amman and started playing when when I was 13,"" she recalls. ""In Jordan we don't have the same problems anymore as say with the Palestinians. ""We don't have the same social problems as they have. But we used to, when we started in the past."" In just eight years the Jordan team has gone from nothing to qualifying for the Asian Cup. Rantisi scored a hat trick in a world record 21-0 victory over Kuwait in one qualification match. That tournament takes place in May and if Jordan reach the semi-finals they will qualify for the World Cup, the first time a team from the region will have ever made it. ""I play as a central midfielder so it was fun to score,"" she says, a little embarrassed at the huge scoreline. ""We have to look at new teams like Qatar and Kuwait and support them. But,"" she adds, laughing now, ""we needed the 20 goals as Uzbekistan were in the same group and they scored eighteen!"" For Prince Ali, the success of the team on the pitch vindicates an investment in the women's game that few others in the region were willing to make. ""Our girls have qualified for the Asian Cup, the first team ever from West Asia and that's down to them and the investment we've put in,"" he explains of Jordan's recent success on the pitch. ""We chose a coach from Japan, bearing in mind they are World Cup champions, and we hope they can make it to the World Cup."" The Zaatari project is a collaboration between the Asian Football Development Project, set up by Prince Ali, and UEFA, European football's governing body. The aim is to use football to promote healthier living and also to fill the idle hours that refugee camps provide in abundance. More than 1,000 children and young adults under 20 are in the program, with 80 more being trained to coach. ""All the children that arrive are completely devastated,"" explains Bassam Omar al Taleb, a 31-year old Syrian who had himself fled his home in Daraa a few months before. Once a keen amateur soccer player, he is now coaching Zaatari's new arrivals. ""They have seen their family members killed before their eyes and the journey to Jordan is a difficult one,"" he says. ""Through football we at least try to remove the sense of fear and regain some sense of normalcy."" Meanwhile as the war in Syria continues. Zaatari's numbers swell every day. ""It is a really difficult job,"" Rantisi says. As the coaching class for young Syrian men finishes, the children are still on the sand pitch, shrieking as they chase the ball as a pack. ""But,"" Rantisi adds, ""we have to bring them back to life.""","As many as 150.000 people living in Zaatari refugee camp .

"(CNN) -- As a practicing Catholic all my life, my faith and the church are never far from my mind. The lessons I learned in the church have structured the way I've approached my life and my career. They were lessons of grace, kindness, forgiveness and compassion. Under Pope Francis, we have seen a change at the Vatican that is reflective of the church I know and love. He approaches controversial doctrine or past wrongdoing with humility, understanding and faith in the goodness of mankind. He has served as a voice for the voiceless, and has been working to re-establish the church as a home for the homeless. The church is moving into a new era, where its leadership understands that what makes the church strongest is when it acknowledges, in Pope Francis' words, ""We all make mistakes and we need to recognize our weaknesses."" The true potential that this new era holds is Pope Francis' embrace of the lesson that how we forgive those mistakes and how we grow from those weaknesses is what defines us, and defines our faith. Pope Francis himself recently acknowledged that the church must grow and change, including in how it trains its clergy, lest the church find itself â€” these are his words -- ""creating little monsters."" Recently, I saw ""Philomena,"" a film that I believe illustrates the need for this new era, and the potential that it holds. Philomena's story is a difficult one. She became pregnant out of wedlock at a young age and was taken in by nuns in Ireland who arranged for her son to be adopted by an American family. While she worked hard to pay her keep, she was only permitted to see him one hour a day. Then, at age 3, he was gone -- adopted by an American family in an arrangement made by the nuns without Philomena's input. Philomena was treated harshly by some of the nuns in whose charge she was left, the same ones who ensured she would never see her son againâ€”though she never stopped loving him. The argument made by some of the film's detractors is that the painful, yet accurate, portrayal of the nuns Philomena encountered is evidence that the film, its producers, and even Philomena Lee herself have an anti-Catholic bias and worse -- a vendetta against the Catholic Church and a political agenda. These nuns who kept Philomena from her son may very well have been examples of the ""little monsters"" that Pope Francis fears. I viewed the film quite differently from these critics -- and instead saw in it the positive attributes of my Catholic upbringing, attributes that are increasingly at the forefront of religious discussion. Quite simply, I believe the lessons found in Philomena's story are lessons that many of us hope to be the cornerstone of a new era of Catholicism under Pope Francis. At the heart of the film is not only Philomena's journey to find her son, but also her journey to find forgiveness for the individuals who treated her with such cruelty, and the church that allowed them to do so. I, like Philomena, am a lifelong Catholic, and still regularly attend church. My faith is important to me, I love the church and believe it is an important force for good, both here in America and throughout the world. But that doesn't mean I don't have disagreements with some of its policies or leaders. On occasion, with issues such as same-sex marriage and contraception, I have found myself at odds with pieces of traditional church doctrine. But to be religious is not to never question or disagree. To love my church is to be able to question it when it does wrong, forgive it for its mistakes, and still have faith in it to do right. In Pope Francis, I see a leader who lives every day in the image of Jesus. Under his guidance, the church is focused once again on providing comfort, compassion and salvation for sinners, the poor and those who seek peace in an increasingly complex world. That's my Catholicism. That's Philomena's Catholicism. That's the Catholicism of millions who believe, even when they disagree. It's not anti-Catholic to question, nor is it anti-Catholic to be honest about the previous shortcomings of the church, because that is the only way we can ensure its strength and dignity moving forward. It is, however, very Catholic to forgive each other, and to never stop loving each other. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Donna Brazile: Pope Francis has reoriented the church to stress humility, forgiveness .
She says critics who say the new film ""Philomena"" is anti-Catholic are wrong .

"(CNN) -- Which president do you want running your country? The one that argues that he knew nothing about the spy programs targeting American allies, which have put America's relations with our closest friends in their most precarious state since the Iraq War? Or the one that approved such programs, knew about them all along, and is simply lying about what he knew? Which Congress do you want providing oversight for such programs? The one that is now calling for massive investigations into America's out-of-control global surveillance apparatus? Or the one that failed to provide oversight when it was needed? What kind of leaders do you want representing you in government? The ones that shrug off gathering data from tens of millions of people in the U.S., France, Spain, Brazil and other countries worldwide as ""spy business as usual,"" but only get really spun up when the surveillance scandal seems to touch other world leaders? Or the ones still saying the threats posed by several thousand bad guys worldwide are grave enough to compromise the most fundamental rights of hundreds of millions of people worldwide, jeopardize our alliances, and potentially trigger a backlash against U.S. technology companies? The practice can also give other governments an excuse to limit Internet freedoms and spy more on their own people. Take your choice. Because right now, America's leaders are offering themselves up on both sides of these divides. While the president tells the world he didn't know what spy programs he oversaw (and while his top aides are trying to placate governments with the same hard-to-believe stories), news organizations from Germany's Bild to the Los Angeles Times are running stories that, like logic, suggest otherwise. Hint: You know you are in a crisis when a president known to be a control freak -- who is allergic to delegating responsibility and has alienated many in his own government by his reliance on a small coterie of close aides -- starts arguing he had no idea what his government was doing. That might be credible, or tolerable, when it comes to IRS snooping on conservative groups or how the tech work was handled on the rollout of a health care website. But when it comes to the vitally important, hugely sensitive business of managing America's intelligence programs, such ""ignorance"" beggars the imagination. The White House's defense strategy is to embrace incompetence rather than take responsibility for errors of judgment on its watch. It is an approach this adminstration has used surprisingly frequently, most recently when President Obama responded to Obamacare's Glitchgate controversy by saying it frustrated him more than anyone, as though he were another victim rather than chief executive. Whether or not he knew or should have known (and his failure to communicate with his Cabinet is a clear contributor to these problems), it sure isn't the kind of response you expect of a leader. Better would be: ""It's a screw-up. It happened on my watch. I'll make sure it gets fixed."" It is also fine to note that some of the controversial surveillance programs began during the Bush administration. But all have continued now for five years during Obama's tenure, and some, like PRISM, have been expanded. Each year those programs were budgeted by the White House, overseen by White House appointees, reported to the White House, fed intelligence up to Obama's daily briefing and into the reports received by his top national security officials. And before the political knife-fighters on Capitol Hill start thinking this is open season on a wounded president who is clearly not going to have any awards for his management skills to sit alongside his Nobel Prize, let's look at them: They have failed just as grievously. Indeed many in Congress have been responsible for the atmosphere of pervasive fear in the country that has made the last decade a period of laws and actions -- from the Patriot Act to ill-considered foreign wars to ""spygate"" -- that will be seen by history as a dark chapter in American history. It will be viewed as the moment we responded to a limited threat with so much panic that our best values and judgment were jettisoned. Perhaps, thanks to the revelations that have come from the Edward Snowden leaks (and let's be clear, Mr. President -- if Snowden knew, you should have too), we will initiate the kind of rules and oversight to avoid a coming era of basic rights diluted and the morphing of Big Data into Big Brother. This is not just a job of reforms that the President and Congress will have to orchestrate together here in the U.S. To restore our most important relationships and advance the U.S. ideal of a world guided by international law, America must cooperate on initiatives that set standards both for how we ensure the sovereignty of our allies and for how we protect the privacy and freedoms of all people worldwide. Spying will not and should not end. We must protect ourselves. But we must also remember that this requires vigilance about external threats -- and the ones that come from within our own system. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.","David Rothkopf: Do we want president aware of spying or one who lies about ignorance?
He asks: Do we want Congress that provides oversight, or one ""outraged"" when it fails to?
He says U.S. has jeopardized ally relations, given cover to regimes who curb Internet, spy .
Rothkopf: Spying happens, but U.S. should work with allies to guard global privacy ."
"Washington (CNN) -- Shaking off three years of partisan freeze, Republicans and Democrats unveiled a $1.012 trillion spending deal Monday night that would roll back some spending cuts, raise federal worker pay and have a surprisingly broad effect on Americans' everyday lives, from the light bulbs in lamps to the lines at airport security. The massive bipartisan bill is a break from years of forced budget cuts and constant Congressional funding fights. It would green-light spending through the end of September. ""I think the most significant thing is this gets the train back on the track,"" House Appropriations Chairman Harold Rogers, R-Kentucky, told reporters. Wielding the power of one of the biggest purses in the world, the measure sets America's national and international priorities. And in the current atmosphere, the so-called ""omnibus"" bill may be the largest policy decision Congress makes this year. Federal workers and military personnel would see 1 percent increases in their paychecks, marking the first pay raise in three years for most agency staffers. The deal also would protect disabled veterans and some military spouses from a pension cut set to go into effect in 2015. Details of the $1 trillion spending bill . Appeal for both sides . Democrats? They're cheering a $1 billion increase in Head Start funding from its recent low point after forced budget cuts last year. Half of that will go to help children three years old and younger, touching on an Obama administration priority. Senate Appropriations Chairman Barbara Mikulski, a former social worker, also won millions of dollars for mental health programs. ""This agreement shows the American people that we can compromise, and that we can govern,"" Mikulski wrote in a statement late Monday. What do Republicans like in that compromise? Hits to two of their least-favorite agencies: the IRS budget will be at 2009 levels and Republicans crow that they've cut the Environmental Protection Agency's funding by 20 percent since 2009. Overall, federal spending is lower than in years. ""Everyone can find something to complain about, but from a Republican standpoint, this is $164 billion less than (President George W.) Bush's last budget, so that's pretty good progress,"" said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, who sits on the Appropriations Committee. Opinion: America's real problem is bipartisanship . Air travel targeted . Changes at the airports may be the most visible Republican idea in the bill. The omnibus launches several policies aimed at forcing the Transportation Security Administration to get more low-risk passengers through security more quickly. First, the bill would cap the number of TSA agents at 46,000. It would also require the TSA to certify increasing numbers of travelers as eligible for ""expedited"" screening. By mid-April, the agency must tell Congress that one quarter of the traveling public is ""expedite"" eligible. By the end of 2014, that figure must be one in two. TSA representatives and aviation experts were not available for comment on the airport security policies at publishing time. Lights and health . At home, the omnibus bill would give Americans more lighting options and less efficiency. The measure stops implementation of a new light-bulb standard which aimed to gradually replace many incandescent light bulbs. That seems to be one of the secrets of the new bipartisanship: pick your controversial items with a light hand. Thus, Obamacare does make a few appearances in the spending plan, but negotiators mostly tiptoe around it. The deal requires that a $1 billion ""Prevention and Public Health"" account, which Republicans call a ""slush fund,"" be used only for, well, prevention and public health. Not all big issues . The word ""Benghazi"" enters the discussion as well. This deal requires that before the U.S. can send any more foreign aid to Libya, Secretary of State Kerry must certify that the Libyan government is helping to find those responsible for the Benghazi attack. The bill is not all sweeping, big issues. It also contains countless smaller provisions, like a ban on funding any new portraits of most officials. ""What I wanted was a benign bill,"" said appropriations chairman Rogers, ""(a bill) that would not have any earthshaking changes, and I think that's what we have."" The House hopes to pass the measure Wednesday, the day that the current spending bill runs out. Leaders plan for government to then operate on a very short three-day funding bill to give the Senate time to debate and vote later this week.","The huge bipartisan bill would fund the government through the end of September .

"(CNN) -- The White House has secured commitments from some of the nation's largest companies for a plan to boost hiring of the long-term unemployed. ""What we have done is to gather together 300 companies, just to start with, including, some of the top 50 companies in the country, companies like Walmart, and Apple, Ford and others, to say let's establish best practices,"" President Barack Obama told CNN Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper in an exclusive interview. ""Because they've been unemployed ... so long, folks are looking at that gap in the resume and they're weeding them out before these folks even get a chance for an interview,"" said Obama. As the economy slowly recovers from the recession, the number of workers who have not found a job for at least six months or more has grown. ""Do not screen people out of the hiring process just because they've been out of work for a long time,"" said the President. He will make the formal announcement on Friday. He's convening CEOs and others who have committed to the plan. The move is in line with Obama's State of the Union push to take executive action on initiatives that he does not need Congress to accomplish. The President proposed in 2011 that Congress prohibit discrimination based on unemployment at companies with more than 15 workers. Bills were introduced in the Senate and House, but little progress was made. ""Will we be able to have more of an impact if we can get Congress, for example, to pass a minimum wage law that applies to everybody, as opposed to me just through executive order making sure that, folks who are contractors to the federal government have to pay a minimum wage? Absolutely,"" said Obama. On Tuesday, he promised to take action raising the minimum wage for government contract workers to $10.10 per hour. The nation's unemployment rate fell to 6.7% in December, but the drop came mainly from workers leaving the labor force. Roughly 4 million people are considered long-term unemployed, those out of work for 27 weeks or more. Efforts backed by Obama to extend a federal program providing jobless benefits to that group fell flat this month in Congress. Weak job growth . Obama added that his administration will continue reaching out to the House and Senate on key initiatives. ""But I'm not going to wait for them,"" the President said. Critics have said Obama's push for executive action illustrates diminished expectations. But he stressed key accomplishments achieved through Congress during his five years in office, including health care and education. ""In no way are my expectations diminished, or my ambitions diminished. But what is obviously true, is we've got divided government right now. The House Republicans, in particular, have had difficulty rallying around any agenda, much less mine. And in that kind of environment, what I don't want is the American people to think that the only way for us to make big change is through legislation,"" Obama said. Companies to pledge help for long-term jobless . In a separate interview, Rep. Paul Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate and a potential White House hopeful next time around, told Tapper that Obama appears to be circumventing the Constitution with an ""end run"" around Congress. ""If there's something he thinks needs to be changed in law, then he needs to make the case to Congress,"" Ryan said, noting that there is an ""effective way"" to use the bully pulpit ""to encourage good things."" CNN's Adam Aigner-Treworgy and Dana Davidsen contributed to this report.","In interview with CNN, President says companies sign on to plan to boost hiring .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama signed into law Tuesday a measure designed to strengthen national community service efforts by boosting federal funding for thousands of volunteers in fields ranging from clean energy to health care and education. Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy, left, introduces President Obama at the bill signing on Tuesday. The Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, recently renamed to honor the Massachusetts senator's sponsorship of the measure, will more than triple the number of positions in the AmeriCorps program, from 75,000 to 250,000, by 2017. ""Our government can help to rebuild our economy ... [but] we need Americans willing to mentor our eager young children, or care for the sick, or ease the strains of deployment on our military families,"" Obama said. ""All that's required on your part is a willingness to make a difference. And that is, after all, the beauty of service. Anybody can do it."" Kennedy, his niece Caroline Kennedy, former President Bill Clinton, and former first lady Rosalynn Carter were in attendance when Obama signed the measure into law at a Washington-area school that encourages volunteerism as part of its curriculum. The law creates four national service corps and launches several other initiatives, including, among other things, a ""Summer of Service"" program to spur greater community outreach by middle- and high-school students. Older Americans will also be encouraged to volunteer more through the creation of a ""Silver Scholars"" program, under which individuals 55 and older who perform 350 hours of service receive a $1,000 award. The law increases the existing AmeriCorps educational stipend offered to volunteers to $5,350 -- the same amount as the maximum Pell college grant. Critics have contended the law is fiscally irresponsible in light of the economic downturn. They also argue that the concept of volunteerism is undermined by providing financial compensation for community service. The law is expected to cost roughly $6 billion over the next five years.","Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act signed into law on Tuesday .

"Washington (CNN) -- You could read the entire 1,582-page, $1 trillion omnibus spending plan announced in Congress Monday night. Or you can check out our handy cheat sheet of some of the key winners and losers in the plan. Winners . Little kids: Big winners. Funding for the Head Start and early Head Start programs would jump by $1 billion. That's $1 billion more than last year's low point after budget cuts. The mentally ill: Social-worker-turned-Senate-Appropriations-Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski, D-Maryland, has long pushed for mental health programs. This year she got them an additional $173 million dollars more than their funding level with last year's budget cuts. Disabled veterans and surviving families: No longer would a planned cut in pensions hit ""medically"" discharged military retirees or military spouses or children who depend on military pensions. Federal workers and active military: A 1% pay raise would come to both groups of furlough- and sequester survivors. Details of the $1 trillion spending bill . G-men: The FBI stands to gain $700 million+ over the funding it got following last year's budget cuts. Social Security Administration: The agency gets a hefty $651 million increase to help it make up for budget cuts in the past. Seated handshakes: The photo of Mikulski and House Appropriations Committee chairman Hal Rogers, R-Kentucky, sealing the deal is a double win: a more natural-looking, lawmakers-at-work shot than the traditional standing handshake. And it masks the significant height difference between the two powerful lawmakers. Obamacare: (And see below.) No gain in funds, but no loss of funds, either. Given the razor-sharp opposition to the health care law, a spending bill that doesn't get snagged in the Obamacare debate (and vice versa) could be considered a win. Obama looks to bypass Congress to press 'Year of Action' Appropriations committees: Think of it as a reality game show that no one would enjoy. The chairmen and staffs of the House and Senate appropriations committees had less than a month to agree on 12 detailed spending bills and fold them into one 1,582-page document that both parties could sign. Losers . EPA: The deal restores some of the funds cut by sequester to the Environmental Protection Agency, but not all. In a summary of the measure, Republicans boasted that with this bill, they have cut the EPA's funding by 20% since 2010. IRS: The tax agency's funding has been cut to 2009 levels, according to the Republican House Appropriations Committee. And just to send a more direct message, this appropriations bill states that the agency cannot use its funds to target citizens or groups based on their ideology. TSA: You have millions of passengers to screen everyday and now Congress has capped the number of employees you can hire. If passed, the deal would set a limit of 46,000 TSA screeners and require the TSA to find a way to make half of the traveling public eligible for ""expedited"" screening by the end of this year. Senators seek compromise on unemployment standoff . Russia: Two reasons. 1. Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Illinois, told CNN the deal fully funds a U.S. missile defense system in Romania, which the Russians do not like. 2. The measure makes it harder for the United States to buy weapons from Russia, including some controversial helicopters. To get around the ban, the omnibus requires the Pentagon to reveal the number of anti-aircraft missiles the Russian weapons agency has sold to Syria's Bashar al-Assad. Obamacare: (And see above.) If the Obama administration needs more funds to implement the health care law, it isn't going to get them from Congress. The bill doesn't add any funding and also blocks the administration from dipping into a prevention fund as a backup pool of money. Generals and admirals: Flag and general officers in the military would see a cut in their staff expense budgets under this plan. The president of Afghanistan: The bill specifically prohibits any of its funds from going to ""the direct personal benefit of the president of Afghanistan."" Portrait artists: The bill bans government officials from spending money to have a portrait made. Jerry Brown: No funds for you. The California governor hoped to get some federal funds for his dream of a $60 billion high-speed rail line between L.A. and San Francisco. But Republicans successfully blocked the idea in this deal.

"(CNN) -- A 52-year-old California man has pleaded guilty to holding a female relative as a sex slave in his backyard shed for 14 years, beginning when she was barely a teenager, authorities said. Raul Ochoa of Richmond, California, would spend the next 22 years in prison under a plea deal in which the victim won't be compelled to testify at the sentencing hearing on February 11, authorities said. Local media accounts are likening her case to Jaycee Dugard, also held captive in a California backyard structure. Dugard was held from age 11 to 29 and gave birth to two daughters, fathered by her captor, Phillip Garrido. He and wife Nancy were sentenced to long prison terms in 2011. In the Richmond case, the victim escaped from captivity in 2012 with help from a relative, who brought her to police, Richmond Police Chief Chris Magnus said in a letter to the city council, confirming a local newspaper account this week of the crime. But authorities didn't publicize the incident until this week, after the newspaper account was published, the chief told the city council. ""I want to make you aware of a horrific case (initially dealt with in the summer of 2012) involving long-term sexual abuse of a developmentally-disabled individual by a very close family member that took place in our city,"" the chief wrote in a Thursday e-mail to the council. ""Just to clarify -- we did not release any information up to this point about the case because the crime was perpetrated within the family by a very close family member,"" Magnus wrote, putting the word ""within"" in italics. ""There was no reason to believe there were any non-family members who had been victimized by the suspect. In addition, this victim is very fragile and we did want to jeopardize her welfare or the case in any way,"" the chief wrote. The girl was taken captive in 1998 at age 13, Deputy District Attorney Ryan Wagner told CNN. At the time, she was visiting Ochoa in his family's home, according to CNN affiliate KGO and authorities. ""In that home, she was basically, through the use of emotional and psychological pressure as well as sexual abuse, forced to participate in horrific acts for an extended period of time,"" Wagner said in a separate interview with KGO. Ochoa's wife and children, who resided in the house, also lived in fear of Ochoa, authorities told KGO. Ochoa built a shed in his backyard where most of the sexual abuse occurred, but it has since been torn down, authorities told the news outlet. A photograph of the shed, released by authorities, shows a box-spring covered with plastic and supported by a metal frame. One wall is decorated with a floral-print fabric, but another wall appears to be covered with white tarp. A wood column supporting the roof is next to the bed, as is a simple wooden table. The girl wasn't allowed to attend school, and as she became older, Ochoa taught her how to do landscaping work, an activity they shared, authorities told the affiliate. In August 2012, the victim was then a 27-year-old woman, and after 14 years of captivity, she told others she wanted to escape. ""On the last day, she said or she indicated that she was going to use the restroom, and had a relative waiting down the street,"" Wagner told the affiliate. ""And at the time when she went to the restroom, she went down the street to a vehicle that was waiting and was able to get to the Richmond Police Department."" Police Lt. Andre Hill said the victim appeared at the police department on August 16, 2012, ""and wanted to report sexual abuse."" ""She reported the abuse had been going on for some years,"" Hill said, and the suspect ""threatened to harm her or her family if she ever reported this abuse."" Police arrested Ochoa after having the victim place a phone call to him, Hill said. ""With the assistance of the victim, they were able to get him to make some admissions to some of these crimes,"" Hill said. The suspect was arrested a short time later and the case was then referred to the district attorney's office, who took over the investigation, Hill said. One neighbor told KGO that she always sensed something was not right at the Ochoa house. ""She didn't go to school so she, I mean, they were always together, she never had any friends,"" Ina Mason told the station. ""I think it's appalling,"" Mason added. ""You are supposed to be a Christian, but this is what you are doing to your child or whoever it is, even if it is not your child. I mean, you are doing this to a person? No one has the right to do this to a person."" In his letter to the city council, the police chief said ""this case is a good reminder that human slavery still exists."" ""There are too many instances where terrible crimes can be perpetrated within families over long periods of time and victims, particularly more vulnerable individuals (such a developmentally disabled folks, young people, etc.) are unaware of how to get help or unable to do so,"" the chief wrote. He credited Officer Mitch Peixoto and Detective Walt Nelson for playing ""critical"" roles in solving the crime. ""Although I can't get into all the details, it would have been SO easy for them to have interacted with this victim and never figured out what was really going on,"" the chief wrote. ""Their perceptiveness, empathy, and skills allowed us to save this young woman's life and bring the perpetrator to justice (if justice can really ever be served on someone who has done such heinous acts)."" Ochoa, who pleaded guilty to one count of forced lewd acts on a child and two counts of forcible rape, is now being held on $30 million bond, according to a detention facility in Contra Costa County. Ochoa's attorney didn't return phone messages this week. CNN's Dan Simon contributed to this report.","Police didn't publicize crime until a local newspaper reported plea deal this week .

"(CNN) -- Planning on building an igloo or snowman this winter? Sorry, we're not impressed. The neighborhood kids might not be, either, after they see what ice sculptors have planned for the 2014 Harbin Ice and Snow Festival. Kicking off on January 5, this frosty wonderland in northern China features crazy sculptures made from massive ice blocks and illuminated with colorful LED lights. Sculptors have been carving away with ice picks, chisels and lasers for the last two weeks in preparation. The result is an exhibition of extravagant castles, a Colosseum and Empire State Building, all made with ice blocks from the frozen Songhua River. Is anything in China not getting bigger? Celebrating its 30th anniversary in 2014, the winter festival gets more impressive and more extravagant each year. The highlight is a towering replica of the Hallgrimskirkja church in Reykjavik, Iceland. According to organizers, the structure is the tallest ice sculpture in China (46 meters) and was made with 12,000 meters of ice. The replica features a 240-meter-long slide for visitors. Apart from replicas, the North Korea Pyongyang National Acrobatic Troupe will perform. Visitors can skate on ice rinks and snowboard. As China's most famous and popular winter attraction, the festival has drawn a combined 28.5 million visitors in the past two years. To combat Harbin's sub-zero temperatures, organizers have set up 13 hot beverage stations around the park and offer complementary ginger tea at its concierge hall. Depending on weather, the festival is open until March 2014.

"(CNN) -- Remember ""Bowling for Columbine""? The anti-gun documentary that attempted to politicize the tragic school shooting at Columbine, Colorado, was wildly successful, both critically and commercially, and even won its writer/director, Michael Moore, an Oscar. But while the film was certainly entertaining, and may have even got some folks thinking about gun violence, it did little to move the needle on its presumptive goal: curbing gun ownership and weakening the National Rifle Association. That's because gun owners and the powerful lobby that represents them don't care what Hollywood thinks of them, a lesson producer Harvey Weinstein will learn soon. Weinstein ""reluctantly"" told Howard Stern that he's planning a movie that will make the NRA ""wish they weren't alive."" On Friday night, in an exclusive interview pre-taped with Piers Morgan, he says that none other than Meryl Streep will star as an anti-gun senator. For so many reasons, Weinstein deserves a good, hard reality check. For one, there's the obvious and almost comical hypocrisy. Weinstein's profited immensely from portraying graphic gun violence in films such as ""Kill Bill"" and ""Pulp Fiction."" His sudden attack of social conscience is astounding and curiously timed. In the same Morgan interview, he says he'll stop making movies that glamorize guns. But according to Internet Movie Database, ""Kill Bill Vol. 3"" and ""Sin City: A Dame to Kill For"" are in the works. Maybe he means starting ... now. For another thing, overtly ideological films -- think ""Rendition"" and ""Lions for Lambs"" -- bomb at the box office. Theatergoers don't want to be lectured by Hollywood for two hours on what they think is wrong with the country. Opinion: When will America wake up to gun violence? If we're to assume Weinstein is motivated by a deep concern about gun violence (and not sheer arrogance), then it's also worth pointing out that he's got the wrong target. The NRA represents law-abiding gun owners, not criminals. A gangbanger in Chicago doesn't care about the NRA, isn't motivated or supported by the NRA, and may not even know what the NRA is. In vowing to take down this powerful organization supported by millions of law-abiding citizens, Weinstein will simply end up empowering and emboldening it. And lastly, the effort most certainly won't rid the country of guns (a goal he's admitted to having, unless there's another Holocaust in which case he very much wants a gun, or something.) Back to Michael Moore. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade association for the U.S. firearms industry, calculates that from 2002, the year ""Bowling for Columbine"" came out, to 2011, there's been a 54.1% rise in the number of federal background checks, one way of measuring an increase in gun sales. And remember, that movie was actually successful. Proving the nation's gun owners not only don't care about Hollywood's dictates but Washington's either, in the year since the tragic Newtown, Connecticut, shooting -- and despite significant efforts from the Obama administration and other Democrats to push increased gun control, gun sales are up 8%. Weinstein may find this lamentable and even reprehensible. He's entitled to his opinion. And he's also entitled to spend Hollywood money on a movie in which Meryl Streep is paid to rail against a constitutionally protected right and a robust and defensive American community. But I promise, every penny he makes will be multiplied manyfold in NRA contributions. Good luck, Harvey.

"(CNN) -- The killing of a young giraffe named Marius at Copenhagen Zoo sparked international outrage this weekend. On Sunday, he was shot with a bolt gun then publicly dissected before being fed to the lions. In its defense, the zoo has argued that Marius' death was necessary to protect the genetic diversity of his species. It was claimed that to allow Marius to take up space that could be used to house another animal with more desirable genetic make-up may hinder conservation breeding programs. Contraception which required sedation is dangerous and giraffes might die during the procedure. As such, Marius' birth could not have been safely prevented. Marius could not be rehomed because sending him somewhere other than a zoo which was a member of the European Association for Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) could result in him being sold into a circus, which would be against EAZA rules. In effect, the zoo's hands were tied, it was implied. None of these arguments appear to stand up to scrutiny. As the head of the European endangered species program for giraffes stated in press, Marius was not from a rare sub-species. Given that zoos claim that animals are kept in order to support the conservation of threatened species, it is therefore unclear why any member of Marius' subspecies should be held captive at all. Zoo staff get death threats . It was further confirmed that a contraceptive for giraffes has been developed in the last few years which allows females to be safely injected at a distance thus suggesting that Marius' birth was not inevitable. The director of EAZA supported the stance that Marius had to die and encouraged people to consider the ""bigger picture."" But EAZA itself is less than consistent in its approach to inbreeding and, indeed, in its concern for the ultimate fate of animals in its member zoos. EAZA and similar zoo bodies discourage member zoos from deliberately breeding white lions; a practice which is recognized as involving inbreeding in order to perpetuate the unusual white coloring of the animals involved. Due to the serious welfare implications and the lack of conservation value of inbred animals, breeding of white lions is theoretically not allowed in EAZA zoos. In practice, both West Midland Safari Park and Paradise Wildlife Park in the UK breed white lions. Both are EAZA members and yet, despite vociferously supporting the killing of Marius to prevent the same problem, a blind eye has been turned by EAZA to the persistent inbreeding of other species in its zoos. White lions are, perhaps tellingly, a great crowd pleaser. In 2012 West Midland Safari Park were revealed to have sent four white lions to a circus trainer, who sent them on to a Japanese circus. That the safari park remains an EAZA member means that the rules on sending animals to non-EAZA collections are not consistently applied. Despite this, no exception was made for Marius. In fact, rather than Marius being a tragic exception, the killing of animals considered to be surplus to requirements by zoos is something which is common in the industry. A 2003 study suggested that there are around 7,500 animals deemed ""surplus"" in European zoos at any one time. Whilst it cannot be undone, Marius' death has served an important purpose in shining a spotlight on a practice which is normally kept well-hidden from public view. As long as there are zoos, there will be unwanted animals. And as long as there are unwanted animals, more like Marius will be killed. It has long been recognised that conservation success is achieved not in city centre zoos or safari parks, but in natural habitats. We would urge anyone with a passion for conservation to support effective in situ efforts which are truly making a positive impact on species conservation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Liz Tyson.","Copenhagen zoo's defense of killing a giraffe does not stand up to scrutiny, writes Liz Tyson .

"(AOL Autos) -- For those of you who are schoolteachers, you will understand what I am about to relate. While at the car repair facility, look for certifications displayed on the wall. You lay out a lesson plan to teach a particular topic, for example, how to solve a basic algebraic equation. You proceed to follow the plan, working with your students until you feel they understand the necessary mathematical principles. A couple of weeks pass and, low and behold, you discover that there are several people who have somehow forgotten what they appeared to have learned! They look at you like you're speaking another language, and you realize you have to start over with the basics again. Frustrated, you repeat the same process until you think they have it, and low and behold, it happens again. Sound familiar? I understand your plight. I get the same question from my readers over and over: ""How do I find a good auto repair shop?! What do I look for?!"" I've written reams on this subject. As a matter of fact, I've even created a separate section within my Web site to make this information available, and still the question keeps coming up. So for those of you who have either never read my columns pertaining to this topic, or have ""forgotten,"" allow me to refresh your memory with a few updates. Before I start, I want to emphasize that the question ""How do I find a good auto repair shop?"" represents a universal concern. This question comes to me from virtually all over the world on a regular basis (Singapore, Scotland, England, Brazil, Calcutta India, just to name a few). An interesting story related to this concern: A man from Calcutta (his name is Moeeb) asked me if I would come to Calcutta and open an auto repair shop with him, because there was such a need. To quote Moeeb, ""There is great opportunity for great profits to be made."" He said he would front all the money we needed for a building and equipment. In jest, I pointed out to him that I was not proficient in camel repair and would have to decline. His response was serious. ""Tom, people who can afford a car in Calcutta are wealthy, and they usually drive a Rolls Royce, Mercedes, Porsche, Lincoln, or a Cadillac, and NOT a camel! i.e. Sheiks and the like."" I still found myself declining the offer, after watching the reaction on my wife's face to the possibility. Anyway, it just goes to show you, car care problems are the same everywhere! AOL Autos: Most stolen cars . So what is the answer to the universal perplexity pertaining to auto repair? First of all, start shopping for a repair facility BEFORE you need one. Why? Because a more sound decision is made when you're not facing an urgent need for transportation because your vehicle just broke down. We all make poorer choices when we are under the stress of the moment. AOL Autos: 10 best cars of 2009 . Call around to various repair shops and ask them if they are members of associations such as: ""NAPA Autocare,"" ""ASP,"" ""Parts Plus,"" ""AAA,"" or ""TechNet."" Membership is these associations means the shop has qualified in some way. For instance, to become a AAA Approved Auto Repair Facility, a shop must undergo a rigorous investigation. In addition to having state-of-the-art equipment, training, qualified technicians, and information systems in place, the shop must score high with its customers. AAA contacts about 100 of the shop's most recent customers and conducts a CSI (Consumer Satisfaction Index) study. AOL Autos: Top 5 crossover vehicles . They ask the customers such questions as: . • Was the estimate accurate (or significantly less than the actual bill)? • Was the job done on time? • Did they fix it right the first time? • What kind of warranty did they give you? • Was the shop clean and presentable? • Did they offer a ride to work or wherever you needed to go? • Was there a comfortable, pleasant, and clean waiting area? If the repair facility passes the test, it can hang the ""AAA Approved"" shingle. As you can see, membership in associations such as the ones mentioned above is a significant qualifier for a shop. AOL Autos: Best selling sedans . Visit the shop. Is it clean and orderly? Or does it look like it ought to be condemned by the health department? Ask customers in the shop, ""Why do you do business with this shop?"" Answers such as ""They are the cheapest"" or ""They offer a lot of specials"" or ""Because the owner is a friend of my father's"" don't have much credibility. Look for responses such as: . ""They fix my car right the first time.""  ""I can trust them to do the job at a fair price.""  ""They welcome my questions and concerns and take the time to answer them."" ""There are never any surprises when I come to pick up the car.""  ""They patiently explain in plain English what the problem is and explain my options."" AOL Autos: Cars with best resale values . While at the facility, look for certifications displayed on the wall. If there aren't any, then ask to see their qualifications; this will tell you a lot about the facility. What shingles and certifications should you look for? • Do the technicians have certification from ASE, Delco, ASP, and/or manufacturers such as GM, Ford, Chrysler, Toyota, Nissan, etc.? • Do they have after market training from such leaders as NAPA/Echlin, Moog, TRW, or Bendix? • How about continued education from BOCES or a technical college such as an Alfred University or Erie County College Vehicle Training Center? These shingles indicate that the technicians have taken the initiative to go beyond the requirements to keep up with the changes in their field. This indicates serious interest as well as pride in their work (not to mention the fact that they are trained in the latest technology). And this extra training not only takes time, but costs them a lot of money! In addition, membership in such associations as the BBB (Better Business Bureau), ATEA (Automotive Technology and Energy Association), ASP (Automotive Service Professionals), ICAR (Inter-Industry Conference on Auto Collision Repair), and ASE (The Institute for Automotive Service Excellence) tells you that the owner of the shop cares about the quality of the workmanship and, most likely, operates by a code of ethics required by the association. In addition, membership in these associations usually means that the shop is willing to subject itself to an arbitration process that is binding, should the need for arbitration between customer and shop arise. Another factor to consider when choosing a repair facility is the equipment available. Is the shop equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, such as hand held computer scanners and diagnostic software, digital volt-ohm meters, logic probes, lab scopes, and on-line computer systems like CAS, Alldata, or Mitchell-On-Demand? Don't be afraid to ask the shop if they have this equipment. These systems and tools are necessary to diagnose and repair your hi-tech car accurately. Without them, fixing your automobile is a hit-and-miss proposition. Sometimes it's best to take your car to a specialist. Specialists cost more money initially. But because they are specialists, they often know how to pinpoint and repair certain types of problems more efficiently and effectively. Why? Because they deal with these problems every day, plus they have the knowledge, equipment, and information systems necessary to get directly to the problem. While ""Joe down the street"" is floundering and replacing parts trying to correct the problem, the specialist diagnoses with laser-like accuracy. He can locate the problem and replace only the parts that are necessary. Less guesswork and fewer parts translates into money in your pocket, even though the labor rate is higher! Don't be short-sighted! Common areas of automotive specialties: . • Transmission and Drivetrain . • Computer, Drivability, and Electrical . • Collision Repair . • Foreign Car Repair . • HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning) • Radiator Repair & Cooling System Repair . Remember, consider the long-term cost. Don't sell yourself short for a few bucks. Quality repair is not expensive ... it's PRICELESS! Equipment, information systems, and technical training must be up to date! A final note about shop size. Some people think that the cost of repair varies with the size of the shop (a large shop or dealership is probably more expensive). Not true! These days, with the high cost of equipment, training, and information systems, the cost of repair at dealerships, large repair facilities and small shops is balancing out. As a matter of fact, in a lot of cases, I see the larger entities, such as the dealers and larger repair facilities, offering competitive pricing to the little guys. If service facilities meet the criteria I discussed (and the quality of the parts and warranties are similar) you will find prices are about the same, regardless of size. So your decision at this point is a matter of whom you feel most comfortable dealing with. Some people prefer a larger shop or their dealership, others prefer a smaller shop. Don't trust your $25,000 automobile, which carries your family through life's daily trips, to just anyone. Pick your repair facility like you would your family doctor. In the long run, this approach saves you not only money, but time and aggravation. Even more importantly, a well maintained vehicle is a safer one. Tom Torbjornsen is a veteran of 37 years in the auto service industry, an automotive journalist registered with IMPA.","Start shopping for a repair facility before you need one .

"(CNN) -- Tunisia's interim Prime Minister Ali Laarayedh has confirmed that he will submit his resignation Thursday, the state news agency reported, as part of a deal aimed at putting the North African country's transition to democracy back on track. His successor, Industry Minister Mehdi Jomaa, is expected to announce a new caretaker government before the end of the week. Laarayedh will hand his resignation to President Moncef Marzouki Thursday afternoon, the state-run TAP news agency said. Tunisia -- the cradle of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings that toppled autocratic leaders in one of the most conservative corners of the world -- has been in crisis since the killings of two secular opposition leaders by gunmen last year. Thursday's move is in line with an agreement between the government and opposition last year to end a political deadlock. That deal foresaw the ruling Islamist Ennahda party handing over power once parties had finished writing a new constitution and appointed an electoral commission to oversee new elections. Tunisia's national assembly has been voting on the last clauses of the new charter this week and on Wednesday appointed the electoral committee. Economic woes . The once-banned moderate Islamist Ennahda party won elections in October 2012 -- the first after the January 2011 ouster of former autocratic leader Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali -- and formed an Islamist-led government. But political turmoil has beset the North African country, which relies heavily on foreign tourists for revenue, and the presidency has declared a state of emergency. One of the most secular nations in the Arab world,Tunisia slid into a stalemate after the assassination of two secular politicians, widening divisions over the role of Islam. Ennahda condemned the killings, but the opposition accused it of failing to rein in radical Islamists. The political wrangling that followed has threatened to disrupt a democratic transition in a country once seen as a model of post-revolutionary stability in a still volatile region. The uneasy compromise between Ennahda and the secular opposition in Tunisia's transition contrasts with instability affecting Libya, Egypt and Yemen, countries which also ousted leaders in the 2011 Arab Spring. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Saad Abedine contributed to this report .","Ali Laarayedh's resignation is part of a deal struck between the government and opposition .

"(CNN) -- What is it like to live in the tallest building in the world? Well, if the elevators stop, not that great. Unplugged air conditioning and out-of-service elevators became a real threat for residents of the 160-story Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai over the weekend. Emaar Properties, the Dubai developer that runs the tower, warned residents it would shut down building services during a dispute over unpaid fees. ""A circular has been issued to remind and urge residents to pay the service charges to ensure the seamless management of the common areas and other community amenities,"" Emaar's spokesperson told CNN. ""It was sent after repeated reminders to pay the pending service charges and following multiple attempts to get the attention of the defaulting home-owners,"" the spokesperson said. Emaar says some of the residents have failed to pay their fees since 2012 -- and the developer followed through with its pledge restricting some services in the building on Sunday. Local newspaper The National reported that the developer has disabled residents' access to communal areas. In the letter, Emaar cautioned residents that the access cards of those who fail to pay will be disabled and entry to the garage, gym, pool, and tennis courts would be denied. ""Home-owners who have paid service charges will continue to enjoy seamless access to all common area amenities,"" Emaar said. Service charges are a contentious issue in Dubai with many tenants caught in the middle of disputes between their landlords, who often view the fees as too high, and the developers who run the buildings. The Real Estate Regulatory Agency in Dubai has been trying to enforce tougher regulations that would require developers and landlords to disclose service charges payments before renting their property out. There are 900 luxurious apartments spread across floors 12 to 108 in the Burj Khalifa skyscraper. While Emaar did not disclose the cost of rent in the tower, real estate agents offer one bedroom apartments in the building for around $55,000 per year -- paid in full, in advance. The service charges, which are at the center of the dispute, add another $25,000 to the annual bill.","Emaar Properties, which runs Dubai's Burj Khalifa, threatens to suspend services .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- An 8 year-old boy was hanged by militants in Afghanistan's Helmand province after the boy's father -- a police officer in the southern city of Gereshk -- refused to comply with militants' demands to provide them with a police vehicle, officials said. Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the hanging, saying ""this action is not permitted in any culture or any religions,"" according to a statement Sunday, which provided details of the incident. Karzai said he has ordered local authorities to root out the militants and arrest them ""as soon as possible."" The boy was kidnapped Friday. It was unclear when he was killed. The incident comes amid a recent wave of attacks on local officials who are considered anti-Taliban. Less than two weeks ago, Ahmed Wali Karzai, Karzai's half-brother and a provincial council chief in neighboring Kandahar, was killed in his home by a longtime bodyguard. Elsewhere on Sunday, formal ceremonies marking the handover of security to Afghan forces took place in Kabul and Panjshir province. They are the fifth and sixth areas to be transferred to national forces. Last week, the capital of Helmand province -- Lashkar Gah -- was transferred to local control as NATO begins a drawdown of troops. The area was a scene of heavy fighting and stiff resistance last year as a coalition ""surge"" swept southward in an effort to drive Taliban forces from their traditional heartland.","The boy's father, a police officer, refused to provide militants with a police vehicle .

"London (CNN) -- The euro club has suffered major shockwaves but its newest member has emerged as a shining economic light. Estonia, which joined the euro in January 2011, has shaken off its painful Soviet Union history and a credit-fed boom and bust to rebuild itself as an economy with shrinking unemployment numbers and growth far exceeding its peers. The fortunes of the small Baltic country, perched on the edge of northern Europe, run in stark contrast to the eurozone's troubled south, where unemployment has soared to record levels and recessions are becoming entrenched. But Estonia's finance minister, Jurgen Ligi, told CNN Greece -- the eurozone's most troubled nation -- was ""paradise"" compared to what his country had suffered after the USSR fell. Estonia, vice-chair of last week's Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation Ministerial Council Meeting in Paris, joined the euro seven months after Greece had taken its first bailout and as the common currency slid into crisis. Ligi told CNN joining the euro was a ""natural choice"" for a ""small open economy."" The country, which has just 1.3 million people, had always been ""very much dependent on the eurozone, and now we are participating and influencing the decisions,"" he said. WATCH MORE: Post-Soviet winners and losers . Accession to the eurozone, despite its problems, ensured the country offered a more stable currency, which gave confidence to investors, Ligi said, as well as showing ""solidarity and political cooperation. ""Sometimes you have obligations that you don't like but [do them] for general stability."" Ligi said the austerity drive being pushed through Europe barely justified the label. ""I would not use the word austerity in Europe, where the size of the social system is half of that of the world and consumption level among the highest."" Estonia went through its own harsh program of cuts in 2009, slicing back state salaries and freezing pensions, after its real estate bubble went bust. The program helped ensure Estonia stayed inside the rules of entry to the eurozone. The country's growth rate averaged 8% between 2003 and 2007, before crashing into recession in 2008: its GDP shrank 14.3% in 2009 but has since rebounded. According to Ligi, real GDP will recover to pre-crisis levels next year. Ligi said the contraction was based on a ""credit, real estate and consumption bubble"" while today's economy ""is on a much stronger basis."" Estonia's debt to GDP ratio remains markedly lower than that of its European peers, sitting at 10.1% compared to Greece at a heady 156.9% and Italy at a painful 127%. WATCH MORE: Doing business in Estonia . Estonia's export economy is also supported by its strong links with Scandinavian countries, including Finland and Sweden. Its unemployment, at 10%, remains high but lower than the eurozone as whole, which now sits at 12.2%. The OECD has predicted this will rise to 12.3% in 2014. Estonia's youth unemployment sits at 23%, again lower than the eurozone's 24.4%. The former Soviet nation has built itself into a free market, highly educated country with a strong telecommunications industry.

It drove through an ambitious program of connectivity credited to Toomas Hendrik Ilves, the bow-tie wearing former ambassador to the United States who is now the country's president. Ligi said the country did not forget the crisis which followed its independence, when inflation reached 1000% and it underwent rapid monetary reform. ""We have been making right and sustainable decisions,"" Ligi said. ""There are lots of countries with similar history and situation than Estonia are not taking advantage. He added: ""This is no miracle that Estonia is developing quicker than the others."" Estonians bore with structural changes with the culture of practicality, Ligi said. ""[Estonians] are very rational ...we have a lot of common sense,"" he said. ""We appreciate solidarity but we do not forget personal responsibility."" The country's leaders -- including Ilves -- have also proved feisty defenders of their economic reforms. In an infamous Twitter battle with Nobel economics prize winner and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, who questioned whether Estonia's GDP recovery could be classed as an ""economic triumph,"" Ilves slapped down the ""smug, overbearing & patronizing"" report.","The euro club has suffered major shockwaves but its newest member has emerged as a shining economic light.

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova's wait for another WTA Tour title must continue after the four-time grand slam champion suffered a shock defeat in the semifinals of the Paris Open on Saturday. Top seed Sharapova would have moved back to fourth in the world rankings by winning her 30th career crown this weekend, but was beaten 4-6 6-3 6-4 by fellow Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. ""I started the match really well, but as the match continued I wasn't doing the things that really helped me in the first set,"" said 2012 French Open champion Sharapova, who returned to the tour in January after missing the final third of last season with a shoulder injury. ""I wasn't being aggressive, I wasn't in the court -- she was playing with a lot of confidence in the match and I gave her that opportunity to play her game."" Since requiring shoulder surgery back in 2008, Sharapova has struggled for consistency with her serve, and that was apparent in Melbourne when she lost in the last 16 to eventual runner-up Dominika Cibulkova, and again in the French capital. The 26-year-old, whose last tournament win came last April in Stuttgart, ended the match with two double-faults. ""They obviously came at the wrong time,"" said Sharapova, who heads to her former home of Sochi on Sunday to start her role as a TV commentator at Russia's first Winter Olympics. ""When I was down in games in the first couple of sets I felt my serve really helped me, but in the third set I didn't keep that level up. I definitely need to improve that percentage going forward."" Pavlyuchenkova, ranked 26th, will next take on either Sara Errani at the indoor event as she seeks the sixth WTA title of her career -- but first in a Premier-level event. ""I had to serve well -- I had no choice today, because Maria has one of the best returns on the tour,"" she said. ""We played a few years ago and she broke me a lot of times."" Errani, beaten by Sharapova in the 2012 final at Roland Garros, battled to a 7-6 (7-3) 3-6 7-6 (7-5) win over Alize Cornet in just over three hours after the Frenchwoman battled back from 5-3 down in the decider. Meanwhile, a weakened Serbian men's team crashed out the Davis Cup in the first round on Saturday, losing 3-0 to a Switzerland side bolstered by the presence of 17-time grand slam champion Roger Federer and Australian Open winner Stanislas Wawrinka. The Swiss didn't need to field their star duo in the doubles, in which Marco Chiudinelli and Michael Lanmer beat Nenad Zimonjic and Filip Krajinovic 7-6 (7-3) 3-6 7-6 (7-2) 6-2. The Serbs, beaten by the Czech Republic in December's 2013 final, were missing rested world No. 2 Novak Djokovic, the injured Janko Tipsarevic and Viktor Troicki -- who is serving a ban for missing a drug test last year. Germany also won 3-0, eliminating a Spain team missing world No. 1 Rafael Nadal, resting after suffering a back injury in his Melbourne final defeat against Wawrinka. France beat Australia by the same margin, while the Czechs took a 2-1 lead against the Netherlands as Tomas Berdych and Radek Stepanek won their doubles rubber in four sets against Robin Haase and Jean-Julien Rojer. Japan went 2-1 up against Canada, while Belgium reduced the deficit to the same score away to Kazakhstan.

"(CNN) -- Gregg Looney is one for tradition. Although he and his buddies didn't catch anything at all during a fishing trip last summer, he had so much fun they all decided to do it again this year. So last week the Dracut, Massachusetts, native and his four longtime friends set out for an entire day fishing off the coast of Cape Cod. What a difference a year makes. After dropping anchor a few miles off of Provincetown at around 8 a.m., Gregg baited his first hook of the day. ""And then all of the sudden, Boom!"" Gregg told CNN. That boom was a 920-pound Bluefin tuna on the other end of his line. ""It dragged us around the ocean for three hours"" he said. ""We had to cut the anchor!"" It took the strength of all of them -- rotating every 15 or 20 minutes -- to reel it in. After the 9-foot-long tuna was taken back to the dock, it was cleaned, stripped of the bones and was sold for $4,000. It was enough tuna to fill nearly 2,000 of the 5-ounce cans sold in the grocery store. Will the gang do it again next summer? ""You bet"" Looney says.

"(CNN) -- In a scathing report recently obtained by CNN, the coroner in the case of a Georgia teen found dead inside a rolled-up gym mat blasted how the initial investigation was handled. Authorities say Kendrick Johnson fell into the mat and suffocated while trying to retrieve a sneaker. His family suspects the 17-year-old was murdered and that someone has tried to cover up evidence in the case. ""I was not notifedi n (sic) this death until 15:45 hours. The investigative climate was very poor to worse when I arrived on the scene. The body had been noticably (sic) moved. The scene had been compromised and there was no cooperation from law enforcement at the scene. Furthermore the integrity of the evidence bag was compromised on January 13, 2013 by opening the sealed bag and exhibiting the dead body to his father,"" wrote Lowndes County Coroner Bill Watson in a report dated January 22. ""I do not approve of the manner this case was handled. Not only was the scene compromised, the body was moved. The integrrety (sic) was breached by opening a sealed body bag, information necessary for my lawful investigation was withheld,"" he said. The coroner's death investigation report was obtained by CNN through an open records request directed at the coroner's office. A second coroner's death investigation report was provided by the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office. The second report, which is not signed nor dated, is not nearly as critical as the first. ""I was not called by investigating officers regarding this death until the afore listed time of notification,"" it read. It was not immediately clear why there were two coroner's reports. The inconsistencies between them were also not clear. When contacted by CNN, a lawyer for the Lowndes County sheriff and the Lowndes County coroner declined to address specific questions about the reports. ""In light of the US attorney's review of this matter, the Lowndes County sheriff and the Lowndes County coroner will not comment further on this case. They will fully cooperate and respond to all inquiries of the United States attorney,"" Jim Elliott wrote in an e-mail. The U.S. attorney's office in Macon, Georgia, opened an investigation into the case last week. While warning his jurisdiction is limited as a federal prosecutor, Michael Moore, the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, said that after a lengthy review of evidence collected by authorities and the family's own investigator, ""sufficient basis exists"" to warrant a formal review of the facts. A Georgia judge on Thursday ruled that pending the outcome of that review, he will decide whether to order a coroner's inquest. Johnson's parents had asked for the inquest. A lawyer for them said they would appeal. Family questions video oddities . Also Thursday, lawyers for Johnson's family raised questions about apparent discrepancies in newly released surveillance images, including missing time codes, gaps and a mysteriously blurry and out-of-position camera that should have been pointed right at the spot where authorities found Johnson's body some 10 months ago. The surveillance images were provided by authorities after a judge ruled they must be released. For instance, in one image, a man seen walking away from the gym in what appears to be an image captured late at night suddenly disappears from a series of images shot by a motion-activated camera. Other images shot at other times capture people walking in that same location, attorney Chevene King said. New footage release in the case of Kendrick Johnson . In another example, King showed reporters images from a camera that he said should have shown the place where authorities say Johnson fell into a gym mat and suffocated. The image was blurry and out of position, he said. While stopping short of directly accusing authorities of deliberately tampering with the evidence, King said problems with the surveillance are only the latest in a series of oddities that have drawn national attention to Johnson's death. His bloody body was found rolled up in a mat at Lowndes High School on January 11. A state medical examiner ruled his death accidental, despite evidence of a neck injury found in a second autopsy conducted by a pathologist hired by the family. His fingernails had been clipped, his clothes were missing and his organs had been removed and replaced by newspaper. ""We have had what I think is a series of events that causes you to raise the question, when does a coincidence stop being a coincidence,"" King told reporters Wednesday in Valdosta, Georgia. King demanded that authorities hand over originals of the surveillance video showing time codes and other evidence that he said could show whether the materials had been tampered with. Elliott, the attorney for Lowndes County Sheriff Chris Prine, said that his client has confirmed the video had not been altered or edited by anyone within the sheriff's office. An attorney for the school likewise said that what was provided to the sheriff's office was the raw feed with no edits. Federal prosecutor will look into Kendrick Johnson case . Kendrick's father, Kenneth Johnson, angrily demanded justice, calling authorities corrupt and vowing the family will not stop until they get answers to what happened to his son. ""The Lowndes County Sheriff's Department, the D.A.'s office, they convict people all the time inside this courthouse,"" he said. ""Should they not be held responsible for the lies they are telling and for the corruption?""","NEW: The scene was compromised, writes Lowndes County Coroner Bill Watson .

"(CNN) -- Debbie Rowe has said she doesn't want fame. But as Michael Jackson's ex-wife and the mother of two of his children, she may now be thrust into the center of the latest high-profile trial related to the superstar's death. Rowe is set to testify this week at the wrongful death trial that Jackson's family has brought against entertainment giant AEG Live. A lawsuit filed by the Jackson family claims that the concert promoter is liable for the death of Jackson because it hired Dr. Conrad Murray, who treated the superstar with propofol, a surgical anesthetic, to help him sleep. A coroner ruled that the superstar's death was caused by an overdose of the drug. Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for Jackson's death in 2011. While the trial thus far has largely focused on key players involved in Jackson's comeback ""This Is It"" tour, it now turns to Rowe, who has largely shunned the spotlight since divorcing Michael Jackson in the 1990s. Jackson's mom: 'I want to know what really happened' AEG Live will call Rowe to testify, and because of her close relationship with Jackson, she could bring some unique insights on the pop singer's life. Rowe, 54, currently lives on a horse farm in Palmdale, California, about an hour north of Los Angeles. She and Jackson met while Rowe was working as a dermatology nurse in Los Angeles for Dr. Arnold Klein. Klein had been the singer's personal friend and dermatologist for years. After Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo in the 1980s, he visited the doctor frequently. Rowe has said in interviews that her friendship with Jackson grew over the course of these visits, and that Jackson expressed a deep desire to become a father. Rowe said she desperately wanted to give him that gift, and they struck an agreement that she would bear his children. ""He was upset because he really wanted to be a dad,"" Rowe said in a 2003 interview with ABC News. ""I said, 'So, be a dad.' He looked at me puzzled. That is when I looked at him and said. 'Let me do this. I want to do this. You have been so good to me. You are such a great friend. Please let me do this. You need to be a dad, and I want you to be.' "" Prince, Blanket celebrate dad's life amid trial . It was while she was pregnant with their first child, Prince, that they wed in Australia in 1996. A year later, Rowe gave birth to their second child, a daughter named Paris. Rowe has said that Jackson was overjoyed by fatherhood and took full responsibility for raising the children. Their marriage, however, did not last. The couple divorced in 1999, and Rowe went on to relinquish custodial rights over their two children. In 2004, however, Rowe tried to reverse that decision when the singer faced child abuse charges. Though she did not win custody, Jackson was ordered to pay her $60,000 in legal fees. Then in 2005, during Jackson's highly publicized molestation trial, Rowe came to her ex-husband's defense and claimed in court that he was a supportive and loving father, though she admitted she had not seen Jackson or her children for several years. The pop star was eventually acquitted on all counts. Shortly after the trial, Rowe moved to Palmdale and continued to live a life out of the limelight until Jackson's death in 2009. Since Jackson's passing, Rowe has reportedly become a permanent fixture in her children's lives and has grown close to daughter Paris. After the 15-year-old's failed suicide attempt June 5, Rowe tweeted about Paris, ""She is strong like her father.""","Michael Jackson's ex-wife is set to testify in his wrongful death trial .

"(CNN) -- ""It's a miracle,"" she told me. ""We can now have a baby that won't have Huntington's disease. I thought I'd never be able to have any kids -- because of the disease."" Her father had died from this disorder, which results from a gene mutation. She feared that she might have the mutation, too. But she was too scared to undergo testing for it. She also worried that if she had it, she might pass it on to her children. This disease causes severe neurological and psychiatric problems, and eventual death at around the same age as one's parent died of it -- usually in one's 40s or 50s. If a parent has the disease, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting it. Woody Guthrie, the singer and songwriter, died of this illness. His children then had to debate whether they wanted to know if they, too, had the lethal mutation. His son, Arlo, for instance, decided not to find out. Many such offspring feel that to undergo this genetic test is to risk ""getting a death sentence,"" i.e., while they may feel fine, they know they have a mutation that will kill them. The woman with whom I spoke was afraid to learn if she had this gene. But she wanted to make sure that her children did not get it. Luckily, a relatively new procedure -- pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, or PGD -- allows doctors to test embryos before they are implanted into a woman's womb, to help ensure that certain gene mutations are not passed on. Using In Vitro Fertilization, sperm fertilize eggs outside the womb, creating embryos. When the embryos are a few days old, one cell is removed and can be tested for hundreds of genes. This woman struggled with what to do. She feared she would be playing God. But she decided to undergo the procedure. The doctor told her that embryos without the mutation were implanted inside her. He did not tell her whether he had identified any embryos with the mutation. Thus, she was able to have a child free of the gene mutation that would cause Huntington's disease, tremendously relieving her and her husband of worries. She still does not know if she has the bad gene herself. But this procedure is raising myriad complex ethical and social issues. It can eliminate gene mutations for untreatable diseases that kill infants and adults. But it can also be used to select embryos based on other genetic factors. Many parents decide that they want to choose, for instance, their future child's gender, and many doctors now use this technology to do so. At some point in the future, tests will no doubt be marketed for genes that, companies will claim, are associated with behavioral traits such as intelligence, sexual orientation, possibly even perfect musical pitch, or physical characteristics like height, blond hair and blue eyes. Many of these claims will be highly questionable. Among diseases, Huntington's is rare in that the gene mutation predicts the disorder. But for most people, common diseases and traits result from combinations of both nature and nurture -- multiple genes, along with various environmental and other factors. So, a particular mutation may contribute in some small way toward a disease or trait, but it would not be the sole determinant. A gene mutation might double your chance of getting a particular disease; say your risk may rise from 5% to 10%, but you would still have a 90% chance of never getting the disease. Profound dilemmas emerge concerning for which genes doctors should use PGD, and who should decide. Most Western European countries ban or heavily restrict use of this technology to serious diseases like Huntington's -- not gender. In contrast, the United States doesn't have laws governing when it can or cannot be used. For example, the procedure has been used to avoid embryos with the gene that increases the risk of breast cancer, though the disease wouldn't affect the child for perhaps 40 or 50 years. Individuals with one of the breast cancer mutations can have their breasts and ovaries removed to prevent disease. Also, by 2065, treatments may exist. And what about gene mutations that have, say, a 20% or 30% chance of causing disease when the child is in midlife? Should parents discard an embryo based on that percentage? This technology is expensive -- about $20,000 for each cycle of IVF -- and many insurance companies do not cover most of the cost. Hence, wealthy parents can afford to eliminate certain diseases from their offspring, while poorer and middle-class parents will not be able to do so. Consequently, over time, certain disease will become relegated to certain social groups, but not others. The gap between the wealthiest 1% and everyone else is already expanding. Should we allow this method to widen it more in the genetic pool? Some people argue yes: Wealthy parents can already afford to send their children to private schools, private tutors, SAT prep classes, while other parents cannot do so. But eliminating diseases is in some ways more extreme. Others see this technology as raising troubling issues of eugenics, which had horrific results under the Nazis, who sought to ""purify"" the gene pool in Germany, and eliminate people whom they felt were genetically inferior. The film ""Gattaca"" and Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel, ""Brave New World,"" depict the dark problems that can ensue. So far, we have allowed parents to choose when to use this procedure. Government regulations might be cumbersome. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the professional organization for physicians working in this area, has issued some guidelines, permitting broad use, but these are not really enforced. Yet many patients, and even doctors, know little about this technology. More education of both physicians and the public is critical. We also need broad discussion and debate about what is at stake, and where to draw the line. ""How beauteous mankind is,"" Shakespeare's Miranda exclaims optimistically in ""The Tempest."" ""Oh brave new world, that has such people in it!"" Huxley used these words ironically. Between her hope and his pessimism may lie the reality -- depending on how we all now respond. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Klitzman.","Robert Klitzman: Testing to screen embryos of gene mutations raises ethical issues .
Klitzman: The upside is it can eliminate mutations that cause untreatable diseases .
But this technology can be abused and some may use it for selective breeding, he says .

"(CNN) -- A man caught on camera beating a woman in front of her young child has been charged on several counts of attempted murder, robbery, burglary and aggravated assault, Essex County, New Jersey, Assistant Prosecutor Jamel Semper said Friday. Shawn Custis, 42, allegedly forced his way into a Millburn, New Jersey, home around 10 a.m. on June 21 and brutally beat the woman while her young daughter sat motionless on a nearby couch. The woman's 18-month old son was sleeping upstairs. Custis fled the house with an undetermined amount of jewelry, Millburn police said. The entire episode was caught on the family's home security camera. Custis was also indicted on counts of endangering the welfare of a child, criminal restraint, and theft, according to Semper. Custis is currently being held at the Essex County Correctional Facility on $750,000 bail, prosecutors said. In the home video obtained by CNN affiliate WABC, Custis repeatedly punches the woman in the face while her daughter watches nearby. He throws her to the floor, chokes her, kicks her multiple times, and throws her down a flight of stairs. He does not hurt the daughter. After he leaves, the woman goes upstairs to retrieve her toddler son and waits with her two children for police to arrive. On the video, the child who witnessed the attack appears to be as young as 5 years old and likely no more than 8. The woman who was beaten told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey that she made a conscious decision to try to remain silent in an attempt to protect her daughter. ""I knew that if I started screaming, my daughter would too, and I was afraid that she would get hurt,"" she said at the time. ""I took it. I didn't cry the entire time."" The woman was later taken to an area hospital, where she was treated for a concussion, chipped teeth, and injuries to her face and legs, according to prosecutors. Custis was arrested in New York City by the FBI Fugitive Task Force and detectives from the Essex County Prosecutor's Office. Custis is to be arraigned on February 28, said the prosecutor's office. Custis' attorney, Olubukola ""Bukie"" Adetula, told CNN that he anticipates Custis will plead not guilty. ""We will do what we have to do to defend this case aggressively,"" Adetula said.

"(CNN) -- The company that makes some Uncle Ben's products says it is recalling bags of flavored rice after people developed flushing and rashes after eating one of the rice varieties. The affected products, known as Uncle Ben's Infused Rice, are sold in 5 pound and 25 pound bags through wholesale distributors, said Mars Foodservices, the company that produces them. The recall doesn't involve Uncle Ben's brand products sold in supermarkets -- such as ready to heat, boxed, bag or cup items -- which are manufactured separately, the company said in a statement. Mars Foodservices said it found out last week that some people at three Houston schools had ""experienced allergic-like symptoms of mild flushing and rash"" after eating Uncle Ben's Mexican Flavor Infused Rice. At that point, the company said, it decided to remove all its infused riced products from the supply chain. ""Our network of distributors, brokers, and sales associates immediately started notifying their customers and collecting the product,"" Mars Foodservices said. But the company found that ""a limited amount"" of the rice is on sale through websites and at some wholesale stores. ""Therefore, we initiated the voluntary recall to ensure that anyone in possession of the product is aware that it should not be served or eaten, but returned to where it was purchased,"" Mars Foodservices said. The company said it is ""continuing to work closely"" with the Food and Drug Administration to investigate the matter. Besides the Mexican flavor, Uncle Ben's infused rice comes in roasted chicken, pilaf, saffron, cheese, Spanish and garlic and butter varieties.","The flavored rice products are sold in large bags through wholesale distributors .

"London (CNN) -- The last time I sat down to interview Julian Assange more than a year ago, he walked out on me, angered by questions about the allegations of sexual assault in Sweden. This time, holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, he had nowhere to go when asked the same question. Assange has taken refuge in the embassy for five months now, refusing to submit to questioning in Sweden over those allegations. He denies doing anything wrong, and says the allegations are a ruse to get him to Sweden, which would then, he claims, extradite him to the United States. ""Look ... there's an attempt to extradite me without charge, without evidence allegedly for questioning."" Ecuador has granted the WikiLeaks founder asylum but the British government insists it is duty-bound to extradite Assange to Sweden. As a result, the Ecuadorian Embassy is now Assange's home. If he steps outside, British police are standing by to arrest and extradite him. But when I met him again, Assange did not seem cornered at all. He was relaxed and friendly. Rumors of ill health, that he had lost a lot of weight, did not appear to be true. He seemed at ease and, despite being confined largely to a small room in this tiny embassy, comfortable. And as if to prove there were no hard feelings, I received a warm kiss on the cheek. Embassy life like 'a space station,' Assange says . Earlier this week I received a call out of the blue: Would you like to come and interview Julian tomorrow? I was surprised, of course, but there was a good reason for it: WikiLeaks is in the process of releasing the ""Detainee Files,"" more than 100 documents from the U.S. Department of Defense outlining the policies and procedures for such infamous prisons as Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo but others as well. So, the short answer to that question was: Yes. The reunion took place on Thursday morning. I've been following the story of WikiLeaks and Assange for sometime now, before they made global headlines with the Afghan War Diary, the Iraq War Files and the massive leak of more than 250,000 diplomatic cables from the U.S. State Department. In 2010, I had read a New Yorker article about a video, released by Wikileaks, that showed an attack on civilians by a U.S. Apache helicopter in Iraq that killed, among others, a Reuters cameraman and a father of two children who were also wounded in the attack. I was intrigued by the concept of WikiLeaks: an encrypted online platform that allowed whistleblowers to leak information anonymously. But I was also curious about the man behind WikiLeaks, Julian Assange. The article painted him as brilliant but enigmatic, staying up all night bent over a laptop receiving anonymous submissions for the WikiLeaks website. So, I thought I'd email him, on the off-chance I got a response. To my surprise, a few weeks later, I got a phone call back. When I first met Assange, I asked him what more WikiLeaks had planned. I was taken aback when he told me casually: ""We're going to do something big. We're going to end a war."" What I didn't know at the time was that Assange and WikiLeaks were preparing to launch the biggest leak of U.S. classified documents in recent memory. Nearly two years and a storm of controversy later, sitting in the same room where he delivered a speech to his supporters from the balcony of the Ecuadorian Embassy, he told me: ""We triggered the end of the Iraq war."" He quickly added: ""Now, that's a rather grandiose statement. But it's true."" He cited commentator Glenn Greenwald and the logic goes something like this: Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki cited documents leaked to Wikileaks as the reason to withdraw legal protection extended to U.S. soldiers in Iraq which ultimately became one of the factors leading to the U.S. troop withdrawal. For more on that, see the extended version of the interview here. Personally, I think that's overstating the impact of WikiLeaks. But he has a point that Wikileaks has changed the political landscape. Governments and institutions now live in fear that they could become the next WikiLeaks headline. Anyone with access and a flashdrive can now anonymously leak secrets to this global platform for all the world to see. Of course, WikiLeaks has plenty of critics and it has suffered due to the allegations against Assange and its financial struggles. The U.S. government has made it clear they believe WikiLeaks' publishing of classified material is illegal and are currently building a case against him. Assange has also been heavily criticized for releasing classified material completely unredacted, potentially putting diplomatic sources into danger. But he has found plenty of support as well. Nowhere more so than in the Ecuadorian Embassy, a small place of fewer than a dozen rooms. Assange occupies an office now converted into a bedroom with a bed, a desk and a treadmill for exercise. About once a week, embassy staff say he practices boxing with a friend for more rigorous exercise. The embassy has installed a shower for him but there isn't much of a kitchen, so most of the food is takeaway delivered by his friends and embassy staff. ""The situation here although I'm confined in captivity to an embassy, is much better than being in solitary confinement in a prison."" He told me, ""So, I am able to work, I am able to speak to you. So, in that sense my mind is free."" Ambassador Ana Alban says he has become part of the family. ""It was difficult for us at the beginning,"" she told CNN. ""We had a person living here 24 hours a day and we didn't know that person, his habits. How he was going to react to confinement. ""What was not normal at the beginning has become normal. He is another one of us here. Somebody that we count on, we talk to, we worry about when we think something has happened to him. We have now an extended and better run family."" His case has become a cause celebre, with Lady Gaga dropping by for tea and fashion designer Vivienne Westwood visiting to display her ""I Am Julian Assange"" T-shirt. Small things have changed since I first met him. His white hair, once chin-length has been cropped short. He has ditched his T-shirts and leather jacket for a formal suit and tie. He's far more media savvy now, at times sounding more like a politician than a former-hacker-turned-activist of global renown. But other things remain the same. He talks passionately about forcing transparency to transform and reform governments and bureaucracies, happily engaging in long debates. He still sees the world's mainstream media as utterly failing in that regard and he's still prone to making grandiose statements. He's more guarded in interviews now. But occasionally you see some of his mischievous humour peeking through. In the interview, I asked him whether he considers himself as a dissident against Western governments. Here's how he answered: ""No. To be a dissident is simply to take the opposite position."" He added: ""You can think of WikiLeaks as simply a function of education. We are just like a library. We collect information about the way the world works. We publish historic documents. And yes, we take the hardest possible case. We look for those things which are very hard to publish and support the rights of publishers and fight for their rights. ""Why do we do that? Well, because we want to live in a better world. But also because it's fun.""","CNN's Atika Shubert meets again with Julian Assange in Ecuador Embassy in London .

"Washington DC (CNN) -- Last month, an independent film titled ""I Want to Be an Astronaut"" about a driven high school robotics student and his dream to become an astronaut premiered aboard the International Space Station 286 miles above the Earth. The film's concept was originally hatched in 2011 when its creator, David Ruck, caught astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson on ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" late one night. Maher's panel was comparing cuts in NASA's budget to the $700 billion used to bail out Wall Street in 2008. Determined to shine a light on the importance of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) programs, Ruck set out to make a film for his master's thesis about high school robotics programs. Ruck's film examines the state of America's space program and captures the passion for human space travel as well as the somber tone that followed the retirement of the Space Shuttle program in 2011. According to various sources, NASA issued layoff notices to about 3,200 contractors after the shuttle Atlantis and its crew of four astronauts landed at NASA's Kennedy Space Center on July 21, 2011, the final mission after a 30-year career. But the film really took shape when Ruck met Blair Mason, then a 17-year-old high school senior keenly interested in space travel. Mason, who is now 19, had wanted to be an astronaut since he was 3 years old. The film follows him as he leads his FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics team in a competition and looks to the U.S. Naval Academy for college. The NASA Robotics Alliance Project (RAP) has been supporting participation in FIRST Robotics Competitions by providing grants to high school teams as well as sponsoring FIRST regional competitions. Blair set his sights on the Naval Academy because it has graduated more astronauts than any other U.S. institution. Now a midshipmen earning academic honors, Blair is majoring in aerospace engineering and computer science with the hope of attending flight school. Blair, who is not permitted by the Naval Academy to speak to the media, acknowledges in the movie that becoming an astronaut is, ""a long and complicated process, and I don't know what I'm going to encounter along the way, but I don't think I'll ever lose that dream."" John Grunsfeld, astronaut and chief of NASA's Science Directorate, who is shown in the film as a mentor to Mason's FIRST Robotics team, said these programs are similar in many ways to how NASA designed, built and tested the NASA Mars Curiosity rover, which is currently exploring the Red Planet. ""NASA always looks forward to seeing how students' innovative solutions are developed and seeing how their creativity might help inspire development of future spacecraft systems,"" Grunsfeld said. Michael Mason, Blair's brother who is now a junior in high school, also caught the robotics bug. ""I joined FIRST Robotics for (several) reasons: I have always loved to build things and see them work, and I saw how happy it made my brother and how much it challenged him,"" he said. ""The robotics team gave me a great idea of what engineering is and has made me want to pursue it as a career."" While the shuttle program has been retired, the United States is still involved in space exploration with various robotic missions, private enterprise and international efforts. According to NASA.gov, ""NASA is committed to human spaceflight beyond low-Earth orbit and the continued development of its next generation spacecraft -- Orion. The Orion spacecraft will take astronauts beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) to deep space. It will provide emergency abort capability, sustain the crew during space travel and provide safe reentry from deep space. The spacecraft will launch on Exploration Flight Test-1, an uncrewed mission planned for 2014."" So what does this mean for kids who dream of traveling in space? Dan Hendrickson, director of Space Systems at Aerospace Industries Association (an association that represents aerospace and defense manufacturers) said there are plenty of opportunities. ""I'm excited for NASA's future and I'm looking forward to the agency's completion of numerous programs that will be brought online in just a few short years,"" he said. ""Between the Commercial Crew program, the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, and the Space Launch System, more vehicles are being built for human spaceflight right now (2014) than at any other point in our history, if (the nation) maintains steady support for these programs."" Ruck and his team passionately hope the film will ""draw attention to the importance of the STEM education as it relates to our nation's ability to remain on the cutting edge of science and technology to create jobs of the future."" Ruck personally believes, ""We need a vibrant space program to provide the context needed for young people to pursue these challenging and exciting career fields."" According to NASA.gov and Whitehouse.gov, the 2014 NASA budget is $17.7 billion dollars, the same as 2013 and a .3% decrease from 2012. That translates to a $50 million cut from 2012 funding. Ruck's film is slated to be screened in May at the International Space Development Conference in Los Angeles that will host speakers Buzz Aldrin -- the Apollo astronaut who was the second man on the moon, Elon Musk, CEO of Space X, and Gwynne Shotwell, president and COO of Space X. The film will also be presented at the American Astronautical Society's 60th Anniversary celebration on July 16 at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington. Most recently, Ruck and his film were invited to the Humans to Mars Summit 2014 at George Washington University. The film is scheduled to open discussions on how humanity can land on Mars by the 2030s. As Ruck said in a recent interview, ""Our goal with this film is to remind everyone what NASA means to the world, reignite those dreams again, and explore space together.""","Space film follows young man's astronaut dream .

"(CNN) -- Rooting for the Seahawks or rooting for the Broncos in the Super Bowl? Heck, we were rooting for Bruno Mars. The Grammy-winning artist had a tough act to follow this year with his halftime show, given that last year's star performer was Beyonce. And let's be honest -- no one wants to have to follow Beyonce. But we have to admit, Mars rocked the house (or rather stadium) and his obvious joy at performing for what was basically almost the entire world was pretty infectious. For those not familiar with Mars, he's pretty awesome. Here are just a few things to love about the guy: . 1) He was a baby Elvis . As a child growing up in Hawaii, Mars performed with his family in a Vegas-style show. Born Peter Gene Hernandez, he was only 4 years old when his family heard him belting out some Motown tunes and added him to the act, which included his father, Pete, a percussionist, and his mother, Bernadette, a singer who passed away in 2013. According to Mars, when he was a baby his dad wanted to call him Elvis, so at age 6 the tiny singer became one of the youngest Elvis impersonators in the world. Baby Bruno said he loved everything about his idol, including ""his lip."" Too cute. 2) He's a return to the singer-songwriter . Mars doesn't just belt out the tunes, Mars also writes them. While struggling to be discovered as a singer, he got his start in the industry writing and producing hit songs for other artists, including Travie McCoy's ""Billionaire,"" Flo Rida's hit ""Right Round,"" and K'Naan's ""Wavin' Flag,"" which became the theme song for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. 3) He's really good at impressions . His turn on ""Saturday Night Live"" may not have gotten as much attention as, say, Justin Timberlake's, but there was no denying Mars was out of this world when he portrayed an intern at Pandora who has to imitate several artists -- including Green Day, Michael Jackson, Steven Tyler and Justin Bieber -- when the power goes out. Not only was it hilarious, but his version of Bieber's ""Boyfriend"" was quite possibly better than the original. 4) He represents for the vertically challenged guys . He's a whole lot of talent packed into a little frame. Mars is reportedly 5-foot-5. 5) He can always find the bright spot -- even when being arrested . How can we forget that famous mug shot with him grinning when he was arrested for alleged drug possession? Mars later explained the smile by laughingly saying ""I have no idea (why he smiled). It was a picture."" 6) He really is as cute as a Monchhichi . We hooted when fans started pointing out the cropped-haired resemblance to the Monchhichi doll, made popular in the 1980s. But there is no denying either the similarity or the utter cuteness of both. 7) He's a supportive brother . While his star has ascended, there are others in his family who are waiting in the wings to find fame. Four of his sisters have formed a singing group called The Lylas, and last year they launched a reality show on the WE network. While he didn't appear in the first season, his sisters said he offers plenty of advice -- even though when he does, ""We pretty much ignore it,"" they have said. They may want to start listening.","Bruno Mars rocked out during the Super Bowl halftime show .

"(CNN) -- Health officials say the tap water near Charleston, West Virginia, is all right to drink. But many residents aren't buying it. When he runs the hot water, Joe Merchant said, ""within a couple of minutes, I'll have a headache from the steam."" Still other residents have photos of rashes that appeared when they washed their faces or took a bath or shower. On January 9, the chemical 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, or MCHM, was discovered leaking from a storage tank into the Elk River and from there into Charleston's water supply. Its licorice-like smell alerted residents to the contamination and led to a do-not-use order for 300,000 West Virginians, some of whom could not drink or bathe in their water for more than a week. Little is known about the health effects of the chemical, which is used to wash coal before market in order to reduce ash. The spill was originally estimated at about 7,500 gallons, but Freedom Industries said late last month that about 10,000 gallons of chemical had escaped. The company also told regulators that a second chemical -- a mix of polyglycol ethers, known as PPH -- was part of the leak. Officials: Coal slurry spill blackens 6 miles of West Virginia creek . Officials lifted the do-not-use order, saying the chemical was found at very low levels. But some aren't so sure. On Tuesday, West Virginia Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct further studies on the health effects caused by the spill. ""It is critical this study is funded and that work begins immediately,"" Tomblin wrote in a letter to CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden. An independent water test conducted early this month at CNN's request found trace levels of MCHM, both in untreated river water and in tap water from two homes in Charleston. The amounts ranged from less than 0.5 parts per billion to 1.6 parts per billion, well below the 1 part per million that the CDC has said it considers unlikely to be associated with any adverse health effects. ""We stand willing to continue to assist and will be discussing with officials there what additional toxicology and epidemiology studies may be needed,"" said Laura Bellinger, a CDC spokeswoman. ""The official agencies are saying (the water is) OK to drink,"" said Dr. Rahul Gupta, health officer and executive director of the Kanawha-Charleston and Putnam County health departments. ""They're not saying it's safe to drink. That's the word. People are looking for that word."" The CDC, in its official guidance, does not use the word ""safe."" It merely says that based on animal studies, levels of the chemical were calculated at levels where ""a person could likely ingest without resulting in adverse health effects."" In the wake of the spill, two waves of patients sought treatment from private doctors and 10 emergency rooms in a nine-county area for non-specific symptoms such as rash, nausea, vomiting and cough, Gupta said. 5 West Virginia schools reopen after water concern . The first peak -- about 250 patients -- occurred in the first three days after the spill was reported on January 9, he said. A lull ensued during the several days of the do-not-use advisory, followed by a second peak -- about the same number -- during the first few days after the advisory was lifted on January 13, he said. Gupta acknowledged that his findings were ""non-scientific"" and that he did not know what the baseline incidence would be of patients appearing at an ER with such symptoms but said the anecdotes point to the need for further studies. ""Those two peaks are undeniable,"" he said. ""Perhaps there is something going on here."" He's called for a long-term study to be carried out ""in a manner able to capture any long-term impact."" Even at the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department, a sign is posted: Do not drink the water. A sign seen on one restaurant: ""We use only bottled water."" In some places, the chemicals' licorice-like smell persists, Gupta said, including in his own home. He and his wife are avoiding tap water, he said. They're not alone. Only about 1% of the 200 people who attended town hall meetings in late January about the matter saying they were drinking it, Gupta said. In a recent survey, only 4% of area residents said they are drinking tap water. Asked whether he wants to hear the word ""safe,"" Gupta said, ""absolutely, I do."" ""The question becomes, is a pregnant mom going to drink it? Should developing brains of children be drinking it?"" The CDC has expressed similar concerns. ""Due to limited availability of data, and out of an abundance of caution, pregnant women may wish to consider an alternative drinking water source until the chemical is at non-detectable levels in the water distribution system,"" it said in a paper dated February 5. ""For mothers with babies, there is no research that suggests consuming water with these low levels of MCHM poses any health risk to their baby. However, if you have any concerns, please consult your doctor."" Another chemical leaked from West Virginia plant, company says . But the West Virginia Poison Center said in a posting on February 10 that some symptoms, such as nausea and headaches, may not indicate that the chemicals were harmful. ""These symptoms are not due to toxic effects but are a body's physical and real response to unusual smells/tastes,"" it said, adding that the poison center received calls from more than 1,900 patients reporting chemical exposures related to the drinking water in the days after the spill was reported. ""Most reported symptoms included mild rashes and reddened skin from dermal exposure, or GI distress (nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea) from ingesting contaminated water. The symptoms tended to be mild and self-limiting."" It urged that anyone with continuing symptoms be evaluated for other medical conditions and noted that viral gastroenteritis, influenza, the common cold and other infections are all common at this time of year. A spokeswoman for West Virginia American Water Co. said the company was continuing to flush the system to get rid of pockets of licorice smell that remain. ""For us, it's not over until we resolve the odor issue,"" said Maureen Duffy. Dr. Tanja Popovic, the director of the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health, said February 5 that repeated testing had shown the water to be acceptable for all uses. ""What I can say is that with all the scientific evidence that we have, with everything that numerous people have worked on so far, I can say that you can use your water however you like,"" Popovic said. ""You can drink it; you can bathe in it; you can use it how you like."" Tomblin said that tests had shown levels of less than 10 parts per billion or too low to detect and that he and his staff had been drinking the water ""for the last couple of weeks."" But when asked whether he could declare it ""100% safe,"" he said, ""No."" ""The only thing that we can rely upon is what the experts tell us, and, you know, for all the tests done, that's who we've got to depend upon,"" Tomblin said. A federal grand jury is investigating the spill at Freedom Industries, sources familiar with the grand jury's activities have told CNN. CNN's Elizabeth Cohen and John Bonifield reported from Charleston, and Tom Watkins reported and wrote from Atlanta. Ashley Hayes, Stephanie Gallman and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","Residents have been given the all-clear to drink the water near Charleston .

"(CNN) -- A chain of Phoenix-area car washes that's raised thousands for local charities, including numerous law enforcement agencies, found itself the target of a sweeping raid Saturday by law officers. Special agents from Immigration and Custom Enforcement's homeland security investigations unit conducted raids at 13 Danny's Family Car Wash locations in central Arizona, plus three locations tied to its outsourced staffing service provider, HR Betty, said ICE spokesman Andrew Munoz. ""We are ... going after businesses that are a magnet for unauthorized workers,"" Munoz said. The action came as part of a criminal investigation into alleged criminal fraud, identity theft and financial violations, according to the agency. Few details were immediately available, though more would come out if an indictment in the case is unsealed. U.S. settles case in immigration raids, must follow new guidelines . Authorities began executing federal search and arrest warrants around 11 a.m. (2 p.m. ET). By 5:30 p.m., the operation was still ongoing at some locations, according to Munoz. The ICE spokesman said he did not know how many people might be arrested. But those who are detained Saturday are expected to make their initial appearances in federal court on Monday. A phone call placed Saturday afternoon to Danny's Family Companies corporate offices was not immediately returned, and there was no answer when CNN called one of its car wash locations. Its website, as well as local news reports, tout that Danny's car wash locations have been sites of numerous fund-raisers. A recent one involved members of the Phoenix, Gilbert, Scottsdale police departments, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office and various fire departments raised $57,000.

"(CNN) -- We're a little suspicious of Jimmy Kimmel now thanks to his numerous hoaxes, but he wouldn't joke about a baby, right? On a pre-taped episode of ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show,"" ABC's host of ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" revealed that he and his wife of close to a year, Molly McNearney, are expecting their first baby together. Even DeGeneres was a little skeptical when Kimmel confirmed his wife is pregnant, but Kimmel assured her that he was being serious -- ""unless she's kidding,"" he quipped. The late-night host, who married McNearney in 2013, has two kids from a prior marriage that lasted from 1988 to 2003. With two-thirds of his brood already into adulthood, Kimmel, 46, admits it's going to be a little awkward to start again. ""I don't know where they are, but I hear they're doing great,"" Kimmel joked. ""No, I have a 20-year-old son, and a 22-year-old daughter, and I've really forgotten everything. I was just with friends who just had a baby, and there are new ways to do things; you hold them by the front of the neck now!"" (Those friends happen to be John Krasinski and Emily Blunt, who welcomed their first child, daughter Hazel, on February 16.) Kimmel claims that when he broke the news of the impending arrival to his daughter, he said, ""Listen, there's only so much love I have to give, and you're going to have to split it up with the new kid. There's a finite amount of love, and that's that. So they're dealing with it."" While the star might think it's ""very weird"" to have a kid at his age -- ""I'm going to be one of those old dads!"" he told DeGeneres -- his age has nothing on the baby names he's thinking of.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Secret Service has made some staffing and rule changes in the wake of recent incidents involving agents and alcohol in Amsterdam and in the Florida Keys. The changes were first reported by the Washington Post. Secret Service agents in the Special Operations Division are now barred from drinking alcohol within 12 hours of duty and 24 hours before the President arrives on location for a trip, a U.S. Secret Service official with knowledge of the rule change told CNN on Tuesday. ""The alcohol consumption directive ... was implemented by a special agent in charge and was limited to the division and employees under his supervision,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Secret Service agents sent home after one found passed out in Amsterdam . Secret Service Director Julia Pierson was called to Capitol Hill last week to explain recent misconduct by her agents. In the latest incidents, three agents who were part of the President's advance security detail were sent home from the Netherlands after one of them was found passed out in a hotel hallway after a night of drinking. Also, a Secret Service officer in Florida was involved in a traffic accident and alcohol use was suspected. ""These are isolated incidents of misconduct and we're working every day to correct our behavior,"" Pierson told reporters on Tuesday after leaving a closed meeting with top senators on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. ""We're human and we make mistakes,"" she said. Pierson ""maintains a zero tolerance policy regarding incidents of misconduct and continues to evaluate the best human capital practices and policies for the workforce,"" said U.S. Secret Service spokesman George Ogilvie, by way of announcing changes. He said personnel were being reassigned ""as a result of staffing rotations and as a result of assessments made after two recent incidents of misconduct. These assessments of the Special Operations Division include personnel, staffing, scheduling practices, etc."" The spokesman added that the Secret Service has not implemented or changed any agency-wide policies regarding alcohol. ""Policies that would affect the entire workforce are currently under review by leadership,"" Ogilvie said in a statement. Secret Service director discusses misbehavior of agents .

"(CNN) -- The Spanish town of Pioz boasts views of snow-capped mountains, a 15th-century castle, and a swimming pool for locals to bathe in -- but residents are in short supply. Pioz has become a ghost town, a haunting reminder of the country's continuing property crisis. Pioz is saddled with €16 million of debt, making it Spain's most indebted town. Thousands of newly-built homes remain empty and vandalized years after they were built, other projects are simply unfinished and unpaid for. The town is in the municipality of Guadalajara, just an hour's drive from Madrid, but commuters weren't lured in by the new-build homes. Today, only 3,500 people live in these housing estates designed for 25,000. The Spanish property boom went bust in 2007, and now 20% of Spanish homes lie empty. The banking sector has €186 billion-worth of troubled real estate assets on its books. It is easier to grasp the impact of these statistics when standing on a street in Pioz. Row upon row of identical homes stand empty, complete with boarded-up windows, peeling plaster, hanging electrical cables and falling down ""For Sale"" signs. At the heart of the town stands an iconic 15th-century castle; despite the ravages of time it appears to be in better shape than many of the newer crumbling homes that surround it. However, looks can be deceiving. ""It's falling down,"" said ex-Mayor Amelia Rodriguez, ""we were thinking of doing some restoration work on it, but owing to the crisis it is not possible. We will leave it until one day when we can."" Elsewhere in the town lie newer constructions: A €1 million community swimming pool that had just one bather on CNN's visit, a €500,000 medical center and a €12 million sewage and water treatment plant, neither of which can be used due to lack of funds for running costs. According to Juan Yunta, the Director of Public Works in Pioz, the €400,000 toxic waste plant, subsidized by the European Union and Department of Industry, has problems that don't stop at the running costs -- there is a dispute over who actually owns the land. ""Everything has been built on land which doesn't even belong to the town hall,"" he said. ""Fiasco? As far as I know fiasco is when something breaks, like a natural disaster, this is something far greater -- this is utter madness."" Amelia Rodriguez has been the mayor of Pioz for just over a year, but since CNN visited has been ousted from office by the previous mayor Emilio Rincon and six councilors. She hopes that future town planners and property developers will learn from their mistakes. ""As the money came into the town hall, they didn't realize it would ever stop,"" she said. ""The good times do come to an end. We'll go back to the good times, but for now we must wait. I hope this is a lesson for everyone.""

"(CNN) -- The media got it wrong when it came to reporting about actor Philip Seymour Hoffman's death, the late Oscar winner's friend said Wednesday in an exclusive broadcast interview on CNN's ""New Day."" Not only did the reporting inaccurately depict Hoffman as a man in a death spiral, playwright David Bar Katz said the press also was lax when it came to a National Enquirer story claiming he and Hoffman were lovers. The report, since debunked, was cited in mainstream outlets. ""I don't know why they did it,"" he said of the Enquirer. ""I know that it's lousy journalism."" Katz sued the Enquirer over the story, reaching a settlement in which the tabloid agreed to fund an award for unpublished playwrights in Hoffman's memory. Hoffman died of apparent drug overdose February 2. Katz found his body. On Wednesday, the National Enquirer took out a full-page ad in The New York Times saying it ""made a good faith error by publishing an interview with a person who falsely and convincingly claimed to be Mr. Katz."" The real Katz told ""New Day's"" Chris Cuomo he believes the Enquirer was misled but he was still stunned the publication ran with the story without cross-checking it with other sources -- and that other media outlets picked it up. ""I always knew they made stuff up, but I never knew they made up even having an interview with someone that they never had, and then the degree of seeing how everyone picks it up and, as you just said, treats it like news,"" Katz told Cuomo. More broadly, Katz said the media had gotten the narrative wrong when it came to Hoffman's life and death, saying the well-respected actor was not in a destructive death spiral the night he died. ""I can just say that I think a lot of it has been totally overblown,"" he said. ""It gives a false picture of him because he was focused, he was working, he was focused on his family, he was not a partyer, he was not someone that was in a spiral, he was not self-destructive in any way."" ""It's a clichÃ© that makes it very easy and that people like, but Phil was not that guy,"" Katz said. When police were called to the actor's fourth-floor Manhattan apartment, they found him lying on the bathroom floor with a syringe in his left arm. Investigators discovered close to 50 envelopes of what they believed was heroin in the apartment, law enforcement sources said. They also found used syringes, prescription drugs and empty plastic bags of a type commonly used to hold drugs, the sources said. Katz declined to talk about what police found in Hoffman's apartment. But he said the actor had been sober ""most of his adult life"" and suffered an unfortunate relapse. He said he hoped Hoffman would be pleased by his efforts to set the story straight but said his friend would as likely have other things on his mind. ""He would more be amused that I spilled ink on my pants and I was on national television and giving me a hard time about that,"" Katz said.

"CARACAS, Venezuela (CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez says he would be willing to accept prisoners from the Guantanamo Bay detention center, which U.S. President Barack Obama has said he will close, the Venezuelan government said Thursday. President Obama has pledged to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Chavez also said he hopes the United States will give Cuba back the land on which the naval base is located, the government said in a news release. ""We would not have any problem receiving a human being,"" the government release quoted Chavez as saying in an interview Wednesday with Al Jazeera TV. The United States obtained the Guantanamo base in 1903, after Spain's surrender in the Spanish-American War of 1898. In 2002, then-President George W. Bush opened the detention center to hold what the Bush administration categorized as enemy combatants captured in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. U.S. officials have not said what will happen to prisoners at the camp when it closes, nor are there are any known plans for any to be sent to Venezuela. Chavez attended the second summit of South American and Arab heads of state in Qatar earlier this week. Speaking about Israel, Chavez said new Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is supported ""by the extreme right,"" the government release said. ""I hope someday the Hebrew people will be liberated from that caste,"" the release quoted him as saying in the 90-minute Al Jazeera interview. From Qatar, Chavez traveled to Iran, where he met with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Thursday. Maria Carolina Gonzalez contributed to this report for CNN.","Hugo Chavez would be willing to accept Guantanamo inmates, Venezuela says .

"(CNN) -- Every morning at 7:30, Hiroshi Ashitomi trudges up sand-dusted steps, pries open a metal folding chair and joins a handful of his fellow retirees under a plastic tent, facing seaward. They are staging a protest. Their sit-ins are in opposition to a perceived threat that many of his neighbors also fear: the planned expansion of a U.S. military base on Okinawa's east-facing Henoko Bay. Last week, however, the routines of both Ashitomi and the U.S. military were upset. And even though the reason for that disruption -- a devastating earthquake and subsequent tsunami -- demonstrated the advantage of having U.S. bases, Ashitomi and others say they will not alter their efforts to get the U.S. military off the island. In the wake of the earthquake, the U.S. military is sending humanitarian aid and technical assistance to the hardest-hit areas of Japan. Many of these efforts are being launched from bases on Okinawa Island, where the United States maintains a permanent military presence under a treaty the two countries signed after World War II. Staging areas in Okinawa allowed U.S. assistance to reach the affected areas faster than aid from many other countries. Perhaps more than at any time in recent memory, the U.S. military has made a compelling case for its presence on Okinawa. But to Ashitomi, who said he views U.S. troops as de facto occupiers, the benefits are outweighed. He is not alone. Susumu Inamine, mayor of the city of Nago on Okinawa, pointed out Saturday that he was elected on a platform of ""no new construction of U.S. facilities"" on the island. He also recited a litany of statistics that many in Okinawa have committed to memory: Seventy-five percent of all U.S. bases in Japan are on Okinawa, an island that makes up less than 1% of Japan's territory, and 20% of the land on the island is taken by U.S. bases. Inamine said his constituents feel that the Japanese central government requires a disproportionate ""burden"" of Okinawans, relative to residents of other parts of Japan. He wants some of the U.S. presence on his island to be relocated to another Japanese island. Still, not everyone in Okinawa is against the influence of the United States, which provides economic and strategic benefits.

"(CNN) -- Nico Rosberg vowed to put on a ""fantastic show"" at Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix after ending Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton's dominance of qualifying. Formula One has been criticized for becoming boring in recent years due to Sebastian Vettel's all-conquering Red Bull, but this season the Mercedes team has taken center stage following a raft of new rule changes. While Vettel failed to make the final session on Saturday -- the second time in three race weekends so far the four-time world champion has suffered such fate -- championship leader Rosberg and 2008 titleholder Hamilton lined up for a shootout in Q3. It was the German who prevailed, denying Hamilton a third successive pole position after the Englishman locked up his wheels on turn one as the last driver still out on the track. ""We're here to put on a great show,"" Rosberg told reporters. ""You could see some action tomorrow between us. Hopefully not, but it's very possible. ""We owe it to the fans, to everybody, to put on a fantastic show, and that's what we'll do."" The quieter V6 engines being used this year have left many, including F1's boss Bernie Ecclestone, lamenting a lack of atmosphere. For the past three years, Bahrain has been one of the most tense dates on the calendar, following the civil unrest which forced the cancellation of the 2011 race. There were reports of peaceful protests outside of Manama on Friday, but organizers were looking forward to a trouble-free celebration of the 10th anniversary of the event -- with the 57-lap race to be held at night under lights for the first time. Vettel has won the race for the past two years, but will start 10th on the grid after new teammate Daniel Ricciardo dropped from third in qualifying thanks to a 10-place penalty from last weekend's grand prix in Malaysia. Hamilton, who won at Sepang after failing to finish the season-opener in Australia, will be ahead of Williams' Valtteri Bottas and Force India's Sergio Perez. McLaren's Jenson Button will start his 250th career GP in sixth behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, whose teammate Fernando Alonso -- a three-time Bahrain winner -- will be ninth. Former Ferrari driver Felipe Massa will start seventh for Williams ahead of McLaren rookie Kevin Magnussen.","Mercedes' dominance continues as Nico Rosberg wins pole position in Bahrain .

"Bekaa Valley, Lebanon (CNN) -- Syrian refugees in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley thought life couldn't get much harsher. But that was before winter storm ""Alexa"" moved in. The rain and snow have since made things even more miserable. Scenes of despair are all around: One young girl, sockless and in slippers, trudges through the snow gathering what's left of it for water. Later, she'll need it to cook with. Across the road, huddling close to the makeshift tents that will barely keep out the rain, let alone protect them from the cold, three teenage boys describe the appalling conditions they're living in. ""There's nothing for us to get warm with,"" Ahmed tells me. He's from Homs and is wearing nothing more substantial than a hoodie. His friend Abdullah, also from Homs, adds: ""We need heating appliances. We need winter clothes for the kids. The adults can take the cold, but the kids can't,"" he said. Aid workers have been quick to mobilize, fanning out across the hardest hit areas in Lebanon. According to the UN's Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the Lebanese Armed Forces, the UNHCR and their partner NGOs have been able to speed up the distribution of additional emergency shelter kits - including plastic sheets, timber and tools - to thousands of refugees living in tents in the Bekaa, eastern Lebanon, so far the region most affected by the storm. The U.N. says that they too are being hampered by the poor conditions. Emergency teams are dealing with blocked roads, and they say, alternate shelters are being prepared. CNN iReport: Refugees brace for snow . ""For the hundreds of thousands of refugees in Lebanon, as well as those in neighboring countries and the displaced in Syria, a storm like this creates immense additional hardship and suffering,"" said Amin Awad, UNHCR's Middle East and North Africa bureau director. ""With Lebanon's help, we're doing everything we can to get rapid additional help to people who most need it."" But the refugees in this particular makeshift camp in the Bekaa tell me help hasn't come fast enough. They say they're still waiting. Close by, adults chop any firewood they can as children, many of them with nothing but slippers on their feet, try to distract themselves from the cold. Some, like sister and brother Khadija and Amjad, from Aleppo, crave the remnants of a childhood long forgotten; they make the most of the frosty conditions by building a snowman. For others though, the needs are more basic: they seek warmth and food. According to the UNHCR, Lebanon is the largest Syrian refugee-hosting country in the region, with 838,189 Syrian refugees either registered as refugees or awaiting registration. So, that means that the country of Lebanon, with a population of just over 4 million, has now grown to over 5 million people due to the growing number of refugees. And, that number is climbing. The UNHCR says that, unlike other countries neighboring Syria, there are no established refugee camps. Instead people are living in the community in nearly 1,600 different areas. Indeed, one of the biggest problems faced by Syrians who've escaped the war at home and come to neighboring Lebanon is that the Lebanese government won't allow for the construction of official refugee camps. Despite continued requests from aid organizations, Lebanese political leaders are too fearful that camps for Syrians will become permanent, just as camps for Palestinian refugees, who began escaping to Lebanon in 1948, did. As the sun begins to set over the ramshackle tents, more fear is setting in. One of the worst winters on record has only just begun. For these desperate souls, the night ahead will be darker and colder than ever.","Winter storm ""Alexa"" has brought snow and rain to Lebanon's Bekaa Valley .

"(WIRED) -- In the time it takes your computer to boot up, you can probably make some toast or a cup of tea before the thing is ready to use. In the near future, you might only have enough time to take a sip of that tea or check your watch. Do you get impatient waiting for your computer to start up? Manufacturers say they're working on that. Mindful of how frustrating the wait is, makers of PCs' basic input/output systems (BIOS) are working on bringing instant-on computing closer to reality with promises of significantly faster boot time. ""People want PCs to be like their toaster. Push a button and it is ready,"" says Steve Jones, vice-president and chief scientist of core systems at Phoenix Technologies, one of the biggest BIOS makers. The BIOS is the first piece of code that a computer runs when it is powered on. Before Windows or Linux can start, the BIOS identifies, tests and gets system devices such as the video display card, the hard disk and other hardware up and running. But running the tests every time the machine powers on can be time consuming. At Intel's developer conference last month, Phoenix announced that the latest version of its BIOS could boot in just about a second by cutting out redundant checks and creating a smarter version of the firmware . Of course, that still leaves the time that it takes Windows to start up, but Microsoft has been working on that, too, and claims that Windows 7 starts up in about 20 seconds, compared to the 50 seconds or so for Vista. The faster boot time will help users, says Nathan Brookwood, a research fellow at market research and consulting company Insight 64. But even with Microsoft's improvements, he says, it is still nearly a minute before the user is completely up and running. ""Every software application today wants to go out there and check for the latest version on boot up, which just gets in the way of what you really want to do. And that is check e-mail,"" he says. Shrinking this digital annoyance is the new quest for PC makers. For most people, computers today have become as much a consumer electronics product as TVs, cellphones and DVD players. That means, consumers expect the same kind of instant response from their computers are they get from other electronics devices. ""If you pick up a phone, you expect to instantly hear a tone,"" says Jones. ""That's the future for computers, too."" Jones says the 'I am ready for use' signaling is an important psychological factor for consumers. ""Bell Labs worked hard on this. They figured if you pick up the phone and didn't hear something within 250 milliseconds, then you would be pretty uncomfortable with the device,"" he says. On PCs, that signaling time has been much longer. Boot-up on PCs is split into two chunks: the BIOS boot up, which is the time taken from pressing the power on button to the time BIOS finishes booting, also known as pre-boot, and the time taken for the operating system to load. Today, this can take anywhere from a minute to nearly three minutes. And that can feel like eternity for users. ""Lots of users today just press the power button and then grab a cup of coffee,"" says Brookwood. ""If the line at Starbucks isn't too long, the system will be ready by the time they're back."" The BIOS has been part of PCs since the first IBM PC in 1981. The firmware initializes every computer to a point where an operating system can come along and with no knowledge of the machine start running. ""The BIOS is doing a lot more than waking up the machine and handing it a cup of coffee in the morning,"" says Brian Richardson, senior technical marketing engineer, for American Megatrends Inc., a major BIOS maker.""It provides a layer so you can buy a PC, take it home, wipe the configuration clean, change it and do it 100 times a day and your OS will still start up."" Running the hardware checks takes time. About 15 years ago, the BIOS firmware in PCs would take up to two minutes to boot. Finding that customers were becoming impatient with the boot times, PC makers started pressing for PCs to be more like appliances with their ability to be switched on instantly. ""Electronics are not supposed to warm up anymore,"" says Richardson. ""So we have been trying to shrink the time it takes to get the machine ready."" BIOS boot times can vary depending on configuration of the PC: More memory and more cards mean it will take longer. Increasingly, operating systems, such as Microsoft's Windows, run initial checkups on boot to verify system details and ensure the most updated versions of the software is loaded. In other words, the OS is doing some of the work that the BIOS traditionally has done. ""Effectively what BIOS makers are saying is that if the OS is not going to believe us anyway, why bother?"" says Brookwood. That's why PC makers are pinning their hopes on a new standard called Unified Extensible Firmware Interface. UEFI hopes to improve the intelligence of the BIOS so it doesn't have to perform all checks every time the computer is powered on. Ultimately, the idea is to run fewer initializations as the computer boots. Phoenix and AMI say there are some machines already whose BIOS is based on the UEFI standard for quicker boot but it will be late next year before a majority of PCs have it. And unlike the BIOS, which is tied to Intel's x86 processor architecture, UEFI will not be specific to any processor architecture. Microsoft's upcoming Windows 7 operating system has also laid out some criteria for PC manufacturers to get hardware aligned in a way that they can meet the company's standards. Microsoft has set a criteria of five seconds for BIOS boot time and 20 seconds for the operating system to boot. That's still nowhere near the instant-on computing dream and promises of faster BIOS risks setting unrealistic expectations among consumers, says Brookwood. There's a way to get instant-on. It's called the sleep mode. ""People assume they get instant-on with their cellphones but no one reboots their cellphone everyday,"" says Richardson. ""So one form of instant-on is never to turn it off."" Another route to quick boot is to do what Dell has done with its latest notebook. Dell's newly launched Latitude Z offers instant boot to check e-mail, calendar, contacts and the web as part of a mode called 'Latitude On.' In it the PC boots from a special chipset running an ARM processor, the same kind of CPU that powers most cellphones, and a slimmed down version of the Linux operating system. The Latitude On mode comes with its own power on/off button. Users can click on an adjacent power button to switch to Windows OS. That gives consumers options, says Robert Thomson, product manager for Latitude Z at Dell. ""When you directly go to the Latitude On mode, you never bring up the main operating system,"" he says ""And when you turn it off, it goes into the suspend mode, which is not like that of Vista or XP but more like what you see in cellphones."" At $2000, the Latitude Z laptop is a pricey answer to the problem of a two-minute boot up time for PCs. And it doesn't give users access to all features and programs that run on Windows OS such as Microsoft Word or Power Point. That's why, Brookwood advocates just staying away from the power off button as much as you can. ""Most systems today have the ability to go to sleep as opposed to being turned off,"" says Brookwood.

"(CNN) -- Electrical stimulation from a spinal cord implant, mimicking the signals the brain would normally transmit to move the body, has allowed a paralyzed patient to stand on his own and walk on a treadmill with assistance, researchers said Thursday. At a news conference in New York City, doctors introduced Rob Summers, a 25-year-old, paralyzed spinal cord injury patient from Oregon. He received continual epidermal stimulation to the lower spinal cord, researchers said, enabling the muscle and joint movements that are required to stand and, with assistance, to step. ""This stimulation causes changes in the brain and changes in the spinal cord,"" said Dr. V. Reggie Edgerton, a professor in the Departments of Integrative Biology and Physiology and of Neurobiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""Now we need to know how this has occurred."" A therapy already in use in a number of U.S. hospitals is known as functional electronic stimulation (FES), in which stimulants or electrodes are placed on the skin above the muscles to help chronic spinal cord injury patients move their limbs and, in some cases, walk with assistance. In the newly unveiled procedure, however, the electrodes are implanted in the patient's body. But even beyond that, there are distinct differences in the two procedures, the researchers said. ""In our case it's a constant signal,"" said Dr. Susan Harkema, a professor at the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of Louisville. ""FES tries to bypass the circuitry by stimulating the muscles externally with electrodes. We allow the spinal cord to control the muscles on its own."" The researchers said in the initial phase of their experiment, Summers was able to reach a standing position, supplying the muscular push himself while his spinal cord was being stimulated electrically. He could stand independently, bearing full weight, for up to four minutes at a time He also began to move his toes, ankles, knees and hips while being stimulated. ""This does not represent a cure for spinal cord injury,"" Edgerton said, ""but it's something to build on."" At today's press conference, Summers, who became paralyzed in his lower extremities following a hit-and-run accident in July 2006, talked about his experience. ""I was able to stand independently, the third day we turned it on,"" said Summers. ""I was amazed. I use it two hours a day now, and I hope to someday go back to playing baseball."" The project, which is outlined in the latest issue of the medical journal Lancet, was funded by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, which provides money for research on spinal cord injuries.","Paralyzed patient, 25, said he is able to stand by himself, walk with assistance .

"(CNN) -- The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform did not go far enough when it proposed the repeal of certain provisions of the mortgage interest deduction. The deduction for mortgage interest should be repealed in its entirety. Most people know that owning a home comes with tax advantages such as the deduction for mortgage interest, but they don't  know how much of an anomaly that is. Most personal, family or living expenses are not tax deductible. They are the result of choices. Your decisions on what to wear to work or whether to pay cash or credit are your personal choices. You don't get a tax deduction. That's why rent is not deductible, even though roughly one-third of Americans are renters -- which includes the majority of blacks and Latinos. Where you live is considered to be the result of a personal choice. The deduction for mortgage interest is a huge exception to the general rule, because what could be more personal than the decision to buy a home? In 1986, an exception was made for home mortgage interest as a way to ""encourage homeownership."" That's the good news for homeowners. The bad news for renters is that the 2010 estimated revenue loss of the tax subsidy for homeownership is greater than $200 billion. By comparison, the entire Housing and Urban Development budget is less than $50 billion. That is a pretty high price to pay to ""encourage homeownership."" But as long as it actually encourages people to buy homes, it could be money well spent. Yet economists generally believe that the mortgage interest deduction does virtually nothing to encourage people to buy homes. During the past 40 years, while tax rates have changed dramatically (making the value of the tax benefits fluctuate), the homeownership rate has been quite stable. The biggest increase in homeownership rates happened after World War II and came after innovations in mortgage financing. That does not mean that homeowners aren't aware of the tax break when they buy a house. In fact, they are paying for the tax subsidy when they buy their homes, because the mortgage interest deduction is built into the price. But homeowners do not decide to buy a house because of the tax break. Research shows that the tax deduction simply rewards behavior -- buying a home -- that was going to happen anyway. The tax subsidy does encourage the purchase of bigger and more expensive homes; tax dollars are subsidizing McMansions. The American people are getting nothing good for their $200 billion subsidy. In order to benefit from the mortgage interest deduction, homeowners must itemize deductions and not take the standard deduction. President Bush's Tax Reform Commission documented that only 54 percent of those with mortgages benefit from the mortgage interest deduction. That means 46 percent of homeowners have paid for the benefit of the mortgage interest deduction when they bought their house but do not receive any tax benefits. So most low-income homeowners are paying for a tax benefit that only a few will receive. The overwhelming majority of homeowners whose household income is $40,000 or less do not receive any tax benefit from mortgage interest payments. Once income hits $50,000, then the majority of homeowners do receive tax benefits. Clearly, tax benefits for the mortgage interest deduction are flowing to middle and upper income taxpayers. While the mortgage interest deduction may help people who are struggling to make ends meet, they are not the only ones struggling. According to a May 2010 Wall Street Journal article, the ranks of renters are increasing because of record foreclosures. Struggling or not, these new renters will not have a tax subsidy. Should we continue giving away a $200 billion subsidy every year to middle- and upper-income taxpayers to ""encourage"" them to do what they were already going to do? We simply cannot afford it any longer. The American public must be convinced that repeal of the mortgage interest deduction is a first step in the larger goal toward creating a tax code that is fairer for all and treats renters and homeowners alike. We all have housing costs. Why should only some get a tax break? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dorothy Brown.","Dorothy Brown: It's unusual to get a tax break for a personal choice such as buying a home .

"(CNN) -- Iraqi police have won back full control of a ministry building stormed by gunmen who took civil servants hostage, the Interior Ministry and security sources said Thursday. Six gunmen were killed in the police operation to retake the Ministry of Transport in northeast Baghdad. Police killed four militants, while two of the militants detonated suicide vests, the sources said. Two police officers were killed and seven injured in the attack. The hostages were freed unharmed. Police earlier said that the militants had overrun the Ministry of Human Rights building, adjacent to the Ministry of Transport. Roads were blocked around the Iraqi capital following the attack, and areas leading to Baghdad's fortified Green Zone were closed. Separately, two car bombs exploded Thursday in different areas in the northeast part of the capital, killing four people and injuring 14 others. One hit a popular market area, a police source said. The United Nations said 2013 was the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008, with almost 8,000 people killed in violence, most of them civilians. Fears of all-out sectarian war have increased since fighting broke out at the end of last year to the west of Baghdad in Anbar province, where al Qaeda-backed militants and Iraqi security forces have been battling for control of Falluja and Ramadi. More than 140,000 people have been made homeless since the new conflict erupted, according to Iraq's Ministry of Displacement and Migration. The United Nations said last week it was scaling up its humanitarian response to help those displaced by the violence.

"(CNN) -- A federal program designed to uncover potential terrorists before they board airplanes is under internal investigation after employees claimed some of their colleagues at Boston's international airport are engaged in racial profiling. Transportation Security Administration officers at Logan International Airport say that fellow employees in the agency's Behavior Detection Program have been targeting minorities for questioning based on their race or ethnicity. The claims, first reported in The New York Times, prompted the TSA to open an internal investigation. ""If any of these claims prove accurate, we will take immediate and decisive action to ensure there are consequences to such activity,"" the TSA said in a statement. Airport screeners closer to having collective bargaining agreement . ""Racial profiling is not tolerated within the ranks of TSA, including within the Behavior Detection Program. Profiling is not only discriminatory, but it is also an ineffective way to identify someone intent on doing harm,"" the statement said. Behavior detection is employed at airports across the country. Boston Logan launched a pilot expansion of the behavior detection program last year, adding casual conversation with passengers as a means to detect behaviors that may indicate security threats. The TSA says officers should flag passengers for additional screening based only on observed behaviors. Some Boston officers have complained to the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. ACLU attorney Sarah Wunsch, who has spoken with 10 officers accusing their colleagues of racial profiling, told CNN that officers are targeting racial and ethnic groups including Mexicans, African-Americans and Brazilians for secondary screening. On Tuesday, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson of Mississippi called for the TSA to suspend the behavioral screening program and requested a congressional hearing. Thompson is the ranking Democrat on the House committee on homeland security . Rep. Bill Keating of Massachusetts, a top Democrat on the House oversight and investigation subcommittee for homeland security, has also called for a probe into the allegations.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- They say one man's trash is another man's treasure and for Tom Szaky, founder and CEO of TerraCycle, that couldn't be more true. His New Jersey-based company is helping millions of people wise-up to waste recycling. But is was a wacky idea that got 29-year-old Szaky started. ""My friends and I were trying to grow some plants and realized worm poop was one of the best fertilizers to feed them,"" Szaky said, ""...and that suddenly started getting me to thinking differently about waste."" He started manufacturing ""worm poop"" and packaging the organic fertilizer in used plastic bottles selling it as ""Waste in Waste"" under the name TerraCycle. Eight years on, the company now turns all sorts of non-recyclable waste from all over the world into recyclable eco-friendly products. ""We collect about a billion pieces of waste every month from close to 25 million people, across 19 countries,"" Szaky explains. Garbage is very much a global problem, he says. But whether it's Sweden (who recycle a lot) or in countries like Argentina, which he says is relatively poor at recycling, TerraCycle's model is consistent. From what he collects, the creations are endless. Juice pouches are made into school folders and kids backpacks; chip bags become bags, even furniture. ""Every Old Navy store (a clothing chain) in America has now started collecting flip flops and we are taking those flip flops and building them into playgrounds around the U.S,"" Szaky said. TerraCycle's influence is also growing around the world, says Szaky, with the company now collecting 6% of Sweden's coffee capsules and 2% of all of the UK's pens. There is no waste stream that cannot be recycled, he says, even diapers and chewing gum. ""We will be taking used gum, literally old chewing gum, collecting it all over Brazil and making it into all sorts of plastic products,"" he said. ""Gum is actually just flavored plastic so we can very easily make it into any plastic product you can imagine."" Trash comes from individuals and major companies around the globe. Schools are also major contributors. ""We are in, I believe, 73% of American elementary schools, actively collecting waste for us and that is the same all around the world,"" he said. ""We find out that kids care a lot about the environment and they are all willing to be engaged and get their hands dirty if you will and bring in waste and make it really happen."" But TerraCycle don't just take the trash away, they also give back Szaky says, paying shipping costs as well as making donations to schools or charities which so far has raised nearly $3 million. Szaky continues to grow the business. A new Facebook game, ""Trash Tycoon"" was recently launched and next year he will steer the company into new markets in Asia and Eastern Europe. All with the aim of saving more waste from landfills and incinerators while spreading the company's mantra, ""Eliminate the Idea of Waste,"" and turning the world's trash into cash.","TerraCycle turns non-recyclable waste into eco-friendly products .

"(CNN) -- Comet ISON may put on a show when it skims through the sun's atmosphere later this year. Right now, it's still far away, but we're keeping track and will give you regular updates. Here are five key facts about ISON as we await its arrival: . What's with the funky name? Comet ISON was discovered by Russian astronomers Vitali Nevski and Artyom Novichonok in September 2012. It's named after their night-sky survey program, the International Scientific Optical Network, a group of observatories in 10 countries organized to track objects in space. How big is it? Measurements taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in April indicate ISON has a nucleus that is 3 to 4 miles across. The comet's head, or coma, is estimated to be 3,100 miles across, or 1.2 times the width of Australia. The Hubble team says its dust tail extends more than 57,000 miles -- more than twice the circumference of Earth, and far beyond the telescope's field of view. OK, it's a comet. Aren't there lots of comets? Why is this one special? Some early comet prognosticators have tagged ISON ""the comet of the century."" ""Comet ISON has the potential to be among the brightest comets of the last 50 years,"" Dennis Bodewits, an astronomer at University of Maryland at College Park, told NASA. Bodewits and other astronomers used NASA's Swift satellite to estimate ISON's water and dust production. How to tell space rocks apart . ""Comet ISON belongs to a class of comets called Sungrazing comets,"" Karl Battams of the Naval Research Lab told CNN. This means it will fly relatively close to our sun. These comets ""teach us not only about comets, but also yield valuable and unique results about the sun,"" he said. But before you get too excited, other experts caution it's too early to know what ISON will do. ""Predicting the behavior of comets is like predicting the behavior of cats -- can't really be done,"" Don Yeomans of NASA's Near-Earth Object Program told CNN.com in March. Welcome to the Year of the Comet (we hope) When can I see it? In November, ISON is expected to fly through the sun's atmosphere at about 700,000 miles above the surface. If it survives the sun's heat, experts say it might glow as brightly as the moon and be briefly visible in daylight. Its tail might stretch far across the night sky. Or the sun could cause it to break apart. Why asteroids don't surprise us anymore . What if ISON breaks apart? Is Earth in danger? No. Experts say the comet won't threaten Earth. In fact, even if it breaks up, Battams says it could put on a big show. ""If Comet ISON splits, it might appear as a 'string of pearls' when viewed through a telescope,"" Battams told NASA. ""It might even resemble the famous Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 that hit Jupiter in 1994."" Whatever happens to ISON, sky watchers in the Northern Hemisphere should have a good view for several months. NASA says it will pass almost directly over the North Pole and will be visible all night long.

"(CNN) -- Just when cruise lines thought they might be headed for calmer waters ... At least 162 passengers and 11 crew members have reported being ill on board Princess Cruises' Caribbean Princess, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute said health officers would board the ship in Houston to investigate the gastrointestinal illness, which is causing vomiting and diarrhea. The news follows reports of sickness this week on another cruise ship, this one from the Royal Caribbean line. Nearly 700 crew and passengers fell ill aboard the Royal Caribbean's Explorer of the Seas, the highest number of sick people reported on any cruise ship in two decades, CDC data show. That ship returned home Wednesday, two days earlier than expected. To compare the cruises, 5.22% of passengers on the Caribbean Princess reported being ill, versus 20.5% on the Explorer of the Seas. The outbreak on board the Caribbean Princess has been confirmed as norovirus, according to Julie Benson, a spokeswoman for Princess Cruises. Are cruise ships floating petri dishes? Noroviruses spread easily and are a common cause of gastroenteritis, which produces vomiting and diarrhea. Norovirus is also suspected on board the Explorer of the Seas, though the cause of the illness there has not been confirmed. Caribbean Princess is expected in Houston early Friday. The seven-day cruise is being cut short by one day. Sick passengers are being asked to stay in their cabins, while staff disinfect public areas such as restrooms and elevators. The decision to cut the trip short was made based on forecasts for heavy fog, not the outbreak, Benson said. CNN first learned of the stricken Princess ship from a Twitter post by the Houston Chronicle. Royal Caribbean cruise ship returns home - with a sickness record .

"(CNN) -- Award-winning entrepreneur Andrew Mupuya was just 16 years old when he decided to take on the world. That was back in 2008, when both of Mupuya's parents had lost their jobs and could only afford to cover his school fees. ""I had to get to meet my basic needs by myself,"" remembers the Ugandan businessman. ""I decided to face the world alone."" Inadvertently, the government of Uganda came to Mupuya's aid. At the time, officials in the country announced that they were considering a ban on plastic bags to curb environmental damage. Mupuya, who was still in secondary school, immediately saw this as an opportunity to launch a paper bag production company. ""I conducted a feasibility study, market research around retail shops, kiosks, supermarkets around Kampala and discovered there is need and potential market for paper bags."" Read this: Sails into sales with bags of love . To start out his small operation, Mupuya figured out he needed a capital of 36,000 Ugandan shillings ($14). He raised the first $11 from selling 70 kilos of used plastic bottles he'd collected over one week. Mupuya then borrowed the remaining $3 from his school teacher and embarked on his entrepreneurial journey producing paper bags on a small scale. Since then, the business has grown extensively and today, at the age of 21, Mupuya is the owner of Youth Entrepreneurial Link Investments (YELI), the first registered Ugandan company to make paper bags. The young entrepreneur employs 16 people who produce up to 20,000 paper bags each week. His long list of clients includes restaurants, retail stores, supermarkets, medical centers, as well as multinational companies like Samsung -- YELI has made about 1,000 niche bags for the local stores of the electronics company.â€Ž . ""Right now I have 72 clients,"" says Mupuya. ""Ninety per cent of our clients always come back."" Green impact . Mupuya's remarkable achievements and shrewd business skills have been recognized with a number of accolades in recent years. In 2012, Mupuya was the winner of the $30,000 Anzisha Prize, a major award given to young African entrepreneurial leaders who take the initiative to address critical needs in their communities. ""The awards I have won give me courage to push on with my business,"" says the young entrepreneur. ""It shows to me how I am doing the right thing and it helps me define the impact am creating."" Read this: Playgrounds made from trash . Uganda has attempted to ban plastic bags in a bid to deal with its acute waste management problem and promote environmental conservation. Yet, they are still used in Kampala and often block drainage systems or collect in heaps on the side of the road. Mupuya, however, believes Ugandans will eventually choose paper over plastic and he even plans to build a recycling operation. ""A paper bag is eco-friendly, it can easily decompose,"" he says. ""But plastic bags take too long, so that is the difference."" 'Just the start' For now, Mupuya sources his paper from Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. His business is housed in Kasokoso, a slum just outside Kampala's bustling city center. Here, everything is done by hand and with precision. YELI employees turn out thousands of bags daily, cutting the paper manually and then folding it and gluing it appropriately. But this takes time, and as customer numbers grow, the team cannot keep up with the increasing orders. Mupuya says one of the biggest challenges for his startup right now is supply and demand. ""It needs time to produce the right quality and quantity to all clients, because it's run manually,"" he says. ""(It's) quite hard to catch up with some clients who are used to cheap plastic bags,"" adds Mupuya. ""My next step is to get a machine because I am only able to supply 5% of the demands I have."" Read this: Fishing craft to foosball tables, furniture to float your boat . Yet Mupuya says that this is a problem that most clients understand, pushing him to keep thinking big and press ahead with his plans to promote environmental conservation. ""My vision is to have a cleaner Africa by eradicating use of plastic bags and emphasis on paper recycling,"" he says. ""I dream of having a big plant where I am able to supply paper bags all over Africa,"" adds Mupuya, ""putting emphasis on sensitizing about environmental conservation."" ""So I believe this is just the start.""

"(CNN) -- ""Can you possibly let me have, at any rate, five hundred dollars to keep us out of the poor house?"" These are not the words you expect to hear from a man who designed one of the world's most famous golf courses. Dr. Alister MacKenzie, the brains behind Augusta National's revered contours and curves -- elegantly showcased each year by the Masters -- died pleading poverty in 1934 and begging for his fee. He never even saw his finished work before his death, which came less than three months before the first Masters tournament was held. ""I have been reduced to playing golf with four clubs,"" he wrote in a letter to Augusta National, recorded in ""The Making of the Masters,"" a book by David Owen commissioned by the club. ""I am at the end of my tether, no-one has paid me a cent since last June, we have mortgaged everything we have and have not yet been able to pay the nursing expenses of my wife's operation."" MacKenzie, a physician turned golf architect, had embarked on a pilgrimage that had taken him from a modest town in northern England to the pacific coast in California. His journey incorporated a stint in the Boer War, which influenced his underpinning principles of course design, and saw his work evolve during the boom and bust years of the 1920s. By the time he was enlisted to build a championship course for all of America by its biggest sports star of the age, MacKenzie was the preeminent golf architect of his time. Bobby Jones had won the grand slam as an amateur in 1930 -- capturing all four major tournaments in the calendar year -- before he stunned the public by announcing his retirement aged just 28. He determined to construct an exclusive golf course in the sun-blushed south of the United States that would offer him twin benefits: sanctuary from his fame and a healthy stream of income. But though Jones declared himself delighted with the finished product, and its architect trumpeted Augusta as his finest creation, MacKenzie was almost destitute by the time he died. He halved his fee to $5,000 in a bid to be paid quickly, but clawed back just $2,000, with several other golf courses also slow to settle their debts. It was symptomatic of the financial difficulties Augusta encountered in its fledgling years, exacerbated by the Great Depression, a fact that seems inconceivable given the club's towering strength in the present day. ""Augusta struggled a lot in the early years and found it very hard to attract members they wanted,"" Adam Lawrence, editor of Golf Course Architecture magazine, told CNN. ""They were really struggling for money. MacKenzie didn't get full payment paid for his work at Augusta -- until he died he was writing letters asking perhaps they could send part of the fee. ""MacKenzie divorced his first wife and was living what would appear to be an expensive lifestyle in California. He was basically bankrupt when he died. ""There were a lot of golf architects from that time who were the same. Most seemed to be terrible businessmen and there were a few bad habits like too much booze flying around."" Humble beginnings . MacKenzie's portrait still watches over the course where his maverick design ideas were first put into practice over 100 years ago. Despite the odd tweak, Alwoodley Golf Club -- just outside the city of Leeds in the north of England -- still boasts many of the original characteristics conceived by the Scot. As Nick Leefe, secretary of the Alister MacKenzie Society, told CNN, the physician's long-held affection for the game even permeated some of his diagnoses. ""How frequently have I, with great difficulty, persuaded patients who were never off my doorstep to take up golf, and how rarely, if ever, have I seen them in my consulting rooms again!"" MacKenzie is reported to have proclaimed. This love of golf sparked an interest in course architecture after a period serving during the Second Boer War, between the British and the South African Republic, at the turn of the 20th century. ""The attitude of the Boers towards camouflage got him interested in disguise and trickery,"" Leefe explains. ""People suggest this is the reason he came back after the war and took an interest in golf design."" When a group of businessman joined together in 1907 to build Alwoodley, MacKenzie presented his designs and had them rubber-stamped by Harry Colt -- another famed architect of the age who worked as a consultant on the project. MacKenzie's fundamental belief was that a good golf course should provide a stern test for a good player but not prove impossible for average players. Also included in his manifesto was an insistence that a player should be required to utilize a variety of shots to prosper and that every hole should have a different character where possible. Among the more eccentric attributes listed was the suggestion that though the course should be sufficiently undulating, there should be no hill climbing, and that a complete absence of irritation caused by looking for lost balls was preferable. ""Alwoodley is very proud indeed because we have the original MacKenzie design and we are very proud to introduce people to it,"" Leefe says. ""MacKenzie was a pioneer and went on to become one of the best known architects of his time. He's become much more famous after his death and the golfing public have realized what great courses he's made. ""There are a lot of the original MacKenzie characteristics on show at Alwoodley. We try our best when we restore the course or renovate course to keep to the original design of which we have a copy."" Augusta National . MacKenzie had carved a formidable reputation for himself by the time he left for the United States in 1926. But it was his work on the Californian coast that would pique the interest of Bobby Jones and lead to his most memorable tender -- designing Augusta National. Many believe MacKenzie's true masterpiece to be Cypress Point, which he designed to complement its proximity to the rugged Pacific Ocean coastline. By the time Jones had completed his first round on the Monterey Peninsula he vowed to employ MacKenzie to build his very own course. It seemed the logical choice, given how closely their vision for the ideal golf course was. ""We believe that no good golf hole exists that does not afford a proper and convenient solution to the average golfer and the short player, as well as to the more powerful and accurate expert,"" Jones was reported as saying. But by the time $100,000 had been spent transforming an Augusta fruit plantation into a golf course, the political and financial landscape had changed dramatically thanks to the stock market crash of 1929. The exuberant flourishes on show via a series of elaborate bunkers at Cypress Point and another of MacKenzie's fabled courses -- Royal Melbourne in Australia -- gave way to a more modest design in which contour was king. ""Originally, Augusta was light on bunkers -- it has many more today than it used to have,"" says Lawrence. ""Augusta was one of the very last things MacKenzie did before he died and it seems he was moving away from those flashy bunkers. ""He was working in a style that was appropriate of the era of depression when Augusta was built. It wasn't about sand or water -- what defined it were the contours of the land. ""You can take a flag stick and put in a flat area and it's a very easy golf hole; you can put it behind a little hump and it's an almost impossible golf hole."" The genius of Augusta . In those early years of struggle, the notion of Augusta preparing to host the 78th installment of the Masters in 2014 would have seemed quite fanciful. As Owen reports in ""The Making of the Masters,"" let alone having the funds to pay MacKenzie for his design, the club could barely cover its staff's $200 weekly wage bill in the early 1930s. The idea to create a yearly tournament, initially called the Augusta National Invitational Tournament, helped stave off the threat of financial ruin and generated plenty of interest when Jones came out of retirement to play in the first one. But what really catapulted the club into the public's consciousness was Gene Sarazen's ""shot heard around the world"" during the 1935 event. The American was trailing the leaders by three shots when his double eagle on the par-five 15th hole helped him cut the deficit with one stroke, paving the way for his eventual win in a playoff. That landmark moment is testament to the principals upon which MacKenzie's design was built. Various tweaks over the years have stripped many of his original features from the course, most of them dictated by the modern player's ability to hit the ball over a hundred yards further than their predecessors. But as Owen wrote: ""MacKenzie's and Jones' ideas about golf course design continue to define the Masters in ways that modern golf fans may not fully appreciate."" The pair's commitment to break from the culture of golf design at the time -- which penalized poor shots harshly -- has engendered some of the greatest finishes in major golf. As Owen makes clear, the plentiful birdie and eagle opportunities down the closing stretch discourage any conservatism, as anyone in with a sniff of winning charges for the finish line. But it's not just at Augusta that MacKenzie's legacy is felt -- an estimated 100 clubs as far afield as Buenos Aires and Blackpool have been touch by his hand. ""MacKenzie is undoubtedly one of the most important figures in terms of the evolution of golf course design,"" Lawrence says. ""Augusta, Cypress Point and Royal Melbourne are three courses that would typically be in the top 10 in the world in most rankings, and the fact all three courses have MacKenzie's footprint is pretty impressive."" MacKenzie may be long gone, but he lives on in the soul of golf courses the world over.
