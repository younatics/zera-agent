"Cristiano Ronaldo became the joint third highest scorer in Real Madrid’s history on Sunday night with his 290th goal for the club in a 2-0 win over Elche. The victory put Real four points clear of Barcelona who slipped up 24 hours earlier against Malaga and it also moved Ronaldo up another notch on Madrid’s all-time goals list. Across almost two decades Spain international striker Santillana scored 290 goals in 645 games from his debut in 1971. It has taken Ronaldo just 281 games to match that total and he is now only 17 goals from second placed top scorer Alfredo Di Stefano and 33 behind all-time leader Raul. Click here to read Pete Jenson's full match report . Host commentator . Real Madrid have capitalised on Barcelona's slip up by picking up all three points against Elche. The scoreline should have been a lot more but Real were wasteful in attack and Benzema had an emphatic acrobatic effort unfairly ruled out for offside. Ancelotti will be happy with the result as Real picked up the three points without having to step out of second gear. Isco receives a standing ovation after impressing for Real. He was the best player on the pitch for the 89 minutes he was on the field of play. We're into the final minute. Ronaldo has a valid reason to be happy as he is now Real Madrid's third highest goalscorer with 290 goals. Alfredo Di Stefano (305) and Raul (323) are ahead of the former Manchester United ace. Sportsmail's Pete Jenson: So just when we thought Ronaldo might go four league games without scoring in the league for the first time in his Real Madrid career... he scores his 29th of the season in La Liga. Ronaldo gets his goal with an outstanding header past the diving Tyton. The Portuguese star shows off his incredible aerial ability to direct his headed effort into the top corner. After scoring against Elche, Benzema has now scored against every current La Liga side - other than Real Madrid. The officials couldn't find a reason to rule this effort out! Benzema has the easy task of tapping the ball into an empty net after Elche fail to clear their lines. Real Madrid deserve their lead despite not being at their best. Niguez should have seen red for a horrendous challenge on Bale. His challenge was both late and high but the Spanish official decided to show the Elche midfielder a yellow card. Casillas pulls off a tremendous diving save to his right to deny Niguez. Replays show the Elche man's shot was going wide but the veteran goalkeeper wasn't to know. Casillas, who is making his 500th La Liga appearance today, had nothing of note to do during the first half. It may just have been the easiest 45 minutes of his Real Madrid career. Elche will surely try to test Real's defence during the second half. Sportsmail's Pete Jenson: Elche very fortunate still to be in the game. Ronaldo's missed a hat-trick's worth of goals and Benzema's should have stood. While it's 0-0 there's hope for Elche mainly because of Jonathas. You could see him against Pepe on at the Grand Garden Arena and people would watch it. Pepe just shading it at the moment. Real Madrid have done everything but score. In fact, they did score but the officials decided to chalk it off. The away side will be confident they can win this game in the second half. One goal should be enough for Carlo Ancelotti's side to take the three points as Elche have failed to test Casillas. Benzema's has just had an outstanding effort unfairly ruled out for offside. The Frenchman put the ball in the back of the net by executing a bicycle kick however the officials chalked it off. Poor officiating. BBC (Bale, Benzema and Cristiano) have failed to really test Tyton as of yet. The trio have shown their quality in small periods of the first 38 minutes of this match but have not really linked up to really drive at Elche's defence. Varane has just shown his strength by using his upper body to muscle Jonathas off the ball. The Elche forward committed a foul after trying to give the Real centre back a taste of his own medicine. It might not be Ronaldo's day today. The Real Madrid has just sent a header over the bar from close range. He leaped above Elche's defenders but was unable to direct his effort at goal. Still 0-0 after 27 minutes. Real Madrid's final pass has been poor thus far. Marcelo just had the time and space to pick out one of his team-mates, however he over-hit his cross. How are Real Madrid not winning this game? Bale just played a delightful cross to Ronaldo at the back post but the Portuguese star surprisingly fluffed his lines. Remains 0-0 with 20 minutes on the clock. Real Madrid have just tried to walk the ball into the net. Ronaldo and Benzema tried to play a neat one-two in the area but the latter should have at least tested Tyton. Tyton, who has impressed for Elche since joining on a season-long loan move from PSV, has just denied Ronaldo with a diving save to his left. 16 minutes gone and Real have failed to unlock the home side as of yet. Elche are treading a fine line as they are giving Ronaldo the time and space to get shots off at goal. Bale almost put his side in the lead however the Welshman was denied by Elche goalkeeper Tyton. Ronaldo, who is being booed by the home crowd, has just gone close to opening the scoring after just four minutes. The Portuguese captain was incredibly unlucky not to put his side in the lead. Real Madrid are dictating play already. Bale just put the ball in the back of the net but he was ruled offside by the Spanish officials. Real Madrid ran out 5-1 winners against Elche back in September with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring four goals against the La Liga minnows. Gareth Bale also managed to get on the scoresheet during the emphatic home win. Carlo Ancelotti will be hoping his side can do the business on his 100th game in charge of the European champions. Iker Casillas is making his 500th appearance for Real Madrid tonight. The Spaniard has conceded 510 league goals during his time at the club. Karim Benzema took to Twitter earlier today to congratulate his team-mate on his achievement. Real Madrid: Casillas; Carvajal, Varane, Pepe, Marcelo; Lucas Silva, Kroos, Isco; Ronaldo, Benzema, Bale . Subs: Navas, Hernandez, Arbeloa, Nacho, Jese, Illarramendi, Medran . Elche: Tyton, Damian, E. Roco, Lombán, Albacar, Niguez, Pasalic, Adrian, Víctor, Fajr, J. de Jesus . Welcome to Sportsmail's live coverage of tonight's La Liga clash between Elche and Real Madrid. Real Madrid will open up a four-point lead over rivals Barcelona if they claim maximum points against the Spanish minnows. La Liga leaders Real Madrid will be hoping to capitalise on Barcelona's home defeat against Malaga by claiming all three points at Elche. Carlo Ancelotti's side go into tonight's match with a one point lead over second-placed Barcelona.

"Southampton's Sadio Mane faces disciplinary action from manager Ronald Koeman after arriving late for Sunday’s 2-0 defeat by Liverpool. Mane was dropped to the bench for turning up 30 minutes after the 1pm meeting time. ‘He was late for the pre-match,’ confirmed Koeman. ‘We have rules, instructions with the players. Sadio Mane (left) is set for disciplinary action after arriving late for the match against Liverpool . Southampton forward Mane battles for the ball with Liverpool midfielder Philippe Coutinho (right) ‘Everybody can be late one day in the morning, but you can’t be late at 1pm when you have to play against Liverpool. ‘His explanation is between him and me, but he was too late. I can’t and I don’t accept that. If he has to pay a fine, he pays the fine. ‘But the best way to keep the discipline in the team was not to pick him today.’ On a day of frustration for Koeman, the Saints boss felt his side were denied a penalty when Joe Allen blatantly tripped Filip Djuricic in the first half. Southampton had two other penalty shouts, when Djuricic fell under pressure from Emre Can in the first minute and Dejan Lovren appeared to handle in the box. ‘The first situation is difficult because, if you whistle, it’s a penalty and a red card,’ said Koeman.

Sportsmail's graphic of Philippe Coutinho's thunderbolt to give Liverpool the lead . ‘You have to be sure as a referee to do that. Maybe Djuricic in that moment fell down a bit too easily in the box. ‘The second, there’s no question. I don’t understand the referee there. But OK, humans make mistakes. The handball just before half-time? I don’t know. 'I have to watch it back, but it’s always difficult with handballs and penalties. ‘I am proud of how we played but in the last few games we have struggled to score and then it’s hard to win games. ‘That’s football, maybe a little bit about the confidence of the players, but the way we played today, the organisation . . . (I am) disappointed about the result but not about the performance.’ Adam Lallana (left) was booed on his return to former side Southampton for current employers Liverpool . The midfielder skippered the team during his final two years of his Saints career . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said he had been shocked at the reception ex-Southampton skipper Adam Lallana was given on his return to St Mary’s. The midfielder, who spent 14 years at Southampton, left for Liverpool last summer and was roundly booed by home fans — as was Lovren, who also left at the end of last season. Striker Rickie Lambert, an unused Liverpool substitute, was given a better reception. And Rodgers said: ‘Today was always going to be difficult for the likes of Dejan and Adam. ‘I was a bit disappointed for Adam. He was captain here for two years, gave incredible service and could have left a number of times and didn’t. 'To get the reception he did was disappointing. There was nothing in the match programme referencing his time here. ‘No mention for Lambert as well. Those two guys gave their heart and soul to Southampton and were big supporters of this club. 'They’ve moved to one of the biggest clubs in the world. Those two guys were wonderful servants. ‘It was a massive decision for them to come to Liverpool. For former servants or players, there’s always appreciation. But nothing here. ‘For me, that’s a wee bit sad. I was thinking of them today looking at the programme before the game. ‘Everything they gave to this club to get them here today, and not a mention.’ In fact, Lallana and Lambert were referenced more than 20 times in the programme. Rodgers had a different view on Southampton’s penalty appeals, saying: ‘Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don’t. ‘I thought the referee was excellent, but obviously with the pressure he was under from the crowd, especially with them being 1-0 behind, they’re big decisions for him. I thought in the main he got them right. ‘It was an outstanding win for us, very controlled. Of course you have to defend at times, particularly away from home against a very good side, but it’s a wonderful win.’","Sadio Mane arrived 30 minutes after meeting time on Sunday .

"A weight loss guru has blamed Homer Simpson for Britain’s obesity crisis by claiming the cartoon character's love of donuts and beer encourages unhealthy eating habits. Steve Miller, who presented TV show Fat Families, believes Homer’s appetite for junk food is sending out the wrong message that unhealthy eating makes you happy. He has now written to the show’s creator, Matt Groening, urging him to put the cartoon character on a ‘realistic’ healthy eating plan in an attempt to slim him down. Steve Miller, a weight loss guru and presenter of TV show Fat Families (left), believes the poor eating habits of Homer Simpson (right) are sending out the wrong message that eating unhealthy food makes people happy . Mr Miller, who has worked with overweight families for the last eight years, said: ‘When I see cartoon characters and any promotion at all in the media that says you can be fat and happy and eat as much as you want, I will raise my concerns strongly. ‘I don’t want people seeing Homer Simpson being fat, stuffing food in and being happy. What we should be doing is elevating the promotion of people who are happy and slim. ‘The reason I decided to write to him [Matt Groening] is because I want to see Homer take up a realistic regime where he is determined to be fit, healthy and happy rather than fat and happy. ‘Because that’s the message I want to get to the nation. It’s about giving children - our next generation - the right message. ‘Being fat and happy don’t go hand-in-hand because you are potentially putting yourself in danger.’ Mr Miller, who once lost four stone himself, said he believes Homer should be put on his 80/20 eating plan – where you eat healthily 80 per cent of the time and have ‘what you fancy’ the other 20 per cent. He said: ‘When it comes to role models, anyone in the media that’s fat needs to really think about it because it’s sending out the wrong message. ‘I am very anti size acceptance because we have to remember that being too fat can lead to significant health problems, including diabetes and cancer. Mr Miller has written to The Simpsons creator Matt Groening (pictured) urging him to 'slim Homer down' by putting him on a healthy eating plan. He believes it will help influence healthier eating habits across Britain . ‘I would love to see Homer go on a health regime that doesn't mean he cuts out everything, but he lives my by 80/20 rule. ‘You eat well 80 per cent of the time and can have a bit of what you fancy the remaining 20 per cent of the week, but you watch the portion size. ‘As somebody who works full-time with fat people helping them to lose weight, it works really well. ‘I’d love to see Homer take back control over food. Because millions of people around the world watch the programme it would be such an inspirational message, especially to young people, that actually you can be fit and happy. ‘I'm not saying lets get Homer on a ridiculous diet, lets do it realistically. The message it would put out would be fantastic.’ Mr Miller, a hypnotherapist, also said he would like to see Mr Groening put the cartoon character in hypnotherapy sessions to help him achieve weight loss. He added: ‘I would love to see him hypnotised to lose weight, I'm even willing to hypnotise him. ‘I always say: “It’s about getting mind over platter.”'","Steve Miller believes cartoon's appetite for junk food gives wrong message .

"Samsung’s rumoured smartwatch won't need a phone to work - and now patent images have revealed it may not even need a touchscreen. According to the application filed by the Korean firm, the standalone smartwatch could be controlled using gestures, detected by sensors built into the wrist-worn device. These sensors could recognise flicks, waves and other movements, and the files claim a depth sensor, when combined with a camera, for example, could be used to detect what a user is pointing at. According to patent images, pictured, Samsung's standalone smartwatch may include sensors that detect flicks, hand waves, fists and other movements. The files claim a depth sensor, when combined with a camera, for example, could be used to detect what a user is pointing at, or interacting with, for example . Samsung could be on the verge of entering the virtual reality race, if reports about an upcoming headset are true. The . Korean firm is said to have sent early prototypes to developers to . test, and the final product could launch by the end of the year. Sources close to Samsung told Engadget the headsets have OLED screens and will connect with the next generation of Galaxy devices. The . reports suggest the headset will run on Android, rather than the Tizen . operating system most recently seen on Samsung’s latest smartwatches. While orientation sensors could be used to unlock the device with a flick of the wrist or open certain apps. Elsewhere, ambient sounds picked up by the watch’s built-in microphone could add context to a gesture - for example, if using the watch at a gig, a gesture that traditionally switches on the camera could, instead, switch to video mode. ‘A depth sensor may be used in conjunction with an optical camera to enhance display or detection of a device's environment, or to determine which object a user is pointing at or interacting with via a gesture,’ explained the patent. ‘Sensors may include one or more inertial sensors or orientation sensors, such as an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a magnetometer, a GPS chip, or a compass. The G watch is likely to sync with LG's current range of phones. Earlier this week, patent files revealed a Samsung smartwatch, pictured, that won't need a phone to work. According to the application, the standalone smartwatch could be controlled using gestures, detected by sensors built into the wrist-worn device . Samsung already has four smartwatches on the market, including the Galaxy Gear, pictured left, powered by Google's Android operating system, and the Gear 2, pictured right, powered by Tizen. It is unclear which operating system the standalone smartwatch will run on . ‘In particular embodiments, output from sensors may be used to activate or unlock a device, detect one or more gestures, interact with content on the device's display screen or a paired device's display screen. ‘Sensors may include one or more microphones for detecting speech of a user, or ambient sounds to determine the context of the device.’ A number of existing Samsung products, including the Galaxy S5, already feature gesture controls, that let users scroll using hand waves, and sensors that follow where the user is looking. Its upcoming smartwatch could develop these further. The patent said sensors could be used to activate or unlock a device, detect one or more gestures, interact with content on the screen, or a paired device's screen. A number of existing Samsung products, including the Galaxy S5, already feature gesture controls and its upcoming smartwatch could develop these further . The G Watch is one of a handful of devices, including the Moto 360, pictured, to take advantage of the modified Android software. The Motorola watch is expected to launch shortly after LG's G watch . The images are part of a wider patent revealed earlier this week that suggest Samsung is developing a smartwatch that doesn’t need a phone to work. The firm plans to unveil the smartwatch over the next few months in a bid to take a larger slice of the wearable technology market. The unnamed smartwatch will be able to take photos, send emails, monitor the wearer’s heart rate and use GPS tracking, according to sources close to the company. Samsung has declined to say what the device will be called, how much it will cost or whether a user will make calls by holding the watch close to his or her mouth. The patent suggests Samsung's new smartwatch will have a round face resembling Motorola's Android Wear-powered Moto 360.","Patent images reveal sensors placed on the wrist-worn device .

"House Speaker John Boehner put himself one step closer to suing the President of the United States on Thursday, unveiling a resolution permitting the move and attracting return fire from the White House. Announcing late in the day that the legal action will focus on the Affordable Care Act, Boehner fumed that Barack Obama had 'changed the health care law without a vote of Congress' in 2013, 'effectively creating his own law by literally waiving the employer mandate and the penalties for failing to comply with it.' The president, he carped, 'believes he has the power to make his own laws.' The Obama administration has taken several actions that Republicans say twisted the plain meaning of the Obamacare law's black-letter text, ignoring dates that the law set in stone – for both practical and political reasons. The law's employer mandate, in particular, has been pushed back twice although the law reads that it 'shall apply to months beginning after December 31, 2013.' Buried: Speaker of the House John Boehner criticized President Obama's economic policies during a press conference on Thursday but announced his lawsuit plans later in the day as Washington lawyers and spokespersons started their evening commutes . Republicans 'actually plan to sue me,' Obama mocked on Thursday in Texas. 'Really? Really? For what? You¿re going to sue me for doing my job?' The administration pushed it back by one year, burying the announcement in a blog entry. Later, the Department of Health and Human Services announced another one-year reprieve for some employers. The mandate requires most large employers to provide health insurance to their workers or pay a financial penalty. The Treasury Department suggested in a July 2013 memorandum that it didn't intend to delay the legal mandate – just the requirement that employers report to the IRS whether or not they had complied. But without those reports, legal analysts have noted, there's no basis for exacting any penalties. The Supreme Court declared in 2012 that the Affordable Care Act passed constitutional muster because the penalties amounted to a tax, a senior aide to House Republican leaders reminded MailOnline. He said that because of that legal precedent, the House counsel is likely to argue that the Treasury Department lacks the authority to pick and choose which taxes to collect in a given year. Publicly, however, the legal nuance is less important to Republicans than the broad-stroke declaration that President Obama has overstepped the boundaries of his constitutional box. 'No president should have the power to make laws on his or her own,' Boehner said in a statement, drawing a quick retort from the White House press office. 'It is disappointing that Speaker Boehner and congressional Republicans have decided to waste time and taxpayer dollars on a political stunt,' read a statement Press Secretary Josh Earnest fired off an hour later. Washington doesn't get much stranger: The GOP is preparing to argue before a federal judge that the president should be forced to retract delays in his medical insurance overhaul law, even though they sought he same kinds of delays during a showdown last year that landed the federal government in partial shutdown mode. 'These guys can't take yes for an answer, I guess,' a Democratic Senate aide told MailOnline. The . concept of filing suit against the president has been in the works for . months, according to the senior Republican leadership aide, but it . gathered steam as GOP leaders began to realize that the Supreme Court . might give their potential case a boost. Last . week the high court ruled that Obama overstepped his authority with 'recess' appointments of three lawyers to the National Labor . Relations Board in 2012. The administration argued at the time that the U.S. Senate wasn't in a position to consider the nominations because it was in a brief break . from regular order. The Supreme Court, however, ruled unanimously that the White House lacks the authority to make that determination, and it's up to the Senate to decide when it's actually in 'recess.' The Obamacare law's centerpiece is a requirement that employers with 50 or more workers provide medical insurance or pay a fine beginning on January 1, 2014 -- but the White House has already delayed that penalty's implementation twice . Boehner erupted in anger at Obama on Thursday: 'He's been president for five and a half years -- when's he going to take responsibility for SOMETHING?' That decision could be a lifeline for Republicans who aim to paint the Obama administration as lawless and dismissive of the U.S. Constitution's separation of powers. Some Democrats fear a series of similar legal rulings that would leave the White House toothless during Obama's lame-duck years, and at the mercy of a coming Congress that threatens to be dominated by the GOP. 'If he files [the lawsuit], it's clearly going to be fast-tracked to the Supreme Court,' the Democratic Senate aide said Thursday, 'and given what we've seen from them lately, that can't be good.' Boehner's resolution is widely expected to pass easily in the House of Representatives, along party lines. It would authorize him to file his lawsuit in federal court. Once the legal complaint reaches a judge, Republicans will have to grapple with the thorny question of whether or not they have legal 'standing' to sue in the first place. In court, . the House of Representatives will have to show that it has suffered an . injury – in this case, the nullification of its powers under the . Constitution. It may also have to show that there's no way to remedy the situation other than obtaining a court order that would hamstring Obama. But the . House does have the power to withhold the billions of dollars required . to implement the Obamacare law – and the power to impeach the president. Those options, says Elizabeth Foley, a lawyer advising Boehner on strategy, are far too radical. The U.S. Supreme Court will llikely find itself arbitrating Boehner's lawsuit once it wends its way through lower federal courts, a situation that concerns Democrats since the justices have already unanimously ruled that Obama overstepped his authority in other cases . Obama's speech Thursady at the Paramount Theatre in Austin, Texas was a partisan love-fest full of barbs at Republicans who, he said, are doing little more than standing in his way . 'Impeachment is overkill for this particular transgression,' she told the conservative National Review on Saturday. 'All Congress wants is for the president to faithfully execute the law. This does not mean that they think he should be kicked out of office.' Boehner has cautioned that his lawsuit shouldn't be interpreted as a prelude to impeachment proceedings, drawing howls from tea party groups and conservative lawmakers in his own caucus. And using the power of the purse to stop all of Obamacare, Foley says, would penalize innocent people and organizations for what could amount to a petty punishment of the president. Expecting House Republicans to find their own remedy, she says, makes sense 'only when [it's] proportionate and related to the transgression.' Obama, traveling in Texas for a string of Democratic fundraisers, seemed to anticipate Boehner's move on Thursday during an economic speech in the liberal enclave of Austin. 'Now, here’s where it gets interesting,' Obama said, discussing his 'year of action' strategy to issue a series of executive orders in defiance of Congress. 'There are a number of Republicans, including a number in the Texas delegation, who are mad at me for taking these actions. They actually plan to sue me.' 'You hear some of them,' he said, drawing laughter and applause: “Sue him.” “Impeach him"".' 'Really? Really? For what? You’re going to sue me for doing my job? Okay.'","House Resolution will authorize Boehner to sue the White House for changing the Affordable Care Act without the consent of Congress .

"An annual measurement of the United States' overall health has shown that Americans made a 'notable shift' towards better health in 2013. America's Health Rankings is an annual assessment of the country's health on a state-by-state basis by the United Health Foundation. This year's rankings show that in 2013, Americans exercised more, smoked less and, for the first time since 1998, obesity rates did not increase. Overall rankings: Hawaii was the healthiest U.S. state, followed by Vermont . Overall, Hawaii was the most healthy state in the country, while Mississippi ranked lowest for health. Last year, Vermont topped the list for healthiest state, and came in second this year. To understand the health of communities across the country, various factors were measured, including smoking, obesity, air pollution, high school graduation rates, infant mortality and crime rates. The analysis uses data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Medical Association, Census Bureau, Department of Education and the FBI to gather information on behaviors, community and environment, policy and clinical care. Physical inactivity: A map of the country shows the proportion of adults who engaged in no physical activity . 'We are encouraged,' Reed Tuckson, senior medical adviser to the United Health Foundation, told USA Today. 'Put all together, the big conclusion is that these trends give us reason to be empowered to do more. We're seeing it all across America — individuals and families are making the decision to be active, to eat a more appropriate diet, to stop smoking. We are seeing that people can do it. And we are encouraged by the work in communities to address these issues that compromise America's health and vitality. Now we have to do more of it. 'We are in no way declaring the war is over but are declaring that there is reason for optimism,' he says. Obesity rates: For the first time since 1998, the national obesity rate did not increase . While there were significant improvements in smoking rates (down from 21.2 per cent in 2012 to 19.6 per cent), binge drinking, physical inactivity and premature death (death before 75 years of age), the report notes that there are still many challenges to national health. Diabetes rates have increased to almost double what they were in the mid-1990s and now the chronic disease affects 9.7 per cent of adults . Also on the rise is chlamydia, the prevalence of which which has increased 8 per cent since 2012. Other . challenges noted by the report are children living in poverty, with . 21.3 per cent of people under 18 living below the poverty line. Improvement: Smoking rates have decreased nationally since last year . The lack of health insurance is another challenge, with 15.6 per cent of the population living uninsured. The . president of the Institute of Medicine Harvey V. Fineberg says that the . U.S. has a long way to go before national health is on a par with other . developed countries. He notes that dozens of countries have longer life expectancies and lower infant mortality rates than the U.S. 'At . the same time, America spends double the per capita average of other . wealthy nations on health care. In fact, if America’s health . expenditures of $2.8 trillion were the entire gross domestic product . (GDP) of a nation, it would rank fifth among the world’s largest . economies.

"A professor who took a group of Palestinian students to Auschwitz has been disowned by his university and branded a 'traitor' by those in his community. Professor Mohammed S. Dajani took 27 Palestinian students from Al-Quds University to visit the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in Poland in March. The trip was part of a joint venture focusing on conflict resolution between the university and two others. However, when the professor and the group returned, the university distanced itself from the trip - saying professor Dajani and the students 'acted in their personal capacity and were not representatives of the university.' Professor Mohammed Dajani pictured at Auschwitz. The scholar was disowned by his university after taking a group of Palestinian students to the concentration camp . The professor was also called a traitor by members of his community following the trip, reports suggest . According to the Washington Post, Professor Dajani was also reportedly called a 'traitor' by some members of his community, while some of his friends advised him to go on holiday until the controversy died down. The professor, who believes the group may have first Palestinians students to visit Auschwitz, has since said he doesn't regret the trip - and he would return if given the opportunity. Writing on Facebook, he said: 'My response to all this tirade is that my duty as a teacher is to teach, to have my students explore the unexplored, to open new horizons for my students, to guide my students out of the cave of perceptions and misperceptions to see the facts and the reality on the ground. 'I will go to the university, I will put my photos of the visit on Facebook, and I do not regret for one second what I did. 'As a matter of fact, I will do it again if given the opportunity. I will not hide, I will not deny. I will not be silent. I will not remain a bystander even if the victims of the suffering I show empathy for are my perpetrators and my occupiers. The trip to the concentration camp, pictured, was part of a joint venture between three universities. It was designed to teach students about empathy and conflict resolution . 'The aim is not to get any one's approval but to do the right thing.' A student who went on the trip told haaretz.com: 'Most . people said we shouldn’t go. It is a strange thing for a Palestinian to . go to a Nazi death camp. But I would recommend the trip.' The controversy came as the Obama . administration attempted to move towards a peace deal with the Middle East. The trip was part of . a research project called 'Heart of Flesh — Not Stone'. It was reportedly paid for by the German Research Foundation and run by the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena, Germany,  and the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. According to the project's Facebook page: 'The project analyses individuals and groups experiencing the “suffering of the other” as a means for understanding how and why groups may become more or less open to reconciliation.' The professor retains the trip was in his student's best interests - and says he would return if given the chance. His critics say he was attempting to brainwash the pupils, reports suggest . A Palestinian newspaper al-Quds wrote a piece about the trip - which was reportedly pulled down following a heated discussion in the comments section of the piece. According to reports, one reader said the trip was not freedom of expression  - but treason. TV analysts and newspaper columnists also spoke against the trip, while others claimed the professor was attempting to brainwash his students. Auschwitz was a network of concentration and extermination camps built during World War II. It was operated by the Third Reich. The network consisted of original camp Auschwitz I, Auschwitz II–Birkenau, Auschwitz III–Monowitz  and a further 45 satellite camps.","Professor Mohammed S.

"There may have been no Premier League this weekend but there was still plenty of action from around the world. Here, Sportsmail's Ralph Ellis gives you 10 things we learned from this weekend's football... 1. Southampton’s £10m deadline day signing of striker Sadio Mané rather went under the radar, what with all the fuss around Radamel Falcao and Danny Welbeck. But the 22-year-old might just turn out to be a significant replacement for the goals lost when Rickie Lambert moved to Liverpool. Mané scored 45 in 87 games for Red Bull Salzburg – and showed he is in form with a strike that sealed Senegal’s shock 2-0 win over seven times African champions Egypt as the African Cup of Nations qualifiers began. Stoke’s Mame Biram Diouf got the first goal. On target: New Southampton signing Sadio Mane could prove a significant purchase for Saints this season . 2. Paulo Bento looks like being the first managerial casualty of the European Championships after Portugal lost 1-0 at home to Albania. With no Cristiano Ronaldo the Portuguese managed a paltry four shots on target – and none of those caused Albanian goalkeeper Etrit Berisha, who plays his club football in Italy for Lazio, the slightest bother. Bento, in charge of a dismal World Cup campaign in which Portugal failed to get through their group behind the USA, got the full treatment from the crowd in the Aveiro stadium waving white hankies. Portugal: Without their captain Cristiano Ronaldo in the side, Portugal lost 1-0 at home to Albania . 3. Germany might be world champions, but Brazil remain the star draw of the global game and proved it by setting an attendance record for “soccer” at the Sun Life Stadium in Miami. Some 73,429 packed into the home of the Dolphins to see Neymar Junior’s goal secure a 1-0 win over Colombia in a friendly. The growth of the game in the States, though, is underlined in it being only the fourth best attendance in America this year – the 109,318 who saw Manchester United play Real Madrid in Michigan is still the record. Crowds: Over 73,000 people turned up to watch Brazil play Colombia at the Sun Life stadium in Miami . 4. Kasper Schmeichel can now be considered Denmark’s number one goalkeeper after getting picked by Morten Olsen for the start of the campaign. The 27-year-old son of Manchester United legend Peter had played only one competitive game in his previous five caps, but after Leicester’s promotion to the Premier League he got the nod for the European Championship qualifier against Armenia. He couldn’t mark the occasion with a clean sheet – beaten from distance by Borussia Dortmund midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan – but at least finished on the winning side as the Danes fought back with goals from Pierre Højbjerg and Thomas Kahlenberg. Denmark: Kasper Schmeichel is now Denmark’s No 1 keeper after getting picked by Morten Olsen . 5. If Roy Hodgson thinks he’s got problems with the press, then its nothing compared to the goings on in Ghana. Former Sunderland striker Asamoah Gyan had to leave the training camp to post bail for his elder brother Baffour, who has been accused of leading an assault on a sports journalist. The reporter was chased out of the Baba Yara Stadium after attempting to ask Asamoah in a press conference about rumours linking him to the disappearance of a musician. Problems with the press: Asamoah Gyan had to post bail for his brother after his sibling was accused of chasing a sports journalist . 6. Barry Fry’s ability to comb non-League football for players seems to have unearthed another gem for Peterborough in 22-year-old striker Kyle Vassell. Rejected by both Norwich and Brentford as a kid, he trailed around nine different part-time clubs before Fry spotted him scoring six goals in a dozen games for Bishop’s Stortford, and signed him at London Road last January. It’s taken Vassell some time to come to terms with full-time football – but his goal when he came on as sub in the 3-1 win over Port Vale took him to five in six League One games this term. Problems: Roy Hodgson's media problems are nothing in comparison to those of Asamoah Gyan in Ghana . 7. Chris Wilder worked miracles when he saved Northampton from almost certain relegation last season and continues to enhance his reputation this term. The 46-year-old, who brought Oxford back from non-League football in his previous job, watched two goals by summer signing Marc Richards secure a win at Dagenham that put the Cobblers into the play-off places. 8. Steve Cotterill has been in charge of three basket-case clubs in a row at Notts County, Portsmouth and Nottingham Forest where in each case he brought some brief stability during chaotic financial times. No wonder the 50-year-old is enjoying a more stable environment at Bristol City where he has started to turn the club round after saving them from fears last season of a second successive relegation. Goals from Aden Flint and Greg Cunningham brought a 2-0 win over Scunthorpe that put the Ashton Gate club into the League One automatic promotion places. Bristol City: Steve Cotterill has been in charge of three basket-case clubs before Bristol . 9. Fallen giants Bristol Rovers are finding life tough in the Vanamara Conference – and their first taste of non-League day ended in shame at Braintree, not only because of the 2-0 defeat. The club are facing an FA inquiry after one of their 565 travelling fans appeared to twice punch Braintree striker Simeon Akinda who had fallen into the back of the goal net. 10. Braintree wasn’t the only place where fan trouble spoiled the fantastic efforts to promote non-League football, which brought good crowds to little grounds throughout the country. Darlington’s game at Droylsden in the Evo-Stik Northern League’s First Division North was held up for 20 minutes because fighting broke out among the visiting fans. Darlington boss Martin Gray had to make a personal plea for peace before the trouble ended – but then saw his team, who were 1-0 up at the time, go on to lose 2-1.

"As a professional bodybuilder and personal trainer, Anita Albrecht’s toned physique is her living. But on a routine visit to an NHS clinic she was stunned to be told she needed to lose weight. After being asked to step on to the scales, she was informed she was borderline obese based on her body mass index. Anita Albrecht, from Harold Hill, East London was told told she was 'eating too much' and needed to go on a drastic diet . A nurse then told her she needed to begin a 1,000 calorie-a-day diet, which is half the recommended amount for a woman. Miss Albrecht, 39, yesterday said: ‘The information the nurse has given me is actually dangerous. ‘A thousand calories a day is only for people who are severely obese who are not active. They should only be on that for a maximum of 12 weeks – generally as a precursor to surgery.’ Health officials have been accused of slavishly following BMI scales – calculated by dividing weight by height – without taking into account individual circumstances. The measurement was developed in the first half of the 19th century and critics say it provides inaccurate results for some people, including rugby players with lots of muscle and tall people. Miss Albrecht, who finished sixth in the 2012 Miss Galaxy Universe bodybuilding competition, visited a family planning clinic at Harold Hill Health Centre near her home in east London on March 5. The advice came as Miss Albrecht visited the walk in family planning clinic near her home earlier this month . At . 4ft 11in and weighing 10st 3lb, she was found to have a BMI of 29. A . ‘healthy’ BMI is between 18.5 and 25, a score of 25-29 is classed as . ‘overweight’ and anything above 30 is ‘obese’. Miss Albrecht said she . was speaking about her ordeal to prevent other women receiving dangerous . ‘misinformation’. ‘The nurse said, “You are obviously eating too much” … without asking about my lifestyle, eating habits, taking into account body composition and so on. ‘It left me feeling belittled, insulted and confused.’ During the appointment to review her contraception, Miss Albrecht was told to exercise more and cut alcohol and fruit juice. She added: . ‘For nine months of the year I don’t even drink as I am a competitive . athlete. I was made to feel as though I was overweight, over-eating and I . felt a knock in my confidence.’ The health centre and an NHS England spokesman both declined to comment yesterday. According to the NHS, body mass index is a measure of whether you are a healthy weight for your height. It is calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing it by your height in metres squared. A BMI calculation producing a body fat percentage of 18.5 to 24.9 is normal, but anything from 25 to 29.9 is classed as overweight, which can put people at a higher risk of diabetes and high blood pressure. A figure of 30 to 39.9 is classed as obese, which also carries the risks of certain types of cancer and stroke. Anything above 40 is morbidly obese and weight loss surgery may be offered. A BMI calculation of below 18.5 is considered underweight. This can also cause risks such as a low immune system, osteoporosis and fertility problems as periods can become interrupted. The skin caliper test, which also measures body fat percentage is often considered a better way of assessing a persons weight. The caliper is used to measure the thickness of the skin and the underlying layer of fat and does not take into account muscle, which weighs more than fat.","Anita Albrecht from London told she was obese and to start drastic diet .

"Cowering and screaming for mercy as she is lashed dozens of times, this is the fate that awaits mother-of-two Meriam Ibrahim who has been sentenced to death in Sudan for marrying a Christian. Meriam could be given 100 lashes within days just like this woman as part of her barbaric punishment that has caused outrage worldwide, MailOnline can reveal. Campaigners today said it could leave Meriam scarred, humiliated and with deep psychological wounds that may never heal. Scroll down for video . Inhumane: In the 2010 video an unidentified woman is ordered to get on her knees as police gear up to whip her . Degrading: The woman was flogged in public as an example to others. The Sudanese government confirmed the authenticity of the video saying she was being punished under Articles 154 and 155 of their penal code . Begging: As the end of the whip cracks against her back the woman pleads for mercy and her mother . Meriam is still recovering from giving birth to her daughter Maya two weeks ago in the prison in the Sudanese capital Khartoum where she has been held captive since last September. Her son Martin, 20 months, has been in custody with her the whole time too. Meriam, 27, a doctor, was put on death row after being convicted of apostasy and adultery by a strict Islamic court. Her case has attracted the condemnation of the governments of Britain, the US and the Netherlands who have branded her treatment as 'barbaric'. The Sudanese government appeared to be on the verge of agreeing to releasing Meriam last week under the growing international pressure - but did a dramatic U-turn. It is now waiting for the outcome of her appeal, which will be within the next week or two. International human rights organisation REDRESS told MailOnline that pressure needed to be maintained on Sudan to make sure that Meriam is freed. Lutz Oette, . of REDRESS, said: 'This may well be the fate that awaits Meriam unless . her appeal is successful. The video shows how flogging violates the . dignity of its victims who are more often than not women. 'REDRESS calls for an end to this practice, which is cruel, inhuman and degrading.' The . footage of the flogging was originally filmed in December 2010 and . shows the woman wearing a full hijab in a public area surrounded by . policemen in blue uniforms as a crowd of men look on. She . is clearly distressed and is seen holding up her hands as she is told: . 'We’ll jail you for two years if you don’t bend down and sit on the . ground'. U-turn: The Sudanese government - in the face of growing international pressure - claimed that Meriam (being held with her baby and son Martin in prison) would be released. That was a few weeks ago and she is still there . Outrage: Meriam was sentenced to death for refusing to convert to Islam and 100 lashes for 'adultery' because it is illegal in Sudan for a Muslim to marry a Christian . She kneels down and begins to cry out loud, bawling as the impatient policeman says: 'Sit down quickly, we want to go'. The woman screams in agony as the policeman repeatedly whips her legs and body. She pleads: 'Enough! Enough!' and 'I want my mum!' At one point she grabs the whip but another policeman moves towards her and starts whipping too. Two of the policemen are seen laughing and joking as the punishment continues. The identity of the woman or the location of her lashing in Sudan have never been identified but the government there did confirm that the video was authentic. A spokesman said the cruel punishment was meted out under Articles 154 and 155 of the 1991 Sudanese penal code which mandates flogging up to 100 lashes for adultery or running a brothel. Meriam’s appeal with the court in Khartoum is ongoing and says her conviction was a breach of her right to religious freedom. Meriam’s . lawyers have also filed a separate appeal with the African Commission . which does not have enforcement powers over Sudan but can add to the . international pressure were it to rule in their favour. MailOnline . can also disclose that Meriam’s husband Daniel, a naturalised US . citizen, who lives in Manchester, New Hampshire, has finally met with . the US embassy in Khartoum. Yet . in a cruel twist they have demanded that he submit to a paternity test . before they assist his children further, even though he has presented . them with his marriage certificate to their mother and his passport. Daniel, . a biochemist, had earlier claimed that he had been ignored three times . by the embassy because they were 'too busy' to see her. Helpless: At one point she grabs the whip but another policeman moves towards her and starts whipping too . Sick: The policeman laughs at the camera as the horrific spectacle unfolds and is amused it is being filmed . Tina Ramirez of US-based religious freedom campaigners Hardwired said that the development was a 'slap in the face' for him. Meriam was originally thrown in jail after her half brother filed a lawsuit in Khartoum which led to the criminal charges against her. A judge found her guilty because he refused to recognise her 2011 marriage because her father was a Muslim. Even though Meriam’s father left her family when he was six she should still worship Islam, the ruling said. During one of her court hearings Meriam said that she was 'was never a Muslim, I was raised a Christian from the start' but it made no difference. Martin was born in Sudan and may be entitled to US citizenship because Daniel is a naturalized American, though the process is complicated and not certain. The same applies to Maya too and she could potentially become an American. Among those . who have supported Meriam are Hillary Clinton who has said in a . statement: 'Meriam Ibrahim’s death sentence is abhorrent. Sudan should . stop threatening religious freedom and fundamental human rights'. In . the UK Justine Greening, the international development minister, has . tweeted: 'Sudan must not allow the execution of Meriam Ibrahim to go . ahead. #SaveMeriam'. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has said: 'I wholeheartedly endorse this call for the death sentence to be dropped'. Some . 1.5 million people have also signed petitions calling for Meriam’s . release including 900,000 on one alone set up by human rights . campaigners Amnesty. In the US, two Senators have demanded that the State Department do more to help Daniel and Meriam. Senator Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, has spoken directly with the State Department's Special Envoy for Sudan. Love: Meriam married Daniel Wani, a biochemist, who lives in Manchester, New Hampshire. He has now travelled back to Sudan in a bid to save his wife and children . Fury: Daniel is angry that the Us Embassy in Khartoum have demanded he take a paternity test before they decide whether they can help his children, who would have a claim to US citizenship and US protection . Rep Trent Franks, R-Arizona, also raised it at the Homeland Security Department Oversight Committee. In response Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security said: 'I will personally take a look at this case, it sounds troubling'. Earlier this week a member of the House of Lords called for the UK to grant Meriam asylum. Lord Alton of Liverpool said that allowing her to move to Britain would be an 'unequivocal demonstration of the value of a civilised country and a humane society.' The Foreign Office has not yet responded to his comments.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"An airline passenger was thrown off a flight after a fellow traveller reported him to cabin crew for writing the word 'terrorism' in his journal as they prepared to take off. Oliver Buckworth was on a Gold Coast-bound Tigerair flight from Melbourne when a man in the seat behind him complained to a stewardess. About 10 minutes later Australian Federal Police officers boarded the flight and asked him to get off. The drama was sparked when the 28-year-old scribbled a drawing of a distressed man and wrote the words 'terror is made up'. Scroll down for video . An airline passenger was thrown off a flight after a fellow traveller reported him to cabin crew for writing the word 'terrorism' in his journal as they prepared to take off . The Melbourne interior designer, who was planning to visit family and friends in Byron Bay in northeastern NSW, had been scribbling down his thoughts in his journal on Saturday morning. Above his drawing, he had also written: 'In a land of melting ice creams, sandy feet and fluffy bears, how can anyone be fearful of terrorism.' 'I'm an inquisitive guy and I was just making light-hearted scribble about how everyone is getting so scared about terrorism again,' Mr Buckworth told Daily Mail Australia. 'Then I heard the guy behind me tap the stewardess and say ""look what he's writing"". 'So I turned around and told him that I was merely commenting on the mass fear of the Australian people.' Shortly after, he looked up only to be faced with three officers from the Australian Federal Police who ordered him to alight from the aircraft. 'It was an incredibly unjust situation,' Mr Buckworth said. 'I was afraid because no one was helping me and I was blamed purely from hearsay. 'Nobody defended me on the plane as I looked around for sympathy. 'I guess they thought ""there goes the baddie and pointed their finger at me"". Oliver Buckworth was on a Gold Coast-bound Tigerair flight from Melbourne on Saturday morning and was not charged by police . But Mr Buckworth didn't leave without a fight. As he was escorted off the plane, he tried to plead his innocence to the rest of the passengers on board by yelling: 'I'm not a criminal you've got the wrong guy'. Once he was taken off the flight, police searched Mr Buckworth and agreed that he was indeed innocent. 'The police said I was free to go because I did nothing wrong but no further action was taken,' he said. 'When I asked them about a reimbursement for another flight, the police said it was matter for the airline.' So after five hours worth of phone calls, an operator from Singapore Airlines-owned Tiger Airways informed Mr Buckworth that he had to submit an online form in order to gain a response regarding the matter. 'And to add salt to the wound, I was told that they [Tigerair] can't guarantee that I'll be able to get on another flight because I might be blacklisted,' he said. Tigerair has confirmed it sought an AFP intervention after receiving a complaint about a disruptive passenger. The airline had a policy of zero-tolerance in matters of safety, it also said in a statement. 'Safety and security of staff and passengers underpins the operation at all times and is never compromised,' a Tigerair spokesperson said. 'As per Tigerair's conditions of carriage, the airline may refuse passengers to travel for reasons of safety or security and this may include the enforcement of future travel bans. 'As the matter was dealt with by the AFP and is subject to further review by Tigerair, we are unable to comment further at this time.' An operator from Tiger Airways told Mr Buckworth that he may be 'blacklisted' from future flights . However a spokesman for AFP said 'no further action will be taken'. 'The AFP responded to a call for assistance from the airline and briefly spoke to the individual concerned,' the spokesman said. 'It is a matter for the airline.' Still, Mr Buckworth has received no word from Tigerair as concerns grow for both him and his family. 'My biggest  fear is this will cause a ripple effect with other airlines and now my family is paranoid that they'll be blacklisted too,' he said. 'Especially because we have a particular surname – there aren't a lot of Buckworths out there. 'The pure irony of it all was that I was writing about the very subject of this fear in everyone about terror. So the whole situation is quite poignant and ridiculous.' The incident comes in light of the federal government's bid to step up security measures after increasing Australia's terrorism alert level to high. On Thursday, at least 800 officers from AFP and NSW Police were involved in anti-terror raids across Sydney and Brisbane, which has been declared as Australia's largest ever counter-terrorism operation. Those who were arrested include Omarjan Azari, who was charged with a serious terrorism related offence for allegedly plotting to behead a member of the public in Martin Place, Sydney's CBD.","Oliver Buckworth boarded a Gold Coast-bound Tigerair flight from Melbourne on Saturday .

"Debenhams has made a step forward in promoting body confidence by becoming the first high-street retailer to permanently introduce size 16 mannequins. The new mannequins, which were trialled by the high street store three years ago, will be used at its shop in Oxford Street, London. They will appear alongside size 10 . dummies on all women's fashion floors, before being rolled out across . all 170 of Debenhams' UK stores. (Left) the mannequin compared to the standard size 10 model and (right) Lizzie Singleton from Debenhams dresses a new size 16 mannequin which are due to be rolled out in stores in the UK . Size 10 is the standard size for mannequins on the high street, a far cry from the dimensions of the average British woman. Debenhams . director Ed Watson said: 'The average British woman is a size 16, but . the high street has been showing them clothing on a mannequin that is . three sizes smaller - until now. (Left) the new size 16 mannequin and (right) both the size 16 and size 10 models displaying the same dress . Promoting body confidence? Debenhams becomes first mainstream high street store to introduce size 16 mannequins . Profit boost: Debenhams found that shoppers are three times more likely to buy an item if it is displayed on a mannequin with their body shape . 'Having worked on this project for three years, we hope that it will help people in some small way to feel comfortable about their bodies and, crucially, that other retailers will follow.' The move was backed by equalities minister Jo Swinson, who has led a Government drive to promote body confidence among women. She said: 'The images we see in the world of fashion are all pretty much the same - it's as if there's only one way of being beautiful. Yet nine in ten people say they would like to see a broader range of body shapes shown in advertising and the media. Equalities Minister Jo Swinson backed Debenham's launch of size 16 mannequins .

"Islamic State fighters beheaded seven men and three women in a Kurdish area of northern Syria, a monitoring group reports. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said five Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, among them three women, and four Syrian Arabs were beheaded near the town of Kobani. The Kurdish fighters were taken prisoner during the battle for the mainly Kurdish town, also known as Ayn Arab, which is close to the Turkish border and has been besieged by Islamic State forces. Scroll down for video . Woman fighters from the Kurdish People's Protection Units: Three women (not pictured) were among five Kurdish fighters reportedly beheaded by Islamic State militants after they were captured near Kobani . Dozens of militants and Kurdish fighters were killed in the fighting, said SOHR. Rami Abdulrahman, head of the Observatory, said a Kurdish male civilian was also beheaded. 'I don't know why they were arrested or beheaded. Only the Islamic State knows why. They want to scare people,' he said. Images posted on social media networks show women's heads placed on a cement block, said to be in the northern Syrian city of Jarablous, which is held by militants. Women fight alongside men in the Kurdish People's Protection Units, known as the YPG, which is the official armed wing of the main Kurdish political group in Syria. Kurdish forces have been locked in fierce clashes with Islamic State militants in and around Kobani since the extremist group launched an assault in mid-September. The fighting has created one of the single largest exoduses in Syria's civil war, with more than 160,000 people fleeing into Turkey, UN humanitarian chief Valerie Amos said yesterday. Kurdish fighters brandish their automatic rifles in Kobani: Fighting for the town has continued for several weeks, with dozens of Islamic State militants and Kurdish fighters killed in recent days alone . More refugees streamed into Turkey from Kobani today, according to an AP journalist on the border. Turkish authorities were registering them and bussing them to refugee camps. Others were being picked up at the border by their relatives in Turkey. Islamic State militants have staked out positions east, west and south of Kobani. Thick dark smoke could be seen rising from an area south of the town today. Smokes rise after a mortar shell landed in the south of the city center of Syrian Kurdish town of Kobani, seen from the Turkish side of border, as thousands of new Syrian refugees from Kobani arrive in Suruc, Turkey . The Islamic State group has pressed its assault on Kobani despite airstrikes by the US-led coalition on its positions. The U.S. has been bombing the Islamic State group across Syria since last week and in neighboring Iraq since early August. The U.S. military said American warplanes conducted three air strikes against Islamic State militants in Syria near Kobani overnight and today, destroying an armed vehicle, an artillery piece and a tank. U.S. and British warplanes also carried out five air strikes in neighbouring Iraq, knocking out two armed vehicles, a militant-occupied building and two fighting positions north-west of Mosul, the country's second largest city, which fell to the Islamic State group in June. One strike near the Haditha dam in Anbar province destroyed an armed vehicle, while another air raid outside Baghdad eliminated two armed vehicles.","Kurdish fighters taken prisoner during the ongoing fight for Kobani .

"Nightclub supremo and multi-millionaire political donor James Palumbo has been nominated for a peerage by Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg. Mr Palumbo, the founder of the Ministry of Sound club in south London, has given more than £500,000 to the Lib Dems since 2004 and is expected  to be among a new list of peers announced in the next fortnight, according to the Sunday Times. The son of property developer Lord (Peter) Palumbo, with whom he has had a long-running feud, Mr Palumbo, 50, played a key role in the last Lib Dem mayoral election by allowing the party to use the nightclub as the campaign headquarters. James Palumbo, founder of the Ministry of Sound nightclub, has been nominated for a peerage by Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg . The old Etonian, a former banker, is a close friend of Mr Clegg and has played a key role in helping to modernise the party by giving advice on marketing, IT, social media and personnel departments. He has also written a number of papers on business affairs for Mr Clegg and is among party donors who have dined with the leader at Chevening, the Kent retreat he shares with foreign secretary William Hague. Mr Palumbo is a close friend of Mr Clegg, pictured, and has donated more than £500,000 to the Lib Dems since 2004 . Despite his allegiance to the Lib Dems. Mr Palumbo has previously given help to the Conservative party, for which his father is a peer. In 2009, he donated £7,000 in auction prizes to the Westminster North consituency association and he has admitted voting for Alan Clarke, then Tory MP for Kensington and Chelsea. Mr Palumbo's family was torn apart 18 years ago when he and sister Annabella accused their father of plundering £30 million from the family trust, set up by their grandfather, Rudolph Palumbo, who made his fortune developing bombsites in London after World War II. He died in 1987 leaving a series of family trusts valued at around £135 million. Mr Palumbo told the Mail in April that he hoped he could reconcile with his father. 'There is a lot that has been said and done in the past that is hard to let go of. It has become entrenched after I wrote a letter to him. ‘But the fact is I am getting older and hopefully more mature. 'But I am not sure how my father will react to the suggestion. ‘It is not straightforward and the whole thing is difficult for others to understand. 'We are both proud men but I have been thinking maybe we could talk before my birthday. ‘Maybe we could meet over a cup of tea first. The point is, none of us is here for ever.’ Mr Palumbo could be joined by nine other Lib Dem donors in the next honours list. Feud: Mr Palumbo has been estranged from his father, Lord Palumbo, left, for a number of years . Mr Palumbo has made millions from Ministry of Sound, which could be closed and turned into flats if developers get their way . It is being vetted by the appointments commission, which looks at nominees' backgrounds and business interests to ensure they do not bring the upper house into disrepute and pay full taxes in the UK. A spokesman for Mr Palumbo said he and his businesses were fully domiciled in Britain and he paid all his taxes here. Other names expected to be on the list are Rumi Verjee, who has given £770,000 to the Lib Dems since 2010, and Brian Paddick, the party's mayoral candidate. It may also include party treasurer Ian Wrigglesworth and two former advisers to Mr Clegg, Olly Grender and Alison Suttie. Further possible names include Sudhir Choudrie, whose family has donated £650,000 to the party since 2004, and policy adviser Patrick Rock.","James Palumbo is a friend and adviser to party leader Nick Clegg .

"It's the ultimate sweetheart deal for a free-spending federal government: Wednesday night's debt deal didn't actually raise the limit on America's credit card, but instead removed it entirely until February 7, 2014. Whether through legislative sleight-of-hand or something less sinister, the law of the land now permits the U.S. to run up new debts for 16 weeks without consequences, and forbids the Treasury Department from enforcing the debt limit that ordinarily keeps spending from spiraling out of control. Some observers noted on Wednesday that when Congress burned the midnight oil to debate a deal that would save the U.S. from crashing through its existing $16.7 trillion debt ceiling and risking a credit default, there was no debate over exactly how far to raise it. House and Senate negotiators only discussed how long the agreement would last. Look familiar? Shoppers on food stamps cleaned out a Louisiana Wal-Mart after a computer glitch removed spending limits on their EBT cards for a few hours on Saturday. Congress now holds the license for a similar spending spree . Pushing the limit: The National Debt Clock already registered $16.9 trillion on Tuesday, with no end in sight . The result has left the Treasury free to accumulate as much debt as it needs to until the deal expires, The Daily Caller noted on Thursday. The Bipartisan Policy Center estimated that if the government had extended its debt ceiling in this fashion through the end of 2014, as one Republican proposal suggested, the federal government's debt would have ballooned by $1.1 trillion. At that rate, the national debt will likely grow by at least $282.5 billion on its own by the time Feb. 7 rolls around, bringing the total close to an even $17 trillion. But there's no guarantee it won't grow even faster, especially if the legislative initiatives President Obama outlined Thursday morning were to cross the finish line by year's end, as he demanded in his first public remarks since signing the debt-limit hike law shortly after midnight. Obama said he wants Congress to give him a new budget deal, a 5-year farm bill and a comprehensive reform of America's immigration laws, all before New Year's Day. Any one of those three could be a colossal budget-buster. Under ordinary circumstances, a hard-and-fast debt limit might serve as a check against runaway spending; but with no ceiling, Democrats could raid the Treasury to give the president what he wants, without fear of practical roadblocks getting in the way. President Obama outlined his fall agenda on Thursday, demanding a new budget, a comprehensive immigration reform law and farm legislation, any of which could break the bank now that there's no limit on the nation's credit card . Republicans, too, could take advantage of the spending loophole. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell demonstrated on Wednesday that he's willing to accept expensive pot-sweeteners in exchange for a tidy solution to a messy problem. When Obama signed the debt-bailout package into law, it included more than $2 billion in new spending for a dam project in McConnell's home state of Kentucky, answering for some the thorny question of why the Senate's top Republican would be so eager to make Democrats look good by negotiating a deal when tea party conservatives in the House were refusing to do so. According to the conservative Heritage Foundation, Obama and Congress have already used the trick of 'suspending' the debt ceiling for a fixed period of time once before – running from February to May of this year. That deal added $300 billion to the national debt in 102 days. The deal that went into effect Thursday covers 114 days. The only requirement for that earlier agreement was that the Democrat-led Senate produce a formal budget for the first time since President Obama took office, which it did. 'No savings were accomplished,' says Heritage. 'Suspending the debt is less transparent to the American people,' the group explains, adding that 'a calendar date is not nearly as scary to constituents as a figure in the trillions of dollars.' Conservatives have demanded leak-proof border security as a condition to discussing amnesty for 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, an expensive proposition that could suddenly seem affordable . Thousands of miles of new border fences, plus the manpower to guard them, would add tens of billions -- or more -- to the debt total while there's no spending ceiling overhead . The coming battles over a year-long federal budget, including Democrats' demands for new taxes and an expected Republican push for spending cuts, could actually reduce deficit spending; but with no credit limit holding them back, lawmakers could see a perfect storm for committing to hundreds of billions in new earmarked projects calculated to please constituents back home. The farm bill, too, is likely to rack up record spending on programs like food stamps, which fall under the Department of Agriculture's budget: The Obama administration has already doubled the number of Americans receiving these entitlements since January 2009. But immigration could require the biggest blank check of all. While Obama and congressional liberals want to put 11 million illegal aliens on a path to citizenship, conservatives have consistently argued that the nation's borders must first be secured. That, Democrats have countered, is simply too expensive to contemplate since it would likely involve building thousands of miles of new high-tech fences and staffing the Mexican border with thousands of guards whose salaries no one has contemplated yet. Capitol Hill sources tell MailOnline that without a fixed debt ceiling over their heads, everyone in Congress might suddenly find it workable to give both parties what they want. Food stamp recipients receive benefits from states, but the federal government pays the bills under the authority of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, an agency whose five-year spending plan is due for a budget-busting renewal . 'I can't speak for the whole Republican caucus, of course,' said a policy staffer to a conservative GOP House member, 'but some of us want a border fence badly enough that we'll look the other way if it adds a few hundred billion to the national debt.' 'And once that's in place, the biggest impediment to a citizenship path disappears.' Since President Obama took office, new deficit spending has added about $43,000 to the national debt for every household in America. That reflects a 60 per cent increase in the debt from where it sat on his first Inauguration Day, at $10.3 trillion. At current rates of growth, Obama will leave office with national debts twice the size of those accumulated by all the previous U.S. presidents combined.","Congressional deal set a time limit for a debt-ceiling extension, but didn't cap it with a fixed dollar amount .
Obama's three autumn demands – a new budget, a farm bill and comprehensive immigration reform – could take the U.S. into uncharted debt territory while Treasury stops enforcing a limit .
Democrats' immigration demands, previously parried with complaints about the cost of new border fences, could suddenly seem easy to grant .
Food stamp recipients, paid through the farm bill, have doubled under Obama and that growth shows no sign of stopping .
U.S. national debt stands to add a minimum of $300 billion between now and Feb. 7, when the eleventh-hour deal negotiated Wednesday expires ."
"A former policeman who is one of three men sought in connection with an alleged racist incident involving Chelsea football fans on a Paris Metro train has apologised for his involvement. Richard Barklie, 50, from Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland was identified after the Metropolitan Police released stills of men they want to speak to in connection with the incident. Mr Barklie now works with human rights charity in Northern Ireland which helps people affected by the troubles. Scroll down for video . Richard Barklie, pictured, has been identified as one of the people wanted in connection with the Paris Metro racism row. Mr Barklie is a former RUC police officer from Northern Ireland and a human rights worker . Mr Barklie, right, released an image of the former police officer who has denied that he is a racist . Mr Barklie, left, addressed the World Human Rights Forum's conference in India in 2013 . He has flown around the globe, even addressing a World Human Rights forum in India in 2013 where he said he was a director of the World Human Rights Forum. The Sunday World newspaper in Dublin revealed that the former RUC officer and Chelsea season ticket holder was on the train at the time of the incident. Mr Barkley has since been suspended by the Wave Trauma Centre in Belfast where he helped victims of the Northern Irish Troubles. The Chelsea season ticket holder is one of the three men whose images were released by Scotland Yard as part of an investigation into a group of supporters who allegedly pushed a black man off the train and chanted a racist song in the French capital on Tuesday. The incident happened ahead of Chelsea's Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain, which ended 1-1. Footage posted online showed the commuter - named in reports as Souleymane S - being pushed back on to the platform amid chants of 'we're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it'. Mr Barklie, bottom right, admitted that he was involved in the incident on the train but denies being a racist . In a statement on Sunday, Mr Barklie's solicitor said his client, centre, is a Chelsea season ticket holder . The statement claimed, Mr Barklie, centre, did not engage in any racist singing or chanting . On Sunday night, Mr Barklie issued a statement through his lawyer in which he admitted involvement in an 'incident' that resulted in Souleymane Sylla being 'unable to enter part of the train'. He said he had an account he wanted to provide to police that would explain the 'context and circumstances'. Mr Barklie denied singing any racist songs; said he travelled to the game alone; insisted he did not know any of the other individuals captured on video footage of the incident; and said he has never been part of any 'group or faction' of Chelsea fans. The statement was issued by Belfast solicitor Kevin Winters. 'We act on behalf of Mr Barklie identified as one of the people sought by authorities investigating an incident on the Paris Metro on 16/2/15 ,' it said. 'We contacted London Metropolitan Police today to advise that our client is happy to assist with inquiries. 'Pending formal engagement with police, our client is anxious to put on record his total abhorrence for racism and any activity associated with it. 'As someone who has spent years working with disadvantaged communities in Africa and India he can point to a cv in human rights work which undermines any suggestion he is racist. 'Today a senior official in the World Human Rights Forum confirmed their support for him. 'Mr Barklie is a Chelsea season ticket holder and has travelled to matches for over 20 years now without incident. 'He travelled alone to the Paris St Germain match and has no knowledge whatsoever of the identities of the other people depicted in recent YouTube video releases. He wants to stress that he was not and never has been part of any group or faction of Chelsea supporters. 'He did not participate in racist chanting and singing and condemns any behaviour supporting that. 'He accepts he was involved in an incident when a person now known to him as Souleymane S was unable to enter a part of the train. 'He has an account to give to police which will explain the context and circumstances as they prevailed at that particular time. 'In the meantime pending that, he wants to put on record his sincerest apologies for the trauma and stress suffered by Mr Souleymane. 'He readily acknowledges that any judgement on the integrity of his apology will be kept in abeyance pending the outworkings of the investigation. 'Given the extremely sensitive nature of the issues engaged we urge upon all media outlets to exercise as much restraint as possible when commenting on the case. 'We accept on behalf of our client that public interest demands nothing but total indignation and condemnation from all media reporting but such reporting ought not to persist at the expense of undermining Mr Barklie's right to a fair trial . 'Tonight London Met confirmed with us that arrangements were in hand to take the investigation to the next stage.' Mr Barklie said he wants to explain to police what happened between him and Souleymane Sylla, pictured . Mr Barklie, right, said he offered 'his sincerest apologies for the trauma and stress suffered' by Mr Sylla . The WAVE Trauma Centre, which supports victims of the Northern Ireland Troubles, tonight said it had suspended a part-time worker pending further investigation into the Paris incident. 'As this matter is subject to an investigation by the Metropolitan Police it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage,' said a spokesman for the charity. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the three men had now been identified and the force was liaising with the French authorities. None of the men sought by Scotland Yard have been arrested. A police spokesman said the force cannot arrest people for offences which happen outside the UK but 'a number of people' have now been spoken to in relation to the incident. Five people have so far been suspended from Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground following investigations into the incident. The club has reiterated its promise to ban for life anyone proved to have been involved in the altercation and is helping police in the UK and Paris. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said the club are 'appalled' by the racial abuse, adding that owner Roman Abramovich is also 'disgusted'. Meanwhile, police are seeking a gang of men, believed to be Chelsea fans, who were heard shouting racist chants at London St Pancras station on Wednesday evening. A member of the public reported the men, who had travelled by train from Paris Gare du Nord, British Transport Police (BTP) said. It is believed they were returning home after attending Chelsea's match with PSG.","Former RUC officer Richard Barklie identified as a Paris Metro race suspect .

"An ex-rugby player who feared undergoing surgery for his battered nose would leave him resembling Micheal Jackson has won £26,000 after surgeons botched the operation. Carl Egonu, from Plymouth, wanted to streamline his nose after years of playing the high-octane sport. The concerned 49-year-old spoke to his doctor about ending up with unusual features similar to those of the late pop star - but he now has a raised scar and a permanent patch of darkened skin on the end of his nose. Distressing difference: Carl Egonu wanted his nose streamlined after years of playing rugby. Left, the 49-year-old before the surgery, and right, with an obvious dark and raised scar that can never be removed . Mr Egonu said he became depressed and withdrawn after the private operation at Nuffield Hospital, Plymouth, Devon in March 2006. The dermabrasion operation left what Judge Christopher Gardner QC described as a 'significant cosmetic defect' on the end of his nose, which he will have for the rest of his life. Mental effects: Mr Egonu said the surgery made him depressed and he even tried hypnotherapy to help him cope . Although the sportsman has now managed to put his scar to the back of his mind, the judge said there was no doubt it had badly affected him and he even had a session of hypnotherapy to come to terms with the blemish. Judge Gardner said: 'The resultant appearance of his nose is something that people - including his own children - tend to ask him about, and the experts agree that attempts to camouflage or skin graft will not assist.' Mr Egonu, a building surveyor, sued the cosmetic surgeon who operated on him, Dr Adeshola Adeniran, who also carries out an NHS role as a locum consultant at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth. Mr Egonu’s lawyers made no criticism of the medic’s surgical skills, but said he failed to warn his patient about the possible risks of the procedure, which was meant to give his nose a cleaner, smoother profile. The judge added: 'Having reached an age where he had finished playing rugby - in which sport his nose had been injured on occasions but not fractured - he consulted Dr Adeniran to ascertain whether the shape of his nose, the bulbous tip of which he felt was too large, could be made more streamlined, and at the same time some small acne lumps could be removed or reduced - although they were not his main concern.' The surgery carried a higher risk of causing hyper-pigmented scarring, resulting in darker areas of skin, because Mr Egonu is black, his lawyers claimed. 'Hyper-pigmented': The businessman, left before the operation and right, afterwards, had wanted to reduce the bulbous tip of his nose and remove acne scars at the same time - although this was not his main concern . Drastically altered: The building surveyor says even his own children ask him about the scar, and that he should have been better warned of the risks . Life-changing mistake: The judge agreed that Mr Egonu would probably not have gone ahead with the operation had he been properly informed of the scarring risk . He had wanted the size of his nose reduced by the procedure, the county court heard, and believed there was no risk of permanent adverse scarring. Hyper-pigmentation is the result of an overproduction of melanin, a substance which gives skin and hair its colour, protects against UV light and absorbs heat from the sun. An overproduction of melanin leads to a mottled, uneven skin tone. It can be stimulated by excessive sun exposure, hormones, or scarring. Post-inflammatory hyper-pigmentation is a darkening of skin as a result of skin injury or acne scarring, caused by an inflammatory response in skin. You cannot stimulate cells the skin's immune system cells without stimulating cells linked to melanin production. If the pigment is found in cells deep in the skin it is very difficult to treat. Source: Dermalogica . Dr Adeniran, however, insisted that he gave Mr Egonu a strengthened warning about the potential downsides of the operation. At their initial consultation, he claimed Mr Egonu told him he had a good knowledge about the options open to him but did not want a complete rhinoplasty as he did not want to 'look like Michael Jackson'. Dr Adeniran’s QC, Richard Wilson, urged the judge to reduce the figure because the scar was only visible at a conversational distance, but Mr Egonu was awarded £26,000. The doctor went on to challenge the county court ruling at London’s Appeal Court. His lawyers argued that he gave his patient a clear warning about the risks of the procedure. But Mr Egonu insisted that, after his wife expressed concerns, the surgeon reassured him that scarring would not happen, and that, if it did, he would have to use him as a case study. Lady Justice Hallett, sitting with Lord Justice McFarlane, said the county court judge found that Mr Egonu gave consistent evidence that he would not have gone ahead with the operation had he been properly informed of the scarring risk. 'There was sufficient material before Judge Gardner to justify those conclusions,' she said, refusing Dr Adeniran permission to appeal and confirming Mr Egonu’s pay-out.","Carl Egonu wanted to reduce the size of his nose after sporting injuries .

"When Vincent Kompany speaks he tends to make sense. So when, after Manchester City’s trouncing of hapless Newcastle, the Belgian claimed Stoke could be tougher opponents than Champions League visitors Barcelona, heads turned. Did he really just say that? He did — and Manuel Pellegrini’s leader had a point. ‘Barcelona’s ability is not about hurting you all game,’ Kompany explained. ‘You can have tougher games when you go to Stoke. It’s about the fact Barcelona can decide a game within a second. Barcelona's attacking trio of Neymar (left), Lionel Messi (centre) and Luis Suarez . Sergio Aguero and David Silva can provide the magic for Manchester City, believes Vincent Kompany . Kompany believes that Stoke City can be a tougher challenge than upcoming opponents Barcelona . Victor Moses (right) celebrates scoring the winner for Stoke City on Saturday alongside Jonathan Walters . ‘They have more players than anyone else in the world who can finish games with a touch of magic.’ Kompany knows all about those game-finishing moments. Last season he was at fault, stepping up for an offside that was never there when Lionel Messi was set clear at the Etihad with the tie at 0-0. Kompany’s defensive partner, Martin Demichelis, had little option but to bring down Messi in the area. From relative comfort, City found themselves a goal down and a man short, all because of a tiny lapse in concentration. They would go on to lose the tie 4-1 on aggregate. On the evidence of Saturday evening’s procession, however, Pellegrini’s men would appear to be better equipped a year on for the home leg. Yes, they will miss the suspended Yaya Toure in the first game but, with an hour gone and his rampant side already 5-0 up against a Newcastle outfit collapsing quicker than England’s cricketers against New Zealand, Pellegrini declared and took off two-goal magician David Silva and the revitalised Sergio Aguero. Aguero calmly placed his spot-kick past Tim Krul to converted in the second minute against Newcastle . Silva finished low in the corner to put Manchester City 4-0 up against Newcastle on Saturday . Silva went on to blast in the fifth and final goal with the pick of the strikes from outside the area . Silva celebrates with Aguero as they ran riot at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday evening . Both can provide for City those moments of brilliance Kompany referred to. Aguero, who missed the first leg last year and retired at half-time in the second, will be relishing the opportunity. As is Kompany, who added that City are not scared of their now familiar foes. ‘Fear?’ he said. ‘We don’t fear them. You don’t go in at this level fearing strikers. We want to play against them. It’s the fourth time in a year now. There’s nothing new to worry us, it’s a case of having the whole team at a very high level.’ A cool penalty from Aguero, a thumping close-range shot from Samir Nasri and a sublime finish from the reborn Edin Dzeko put City 3-0 up after just 21 minutes. A quickfire double from Silva following the break had Newcastle fans streaming for the bars. Before five-star City narrowed the gap on Chelsea to five points, Barcelona had suffered a surprise 1-0 home defeat at the hands of Pellegrini’s former club Malaga. The Chilean, who introduced £28million man Wilfried Bony for a half-hour cameo, cancelled a planned briefing with the Spanish press last week for fear it would distract from the visit of John Carver’s generous Geordies. But did Barca take their eye off the ball? Martin Demichelis brought down Messi at the Etihad Stadium during last season's Champions League clash . Demichelis was sent off before Barcelona went on to win the tie 4-1 over two legs and progress . ‘Maybe they were thinking about Tuesday,’ said Pellegrini. When the Catalans came calling last year, City remained in the Capital One Cup and the FA Cup. This time there are no such diversions and Pellegrini reluctantly admitted this put them in better shape. ‘We’d played 18 games in December and January and were really tired by the time we met Barcelona. This time we are arriving at the game not having so many games as last season and that could be important.I would always prefer to stay in the cup competitions but when you are out of them it is easier to focus.’ Pellegrini agreed that Aguero, out for five weeks following a knee injury in December, was nearing top form again. ‘Every game he is improving and he is now arriving again to the high-performance level he had before his injury,’ he said. Carver, left to rue a display that started badly and got worse, does not believe the defeat will harm his chances of landing the Newcastle job permanently. ‘It’s not going to be the end of the world,’ he said. ‘We’ll be judged on the games against Villa and teams like that.’ For City, whose owners demand European progression, judgment is looming.","Vincent Kompany says you can have harder time at Stoke than Barcelona .

"Designer had sued High Street chain for copying his heels . French court rules customers will not be confused between designer version and cut-price pair and orders Louboutin to pay compensation . Flash of red: Victoria Beckham in a pair of red-soled Louboutins in Hong Kong . The distinctive scarlet soles have become an instantly recognisable marker of the brand, a stamp of taste and quality. But Christian Louboutin’s red-bottomed . shoes could face competition from high street lookalikes after a court . ruled fashion chain Zara could sell heels in the same colour. Louboutin initially sued  the Spanish . brand in 2008, claiming that an open- toed red-soled shoe it was selling . for £40 was similar to its Yo Yo style. However a French court ruled that Zara’s cut-price shoe could not be confused with that made by the high-end designer. And last week the Cour de Cassation – the final court of appeal – upheld the decision. It also ruled that Louboutin, whose . shoes are favoured by celebrities including Victoria Beckham and Sarah . Jessica Parker and cost hundreds of pounds a pair, must pay the chain . £2,000 in compensation. Alexis Mourot, group chief operating . officer and general manager of Christian Louboutin, said the company . would continue defending its soles. In 2008, Louboutin registered a . trademark, claiming the exclusive right to make shoes with red soles for . ‘women’s high fashion designer footwear’. And last year the shoemaker accused . designer Yves Saint Laurent of copying his celebrated red-soled . footwear, when he used a similar theme in his 2011 resort collection. That lawsuit resulted in a high-court appeal case in the US, the verdict of which is yet to be decided. Earlier this year, Louboutin told . French newspaper Libération why the cause is important to him and his . brand identity and that he is aware he cannot 'monopolise' a colour. Victory: Zara have won the right to sell their red-soled heels, left, which Louboutin said copied their Yo Yo slingbacks, right . Seeing red: In April 2011 Christian Louboutin sued YSL for using red soles on the bottom of its red pumps, demanding $1million in damages . He said: 'I understand that, but it is a red in . a specific context, there is Ferrari red [and] Hermès . orange. 'Even in the food . industry, Cadbury recently won a lawsuit against Nestlé for using purple . packaging. 'All this proves that the colours play a part in a brand's . identity.

Celebrity favourites: Amanda Holden, left, in Louboutin slingbacks and actress Hayden Panettiere flashes the famous red sole . Louboutin said that he came up with the idea for his red sole heels, which are favoured by celebrities including Sarah Jessica Parker and Victoria Beckham, nearly 20 years ago, when he . painted red nail polish on the black soles of a pair of women's shoes. His lawsuit against YSL reads: 'Mr Louboutin is the first designer to . develop the idea of having red soles on women's shoes. 'The location of . the bright colour on the outsole of a woman’s pump is said to provide an . alluring 'flash of red' when a woman walks down the street, or on the . red carpet of a special event.'

"This man is a walking history book. He has dedicated his body to the memory of the heroes and battles of the Second World War. Nolan Holmes has spent four years under the needle of a skilled tattoo artist to complete this homage to British and world history. A mark of respect: Nolan Holmes has dedicated his body to remembrance of the war . Illustrations include battles on the Russian front, the Battle of Britain and the Allied invasion . Beside Churchill and a wartime news report Holmes has now had a memorial poppy added to his tattoo . The mechanic has also had a striking poppy drawn alongside the pictures of conflict ready for this weekend's Remembrance Day. This Thursday will see the official open of The Field of Remembrance at Westminster Abbey. Twenty -six-year-old Nolan has the portraits of Churchill, Monty and even Hitler on his torso. They go alongside newspaper front pages of the time and the work is not without its touch of humour with comic actor John Cleese's classic moment: 'Do not mention the war,' featured. The Battle of the Russian Front, the Allies bombing of Germany the exploits of The Few in the airborne Battle of Britain and the German invasion of Poland are etched into Nolan's skin for the rest of his life. Body of work: Nolan started taking an interest in the war from listening to his grandmother who worked in a bomb factory . Included in the illustrations is John Cleese's 'don't mention the war' scene from Fawlty Towers . Finishing touch: The tattoo series took four years complete . He said: 'I have a family interest in the war.My grandmother worked on the production line for the Wellington bombers in Blackpool. 'She was engaged to a GI who was killed in the D-day landings. 'World War Two has become a huge interest of mine and I study all the books, films and documentaries about the war.' 'I feel the history of the war is dying as the world becomes more politically correct.I have dedicated my upper body as a mark of respect to those who served and those who fell in battle.' Nolan from Fleetwood added: 'These are not cheap back street drawings they are works of art and show the history of the war. My girlfriend loves them. 'It is not just a fashion stamp like many people have done.It is a huge talking point and makes people remember what went on between 1939 and 1945 a time when this country could have changed forever. 'Now I have had the Poppy done at the most fitting time of the year. 'My personal favourites are Churchill and the Spitfires flying past Tower Bridge.' Pete Sinclair who has won national awards for his tattoo skills turned Nolan's body into a battlefield.

"Mea culpa: Rep. Becky Carney, a Democrat, accidentally laid the passing vote for a controversial bill that allows fracking . A North Carolina state representative says she voted mistakenly to override the governor's veto of a bill to allow the shale gas exploration called 'fracking' after a late-night vote in the General Assembly. Democratic Rep. Becky Carney of Charlotte said she pushed the green 'yes' button at her desk Monday night to override Democratic Gov. Beverly Perdue's veto of the measure that would allow shale gas exploration, before realizing she wanted to vote red, or 'no.' After pushing the wrong button, Rep Carney could be heard saying, ‘Oh my gosh, I pushed green.’ She was told she couldn't change her vote because this would have altered the outcome. According to Raleigh Durham’s WRAL, the Democrat turned her light on, but was not recognised by Speaker Thom Tillis and went down on the floor to speak with him. Her 'yes' vote made the tally 72-47 - just above the 60 per cent required to override in the Republican-controlled Legislature. She told WRAL that she felt ‘rotten’ about the vote that allowed Gov. Perdue’s veto to be overridden, adding: ‘I made a mistake, and I tried to get recognised to change it, as people have been doing all night on other bills, and it was too late,’ she said. Red and green: After pushing the green button, the representative tried to correct the mistake at the General Assembly in North Carolina . Save our water: Wake County resident Marvin Woll joins others to protest fracking in North Carolina last week in Raleigh; because of Carney's vote, the fracking veto was overridden . ‘It would have changed the outcome of the vote.’ The chamber's rules allow members to again cast their vote if they’ve made a mistake, but prevent members from changing a vote if it affects the outcome. Rep Carney had voted earlier against fracking, and spent the days preceding the vote campaigning against the controversial process. Republican Paul Stam, the assembly’s majority leader, told NBC 17 that fracking will not begin for some time yet. ‘It’s definitely not a fast track,’ he said. ‘It’s two years of rule-making and no drilling until another vote of the assembly two years from now.’ Rep Carney said that she’ll be on the lookout for opportunities to change the law.

"A nicotine substitute which can be bought online for 12p more than triples a smoker's chances of quitting for at least a year, research has shown. Tabex, which contains the active ingredient cytisine, is obtained from laburnum seeds. Experts believe the drug is as effective as conventional stop-smoking treatments and could save the NHS millions of pounds a year. Revolutionary: Experts believe the 12p drug is as effective as conventional stop smoking treatments . The origins of the drug can be traced to German and Russian soldiers in World War II who smoked laburnum leaves when they ran out of nicotine. But despite four decades of use in eastern Europe, the pills are unlikely to be available on prescription in the UK for another two to three years. They can legally be bought online, but experts fear this leaves customers at risk of scammers selling poor quality counterfeit drugs. The British scientist who led the recent Tabex trial spoke of the 'Alice in Wonderland' regulatory system responsible for the delay. Source: The pills are made from a substance obtained from laburnum seeds . Professor Robert West, from the Cancer . Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre at University College . London, said he expected to see a flood of internet orders for Tabex . once news about the drug got out. 'It's been available in central and eastern Europe for more than 40 years, we have safety data on millions of people, and we know it's effective, but it's not licensed in Britain,' he said. 'People can make their own choices. A licence is not a licence to buy, it's a licence to market. 'There's nothing illegal about buying this drug online, but there's always the risk that you might not get what you expect.' The trial, involving 740 patients, showed that people who wanted to stop smoking were 3.4 times more likely to succeed with Tabex than with a 'dummy' placebo tablet. Participants took between two and six pills per day for 25 days. After treatment, 8.4 per cent of those given Tabex were able to avoid smoking for a year compared with 2.4 per cent of the placebo group. Trials involving Tabex showed it was over three times more effective in removing the desire to smoke . The low overall success rates reflected how hard it was even for motivated smokers to quit, said the researchers. However Professor West said his team was 'extremely encouraged' by the results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine.","Drug has been used in eastern Europe for 40 years .

"Almost a quarter of Americans in the prime of their working lives  are out of a job - and millions have given up trying completely, new figures show. Data published by the Senate Budget Committee revealed the extent of unemployment in the United States, saying that 28.9million US citizens aged 25-54 are out of a job - 23.2 per cent of the total. The information, published by Republican lawmakers, show a 3.5million increase compared to 2007. Stark: The stats, from Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee, show widespread joblessness in the US . The rate differs from the Department of Labor's official unemployment figure of 6.1per cent because the Budget Committee figures also include people who have been unemployed so long they no longer count as part of the 'labor force' used to calculate the regular rate. A release under the name of Jeff Sessions, an Alabama senator, said the figures show 'deep, profound and pervasive' problems in the U.S. economy. The figures cut against the regular unemployment figures, which have been steadily falling since a high of 10 per cent in 2010. Unemployment: The statistics cut against recent improving unemployment statistics. Pictured are would-be workers in New York queuing for jobs . He said: 'Nearly one-quarter of this group - 28.9 million people, or 23.2 percent of the total - is not currently employed. 'They either became so discouraged that they left the labor force entirely, or they are in the labor force but unemployed. This group of non-employed individuals is more than 3.5 million larger than before the recession began in 2007.' 'Those attempting to minimize the startling figures about America’s vanishing workforce — workplace participation overall is near a four-decade low — will say an aging population is to blame.' 'But in fact, while the workforce overall has shrunk nearly 10 million since 2009, the cohort of workers in the labor force ages 55 to 64 has actually increased over that same period, with many delaying retirement due to poor economic conditions.' 'In fact, over two-thirds of all labor force dropouts since that time have been under the age of 55.

"House Speaker John Boehner's lawsuit against him is just a 'stunt,' President Barack Obama told ABC News anchor George Stephanopolous on Thursday. Obama said he'd already talked to the GOP legislator and that he told him,‘ ""If you’re really concerned about me taking too many executive actions, why don’t you try getting something done through Congress?"" ' 'You're going to squawk if I try to fix some parts of it . administratively that are within my authority while you're not doing . anything?' Obama said, referring to House Republicans. ""I'm not going to apologize for trying to do something while they're doing nothing.' Scroll down for video . Go home, you're drunk: President Barack Obama said Thursday that House Speaker John Boehner's lawsuit against him is a 'stunt' You'll still be my friend right?: President Barack Obama holds six-month-old Olivia Hughes, of Arlington, Va., after arriving on the South Lawn of the White House today after a two-day trip to Minnesota . Obama . has repeatedly touted his 'pen and phone' approach to implementing his domestic . agenda by going around Congress, casting 2014 during his most recent . State of the Union address as a 'year of action.' The House has passed legislation that . would curb the president's power to take executive actions that . Republicans say fall outside his constitutional authority, but Senate . Majority Leader Harry Reid has declared them dead on arrival. On Wednesday Boehner announced he will file a lawsuit against President Obama for what . he claimed is a series of abuses of power in the executive branch of the . federal government. 'This is not about impeachment,' the Ohio legislator insisted. 'It's about him faithfully executing the laws of this country.' 'What . we've seen, clearly over the last five years, is an effort to erode the . power of the legislative branch,' Boehner said. 'I believe the . president is not faithfully executing the laws of our country.' Better things to do: The White House has said it's not going to let Boehner's lawsuit consume its attention . Unphased: Obama went about his business on Friday, speaking on the economy in Minneapolis, Minnesota, before heading back to Washington . Obama's more controversial actions have included raising the minimum wage for companies undertaking new federal government contracts, ordering a long series of changes to the implementation schedule of his Obamacare law, decreeing new fuel-economy standards for trucks, and – most recently – declaring that the EPA will enforce a wide-ranging set of rules governing carbon emissions. Obama's Climate Action Plan, formalized this week, is being called a 'coal-killer' because it will dramatically increase costs associated with building and running coal-fired electric power plants. But most objectionable to conservatives in Boehner's caucus, according to multiple Capitol Hill sources, is the president's 2012 action that deferred deportation for hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. That move, Republicans say, led directly to the current border crisis that has seen tens of thousands of unaccompanied children – including many toddlers and infants – being brought across the U.S.-Mexico border in the hope of an amnesty. Boehner . told reporters on Wednesday that he hasn't yet decided which of Obama's . executive actions he will challenge in federal court. 'When I make that decision, I'll let you know,' he said. He told a closed-door House Republican Conference meeting on Tuesday – and followed up with a detailed memo . – that he plans to move ahead with the lawsuit in the coming weeks. The . whole House of Representatives would be the plaintiff, meaning he will . need the approval of House leaders. With the GOP in the majority, that isn't expected to be a problem. The . Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, an informal House leadership panel, . will likely make the call. It includes Boehner, newly minted Majority . Leader Kevin McCarthy and Majority Whip Steve Scalise, Minority Leader . Nancy Pelosi and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer. A simple majority vote, . likely 3-2, will determine if Boehner can proceed. Asked in his weekly press briefing on Wednesday if he's committed to moving forward, he replied, 'I am.' 'You notice that he didn't specifically . say what exactly he was objecting to,' Obama said when asked . about the suit by Stephanopoulos. 'Right now we’ve got a Republican Party that seems to only care about saying ""no"" to me.' Unphased: Obama went about his business on Friday, speaking on the economy in Minneapolis, Minnesota, before heading back to Washington . Fox News host Neil Cavuto, an unlikely ally of the Obama administration, bemoaned the GOP's latest move as partisan politics on his show Wednesday afternoon. 'Where was your rage when Democrats were going after President Bush on the same use of executive orders?' Cavuto asked Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann. 'I think you know in your heart of hearts this is a waste of time now. There are far more important things you guys have to be addressing.' Bachmann apparently didn't get her caucus leader's memo that the purpose of the lawsuit was not to impeach the president. 'What we should do right now is defund the executive branch while we have the option,' Bachmann said. 'What we can do further is impeach the elected official.' 'Think about what you are saying,' Cavuto told her during the shouting match. 'The Democrats would be in their right mind to laugh you out.' Executive action: The GOP says Obama's 2012 unilateral policy change on immigration enticed tens of thousands of unaccompanied children to cross the U.S. border, putting a strain on government resources and creating a humanitarian emergency . Boehner said he hasn't yet decided exactly which of Obama's executive actions he will challenge in court . White . House press secretary Josh Earnest accused congressional Republicans of . obstruction on Wednesday, and said they had left Obama with little . option but to make greater use of his executive authority . 'The . fact that they are considering a taxpayer-funded lawsuit against the . President of the United States for doing his job, I think, is the kind . of step that most Americans wouldn't support,' Earnest said. 'This lawsuit is not going to consume the attention of the White House.' Boehner spokesman Michael Steel pushed back on the Obama administration on Friday, telling reporters via email, 'The American people, their elected representatives, and the Supreme . Court have all expressed serious concerns about the President’s failure . to follow the Constitution.' 'Dismissing them with words like, ""smidgen"" or ""stunt’"" only reinforces their frustration,' he said. Obama 'has a clear record of ignoring the American people’s elected representatives and exceeding his constitutional authority, which has dangerous implications for both our system of government and our economy,' he told Roll Call earlier this week.","House speaker says Obama 'is not faithfully executing the laws of our country'

"Humans have long believed that they are smarter than other animals, but an increasing body of scientific evidence suggests that, as a species, we are just being arrogant. Evolutionary biologists claim that in some cases animals have superior brains to us and that many of their abilities are merely misunderstood by humans. They believe that creatures ranging from crows to koalas reveal this intelligence is widespread in the animal kingdom. Gibbons, for example, can produce 20 varied sounds with clearly different meanings that allow them to communicate across tropical forest canopy . Levels of perception in animals have been studied in many species and these processes can go beyond those found in humans, such as echolocation in bats and dolphins, motion detection by skin receptors in fish and the ability to see ultraviolet light in birds. Research into attention and expectation indicates that birds, mammals and reptiles are similar to humans. In one experiment a common pigeon could distinguish between a light and noise to anticipate a treat. Another experiment found that birds tend to catch the same type of insect repeatedly because prey selection is caused by an attentional bias that improves detection of one type of insect while suppressing detection of others. Different types of memory have been detected in animals and scientists have explored the spatial memory of scatter-hoarder animals such as certain jays, tits and squirrels, whose ecological niches require them to remember the locations of thousands of caches, often following radical changes in the environment. Tool use has been reported many times in both wild and captive primates, particularly the great apes. The use of tools by primates is varied and includes hunting fish, collecting honey, processing food such as nuts, collecting water, weapons and shelter. Research in 2007 shows that chimpanzees in the Fongoli savannah sharpen sticks to use as spears when hunting, considered the first evidence of systematic use of weapons in a species other than humans. Several species of birds including parrots and owls have been recorded as using tools in the wild. One species examined extensively under laboratory conditions is the New Caledonian crow. One individual called Betty spontaneously made a wire tool to solve a novel problem in the laboratory. It is clear that animals are capable of solving a range of problems that are argued to involve abstract reasoning. Research has shown  that the performances of Wolfgang Köhler's chimpanzees, who could achieve spontaneous solutions to problems without training, were by no means unique to that species and that apparently similar behaviour can be found in animals usually thought of as much less intelligent, if appropriate training is given. For example, the gibbon's ability to make varied sounds with different meanings, the koala's sophisticated method of marking its environment and domestic pets’ abilities to control humans are cited as evidence for this intelligence. ‘For millennia, all kinds of authorities from religion to scholars have been repeating the same idea ad nauseam, that humans are exceptional by virtue that they are the smartest in the animal kingdom,’ said Dr Arthur Saniotis, Visiting Research Fellow at the University of Adelaide’s School of Medical Sciences. ‘However, science tells us that animals can have cognitive faculties that are superior to human beings,’ he said. The belief that humans have superior intelligence harks back to the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 years ago when people began producing cereals and domesticating animals. According to the scientists, this gained momentum with the development of organised religion, which viewed human beings as the top species in creation. ‘The belief of human cognitive superiority became entrenched in human philosophy and sciences. Even Aristotle - probably the most influential of all thinkers - argued that humans were superior to other animals due to our exclusive ability to reason,’ Dr Saniotis said. Maciej Henneberg, a professor of anthropological and comparative anatomy from the university, believes animals often possess different abilities that are misunderstood by humans. ‘The fact that they may not understand . us, while we do not understand them, does not mean our “intelligences” are at different levels, they are just of different kinds. ‘When . a foreigner tries to communicate with us using an imperfect, broken, . version of our language, our impression is that they are not very . intelligent. But the reality is quite different,’ Professor Henneberg . said. The biologists . said that animals offer different kinds of intelligences, such as social . and kinaesthetic, which have been underrated due to humans' fixation . on language and technology. Gibbons, . for example, can produce 20 varied sounds with clearly different . meanings that allow them to communicate across tropical forest canopy. ‘The fact that they do not build houses is irrelevant to the gibbons,’ said Professor Henneberg. A different kind of intelligence: Koalas, have special pectoral glands for scent marking their environment in a complex way but humans cannot gauge the complexity of messages contained in olfactory markings, which may be as rich in information as the visual world,the scientists said . ‘Many quadrupeds leave complex . olfactory marks in their environment, and some, like koalas, have . special pectoral glands for scent marking. ‘Humans, . with their limited sense of smell, can't even gauge the complexity of . messages contained in olfactory markings, which may be as rich in . information as the visual world,' he said. An . experiment by the University of Cambridge has proved that members of . the crow family, known as corvids, aren’t just among the cleverest . birds, they are smarter than most mammals and can perform tasks that . three and four-year-old children have difficulty with. Scientists said that, while having very . different brain structures, both crows and primates use a combination of . mental tools, including imagination and the anticipation of possible . future events, to solve similar problems. Other experiments involving the same family of birds found that Caledonian crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food, which the University of Oxford’s Behavioural . Ecology Research Group said is the first demonstration of spontaneous . sequential tool use in a species other than humans. A study also found that rooks can use stones to raise the level of water in a vessel in order to bring a floating worm into reach. Urban-living carrion crows have been witnessed learning to use road traffic for cracking nuts. They wait patiently at crossings while keeping watch on the traffic lights, so that when the traffic stops they can retrieve a nut that they have dropped earlier and has been crushed by cars. Professor Henneberg believes that domestic pets also give us close insight into mental abilities of mammals and birds. A previous experiment by the University of Cambridge has proved that members of the crow family, known as corvids, aren't just among the cleverest birds, they are smarter than most mammals and can perform tasks that three and four-year-old children have difficulty with . ‘They can even communicate to us their . demands and make us do things they want. The animal world is much more . complex than we give it credit for,’ he added. Thanks . to scientific research, it is now known that elephants grieve and . conservationist Damian Aspinall said apes feel joy, love and sadness and . should be given human rights. ‘When . you get to know them, you start to understand that they each have their . own personalities. You realise how much apes and humans share. They . love each other as we do. They feel complex emotions such as loyalty and . jealousy,’ he said. 'Apes . share all the characteristics and emotions that we think of as human. They do experience deep sadness, for example when they are grieving or . lonely, or when they have suffered the death of a parent or their young. It can be heart-breaking to witness.'","Evolutionary biologists believe that  animals can possess cognitive faculties that are superior to human beings .

"The small town of East Hampton has gained a reputation as the playground for New York’s well-heeled elite, a place to spend the idle summer months in their million-dollar homes. But some of its wealthy residents are upset at an influx of less well-heeled workers who they say are lowering the quality of life and diminishing the appearance of the quaint Long Island town. A campaign group is focusing on the Springs area of East Hampton, dubbing itself 'Unoccupy Springs' and calling for an end to multiple families of low-wage workers living under one roof. Well-heeled: Some East Hampton residents are upset over the influx of immigrants to the famously affluent hamlet on eastern Long Island (file photo) Home sweet home: Many wealthy East Hampton residents employ labourers to tend to their hedges and clean their houses . Attending: Many immigrants come to the Hamptons to land a job as hired help . While the group insists that race, . religion, and creed do not factor in, most of the residents are from . ethnic minorities - many of them immigrants - and find employment . servicing the area's luxury properties. Carol Saxe Buda, the creator of group . Unoccupy Springs, told the New York Times that regardless of race, . crowding in homes is bad for business, adding that multiple families’ children all living under one roof caused an imbalance in taxes. Ms Buda said in a recent town hall . meeting that the people using single-family dwellings for multiple . families were not committing ‘victimless crimes.’ The housing code states that up to four unrelated people or one family can occupy a single-family dwelling. Resident . Frank Weinberg, who is also a member of Unoccupy Springs added: . ‘Imagine yourselves living next to a house with 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 cars and . debris strewn about the property – neglected and blighted. ‘And imagine that your taxes are going up every year, significantly, while your property value is going down,’ the East Hampton Star reported. Gated community: This tidy-looking East Hampton house belongs to none other than Martha Stewart . Manor: This house sold for more than $2.6million; some residents worry that multiple families living in single-family homes will drag property values down and raise taxes . Deputy town supervisor Theresa K. Quigley told Times that while Springs does have very high tax rates, the motive behind the Springs HomeOwners Alliance and the Unoccupy Springs movement is more ominous. She told the newspaper: ‘The people who came to the Town Board insist there is nothing radical intended. They say they’re talking about overcrowding, but they’re talking about Latinos.’ Ms Quigley added that it may be easy to blame minority groups like Latinos for the problems in Springs and East Hampton. ‘Doesn’t that sound a little familiar?’ she asked,’ Like blaming the Jews for troubles in Germany.’ 'Imagine yourselves living next to a house with 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 cars and . debris strewn about the property – neglected and blighted. And imagine that your taxes are going up every year, significantly, while your property value is going down.' -Unoccupy Springs supporter Frank Weinberg . According to the New York Times, the Hispanic . population has tripled in the past decade, and the Hamptons’ traditional residents are making waves about their new neighbours. The Times notes that most immigrants . live on the southern part of East Hampton, which is less expensive but . also farther away from the ocean. The area, called Springs, is home to . modest houses –some of which, residents said – are over-crowded with . multiple families and children. Unoccupy . Springs’ website says the movement was founded by concerned citizens . who want to ‘improve our quality of life’ and are ‘concerned about . enforcement of single family zoning code provisions’ and ‘very . burdensome school taxes.’ The website describes Springs as a ‘dumping ground for the town’s low-end multiple housing.’ Home sweet home: This modern estate is home to rapper P. Diddy, real name Sean Combs . I was in the pool: This is the home of Seinfeld co-creator Jerry Seinfeld, whose much beloved NBC sitcom is still in syndication . It's a good thing: P. Diddy, left, and Martha Stewart, right, are two of many famous faces to grace the Hamptons every summer . The Star reported that there are four full-time officers and one part-time official to patrol the town. The 2010 census revealed that 37 per cent of residents in East Hampton were Hispanic. According to Greatschools.org, the cost of living in East Hampton is 390 per cent higher than the national average, with the median home price settling in at a staggering $1.66million. East Hampton serves as the summer pied-a-terre to celebrities like P. Diddy, Jerry Seinfeld, designer Calvin Klein, Martha Stewart, and celebrity chef Ina Garten, among others.","Residents of East Hampton tense over rising immigrant population .

"A young woman has eaten her way through more than 13,000 jacket potatoes - because she has a phobia of almost all foods. Claire Jones, 23, has panic attacks and is physically sick at the thought of eating proper meals. The barmaid has a bizarre disorder which meant she eats practically nothing but potatoes, cheddar cheese and coleslaw - and only a particular brand. Fussy eater: Claire Jones lives on a diet of jacket potatoes because she has a phobia of almost all foods . Picky: The bizarre disorder means she has eaten more than 13,000 jacket potatoes - topped with particular brands of cheddar cheese and coleslaw . Claire will only eat Maris Piper potatoes, mild cheddar cheese and Tesco Finest coleslaw. Very occasionally she will try some bread, sausage or a burger, but even this slight change in her diet makes her feel sick - as does the smell of cooking. Selective eating such as Claire's is a recognised condition and can have negative health implications -  in her case, persistent infections and anaemia. She said: 'I'm fed up of eating jacket potatoes but I don't know how to stop. I keep getting ill. My immune system is really bad. 'I've had a sinus infection for the past six months. I'm constantly tired.' She added: 'Trying new foods has made me physically sick, so I just don't do it now. 'It's so bad, it's taken over my life. I'm scared to go to the supermarket or eat out with friends. 'I went to a work party and when they brought out the buffet, I started shaking. I couldn't get out quick enough. 'A friend at uni tried to get me try . new foods. I put something on my fork and almost got it to my mouth but . then I panicked. I threw the fork down and had a panic attack. 'I've always been fussy but it was only recently I realised it was an actual disorder.' Claire blames her diet on being a picky eater, which started when she was just a baby. She began refusing food aged two. She said: I think it was built in me from birth. 'Mum said I would go for days without eating. Habit: Claire has been a picky eater since she was a baby. Even as a child (right), she refused to eat her birthday cakes . Deviation: Very occasionally she will try some bread, sausage or a burger, but even a slight change in her diet makes her feel sick . 'I broke my leg really badly when I was five and ended up in hospital. I refused to eat anything so Mum had to buy me a jacket potato from the canteen for lunch and then bring one from home for dinner. 'I've never eaten any of my birthday cakes but Mum still buys me one every year. She spent £50 on a giant cupcake for my 21st and I didn't eat a bite.' Claire lives with her mother Debbie, 50, in Wellingborough, Northants and will only eat food prepared by her. She's had to miss out on family meals and it's affecting her social life. Claire said: 'So many things revolve around food - like going out for dinner and going to the cinema. 'I've . gone out before and they've not had what I can eat on the menu so I've . sat there and not eaten anything. I'll just go hungry. 'Luckily, my boyfriend Luke is really understanding.' Friends and family have tried to persuade her to vary her diet. She said: 'Mum gets really worried about me. She says I need to see someone. She says it's not right.' She . said: 'I also hate watching people eat. The worst thing I have to do at . work is a table check, because you have to interrupt people while . they're eating. Unhealthy: Claire suffers from persistent infections and anaemia as a result of her limited diet . Help: Claire, who couldn't even manage a bit of her 21st birthday cake (pictured) has now joined a Selective Eating Disorder support group . 'They didn't say anything about waitressing at the job interview. I just thought it was bar work. I don't think I would've taken the job if I'd known.' Her mother Debbie, who also has a son, Glenn, 27, said: 'I always cooked meals from scratch. Glenn was very good and loved his food but Claire was always very difficult with eating. 'When she was younger and we went camping, I'd have to bring food from home. I'd try to buy food from the supermarket where we were staying but she refused to believe it was the same. 'I always make sure I have jacket potatoes in the cupboard or she'd probably not eat much at all.'I do worry because she's not getting the right vitamins.' Claire has joined a Selective Eating Disorder support group and wants to finds a medical specialist or psychologist to help her beat the condition. She said: ""Going on the group I realised there are other people like me. It's made me feel less alone.'It's not that I want to eat jacket potatoes. It's just the only thing I can eat.'

"The mother of Ariel Castro, who was today formally charged with imprisoning three women for a decade, has tearfully apologized for his actions and said she is 'in a lot of pain'. Lillian Rodriguez spoke to reporters from the window of her car as she left her home, which she shares with her son Pedro, who was also arrested in connection with the kidnappings but who has not been charged. 'I am a mother in a lot of pain,' she said in Spanish. 'I am sorry for what my son has done.' She added that she is sorry for the mothers of the three women - Amanda Berry, 26, Gina DeJesus, 23, and Michelle Knight, 32 - whom her son allegedly raped and beat while holding them captive. Scroll down for video . Apology: Lillian Rodriguez spoke to reporters as she left her home to says she was sorry for her son's actions . Police are believed to have questioned Rodriguez earlier this week, but there is no indication she knew of her son's allegedly heinous crimes. She did, however, know the six-year-old girl, Jocelyn, who was born to Berry while she was held captive. Authorities said it is likely the suspect is the father but are carrying out paternity DNA tests. The young girl was the only victim to ever leave the fortified home on Seymour Avenue and is believed to have called Rodriguez 'grandmother'. In a separate interview, also with The Plain Dealer, Castro's cousin, Maria Castro-Montes, also apologized to the women. 'We are horribly sorry for what the three of you went through,' she said, adding that Castro does not 'define this family and we hope that people don't judge an . entire family on one persons actions.' 'Grandmother': It is believed that Rodriguez met the six-year-old girl who was born in the house . Speaking out: She spoke with reporters outside her home, which she shares with one of her sons . 'We will get through this, our greatest concern is for those three girls,' she said. 'From one family to another, we feel your pain.

With tears in her eyes, she added that she never suspected Ariel's dark secret, calling him a loving cousin, father and son, during a television interview on Thursday. Castro's daughter, Arlene Castro, also became emotional as she asked for the forgiveness of Gina DeJesus, her best friend. Ms Castro had been the last person to see DeJesus, then 14, before she was allegedly snatched by her father in 2004 and imprisoned in his Cleveland home.'I'm absolutely so, so sorry,' she told GMA as tears rolled down her cheeks.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sex is good for keeping fit and having a glowing complexion, says Emily Hartridge, left, in her YouTube video . Helped by one of her three sisters, Jessica, Emily explores the subject of why women enjoy a bit of hanky-panky, starting with the fact that it strengthens a woman's pelvic floor muscles to improve bladder control and moving swiftly onto how it keeps you fit by burning five calories per minute. 'So if you had sex for an hour you'd burn 300 calories!' she shrieks, heading back inside wearing clean jogging gear, thinking her time would be better spent in bed.

"Just an hour’s drive from  London and under the flight path of a major airport, it hardly seems the spot for a pastoral idyll. But if you are looking for the best quality of life away from the rat race, the little-known district of Uttlesford in Essex has just topped a survey of the best rural places to live. Despite its biggest claim to fame being that it is the home of Stansted, the area has just beaten 118 other non-metropolitan regions in Britain on factors such as health, life expectancy, employment, weather, wages and school results. Far from the crowds: The market square of Saffron Walden, a town of 14,000 people . Cottages: Towns such as Thaxted are popular destination for Londoners who want to leave the metropolis but continue to work there . And according to the report by banking giant Halifax, more than eight out of ten people in Uttlesford think ‘what they do in life is worthwhile’. The study, which is published today, also shows that the district’s residents are comparatively wealthy, with average weekly earnings of £819 –  compared to £608 across the rest of the country. And not surprisingly given its proximity to the capital, the employment rate is also far higher than the average for rural districts at 84 per cent, in contrast to just 74 per cent nationally. Colourful: People living in the Essex district are comparably wealthier and live longer than those in other metropolitan areas . Spring: An idyllic cottage surrounded by fields filled with daffodils in the village of Elmdon in the Essex district . But homes in the local authority area – which encompasses the towns of Saffron Walden, Great Dunmow, Thaxted and the village of Elsenham – are far from cheap. As a popular destination for Londoners who want to leave the metropolis but continue to work there, the area’s average house price is seven times higher than the salary of a typical local. However the houses are at least bigger than most, averaging 6.4 rooms – more than anywhere else in the country, and equal to Chiltern and Rutland. It is the first time that Uttlesford has won the top prize in Halifax’s annual research. Claim to fame: The district is just an hour's drive from London and under the flight path of Stansted airport . But it has rarely been out of the top five, and has gradually been promoted up the table. It came fourth in 2010, third in 2011 and second in 2013. Other places in the top ten include South Northamptonshire, Waverley in Surrey, East Hertfordshire, Rushcliffe, South Cambridgeshire and the Vale of White Horse. Overall, the best places to live are dominated by the East of England, the East Midlands and the South East. Of the top 50 local authority districts, 12 were in the East, nine in the East Midlands and 15 in the South East. By comparison, just two were in Scotland and two were in the West Midlands. The report defined rural districts as ones in which the majority of residents live in towns or villages, with a population of fewer than 10,000 people. Rural areas in the South tend to be better for employment, earnings, health and weather, while the North fares better for school exam results, a lower house price to  earnings ratio, traffic flow and  less overcrowding. However for those looking for sunshine, the Isle of Wight is the safest bet, while to avoid being burgled – and for the best chance of being happy – the Orkney Islands are the best place to be in the UK. As well as looking at rural quality of life, Halifax also compiles an annual report on the best areas to live generally, which is normally won by Hart in Hampshire. ■ The top ten rural places to live in Britain are: Uttlesford in Essex, South Northamptonshire, Waverley in Surrey, East Hertfordshire, Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire, South Cambridgeshire, Vale of White Horse in Oxfordshire,  Chiltern in Buckinghamshire,  Mid Sussex, and South Kesteven  in Lincolnshire.","Is an hour's drive from London and has average weekly earnings of £819 .

"A 17-year-old jockey has died after he was thrown from his horse when it clipped another rider during a race at an Indiana racecourse. Juan Saez, from Panama, passed away on Tuesday after he suffered a head trauma at the Indiana Grand Racing & Casino, and his horse, Montezuma Express, was euthanized following the fall. Another horse, Platitude, was also euthanized at the track on the same night but authorities said he was involved in a separate incident, the Indianapolis Star reported. Saez, an apprentice who learned to ride when he was two, was competing in the eighth race when his four-year-old horse apparently clipped the heels of a horse in front of him, track officials believe. Loss: Juan Saez, 17, suffered head trauma after he was thrown from his horse during a race on Tuesday . Saez was thrown from the horse as it fell, and the horse and rider behind them also tumbled. An ambulance service operating at the track rushed to his aid and he had to be revived 'about three or four times', his agent Julio Espinoza told the Daily Racing Form. He was then airlifted to IU Health Methodist Hospital but he succumbed to his injuries. He was pronounced dead at Methodist just before 11 p.m. No other riders were taken to hospital but Montezuma Express was euthanized. The Indiana Horse Racing Commission's Board of Stewards is reviewing the incident. Following the tragedy, Indiana Grand Casino officials canceled the final race of the evening. Rising star: Saez, who was from Panama, had been racing horses with his brother since he was two . Tragic: After the incident on Tuesday night, his horse Montezuma Express (not pictured) was also euthanized . Saez, a promising young jockey from Panama City, had graduated from Laffit Pincay Jr. Jockey Training Academy in Panama, and hoped to follow in the footsteps of his brother, jockey Luis Saez. 'That's why I went to jockey school,' he explained. 'But I also want to be better than my brother.' In an interview last summer, his agent, Julio Espinoza, described the boy's talent. 'As soon as I saw him work a horse the first time, I was really stunned,' he told the Courier-Journal. 'I said, ""Man, I got the real deal here."" Because he acted like he'd been here 10 years. 'My biggest surprise was the patience he's got. He doesn't freak out if a horse breaks bad. If they send him to the lead and (another) horse goes in front of him, he doesn't get excited. He just sits there.' Scene: He was airlifted to hospital following the Indiana Grand Racing & Casino, pictured, but later died . Saez explained in the article that he had been racing his brother on horses since he was two, and that their father often became exasperated when they wore out the animals. Of his move to the U.S., he added: 'It's so exciting. I never thought I'd be riding for the kind of people I'm riding for. It's a dream come true.' Earlier this year, Saez was involved in a similar incident when his horse threw him forward and nearly dumped him over the rail at Ellis Park in Kentucky. He was applauded afterwards for regaining his composure to stay on board, despite the near-fall, the Star reported.","Juan Saez, an apprentice jockey from Panama, was thrown from his horse Montezuma Express on Tuesday night and suffered head trauma .

"Earlier this week, astronauts on board the ISS embarked on the first US spacewalk since April to move a broken pump. And during the three-hour event - which was broadcast live online - astronaut Alexander Gerst took time out to take a stellar selfie. The Expedition 41 flight engineer used a digital camera to take the photo on his helmet visor, in which, the reflection of the sun and parts of the space station are visible. Say cheese!

US-based spacewalks were curtailed in July 2013 after Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano nearly drowned because of a flooded helmet. Nasa solved the problem with the suit's water-cooling system, but then concern arose over spacesuit batteries. New batteries arrived late last month, clearing the way for Tuesday's spacewalk, and another one scheduled for next week. On Tuesday, American astronaut Reid Wiseman and German Mr Gerst worked together to move a broken pump into its proper storage location. The pump had been been outside the station since December.

Here, American astronaut Reid Wiseman is filmed floating in the ISS through a water droplet. His Vine reads: 'Turns out a sphere of floating water makes the ultimate fisheye lens' During the three-hour, 13-minute spacewalk, Mr Gerst and Mr Wiseman worked outside the space station's Quest airlock. They relocated the failed cooling pump to external stowage before installing gear that provides back-up power to external robotics equipment. The 780lb (350kg) pump on the move was about the size of a double-door refrigerator. This is another angle of Alexander Gerst taking a selfie. The camera is in front of him and below you can see the swirling clouds over Earth below . This was the first spacewalk ever for Mr Wiseman and Mr Gerst, and the former’s exuberance was evident as he emerged from the hatch into the vast darkness over the Pacific (pictured). ‘Wow, looks like we've almost got a full moon out here. It's beautiful,’ he said . Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 264 miles (425 kilometres). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000 kilograms) and has liveable space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600 kilometres) per hour. It has now been in space for more than 5,800 days, during which time it has completed more than 88,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for over 13 years. It ended up in temporary storage during urgent spacewalking repairs to the station's ammonia-cooling system last December. Nasa did not want to waste time back then putting the pump in the correct long-term location, given all the spacesuit worries. This was the first spacewalk ever for Mr Wiseman and Mr Gerst, and the former’s exuberance was evident as he emerged from the hatch into the vast darkness over the Pacific. ‘Wow, looks like we've almost got a full moon out here. It's beautiful,’ he said. When the glow of sunrise started to appear several minutes later, he shared his excitement again with Mission Control. A follow-up spacewalk is scheduled for 15 October to further whittle down Nasa’s lengthy to-do list, on hold since the 2013 incident. That spacewalk will be conducted by Mr Wiseman and fellow American Butch Wilmore, a newcomer. A week after that, two of the three Russians on board will perform a spacewalk on their country's side of the orbiting outpost. The Moscow-led spacewalks were unaffected by Nasa's spacesuit troubles. The helmets used by Mr Wiseman and Mr Gerst (pictured) for Tuesday's spacewalk contained absorbent pads and makeshift snorkels in case of water leakage . In July 2013, Nasa was forced to dramatically abandon a spacewalk on the ISS after a dangerous water leak in an astronaut's helmet drenched his eyes, nose and mouth. Italy's first spacewalker, Luca Parmitano, endured the terrifying experience when his drink bag tipped half a liter of floating liquid around his face. Parmitano could not speak or hear his radio due to the water, and he got wedged outside the craft before being helped in by fellow astronauts. A follow-up spacewalk is scheduled for 15 October to further whittle down Nasa’s lengthy to-do list, on hold since the 2013 incident. Here, Alexander Gerst tests his spacesuit on the ISS in preparation for the walk . The pump could not be moved until now owing to spacesuit troubles. In July last year, Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano almost drowned when his helmet filled with water following a coolant fault. And later a battery malfunction left astronauts unable to go out the station. Pictured is a still image from the current spacewalk . Engineers at Nasa's mission control centre in Houston took the two astronauts through the spacewalk. Mr Wiseman and Mr Gerst moved a refrigerator-sized pump (pictured) left outside the station in December . The leak was so bad that Parmitano asked his spacewalking partner, American Christopher Cassidy, to help him back in. 'It's a lot of water,' the Italian said once he was back in the air lock of the station. He later recalled that he thought he was going to drown during the ordeal. The helmets used by Mr Wiseman and Mr Gerst for Tuesday's spacewalk contained absorbent pads and makeshift snorkels in case of water leakage. As for the spacesuit batteries, Nasa sent up replacements on the latest SpaceX cargo ship and Russian Soyuz capsule. Ground testing uncovered a potential fuse problem earlier this year, and Nasa opted to switch out the batteries on board. The Ultrascope (pictured) uses the 41 megapixel camera in the Lumia 1020 smartphone to capture professional-grade images of space . Inventor James Parr has created the first 3D printed automatic robotic observatory. The Ultrascope uses the 41 megapixel camera in the Lumia 1020 smartphone to capture professional-grade images of space for far less money than traditional telescopes. Once 3D printed, laser cut and assembled at home, the Ultrascope stands 1m tall when pointed vertically and 65cm at the base. 'We’re inspired that we live in an era where consumer technology now allows us to do things that were only exclusively available to professionals just a few years ago,' said Mr Parr, who founded the Open Space Agency (OSA) collective. 'Keen amateur astronomers can now download this design and software, 3D print and assemble their own hardware, which is an amazing development. It opens up opportunities for people who have been gazing at the stars their whole lives, but haven’t, until now, been able to get involved. 'Powered by Lumia smartphones, our hope is that hundreds of Ultrascopes will be assembled, enabling a large number of people to contribute to new discoveries as they explore the night sky.' The Ultrascope is currently in Beta testing and 3D plans will be downloadable from the OSA website. Over the next 12-18 months increasingly sophisticated models will be released, enabling enthusiasts to peer ever deeper into the stars. The Microsoft Lumia Design team is currently working on an application which will enable the Lumia to be connected with the telescope.

"Nicolas Colsaerts set a new European Tour longest drive record with a 447-yard behemoth from the 18th tee on day two at the Wales Open - they don't call him the Muscles from Brussels for nothing. Colsaerts practically perfect shot on the 613-yard last at Celtic Manor overtook the previous record of 442 yards by Shiv Kapur at the 2012 Madeira Islands Open. Adding to the Belgian's feat on Thursday at the 2010 Ryder Cup's venue is the fact Colsaerts made the best possible use of his drive. Nicolas Colsaerts hit a new European Tour longest drive record with a 447-yard behemoth at the Wales Open . Colsaerts showed just why he is called the Muscles from Brussels . He took a gap wedge for his second stroke and breezily slotted the putt for his eagle for a five-under 66 for the day and push for the lead of the Wales Open at the halfway point. 'The hole was playing downwind and I managed to get a good bounce,' the modest 31-year-old said. 'I thought it was too far right but it's all downhill and downwind and it must have luged down the fairway. If all the stars align you can hit it a long way.'

"President Barack Obama's choice for the No. 2 job at the Homeland Security Department is under investigation for his role in helping a company run by Hillary Clinton's brother Anthony Rodham. Alejandro Mayorkas, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, is being investigated for his role in helping the company secure an international investor visa for a Chinese executive, according to congressional officials briefed on the investigation. Anthony Rodham is president and CEO of Gulf Coast Funds Management LLC in McLean, Va. Under investigation: Alejandro Mayorkas, who is being probed, (pictured far right) stood with President Obama and Director of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano (center) in March 2013 at the White House . The officials spoke only on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release details of the investigation. Mayorkas was named by Homeland Security's Inspector General's Office as a target in an investigation involving the foreign investor program run by USCIS, according to an email sent to lawmakers late Monday, Associated Press has learned. In that email, the IG's office said,'At this point in our investigation, we do not have any findings of criminal misconduct.' The email did not specify any criminal allegations it might be investigating. White House press secretary Jay Carney referred questions to the inspector general's office, which said that the probe is in its preliminary stage and that it doesn't comment on the specifics of investigations. The program, known as EB-5, allows foreigners to get visas if they invest $500,000 to $1 million in projects or businesses that create jobs for U.S. citizens. The amount of the investment required depends on the type of project. Investors who are approved for the program can become legal permanent residents after two years and can later be eligible to become citizens. Clinton connections: Hillary Clinton's brother Anthony Rodham (pictured right with his bride Nicole Boxer in 1999) is president and CEO of Gulf Coast Funds Management LLC in McLean, Va . If Mayorkas were confirmed as Homeland Security's deputy secretary, he probably would run the department until a permanent replacement was approved to take over for departing Secretary Janet Napolitano. The email to lawmakers said the primary complaint against Mayorkas was that he helped a financing company run by Anthony Rodham, a brother of Hillary Rodham Clinton, to win approval for an investor visa, even after the application was denied and an appeal was rejected. Mayorkas, a former U.S. attorney in California, previously came under criticism for his involvement in the commutation by President Bill Clinton of the prison sentence of the son of a Democratic Party donor. Another of Hillary Clinton's brothers, Hugh Rodham, had been hired by the donor to lobby for the commutation. Mayorkas told lawmakers during his 2009 confirmation hearing that 'it was a mistake' to talk to the White House about the request. Hillary Clinton, who stepped down as secretary of state on Feb. 1, is considered a possible contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. According to the Inspector General's email, the investigation of the investor visa program also includes allegations that other USCIS Office of General Counsel officials obstructed an audit of the visa program by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The email did not name any specific official from the general counsel's office. Family ties: Another of Hillary Clinton's brothers, Hugh Rodham (pictured with Bill Clinton in 1999) had been hired by the donor to lobby for the commutation . The email says investigators did not know whether Mayorkas was aware of the investigation. The FBI's Washington Field Office was told about the investigation in June after it inquired about Mayorkas as part of the White House background investigation for his nomination as deputy DHS secretary. The FBI in Washington has been concerned about the investor visa program and the projects funded by foreign sources since at least March, according to emails obtained by The AP. The bureau wanted details of all of the limited liability companies that had invested in the EB-5 visa program. Of particular concern, the FBI official wrote, was Chinese investment in projects, including the building of an FBI facility. 'Let's just say that we have a significant issue that my higher ups are really concerned about and this may be addressed way above my pay grade,' an official wrote in one email. The FBI official's name was redacted in that email. Appointed by Obama: Alejandro Mayorkas is director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services . Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent the FBI a lengthy letter Tuesday asking for details of its review of the foreign investor visa program and Chinese investment in U.S. infrastructure projects. Chinese investment in infrastructure projects has long been a concern of the U.S. government. In September, the Obama administration blocked a Chinese company from owning four wind farm projects in northern Oregon that were near a Navy base used to fly unmanned drones and electronic-warfare planes on training missions. And in October, the House Intelligence Committee warned that two leading Chinese technology firms, Huawei Technologies Ltd. and ZTE Corp., posed a major security threat to the U.S. Both firms have denied being influenced by the Chinese government. The most routine users of the EB-5 program are Chinese investors. According to an undated, unclassified State Department report about the program obtained by the AP, the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou, China, processed more investor visas in the 2011 fiscal year than any other consulate or embassy. The document says 'applicants are usually coached and prepped for their interviews, making it difficult to take at face value applicants' claims' about where their money comes from and whether they hold membership in the Chinese Communist Party. Party membership would make an applicant ineligible for the investor visa. Gulf Coast Funds Management LLC is one of hundreds of 'Regional Centers' that pool investments from foreign nationals looking to invest in U.S. businesses or industries as part of the foreign investor visa program. There was no immediate response to an email sent to Gulf Coast requesting comment. It is unclear from the IG's email why the investor visa application was denied. Visa requests can be denied for a number of reasons, including a circumstance where an applicant has a criminal background or is considered a threat to national security or public safety.","Alejandro Mayorkas under investigation for helping get an international investor visa for a Chinese exec .

"Two policemen, three brothers, a fireman, a customs officer and an admin clerk. They formed part of the Gibraltar starting XI that lost 7-0 to Poland in their first-ever competitive match on Sunday night. With a population of less than 30,000, UEFA's newest member Gibraltar didn't exactly have a wealth of professional footballers to choose from for their debut in this Euro 2016 qualifier. Preston's Scott Wiseman  and Bnei Yehuda's Liam Walker were the only two making a living in football in the Gibraltar side, and could do little to prevent Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski from scoring four of Poland's seven. But who are the others that  fit playing internationally around their day jobs? Sportsmail finds out. The starting XI: Gibraltar's competitive debut didn't go to plan, but the country has a population of just 30,000 . A mixed bunch: Gibraltar's starting XI boasted two policemen, an admin clerk, a fireman, two pros and others! Jordan Perez (FIREFIGHTER) One day an international footballer, the next working the night shift as a firefighter. When Perez isn't defending his goal for Gibraltar Premier Division outfit Lincoln Red Imps, he's donning a fireman's outfit. The 27-year-old previously admitted he fits his life as a footballer around his shift patterns. Scott Wiseman (PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLER FOR PRESTON) A right-back born in Hull. Wiseman qualifies for Gibraltar through his mother, and is rare in the fact that he makes a living out of football. The 28-year-old has been with Hull, Darlington, Rochdale and Barnsley, but currently plays for Preston in League One. Joseph Chipolina (ADMIN CLERK) Chipolina is a left-back for Lincoln, the reigning champions of the Gibraltar Premier Division for 12 years running. When not acting as an admin clerk, the versatile part-time footballer can be found racing down the left wing. He plays alongside his namesake and distant relative, Roy Chipolina.

CLICK HERE to read what the part-time defender had to say! David Artell (CREWE  ACADEMY DIRECTOR) Artell plays for Bala Town, who finished eighth in the Welsh Premier League last year. The 33-year-old's role at former club Crewe, though, sees him act as the Academy's Operations Manager. And that's not all, Artell is a trained biologist, having previously studied at the University of Chester. Roy Chipolina (CUSTOMS OFFICER) A customs officer for more than a decade, who was born in Enfield, north London. Chipolina captains the national side, and remains with Gibraltar's main club Lincoln. The 31-year-old  centre-back was charged with containing the threat posed by Lewandowski, who proved deadly for Poland. Lee Casciaro (POLICEMAN) Casciaro, Gibraltar's Sports Personality of the Year of 2012, is one of three brothers on the pitch. Lincoln won 12 consecutive league titles in his homeland, all while Casciaro got on with his day job as a policeman. Casciaro has also featured for Gibraltar's futsal team, too.

Rafael Bado (STOREMAN) A storeman who plays in midfield for amateur football club, Lynx FC, in Gibraltar. The 30-year-old is reportedly gifted technically, but fell short of causing Poland a problem or two. Bado is a new feature to the national squad, and is reaping the rewards after Gibraltar won their 14-year battle with UEFA. Ryan Casciaro (POLICEMAN) Another Lincoln footballer in Gibraltar's top amateur league and, like his brother Lee, the 30-year-old spends his days serving as a policeman. This Casciaro is versatile, and can fit into defence or midfield for the national side. Liam Walker (PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLER FOR BNEI YEHUDA) The second professional footballer of the team. Walker, a midfielder for Israeli club Bnei Yehuda, came with a recommendation from former Chelsea player Yossi Benayoun.

Kyle Casciaro (SHIPPING AGENT) Gibraltar's main goal threat and the youngest of the three Casciaro brothers. International newcomers Gibraltar claimed their first win in just their fifth match after this particular Casciaro scored the winner against Malta.

"When Sir Bobby Charlton presents Wayne Rooney with his 'Golden Cap' ahead of his 100th England game on Saturday, all eyes will be on Roy Hodgson's captain. After 99 appearances and 43 goals, the striker will follow the likes of Steven Gerrard and Ashley Cole in receiving the honour.

"You know you are in the most expensive city in the world when a Geneva hotel sandwich and beer costs you £33 but Kevin Cooper is not here for the experience of wealth, more the wealth of experience. As Roy Hodgson leads out England in Switzerland on Monday night, this 39-year-old from Derby will be contemplating a similar career path. Cooper does not have delusions of grandeur as the parallels with Hodgson are already emerging for the self-effacing manager of Servette in Switzerland's Challenge League. Cooper was a journeyman midfielder, eight clubs plus another five on loan, and found himself on a steep learning curve coaching Cardiff City's U21s when the club's former commercial director Julian Jenkins approached him about a new project he was working on with Servette in Geneva. Gaining experience: Former Wolves midfielder Kevin Cooper is now manager of Swiss side Servette . Talking tactics: Cooper, pictured on the Servette training field, moved to Switzerland to build his career . Hodgson sought to learn his trade as a coach abroad prior to returning to England and for Cooper the prospect was too good to turn down. 'At my age, there are not too many opportunities in England to manage a club of this stature and pedigree,' says Cooper. 'As soon as I met the owner Hugh Quennec and spoke to Julian it was clear we had the same philosophy. They accepted that I was young and would make mistakes but there was no extra pressure. It was better than anything I could have imagined back in the UK.' Like many clubs, Servette had lost the connection with their support. A club rich in heritage, formed in 1890 and pioneer of the first attempted Champions League in 1930, they had lost their way and poor financial decisions led to them being declared bankrupt. Quennec, a Canadian-born businessman, was already the owner of Geneva's ice hockey team Geneve-Servette and, sensing an opportunity, bought the football club for one Swiss franc. Cooper was appointed in June and the season began in July. He tried and failed to lure friend Craig Bellamy into following him. 'Craig certainly had something to offer still as a player in my mind but he thought about it and sadly decided it wasn't for him but I brought over Sean Connelly as head of performance and Adam Owen from the Wales set-up as head of sports science and we got to work. Despite where we are, there is no big budget. It's about being sensible and thinking of the long-term. The young players and staff we inherited have been terrific and everyone has been very responsive. 'We have breakfast and lunch together and must be one of the fittest teams in the league. We beat our rivals Lausanne 2-1 last month and we missed a penalty in the 91st minute but got the winner in the 93rd. We kept going.' That spirit is rubbing off on the supporters too. Jenkins has promoted a 'one community, one club' campaign borrowed from his experience with Cardiff and the attendance for the Lausanne game was double that of when the two sides last met. They plan to give away tickets for 10 Swiss francs to keep the fans coming. 'Even in Geneva, not everyone can afford to go to football,' says Jenkins. Keen to embrace the experience, manager Cooper is learning French, lives across the France border near Nyon and wakes up every morning to a view of the imperious Mont Blanc. 'It certainly makes you smile,' he says. 'It's a wonderful environment to play football but I can't lose sight of why I'm here. I'm ambitious and serious about building a career. I want to make this a success. We're spreading the word that the club is on its way back.' Journeyman: Cooper enjoyed spells with Cardiff and Wolves in the Football League among others . Cooper played for sharp-witted characters such as Jim Smith and Arthur Cox while he counts West Brom technical director Terry Burton, Malky Mackay, Dave Jones and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as people he can trust for advice. He has struck up a friendship with Switzerland assistant manager Michel Pont and, if all else fails, can turn to Geneve-Servette ice hockey coach Chris McSorley, a no-nonsense Canadian who was once accused of biting an opponent's nose. As for calling on Roy Hodgson, he's happy to admire from afar for now. 'He's still held in high regard in Switzerland,' says Cooper. 'There is a lot of respect for him. For me he has to be a barometer of where I could go. I'm not saying I'm of that quality yet but he wasn't afraid to go abroad first and I think you have to be brave to get where you want to go. Other English aspiring coaches should take that route.' So will he be cheering on England on Monday? 'I'm taking the opportunity to go back to Cardiff for a few days with the wife and kids. I'll probably watch it in the pub, besides it's a cheaper pint back home.'","Former Wolves and Cardiff man Kevin Cooper managing in Switzerland as Roy Hodgson did .

"A pair of sisters are celebrating after both giving birth to baby girls just hours apart in the same hospital. Inseparable siblings Kirsty and Mica Higham were delighted when they became pregnant at around the same time. And the pair joked that the ‘race was on' - but were stunned when they both went into labour on the same day. Scroll down for video . Kirsty (L) and Mica (R) Higham with their newborn baby girls Delilah and Pixie . They never imagined that their double deliveries would spark the ultimate family celebration with the arrival of their daughters within hours of each other at Salford Royal. Eldest sister Kirsty, 27, from Swinton, gave birth to baby Delilah, weighing in at 7lbs 1oz, at 1.58am last Tuesday. Then new mother Mica, 19, from Pendleton, followed suit with baby Pixie, weighing 5lbs 10oz, at 7.14pm. Kirsty, who was already a mother-of-two, beamed: 'We were both in a slow labour that lasted two days and we joked that the race was on to have our babies. 'We said we might end up in a birthing pool together but didn't imagine that we really would give birth on the same day. 'I ended up four days overdue and Mica was five days early so we met in the middle.' Delilah and Pixie were delivered just hours apart at Salford Royal hospital . And the sisters have definitely beat the odds, as bookmakers Ladbrokes put the odds of two sisters giving birth on the same day at 2,000-1. They both found out that they were expecting girls at a scan early in their pregnancies and both went into labour on Sunday, August 24. Kirsty, who also has two sons Caleb, seven, and five-year-old Nile, was admitted to hospital last Monday and gave birth in the early hours of Tuesday. Mica was admitted later on on Tuesday and gave birth on the same day. The sisters' paths didn't cross in hospital because Kirsty had been discharged by the time Mica gave birth. But mother Gillian Shaw, now a proud grandmother of 10, kept them informed via text message. Kirsty added: 'My mum joked that she wished she had put a bet on us having a baby the same day now. 'We are close and when we found out we were both pregnant we went for all our scans together.We both gave birth naturally using gas and air.' Mica said: 'It helped my sister being pregnant at the same time because we could support each other. 'And it's special that our daughters will grow up together and will the share the same birthday.' Kirsty went to hospital last Monday and Mica the following day after both going into labour on Sunday .","Kirsty, 27, from Swinton, and Mica, 19, from Pendleton, joked 'race was on'

"Of all the players Jose Mourinho wanted to avoid losing at this critical point in the season, Nemanja Matic was perhaps top of his list. Eden Hazard, Cesc Fabregas, Diego Costa or John Terry would all be missed, of course, but Matic dictates how Chelsea plays. His prowling presence, tackling strength and defensive acumen in midfield offers more freedom to the creative players, especially Fabregas in his deeper role. This studs-up tackle from Ashley Barnes infuriated Nemanja Matic and Jose Mourinho backed up his player . Matic's reaction to Barnes's tackle earned the Serbian a red card - he'll now miss the Capital One Cup final . 'Two points dropped at home to relegation threatened Burnley and midfield keystone Nemanja Matic banned for three games and, surprise, surprise, it is all down to the decisions which went against Chelsea' Click HERE to read Matt Barlow's match report from Stamford Bridge . Of 37 games featuring Matic this season Chelsea have lost only one - at Tottenham. Of the three he missed they have lost two - against Newcastle and Bradford. The flashpoint between him and Burnley's Ashley Barnes – the bad tackle missed by officials, the reaction and the red card for violent conduct - may yet prove to be a moment of title race significance to match the meltdown at Aston Villa last March. 'The man is a giant, not for his size but the way he plays,' said Mourinho of Matic, after winning at Liverpool in November. Chelsea were undecided about whether to appeal the red card on Sunday night. They have the right to, in which case it will go before an independent commission to decide if Martin Atkinson made the right call. Referee Martin Atkinson shows Matic a straight red card after his altercation with Barnes in the second half . Matic is sent off by Atkinson after reacting angrily to a horrid tackle on Saturday at Stamford Bridge . It is hard to imagine the commission overturning it as Matic's reaction fell firmly into the category of violent conduct regardless of the provocation and precisely where he put his hands - but they have been known to make some strange decisions and Mourinho might consider it worth a try. Without him, Chelsea have to adjust the balance. Making it worse, John Obi Mikel is out with a knee injury and not close to a return. 'No chance,' said Mourinho was asked if Matic's most obvious replacement might be rushed back for the Capital One Cup final against Spurs at Wembley, on Sunday. Asked who might play, he replied: 'Somebody will.' With Mikel sitting as he does in front of the centre-halves, Chelsea could flank him with Ramires and Cesc Fabregas and switch to a 4-3-3 shape. Matic (left), pictured alongside Harry Kane, will be a big miss when Chelsea face Tottenham on Sunday . John Obi Mikel would have been a potential replacement for Matic, but is sidelined with a knee injury . Without him, Mourinho's options revolve around Nathan Ake, a 20-year-old defensive midfielder who has started only twice this season, and Ramires, who is clearly at his best when galloping freely rather than sitting and reading the game. Neither can boast the height of Matic or Mikel. Ramires was easily beaten in the air at a corner by Ben Mee for Burnley's late equaliser at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. The corner came when Thibaut Courtois pushed a shot wide from Barnes, who was allowed to twist and aim at goal from that edge-of-the-box area usually patrolled by Matic. It is in these pockets of space between the holding midfielders and the centre-halves that Tottenham's best players Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen seek to do their damage. On Mourinho's side, is the fact he has time to plan. Ben Mee rises above Ramires to equalise for Burnley on Saturday, making the score 1-1 . Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois can only watch in vain as Mee's header beats the Belgium international . Chelsea have the entire week free while Spurs are flying to Italy to play Fiorentina on Thursday in the second leg of the Europa League last-32 tie which is poised at 1-1. Mourinho likes to plot as he did when he won with a weakened team at Liverpool in April, although both Matic and Mikel played that day and he had given up on winning the Barclays Premier League. This season, he is determined to win it and these next three games are vital. First, the Capital One Cup final, with Mourinho searching for the first trophy since his return, but lose at Wembley and the worm of doubt will eat away on a day when Manchester City will cut the gap at the top to two points if they win at Liverpool. After that, Chelsea travel across the capital for a London derby with West Ham and a home fixture against gravity-defying Southampton, two games which promise intense and physical midfield contests. Courtois, pictured smashing the bar in frustration after Burnley's equaliser, admits Matic will be missed . Filipe Luis was honest in his assessment of the game, claiming that Chelsea should have won the match . 'Nemanja will be missed,' admitted goalkeeper Courtois. 'He has been very good for us this season. It is a pity but heads-up we must continue. We have other players who can do the job also and they are strong players.' Courtois thought the sending off changed the game on Saturday but, unlike their manager, the Chelsea players did not try to avoid blame for dropping points at home for only the second time this season. 'We should have won the game,' said full-back Filipe Luis. 'I don't believe in luck and don't want to talk about the referee. We cannot allow these things to happen. We cannot lose points at home. 'We played really well. We had a lot of chances. We were solid in defence and everyone was running in attack. But it is not easy. We are top of the league and everyone is trying to steal points from us. Atkinson, the referee for Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Burnley, was criticised by Mourinho for his decisions . Kieran Tripper of Burnley (right) said that it was a massive point for his side against Chelsea on Saturday . 'We have to say Burnley did a good job. They have won points against Manchester City and Manchester United. They are a good team.' Well said Filipe Luis, because this point was in danger of being lost amid Mourinho's storm of numbers and silent accusations about Barnes and referee Martin Atkinson. Burnley did play well, even before the sending off. They have only won four this season but are eking out points and fighting for survival. 'It was a massive point after going down against one of the best teams in the world,' said defender Kieran Trippier.","Nemanja Matic was sent off for reacting to a bad foul by Ashley Barnes .

"At a time when England manager Roy Hodgson badly needs a speedy start to this Euro 2016 campaign, his captain tried to lift the mood by summoning the spirit of a flying Dutchman. Wayne Rooney was discussing the destructive qualities of Raheem Sterling when he likened him to Marc Overmars, and told how he had taken aside England's teen star to study clips of the former Arsenal and Holland striker. 'Before the World Cup I showed him videos of Marc Overmars because he reminded me of him,' said Rooney. 'He has the potential to be as good as Overmars. Bright future: Raheem Sterling was England's best player during Wednesday's 1-0 win against Norway . Similar: Wayne Rooney believes Sterling (left) shares some of the same qualities as Marc Overmars (right) Captain material: Rooney (left) has admitted showing Sterling videos of Overmars before the World Cup . Danger man: Overmars scared opposition defenders with his pace and trickery in attacking areas . 63.6% - England’s win percentage against Switzerland. They have won 14 of their 22 contests, drawing five and losing just three. They are also unbeaten in their last eight games against the Swiss. 1 - Good news for Roy Hodgson — England have lost just one of their last 13 international matches away from home. 192 - Some bad news for Hodgson. In 192 minutes of football, England have only managed three shots on target with their one goal coming from the penalty spot. 3 - Wayne Rooney looks a good bet to score at any time. The England captain has scored in each of his three appearances against Switzerland. 2 - Only two players have survived from England’s last game against the Swiss — Joe Hart and Jack Wilshere both started that match at Wembley in 2011. 17 - England like playing in Basel. They have won four out of five games in the city and scored 17 goals at an average of 3.4 per game. That includes an 8-1 victory in 1963. 9 - Switzerland have not lost at home for nine matches. Their last defeat on home soil came against Romania in May 2012. Andrew Magee . 'Raheem is a fantastic and quite an unusual player. He can play right across the front line, out wide. Although he's a small lad, he's really strong. The potential he's shown is incredible. He'll be a massive player for us over the next 10 to 15 years and, unfortunately, for Liverpool.' Overmars had terrifying speed and a clinical instinct. Sterling arguably has a greater range of weaponry, but is still only 19 and developing. He is, nevertheless, the brightest spark in Hodgson's post-World Cup gloom. At the St Jakob-Park stadium here on Monday night, England will look to him for creativity. Four years ago, Fabio Capello's England arrived at the same stadium in similar circumstances. The World Cup in South Africa had gone badly and this was the first test for his team away from Wembley. Rooney was mired in front-page scandal at the time but he responded with the opening goal in a 3-1 win, which put Capello in control on the road to Euro 2012. Hodgson could do with the same on his return to Switzerland, where he is still feted for taking them to their first World Cup finals in 28 years in 1994. 'Winning this game does not make a great team in 2016,' said Hodgson. 'Neither does losing it make us a poor team in 2016. We are not in an embryonic stage — we are carrying on — but it is an early stage. We have to make sure after these next two years we are very, very strong.' Wednesday's 1-0 home win over Norway was not enough in itself to settle the anxieties that emerged in Brazil. It is nearly two years since England actually beat any of the teams who qualified for the World Cup. Pivotal moment: Wayne Rooney scores from the penalty spot in England's 1-0 win against Norway . Challenges: Roy Hodgson will be without Daniel Sturridge and potentially Jordan Henderson on Monday . Preparation: Hodgson leads his players in training at St Jakob-Park in Basle on Sunday afternoon . As ever, injuries have eaten into the squad. Striker Daniel Sturridge's withdrawal on Friday was more damaging than the loss of midfield rookie Jack Colback or back-up keeper Ben Foster but at least Hodgson has Danny Welbeck ready to step in. If Jordan Henderson is not fit after twisting an ankle in training on Sunday night it will bring another thorny problem — not least because England have brought only 17 outfield players — and challenge Hodgson's theory that the nation is producing a breed of footballer no longer bound by positions. 'Very few are classic number nines, or tens or sevens or fours or sixes,' Hodgson said. 'They're not stereotyped. They're capable of different things. I've seen the Under-20s play twice and when you watch them you do see a way in which English football is changing. I think back to the academy at Blackburn 20 years ago and the type of players coming through now are different. 'It's difficult to look at an England team at any level and find a player who is not pacey, even a centre back. In the past we had stereotypical players who got by on the quality of their play. Not now.' By the same token, he likes to think the style of his team is less predictable. 'The players we have are very different to the ones we had in 2012,' the manager added. 'We were a passing team. Now we're a dribbling team. We're not a long-ball team any more. We try to pass through the midfield and create openings. We're athletic and pacey and technique is getting better.' Hodgson refuted the accompanying theory that a 67-year-old coach might not be best-equipped to coach such modern footballers. Stepping up: Danny Welbeck looks set to start for the Three Lions after an injury to Daniel Sturridge . Settling : Sterling (left) and his team-mates get used to the pitch on which they will face Switzerland . All smiles: Arsenal team-mates Calum Chambers (left) and Jack Wilshere (centre) share a joke in training . England will play on a Monday for only the 10th time in 45 years when they face Switzerland next week. UEFA have spread out the qualification matches for EURO 2016 as part of their new ‘Week of Football’ concept, with games taking place from Thursday to Tuesday. That means 33 per cent of games now take place at weekends as opposed to just 10 per cent in 2012 qualifying. The final set of fixtures in each group — scheduled for October 2015 — will still kick off simultaneously. England have only played nine Monday games since 1966, but prior to that they were a regular occurrence. Between 1880 and 1927, England played Wales alone 33 times on a Monday. The good news for England fans is their record is good... P...55  W...37  D...11  L...7 Win %...67.3 . 'Either you're a good coach or you're not,' he rapped back. 'Either you know how to put your approach across or not. You just try to make sure the best players are in important places, and those around them complement them. That's how it's been since I started. I don't see any difference at all now to that.' And so, to the puzzle of where precisely to deploy Sterling, who was so impressive at the tip of a diamond in the final 20 minutes against Norway, after Rooney had been replaced. Does he keep him there or move him back to the wing, albeit with freedom to float? The team practised with the diamond midfield at times last week while at St George's Park and, in the absence of Sturridge, England can more easily revert to 4-2-3-1 without threatening Rooney's place. 'There are options,' said Hodgson. 'It's up to us to perform and play well. Is it enough to come here and play 10 behind the ball and sneak a 0-0? No, I'd say it isn't.'","Raheem Sterling has the potential to be as good as Marc Overmars according to Wayne Rooney .

"A grieving mother whose 15-year-old daughter died after taking an 'exceptionally pure' dose of Ecstasy has called for the drug to be legalised so users can make an 'informed decision' about what they are taking. Teenager Martha Fernback, from the Summertown area of Oxford, suffered a cardiac arrest in July last year after unknowingly taking a 91 per cent pure dose of MDMA - almost double the average street purity. Now the teenager's mother Anne-Marie . Cockburn is calling for Ecstasy to be legalised so those wanting to . 'dabble' in getting high can be assured the drug is coming from a trustworthy source. Scroll down for video . Anne-Marie Cockburn, 43, pictured right, from Summertown, Oxford, is . calling for Ecstasy to be legalised after her 15-year-old daughter . Martha, pictured left, unknowingly took an 'exceptionally pure' dose of MDMA . The 43-year-old also wants to meet top politicians, including the Home Secretary, to discuss her proposals for 'strict and responsible regulation'. Speaking after the inquest into her daughter's death, Miss Cockburn said: 'We need strict and responsible regulation. 'I'm not a radical person, this has been well considered and thought out. If we had that, Martha would have been able to make an informed decision. 'Martha wanted to get high, she didn't want to die - no parent wants . either, but one of those is preferable to the other.' Martha was studying for her . GCSEs when she collapsed in a park on July 20, hours after taking 0.5mg of the drug. The GCSE student died from a cardiac arrest after taking 0.5mg of the 91 per cent pure drug . She died just hours afterwards at the John Radcliffe Hospital . in Oxford. At the inquest into her death, the coroner warned other teenagers of the risks of taking drugs, explaining there was 'no way of knowing' how pure they were. During that hearing, it emerged . the drug taken was 91 per cent pure, compared to the average street purity of 58 per cent. Miss Cockburn said control of drugs needed to be handed over to 'doctors and pharmacists, not drug dealers', to ensure what happened to her daughter did not happen again. She said: 'What is in place now resulted in what happened to me. Prohibition is outdated and it's not realistic in modern society. 'Strict and responsible regulation is not the soft approach, it's the hard approach. It's taking some control. 'No parent wants their child to take drugs but it would be reassuring to parents to know if they're going to dabble they can get it from a trustworthy source. I think it's highly inadequate what's in place.' Miss Cockburn is also calling for politicians to improve education about drugs and reform UK policy by disclosing their contents. She said: 'I wish Martha was sitting her GCSEs alongside her friends at school right now. ‘I wish the drug education she received had enabled her to make a more fully informed decision, instead of leaving her so vulnerable and in danger.’ Miss Cockburn said she was seeking a meeting with senior politicians, including Home Secretary Theresa May and Home Office minister Norman Baker, to discuss the eventual legalisation and regulation of recreational drugs. She said: 'It has . been 328 days since my precious girl was safely by my side. Miss Cockburn, who wants to meet with the Home Secretary over her plans, . said 'strict and responsible regulation' was needed so those who dabble in drug-taking could be assured the drug was coming from a . trustworthy source . 'I . wish Martha was sitting her GCSEs alongside her friends at school right . now. 'I wish the drug education she received had enabled her to make a . more fully-informed decision, instead of leaving her so vulnerable and . in danger. 'Martha wanted to get high, she didn't want to die. No parent wants either, but one of those is preferable to the other' Anne-Marie Cockburn . 'I . would like to meet with Theresa May, Norman Baker and Yvette Cooper to . start a sensible dialogue for change, from prohibition to strict and . responsible regulation of recreational drugs. 'This . will help to safeguard our children and lead to a safer society for us . all by putting doctors and pharmacists, not dealers, in control of . drugs.' Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter recorded a conclusion of accidental death at the inquest at County Hall in Oxford. He said: . 'It is a terrible loss and I think we can only say that it may at least . serve as a warning to young people who may take, or think of taking, . ecstasy or MDMA. 'What is . clear is that there is no way of knowing what it is made up of or what . the purity level is. So, as I say, this is a very stark warning of what . can happen.' The teenage drug dealer who sold the ecstacy that killed the teenager was spared prison last month. Miss Cockburn said Martha, pictured above, 'wanted to get high, she didn't want to die' when she took the drug . Tributes: Mourners lay floral tributes at the scene in Hinksey Park, Oxford, where Martha died last July . Alex . Williams, 17, sold an 'exceptionally' pure version of the drug to a . friend of Martha Fernback.  Williams pleaded guilty to supplying . ecstasy, but instead of the ten-year jail term he might have received, . he was given a three-month curfew and an   18-month youth rehabilitation . order. At that trial, prosecutor David Povall said Martha had used the drug before. He said: 'Martha was saying the drugs were amazing, ""It feels like a   dream, it's better than the last time that we did it"".' Her friends then noticed that Martha was sweating a lot. She said she was going for a swim in a pond to cool down. Change: Miss Cockburn said doctors and pharmacists should be put in control of drugs, not dealers . 'At . that point, Martha collapsed,'   said Mr Povall. 'Her legs went from . underneath her.'  Shortly after arriving at hospital Martha died after . suffering a cardiac arrest. Miss Cockburn described Martha as a 'bright and funny' kid, telling how she used to walk her . three-legged rabbit on a lead in Summertown, Oxford. She added: ""Six . weeks before she died she was predicted an F in French. I got her a . tutor and after she died I collected her GCSE result and she got an A. She was naturally bright. ""I'm just glad that although she had a short life it was a very full life."" ‘Martha was a really bright kid. She had . an engineer’s brain and could do anything when she set her mind to it. She was an inch taller than me when she died. And I guess that’s the . point. She was nearly there. She was nearly an adult. But she died just a . few months short of her sixteenth birthday.'","GCSE student Martha Fernback, from Oxford, suffered cardiac arrest in July .

"A teenager unable to hug his family for years for fear of the excruciating pain that came with being touched, has made a 'miracle' breakthrough. Sam Ford, 14, would writhe in agony at an embrace with friends or family members, having been diagnosed with regional chronic pain syndrome (RCPS) two years ago. The condition caused Sam to suffer persistent burning pain in his limbs forcing him to leave school and study at home. But today the teenager from Shotley, near Ipswich in Suffolk is today back in the classroom for the first time in two years, thanks to a life-changing three-day course of treatment teaching him to retrain his brain. Teenager Sam Ford can hug his mother Emma, brother Jack and sisters Riona and Niamh, after years of excruciating pain every time he was touched, thanks to a life-changing three-day treatment course teaching him to retrain his brain . Sam has battled the debilitating condition as well as ME, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, and extreme hypermobility syndrome - both diagnosed when he was a child. Countless NHS treatments and physiotherapy proved ineffective against Sam's RCPS. But a specialist team at the Rowan Centre in Leiston, Suffolk, offered the teenager a free three-day programme after his plight came to light in January. Sam's mother Emma Ford, 38, said . since her son underwent the treatment he was 'got his life back', . returning to school and finally able to enjoy hugs with his family. The 38-year-old said: 'It's like I've got my son back again. It is nothing short of a miracle. 'To be rid of the pain he felt every day after just a three-day course is absolutely amazing. 'We walked the dog the other day which is something we have not done for at least 18 months and he asked ""can I go for a run?"" 'I said ""of course you can"" with a big lump in my throat,' said Ms Ford. 'He came back and said ""something has really changed. I don't feel like I have just run a marathon"".' The mother-of-four said Sam has been . for his first bike ride in two years and car journeys are no longer a . traumatic endurance test. His mother Emma, said: ''It's like I've got my son back again. It is nothing short of a miracle' Since his treatment, Sam has stopped taking daily painkillers and medication. Ms Ford said: 'I can now hug him - he can now hold his sisters' hands,' she added. 'I did not want another 14 years of fighting the illnesses. 'Our huge thanks goes to The Rowan Centre. Sam will always have ME but he now has the tools to manage it. 'It is just nice to see Sam confident again. He is growing in to the man he was always meant to be.' Steve Fawdry, a co-founder of The . Rowan Centre, explained the process behind the BodyMind philosophy which . has put Sam on the road to recovery as he now gears up to take it one . stage further. Mr Fawdry said: 'Sam has completed phase one: preparation and is about to embark on phase two: education and training. 'He will learn about the . brain-body connection, the physiology of stress, how the chronic stress . response becomes established and how it impacts on various body systems. 'Stress hormones have a detrimental effect on the regulation of pain messages from the periphery to the brain. 'They can also impact on the patient's natural ability to release endorphins that sooth pain. 'This . creates a chaotic, vicious cycle. To create a healing cycle, Sam will . learn strategies and techniques to use on a moment-by-moment basis.' He . added: 'This will enable his brain and body to switch off the stress . response and allow the proper regulation of pain messages and . endorphins. 'Sam will effectively retrain his brain and body back into healing and recovery that become  established over time.' Sam said he is now looking forward to just living a 'normal life' with his family and friends. He said: 'Everyone at school was really pleased to see me back. I just want to live life and be happy.' Complex regional pain syndrome is a rare and poorly understood . condition, in which a person develops a persistent burning pain in one . of their limbs. The pain usually develops after an injury but the pain experienced is out of all proportion to what you would expect. For example a sufferer may only strain their ankle but it can feel like a serious burn. The . skin of the affected body part can become very sensitive and even the . slightest touch, bump or change in temperature can provoke a feeling of . intense pain. In some cases the pain passes after a few weeks. But others suffer the condition for months, and as in Sam's case, years. There are three treatment options available. - Physical therapy, including physiotherapy to help improve a sufferer's range of movement . - Medication, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like Ibuprofen to relieve pain . - Counselling and support to help people cope better emotionally with the impact of living with chronic pain .

"Reebok Australia has been fined $350,000 and ordered to issue refunds after the company was found to have misled customers about the benefits of their shoes. Promotional material for Reebok's EasyTone shoes claimed that the runners would increase the strength of the wearer's various leg muscles through the footwear's unique design. 'EasyTone uses balance pods in the shoes to create natural instability, much like walking on a sandy beach, which encourages toning through increased muscle activation in three key areas of the leg,' the advertisements, which ran on shoe boxes, on Reebok's website and on information cards, read. Scroll down for video . Miranda Kerr, Reebok Australia's spokesperson, featured in a photo shoot for EasyTone footwear in 2012 . They were accompanied by images of women running and the claim that the runners could tone calves by 11 per cent, hamstrings by 11 per cent and buttocks by 28 per cent. 'The best part is that EasyTone works while you walk the dog, walk down the aisle, country line dance, chase after a bus, do the walk of shame… actually, when doesn't EasyTone work?' Reebok continued to issue these promotions in Australia long after their international firm was fined $25 million by the US Federal Trade Commission in September of 2011 for making false claims about the shoe's benefits. On Thursday, the Federal Court hit Reebok Australia with a $350,000 fine for 'for making false and misleading representations about the benefits of Reebok EasyTone shoes'. Reebok has been fined $350,000 for these 'false and misleading' claims about their EasyTone shoe design . The shoe company was also ordered to refund $35 to anyone who bought EasyTone shoes from September 2011 to February 2013. 'The Court found that Reebok's representations on the shoe boxes and swing tags on shoes, and information cards/booklets and in-store promotional material that if a person walked in a pair of EasyTone shoes, they would increase the strength and muscle tone of their calves, thighs and buttocks more than if they were wearing traditional walking shoes were false and misleading and consequently contravened the Australian Consumer Law (ACL),' the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said in a statement. The company has also been ordered to refund $35 to anyone who bought EasyTone shoes from September 2011 to February 2013 . 'Further, the Court held that Reebok had no reasonable grounds for making the representations.' 'Where businesses claim their products have certain performance characteristics and benefits, they have a responsibility to ensure that those claims are accurate and supported by credible evidence. This is particularly important in cases such as this where it is difficult for consumers to independently verify the claims,' ACCC Deputy Chair Delia Rickard said. A spokesperson for Reebok Australia told Daily Mail Australia, 'We are happy to have resolved the ACCC's inquiry over our historical EasyTone advertising so that we can return our focus to inspiring people everywhere to be their absolute best - physically, mentally and socially.'","The Federal Court ordered Reebok Australia to issue $35 refunds to customers who bought the shoes from September 2011 to February 2013 .

"It was branded by Winston Churchill as 'one of the finest expositions of the British art of muddling through.' But now China has stepped in to rebuild Kenya's historic 'Lunatic Line',120 years after British colonialists sacrificed more than 2,500 lives to lay the original track. The £3.8billion project will run from Nairobi to Mombasa and eventually link to Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan. Under the agreement, signed today, China will finance 90 per cent of the railway while the Kenyan government will foot the rest. 'Equal cooperation': Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta delivers a speech next to Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (second left), Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni (left), Rwandan President Paul Kagame (second right) and South Sudan's President Salva Kiir (right) at a news conference on the Standard Gauge Railway at the statehouse in Nairobi . Dangerous: Construction began in Mombasa in 1895. Work was hampered by storms, strikes, local hostility, disease and lion attacks. Some 2,500 workers, many of them labourers imported from India, as they toiled in the heat to meet their imperial masters' ambitious timetable . Early days: Construction of the original line began in Mombasa 1895 and the railway reached Nairobi in 1899. By December 1901, it had reached the shore of Lake Victoria . Construction work on the standard gauge line is expected to start in October this year, and the 610 km (380-mile) stretch from the coast to Nairobi is due to be finished in early 2018. The deal was signed at State House in Nairobi and witnessed by presidents Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Paul Kagame of Rwanda and Salva Kiir of South Sudan as well as Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang. Huge network: The £3.8billion project will run from Nairobi to Mombasa (in red) and eventually link to Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan . Open Africa: Railway men pose for a photograph on a railway trolley in the middle of a bridge in 1885. The aim then was to create a route linking Mombasa to Uganda, the source of the Nile and to open up Africa's 'interior' Trouble ahead: But huge costs - both financial and in human life - drew strong opposition and the project soon became known as the 'Lunatic Line' Man eaters: Lt Col John Henry Patterson (pictured with one of the two dead Tsavo Man-Eaters) described how he and his workers became drawn into a dangerous game of cat and mouse with two lions, claiming they ate 135 men before he killed them . 'This . project demonstrates that there is equal cooperation and mutual benefit . between China and the East African countries, and the railway is a very . important part of transport infrastructure development,' Li said. The Tsavo Man-Eaters are the most notorious lions in history who terrorised the British-led team of railway-bridge builders at Kenya's  Tsavo river in 1898. Over a nine-month reign of terror, the two maneless male lions would sneak into the labourers' camp in the dead of night and snatch men from their tents, devouring them on site. Terrified workers built snares, thorn fences and bonfires to scare them off but the beasts simply crawled under or leapt over them to reach their prey. The number of victims varies wildly between accounts. Lt. Col. John Henry Patterson, who oversaw the project and ultimately killed the beasts, claimed they had slain 135 men, though that number is generally accepted to be a generous exaggeration. Current estimates remain somewhere between 30 and 70 dead. After several attempts to hunt down and kill the lions, Patterson finally shot one from scaffold on December 9 1898. It measured 3m, from head to tail. He killed the second 20 days later after shooting it nine times, and recorded the story in his 1907 book The Man-Eaters of Tsavo. The tale has since been made into three films, most recently the 1996 movie The Ghost of Darkness, starring Val Kilmer, as Patterson, and Michael Douglas. After 25 years as Patterson's floor rugs, the lions' skins were eventually sold to the Chicago Field Museum in 1924 for $5,000 where they were stuffed and put on display (pictured). Kenyatta . hailed the booming relationship with China, calling it one 'based on . mutual trust' and saying Kenya 'has found an honourable partner in . China'. Construction . of the original line began in Mombasa 1895 and the railway reached . Nairobi in 1899. By December 1901, it had reached the shore of Lake . Victoria. But building the line proved no easy task for the British. The aim then was to create a route linking Mombasa to Uganda, the source of the Nile and to open up Africa's 'interior'. But huge costs - both financial and in human life - drew strong opposition and the project soon became known as the 'Lunatic Line'. Disease and attacks by wild animals killed some 2,500 workers, many of them labourers imported from India, as they toiled in the heat to meet their imperial masters' ambitious timetable. Lt Col John Henry Patterson, who oversaw the construction of a railway bridge over the Tsavo river in Kenya in 1898, described how he and his workers became drawn into a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a local pride of lions. 'Our work was soon interrupted in a rude and startling manner,' he wrote. 'Two most voracious and insatiable man-eating lions appeared upon the scene and for over nine months waged an intermittent warfare against the railway and all those connected with it in the vicinity of Tsavo.' One of the lions' many victims was the unfortunate superintendent Charles Ryall, who was dragged from his carriage and killed by one of the beasts. Lt Col Patterson's story was later dramatised in the 1996 movie The Ghost of Darkness, starring Val Kilmer, as Patterson, and Michael Douglas. For a brief period, the 660-mile track proved a success, despite its massive cost, opening up Africa's 'interior' to tradesmen and colonists and transforming the region. Tellingly, Winston Churchill, who later shot zebra from the train, called it 'one of the finest expositions of the British art of muddling through'. But over the years it was blighted by bandit raids, corruption and neglect. Now trains are infrequent and slow, running at little more than around 15mph. There have also been numerous derailments and delays in recent years, sparking serious safety fears and a resulting passenger exodus. Kenyan economist Aly-Khan Satchu told The Telegraph that China’s new engagement with Africa was 'very similar to the British engagement in the past: railways, roads, bridges, major infrastructure'. With president Kanyatta about to face trial for alleged crimes against humanity, Kenyan relations with the West has become strained. Britain has reduced its dealings with him to 'essential' contact only. China, however, has seen Kenya's alienation from the West as a gaping opportunity and eagerly stepped in. Chinese car manufacturers and television stations all operate in Kenya while an . English edition of China Daily is now printed in the capital, Nairobi. Brief success: For a brief period, the 660-mile track proved a success, despite its massive cost, opening up Africa's 'interior' to tradesmen and colonists and transforming the region. In this picture, US president Theodore Roosevelt inspects a train on the track . Danger: But over the years it was blighted by bandit raids, corruption and neglect. Now trains are infrequent and slow, running at little more than around 15mph . Hopes that the new line will boost Kenya's economy - already running at a healthy 5 per cent growth - and its government claim it will knock some 79 per cent off the cost of running freight across the country.

"As England begin their bid to qualify for Euro 2016 with a tough trip to Switzerland, Sportsmail's Martin Keown assesses where the game could be won and lost by Roy Hodgson's side. Xherdan Shaqiri vs Leighton Baines . Known as the 'Alpine Messi', it's no wonder much of Switzerland's hopes are pinned on Xherdan Shaqiri. Despite being the star of this team, the 22-year-old was criticised at the World Cup and is only used as a super sub at his club Bayern Munich. But he will be a threat. He's got legs like a cyclist and they give him explosive pace. He's technically gifted and he likes cutting in off the flanks. Danger man: Xherdan Shaqiri (right) could prove difficult to handle for England defender Leighton Baines . Leighton Baines will have to be wary dealing with him. If he does cut inside, Baines  has to pass him on to the midfield markers. I'd like to see Baines force Shaqiri to go the other way. For Everton he is one of the best attacking full backs in Europe but we've yet to see that for England. He needs to take his club mentality and apply that positivity in a white shirt. Good going forward: Baines needs to show the attacking intent he does at club level in an England shirt . Johan Djourou vs Danny Welbeck . Djourou played in every game for Switzerland at the World Cup, so clearly his old coach Ottmar Hitzfeld trusted him. He’s a converted midfielder and never really looked like a natural centre half, but he improved dramatically when Arsenal sent him on loan and now he is rebuilding his career in Germany. Playing against England he will certainly have a point to prove, but he can be got at. At the back: Former Arsenal defender Johan Djourou (left) will be aiming to keep out Wayne Rooney and Co . Danny Welbeck’s  move to Arsenal will give him the confidence he needs to become a main striker. He can use his pace to run off the back of Djourou, but he needs to be more ruthless in front of goal. On the run: Danny Welbeck (centre) has the pace to trouble Djourou and the rest of Switzerland's defence . Haris Seferovic vs Gary Cahill . In terms of experience, this is one of the weakest English back fours in living memory, so it’s up to Gary Cahill  to step forward and take charge. Neither Baines nor John Stones are very experienced internationally and we still don’t know Phil Jones’s best position. Leader: Gary Cahill, pictured tussling with Norway's Havard Nielsen, must command England's back four . Cahill has to lead that unit but it could be a tough night against Haris Seferovic. The 22-year-old was largely an impact sub at the World Cup, but he had quite an impact in their opener against Ecuador when he scored an injury-time winner. Instant impact: Haris Seferovic (left) celebrates after scoring a late winner against Ecuador at the World Cup . Talking tactics . Switzerland's former boss Ottmar Hitzfeld retired after the World Cup. With Vladimir Petkovic now in charge, the Swiss could move from their solid 4-2-3-1 formation to a more attacking 4-3-3. That should make them more fluid and give Xherdan Shaqiri greater licence to roam. They claim they are underdogs but I don’t buy that. They had a good World Cup, England did not and the Swiss are at home. This is our toughest game in the group, and the pressure and expectation are on the hosts. Fresh start: Vladimir Petkovic could employ a more attacking formation than Swiss fans have been used to .","England face Switzerland in their first Euro 2016 qualifier on Monday .

"Gibraltar's first-ever senior competitive game ended in a 7-0 thumping by Poland in their opening Euro 2016 Group D qualifying match on Sunday night. Robert Lewandowski scored four, Kamil Grosicki fired in two and Lukas Szukala also got onto the scoresheet in a predictably one-sided match at Estadio Do Algarve. Gibraltar, UEFA's newest member and a country with a population of around 30,000, were accepted by the European governing body in May 2013 following a 14-year battle. Comfortable: Robert Lewandowski scored a four as Poland cruised to victory over Gibraltar . Opener: Kamil Grosicki scored the opener with the help of a significant deflection . Struggle: Gibraltar struggled against Poland's superior players, in particular Lewandowski . Performance: Gibraltar worked hard, and the locals were in fine voice, but the hosts were easily outclassed . Fans: Gibraltar fans pose with their tickets outside the stadium before their Euro 16 qualifier . They face a tough test to progress from Group D with a team predominantly made up of amateurs, which has been made even more difficult following their opening result, as they have been drawn with World Cup winners Germany, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Scotland and Georgia. Poland took the lead in the 10th minute through Grosicki's low strike to set the tone for the rest of the match. Gibraltar's Brian Perez tried his luck in the 21st minute but his shot flew over the bar as the home side struggled to make many chances against their experienced opponents. Bayern Munich striker Lewandowski lined up a free-kick in a dangerous area just to the left of the edge of the 18 yard box but sent it wide. He then fired another attempt into the wall just before the break as Poland held onto their one-goal lead. Group: Poland's comfortable victory puts them top of Group D on goal difference . Defending: The score could have been worse, were it not for the woodwork and a clearance off the line . New: Gibraltar have never competed in a UEFA  match before as they have only recently been recognised . History: Gibraltar have beaten countries like Malta but Poland is the most populated country they've played . Difficult: Allen Bula faces an uphill battle if his side are to qualify for their first ever European Championships . The visitors doubled their advantage early in the second half when Grosicki was given acres of time and space in the box as Gibraltar's defence stood off and the Rennes midfielder picked his spot. Lewandowski added the third in the 50th minute when he headed in from close range after a long diagonal ball over to top from Grosicki to stun the home side. The 26-year-old striker was then denied by keeper Jordan Perez - who works as a fireman - as he stood up and palmed away Lewandowski's effort, but the forward did score his second and Poland's fourth of the match shortly after, when he slid the ball in after a neat one-two with Grosicki on the break. Szukala then rose highest to head the fifth from a free-kick - meaning Poland had scored four within 10 second-half minutes. Lewandowski squandered the chance to claim his hat-trick when he could not keep the ball down after trying to fire in from the right in the 80th minute but made no mistake five minutes later as he raced towards goal and coolly beat Jordan Perez. The prolific forward added his fourth in the first minute of stoppage time to compound Gibraltar's misery in what was a bittersweet arrival in international football. First: The national anthem is God Save the Queen but Gibraltar sung a different song before kick-off . Competition: Gibraltar have previously competed in the Island Games, finishing runners-up in 1995 . International: Gibraltar were on the receiving end of Lewandowski's first international hat-trick . Careers: Gibraltar's national football team includes teachers, fire fighters and civil servants . Qualifiers: Poland have often performed well in qualifiers but disappointed in actual competitions . Group D: The other group members are Germany, Scotland, Georgia and the Republic of Ireland .","Poland beat Gibraltar 7-0 in European Championships qualifier .

"It smashed all book-selling records at the start of this year. But just a few months on, EL James' raunchy 'mummy porn' trilogy is the last thing we want to find in our stockings on Christmas morning. Fifty Shades of Grey is the most unpopular potential Christmas gift this year, with 26 per cent of people saying they would be seriously disappointed if they unwrapped it on 25 December, according to a survey by the British Heart Foundation. Fifty Shades of...meh: The EL James trilogy is reportedly the least popular Christmas gift this year, according to the survey by the British Heart Foundation . More than a quarter of people said the publishing phenomenon would be their most unwanted gift, followed by the Olympics highlights DVD (24 per cent) and a weight loss DVD (20 per cent). The recently fashionable 'onesie' item of clothing made fourth place, with 18 per cent of people saying they would not appreciate it as a gift, while just 7 per cent of those surveyed said the Christmas jumper would be their most unwanted present.

'People often receive perfectly good gifts that are just not to their taste, are the wrong size, or even two of the same gift. 'We encourage people to donate these items to BHF shops so that unwanted Christmas gifts can help in the fight against heart disease.

"Rugby League commentator Eddie Hemmings has faced criticism after picking out Oscar-nominated actor Djimon Hounsou in the crowd as Samuel L. Jackson on live television. Hemmings made the mistake while the camera panned to Russell Crowe sat next to Hounsou as they watched the South Sydney Rabbitohs steamroller St Helens in a 39-0 win in the World Club Challenge final. Hemmings joked on Sky Sports: 'Samuel L. Jackson alongside him, wasn't it? Looked like him. Maybe it was somebody doing an impersonation.' Scroll down for video . Oscar-nominated actor Djimon Hounsou (centre) at the Rabbitohs game with team owner and friend Russell Crowe (right) and Sam Burgess (left) British rugby league commentator Eddie Hemmings has come under fire for joking that Oscar-nominated actor Djimon Hounsou looked like Samuel L. Jackson . The camera panned to show actor Russell Crowe who was watching his team, 2014 NRL Champions the South Sydney Rabbitohs, take on St. Helen's in England with long-time friend Hounsou . The comments drew sharp criticism from viewers, who took to Twitter to accuse Hemmings of 'casual racism' and make fun of him for confusing two black actors. 'Can't believe Eddie Hemmings trotted out the ""black guy looks like Samuel L Jackson"" line. I mean, come on,' @MatthewRiley81. 'Eddie Hemmings utterly embarrassing himself on national TV once again…claiming his comments were tongue in cheek makes it worse #Dinosaur,' @SupernovaPhil88 tweeted. But Hemmings hit back at his online detractors later in the game. Hemmings (pictured) was slammed on Twitter but he hit back at his online detractors, saying: 'Pity some people don't have things better to do on a Sunday night' Hemmings said he 'tongue-in-cheek' suggested Hounsou looked a little bit like Samuel L. Jackson (pictured) 'Off the field we do have of course Russell Crowe with his Hollywood friends,' he said. 'The gentleman there who I tongue-in-cheek suggested looked a little bit like Samuel L. Jackson but I can tell you it's the man who played Juba in Russell Crowe's Oscar-winning movie The Gladiator. 'His names' Djimon Hounsou, he's an actor model from America, a big pal of Russell's, came up here on the helicopter ride with him and apparently social media has lit up with certain comments this evening. 'Pity some people don't have things better to do on a Sunday night but anyway there you are that's the record cleaned up for you and I hope that you're enjoying every second of this match here.' Hounsou played Juba alongside Crowe in the Oscar-winning movie The Gladiator . But Twitter users continued to slam Hemmings, posting images of other famous black actors and musicians including Laurence Fishburne, Kerry Washington, Ice Cube and Chris Rock. Crowe decided to ditch the Oscars in favour of standing side by side with Sam Burgess to watch their team take on St. Helens in England for the World Club Challenge. The 50-year-old was all smiles prior to the game, and his spirits lifted even higher when the 2014 NRL Champions defeated St. Helens 39-0. Rusty wore his colours proud as he sported a green and red hooded letterman jacket to the game - which he traveled to via helicopter. He was seen rubbing shoulders with Sam Burgess, who was cheering his brothers Tom and George on from the sidelines. The actor and director seemed a bit concerned during some moments, but it wasn't long before the Rabbitohs took a dominating lead. The Rabbitohs, of which Rusty is a co-owner, became the sixth NRL winners of the World Club Challenge, which sees the NRL champions take on the European Super League champions, in the last seven years.

They remained in the Russo family until a California collector purchased them several years ago before putting them up for auction. Liston struggles to raise himself from the canvas after what many believe was a 'phantom punch' The Lewiston rematch was also the first bout in which Ali  stepped into the ring as Muhammad Ali after converting to Islam. He was still Cassius Clay a year earlier when he won the championship from Liston in Miami. His gloves from that bout sold last year at Heritage Auctions for £544,300.

"Mauricio Pochettino is in the midst of the most testing few weeks of his managerial career, but the Tottenham head coach is enjoying every second of it. Over a 17-day period, the Argentine faces the unenviable task of ensuring Spurs continue their top-four charge and a two-pronged attack on silverware. Taking on Fiorentina for a place in the last 16 of the Europa League is tough enough, but that two-legged tie comes in a frantic period which includes three Premier League matches and, most importantly, a shot at silverware. Harry Kane celebrates scoring with the last kick of the game as Tottenham fought back against West Ham . Kane's penalty was saved by Adrian but the striker followed up to score the rebound . Tottenham 1-1 Fiorentina - Feb 19 . Tottenham 2-2 West Ham - Feb 22 . Fiorentina vs Tottenham - Feb 26 . Chelsea vs Tottenham - Mar 1 . Tottenham vs Swansea - Mar 4 . QPR vs Tottenham - Mar 7 . On Sunday, Pochettino will lead his players out at Wembley to take on Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final, with victory offering a wonderful way to cap an already impressive first season at the helm. As a former Argentina international with experience playing in the top level in Spain and France, it is a high pressure the Spurs boss is used to and a situation he thrives off. 'Yes, maybe (this is the biggest challenge I have faced as a manager),' Pochettino said. 'Maybe yes. It depends. 'I think that it is a good challenge for us, for me personally, but I feel good. I am prepared to enjoy these moments. 'We have ahead a lot of very tough games and one final. I think it is good for the club, good for our supporters and for our players, too.

Danny Rose strikes to pull one back for Tottenham with 10 minutes remaining in the match in north London . 'But I don't think too much. It is only to enjoy moments and try to prepare them in the best way for their next game. 'Always in football, you need to enjoy. If not, it is difficult to give your best. 'Football is emotion - you need to be in your best condition to play in your best level.' As well as being mentally ready, the importance of being physically prepared cannot be underestimated. Spurs have struggled in the league immediately following Europa League matches even when rotating the squad, underlined by Sunday's 2-2 draw at home to West Ham. That inability to balance domestic and European exertions has proved costly this season and could haunt them again at Wembley, with the showdown against Chelsea coming just three days after taking on Fiorentina in Italy. Roberto Soldado, left, opened the scoring for Tottenham in the first leg against Fiorentina . Jose Basanta stabbed the ball home to give the visitors a vital away goal to take back to Florence . 'I think in the last period we've played a lot of games and I think now we are prepared to compete on Thursday and Sunday,' Pochettino said. 'I think we have improved a lot and changed the competition because it's all in our mind. It's because our physical condition is good, it's excellent. 'But I think in the seven months we've been here we've improved a lot and we're not worried about that. The team is ready to compete on Thursday and Sunday.' Pochettino may have been working for the players for seven months, but it is nine since he accepted a five-year contract at White Hart Lane. Upon his appointment, the Argentinian pledged 'to give the supporters the kind of attacking football and success' they yearn for. Tottenham fans have certainly seen a number of exciting glimpses of that so far, highlighted by the astonishing 5-3 New Year's Day annihilation of Chelsea. Pochettino is under no illusion about the difficulty in replicating that result - never mind scoreline - but it is a challenge Tottenham fans will be hopeful their manager can rise to.","Tottenham are facing a fixture pile-up over the next three weeks .

"Chelsea are to appeal  the red card shown to Nemanja Matic during Saturday's 1-1 draw with Burnley at Stamford Bridge. The Serbia midfielder was sent off for pushing Burnley forward Ashley Barnes after a dangerous foul which manager Jose Mourinho deemed 'criminal' and potentially career ending. Chelsea have until 1pm on Tuesday to submit their evidence to the Football Association and, if successful, Matic would be allowed to play in Sunday's Capital One Cup final against Tottenham. This studs-up tackle from Ashley Barnes infuriated Nemanja Matic and Jose Mourinho backed up his player .

Matic is sent off by Martin Atkinson after reacting angrily to a horrid tackle on Saturday at Stamford Bridge . Referee Atkinson shows Matic a straight red card after his altercation with Barnes in the second half . The appeal will be discussed by a three-person disciplinary commission ahead of the all-London final at Wembley on Sunday. It comes the day after Mourinho requested to appear on Goals on Sunday to discuss what he feels is a series of injustices against the Barclays Premier League leaders. Mourinho attacked the reckless challenge by Barnes that went unpunished by referee Martin Atkinson, and insisted Matic's reaction was understandable because it could have ended his career. 'This can be end of career. Matic is a very lucky guy,' Mourinho said. 'I can’t find the word to describe what that player [Barnes] did. 'I can clearly understand that football is about emotions and sometimes you lose emotions. Clearly Matic had a reason to lose his emotions. 'What could be the consequence of his push for the other player? Nothing. The consequence for Matic could be end of career. If you call Diego Costa's actions against Liverpool a crime, the minimum you have to say is this is a criminal tackle.'

"At the Liberty Stadium on Saturday, Juan Mata emerged from the bench with just 11 minutes to go hoping to turn what was to become an away defeat around for Manchester United. But he wasn't manager Louis van Gaal's trump card, instead the Dutch boss had preferred to bring Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young on earlier in search of a winner and, as things went downhill, an equaliser. Mata arrived at Old Trafford 13 months ago as United's £37.1million capture that was meant to halt the decline under David Moyes - instead his role now resembles the bit-part figure he was under Jose Mourinho in those dark final days at Chelsea. Juan Mata is increasingly finding himself sidelined at Manchester United despite his impressive record . The £37.1million signing from Chelsea had similar problems at his former club with manager Jose Mourinho . Mata finds a place on the bench away at West Brom and he rarely makes it into a fully fit starting XI . It's sometimes easy to forget just how good Mata was in his first two years on English shores before Mourinho's arrival signalled the end of his time at Stamford Bridge. Sitting in the No 10 role, Mata was the creative cog in a Chelsea side that conquered Europe in the Champions League in 2012 (with Mata setting up a goal in the final), won the FA Cup at Wembley (Mata creating Chelsea's opener) and lifted the Europa League trophy in 2013 (Mata's corner led to the winner). Second-season totals of 20 goals and 35 assists in all competitions said it all. His failure to find a place under Mourinho looked to be United's gain. Moyes snapped him up for a then club-record fee and after a slow start put down to a lack of match fitness Mata, scored six in his last six games of the season. But Van Gaal just hasn't taken the same shine to Mata that Moyes, and before him Andre Villas-Boas, Roberto Di Matteo and Rafa Benitez were also fans of the likeable Spain international. Van Gaal's attitude reflects that of his former student Mourinho. Mata celebrated winning the Champions League and, a year later, the Europa League while with Chelsea . But returning boss Jose Mourinho did not take a shine to Mata and he soon found his opportunities limited . Mata arrived at Old Trafford for £37.1m but there have been bigger signings since and he isn't first choice . He praised Mata back in November but had earlier said he was 'not satisfied' with the 26-year-old. 'We have played well but can improve and I was not so satisfied with (Wayne) Rooney as a striker and  Mata as midfielder and that's why I'm changing,' Van Gaal said. With a constantly changing system and a wealth of attacking options, Van Gaal wants his players to offer more than the attacking threat of Mata - hence why Angel di Maria keeps a place ahead of him despite his form going nowhere close to justifying his £59.7m fee. At Swansea, Mata almost ended up in quarterback role, marshalling United's attacks from deep as they tried to penetrate the home side's backline late on. It didn't work. Mata created one chance but United failed to find the net and fell to their fifth league defeat of the season. Mata's touch map against Swansea showed him playing relatively deep. See more in our MatchZone here . Mata had his best season in the Premier League under Roberto Di Matteo and Rafa Benitez (right) in 2012-13 . While still popular with the supporters at Old Trafford, it seems Mata is yet to win Van Gaal's trust . The Spaniard remains popular with the Old Trafford support - his goal output is still below just Robin van Persie and Rooney in the rankings of United players - but there is a sense that he could do more when the going gets tough. His last strike that turned a game for United was back in early November against Crystal Palace. The one thing that is clear is that if Van Gaal can find a way to utilise Mata's talents, he has a top player on his hands - and one that almost single-handedly guided Chelsea to the top four in 2013. Van Gaal would happily take one of those spots himself come May. The bench was a familiar spot for Mata under Mourinho but Van Gaal will hope he can utilise his talents better .","Juan Mata played a quarterback-like role for Manchester United as a sub .

"With Christmas over and the New Year upon us, many of us are feeling the effects of overindulgence and turning our minds to that age-old New Year’s resolution - weight loss. But is there anything that can help shift that festive flab along with - or instead of - diet and exercise? Slimming products such as pills and food supplements can be effective if combined with a balanced, healthy, low calorie diet, says Omar El-Gohary, Superintendent Pharmacist for ChemistDirect. Omar El-Gohary, from ChemistDirect, says slimming products can be effective but that they only work when combined with a balanced, healthy, low calorie diet . He told MailOnline: ‘But there is no magic weight loss quick fix - all treatments require . the will-power to maintain a balanced, healthy, low calorie diet. 'Any weight lost can come back if you don't stick to a . healthy diet and eat in moderation.’ Here, Mr El-Gohary gives his guide to slimming products: . Slim Fast - from £1.27 per item . Slim Fast offers a range of bars, shakes and snacks which can be consumed in place of meals to reduce calorie intake . Slim Fast offers a range of meal replacement bars, shakes and snacks which can be used in conjunction with a balanced meal to offer a reduced calorie diet. The Slim Fast products are low in calories but are nutrient rich ensuring you don't miss out on important vitamins and minerals. The meals contain at least 25 per cent of energy from protein and 30 per cent of a dieting person's RDA of 23 vitamins and minerals. They also contain essential fatty acids. Protein is an important component in weight loss diets helping to fill you up faster, increase muscle mass (with the right exercise) increasing your resting metabolic rate and replacing excessive carbs and fats in your diet. By following the recommended plan which includes one balanced meal in the evening along with two Slim Fasts in the day, this adds up to 1,200 calories a day which is suitable for weight loss in the overweight and moderately active. Anyone more active may need to supplement this diet with additional low-fat snacks. While the Slim Fast products may not be to everyone's taste, they are a convenient and effective weight loss option. The available evidence shows that this kind of meal replacement diet is more effective than traditional diets in assisting weight loss, and keeping the weight off afterwards. Alli - £29.95 . Alli is the only pharmacy-only medicine in this list and consequently it is the best researched product here. Orlistat, . the active ingredient in Alli, works by blocking some of the natural . enzyme which breaks down the fat you eat, preventing it from being . absorbed. It should . only be taken as part of a balanced reduced calorie diet with no more . than 30 per cent of your calories coming from fats. Alli works by blocking the enzymes which break down fat - this prevents fat from being absorbed by the body . Because . undigested fats are passed in stools, if you eat more than the . recommended amount of fat you are more likely to experience side . effects. These include wind, sudden bowel movements and fatty or oily stools. There . is evidence available to demonstrate Alli is effective in weight loss, . and because this is a licensed medicine, its quality, effectiveness and . safety will have been assessed as part of the licensing procedure. Alli . is best suited for those who have a BMI over 28, can adhere strictly to . the recommended diet and who experience minimal side effects when . taking Alli. Because Alli contains gelatine it is not suitable for vegetarians. XLS Fat Binder - £49.99 . The key ingredient in XLS Fat Binder is Litramine, a natural fibre derived from an organic plant source. The manufacturers claim this can bind to fat, preventing absorption and causing it to be excreted from the body. XLS Fat Binder is suitable for vegetarians and causes few side effects but its effectiveness as not been proved in an independent study - the manufacturer says it can help people lose three times as much weight . They say it can help you lose three times as much fat as you would have done with a reduced calorie diet. There is some evidence to show that Litramine binds to fat and can assist in weight loss as part of a daily diet plan, however, this work was sponsored by the manufacturer of XLS and has yet to be verified by independent researchers. BIObind causes no known side effects but it is not suitable for vegetarians or for people who are allergic to shellfish . XLS Fat Binder is generally well tolerated with only mild side effects reported such as occasional loose stools and constipation. BIObind - £9.99 . BIObind consists of three key ingredients - chitosan, nopal cactus and pysyllium husk. Chitosan is a naturally occurring fibre sourced from the shells of shellfish. There is some evidence that chitosan is an effective fat binder, reducing the absorption of fats in your diet. Nopal cactus contains soluble and insoluble dietary fibres which absorb both water and toxins, which the manufacturer claims can contribute to regular bowel movements. The manufacturer also claims that copal helps prevent the absorption of simple carbohydrates. However, there are currently no studies to support this. Psyllium husk is extracted from plantain seed and the manufacturer claims that this can improve digestion and cleanse the system and can promote a feeling of fullness by drawing in water to the digestive tract. There are no reported side effects with this product. However, as the chitosan is extracted from shellfish, it is not suitable for vegetarians or those with a seafood allergy. XLS Carb Blocker - £21.99 . Made by the same manufacture XLS Fat Binder, XLS Carb Blocker contains a patented ingredient called Phaselight which consists of a standardised complex of glycoproteins from a GM free vegetable source. XLS Carb Blocker is said to bind to carbohydrates and reduce their absorption in the body . The manufacturers claim that this product binds to carbohydrates and reduces their absorption. There is no independent research to verify the claims made by the manufacturer, however on the plus side this product is vegetarian friendly and no side effects have been reported. Adios Max Herbal Slimming Tablets - £9.60 . Adios Max is a herbal medicine traditionally used for weight loss. Its main ingredient is Fucus, a seaweed extract. Adios Max contains fucus which is traditionally used in herbal medicine to aid weight loss. However, there is no clinical evidence to suggest it is effective . Fucus is a source of iodine, a key component in thyroid function, which the manufacturer claims can speed up your metabolism, burning calories and causing weight loss – although this is unlikely to be an effective mechanism in weight loss unless you have a thyroid problem resulting from iodine deficiency. Reported side effects are rare and include some cases of diarrhoea. This product is not suitable for anyone with a thyroid problem or anyone on anticoagulant treatments.  It is suitable for vegetarians. One study showed Forza Green Coffee 2:2:1 can help people lose more than 10 per cent of their body weight but the research was funded by the manufacturer . Although there is no clinical evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of Fucus in weight loss, it has been used as a traditional herbal medicine for many years as an aid to slimming as part of a calorie controlled diet. Forza Green Coffee 2:2:1 - £18.40 . Forza contains of a high dose of green coffee and is marketed as a fat burner and a pre-workout energy supplement. In one study participants lost an average of 10.5 per cent of their overall bodyweight taking this product. But it should be noted this study was funded by a manufacturer of Green Coffee. It is believed that a component of green coffee called chlorogenic acid may be the reason for the weight loss, however, scientists are still not sure how exactly this works. Chlorogenic acid doesn’t survive the roasting process so unfortunately you won’t receive this benefit by drinking green coffee. T5 Super Green Coffee also contains caffeine which is known to increase resting metabolism, niacin, iron, and chromium. Niacin is a B vitamin that contributes to energy metabolism and is able to reduce tiredness and fatigue, iron is a chemical element that contributes to healthy oxygen delivery within the body, and chromium is an essential mineral that has been shown to regulate blood sugar levels. Side effects of this product are rare but may include rapid heart rate and elevated blood pressure. Celevac - £4.89 . The main ingredient in Celevac is methylcellulose, which is what is known as a bulking agent. The manufacturer states if taken half an hour before a meal, Celevac can be used to reduce appetite in obese people who are trying to lose weight. Side effects of Celevac include flatulence and bloating . When Celevac tablets come into contact with water they swell in the gut and send messages to the brain giving a feeling of fullness that helps reduce appetite. Currently there isn’t enough evidence to back up the manufacturers claims that this is an effective appetite suppressant. Other side effects include flatulence and abdominal distension.","Pharmacist Omar El-Gohary says some slimming products can be effective if combined with a balanced, healthy, low calorie diet .

"Ed Miliband needs to get real about trying to cut the deficit by hiking tax on the rich, a Blairite former Cabinet minister has claimed. Alan Milburn said bringing back the 50p tax rate would be ‘absolutely incidental to the state of the public finances’. The former health secretary said it was important not to ‘kid ourselves’ about the scale of the deficit and what was needed to balance the budget. Former Cabinet minister Alan Milburn said Labour needed more 'realism' over the state of the public finances . Mr Milburn’s remarks emerge after Labour called a Commons debate on the reintroduction of Gordon Brown’s 50p tax rate on salaries over £150,000. The coalition scrapped the rate in 2012 – bringing the top rate of income tax down to 45 per cent. Chancellor George Osborne claimed the higher rate ‘raised just a third of the £3billion that we were told it would raise’. But the Shadow chancellor Ed Balls announced in January that Labour would restore the 50p rate if the party wins power next year. Mr Balls has insisted the hike would be temporary and used to plug the country’s budget deficit. But Mr Miliburn said Labour’s spending plans were ‘big bunts’ which could not be paid for by simply raising taxes on the wealthy. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has pledged to reintroduce the 50p top rate of tax on those earning more than £150,000 . Mr Milburn - pictured with Mr Balls - was Labour's election co-ordinator in the 2005 general election, won by Tony Blair . Speaking at a Progress event at Labour conference Mr Milburn was asked if it was the job of left-wing parties to redistribute wealth. He said: ‘I gather that we are going to do that through a 50p tax rate which I mean, whether or not I agree with it, will be absolutely incidental, by the way, to the state of the public finances. Incidental, so let’s not kid ourselves. ‘This is big bunts if you're talking about a Scandinavian style early years system which is what people want, if you're talking about the best performing schools in the world, which people want, if you're talking about protecting pensioners, investing in infrastructure, doing all those things, even in the height of the good times not all of that was possible. ‘In the bad times it's certainly not going to be possible. ‘So all I’m saying to you as fellow party members is that we need a note of realism and we need a note of edge as we go into the next General Election.’ Labour's shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie said the 50p tax rate was necessary to balance the books fairly . Treasury minister David Gauke claimed the remarks by one of Labour’s 'big beasts' showed Labour did not have 'a credible economic plan'. He said: 'They bust the economy and left us with the highest deficit since the war - everyone knows they would do it again. Ed Miliband just isn’t up the job.' The Institute of Fiscal Studies has said the ‘raising the top rate of tax would raise little revenue and make, at best, a marginal contribution to reducing the budget deficit an incoming government would face after the next election’. Labour peer Digby Jones has also attacked the policy as ‘lousy economics’. But Labour has insisted the tax crucial to its 'fair plan to balance the books'. Chris Leslie, Labour’s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: “While millions of working people have seen their taxes go up, millionaires have been given a huge tax cut by David Cameron’s government. “The top one per cent of earners have been given a £3 billion a year tax cut – worth an average of £100,000 for those earning over £1 million. “But at the same time families will be on average almost £1,000 a year worse off by next year as a result of tax and benefit changes since 2010. “How can a tax cut for millionaires be the right priority when working people are still not feeling the recovery and the deficit remains high? “Now the Tories want to cut tax credits again for millions of working families while keeping their huge tax cut for top one per cent of earners. As we’ve seen time and time again, the Tories always stand up for a privileged few rather than hard working people. “We know their real economic plan is to cut taxes at the top and hope that wealth will just trickle down. That’s why David Cameron and George Osborne still won’t rule out cutting the top rate of tax again for earnings over £150,000 from 45p to 40p. “Working people who are worse off under David Cameron can’t afford more of this same old failed Tory economics. “As part of our plan to balance the books in the next Parliament in a fairer way Labour will reverse the Tory tax cut for millionaires and introduce a lower 10p starting rate of tax for 24 million working people.”","Ex health secretary said it was important not to 'kid ourselves' over 50p tax .

"Former escort, Jenny Thompson, has revealed she is six months pregnant but she will have to do a DNA test to make sure the identity of the father . Former escort Jenny Thompson, who famously enjoyed a sexual liaison with Wayne Rooney, has revealed she is pregnant. But it is claimed Miss Thompson, 23, who admits sleeping with more than 100 men, said she will have to take a DNA test to confirm the identity of the father. The former vice girl, who claimed she bedded Manchester United star Rooney while his wife Coleen was five months pregnant with their son Kai, is already six months pregnant. She told The Sun newspaper: ‘Quite a few men will be trying to work out if it is them.’ She also admitted it ‘made her laugh’ to think different men would be trying to decide if they were the father. Her baby girl is due on Christmas Day. A Sun newspaper source said the mother-to-be believed the father was one of five possible candidates. Miss Thompson is renowned for her flings with superstar football stars, including Rooney’s Manchester City rival Mario Balotelli. She said Balotelli surpassed Rooney in 'every way' but that he also impressed her with his intelligence and sense of humour. The pair met five times and had sex with her twice behind the back of Balotelli's girlfriend Raffaella Fico. She rated Balotelli as one of her top 10 best lovers but was less complimentary about Rooney, who she claimed in 2010 paid her £1,200 a night for sex. Shortly before Miss Thompson began her fling with Balotelli, 22, she spent the night with television dwarf Josh Bennett after bumping into him in Manchester. Tan-tastic: The 23-year-old, who bedded Manchester United star Wayne Rooney, has admitted sleeping with more than 100 men . Manchester City star Balotelli, left, and rival Manchester United star Rooney, right, both allegedly slept with former escort Jenny Thompson . Josh Bennett with Laura Whitfield, who he starred with in the Channel 4 documentary Seven Dwarfes. Miss Thompson said Bennett should do the maths to work out if the baby could be his . She said sleeping with the 4ft5in actor was a ‘big mistake’ because it was ‘one-night stand’. Mr Bennett, who appeared in Channel 4 reality show Seven Dwarves, said she had been impressed by his appearances in the Harry Potter films and that it was ‘obvious’ she fancied him. Speaking about the father of her unborn child, Miss Thompson added: ‘If they work it out they’ll know. Mario and Josh might be worried – they will have to do the maths.’ She said she did a pregnancy test two months ago after feeling ‘bloated’, but it came back negative. It was only when she went to her GP after she had grown bigger that she was given the shocking news. Miss Thompson, who signed up to an . escort agency at the age of 19 under the name ‘Juicy Jeni’, claimed . Rooney slipped away from his £4.5million mansion in Cheshire to meet her . at Manchester’s five-star Lowry Hotel seven times – including for a . threesome with fellow prostitute Helen Wood, 25. As the alleged sexual liaison happened in 2009, Rooney cannot be the father of Miss Thompson's unborn child. Miss Thompson said that Rooney, left, had paid her £1,200 a night for sex while his wife Coleen, right was five months pregnant with their son Kai . Miss Thompson said Bennett did not compare to Manchester City star Mario Balotelli, who she slept with behind his girlfriend Raffaella Fico's back .","Former escort, 23, 'expecting baby girl on Christmas Day'

"Nicolae Patraucean, 20, strangled Rivka Holden, 55, and slit her throat before dismembering her body with a two-and-a-half inch Stanley knife blade, the Old Bailey was told yesterday . A 'sadistic' construction worker murdered a 55-year-old woman with a Stanley knife before mutilating her body, a court has heard. Nicolae Patraucean, 20, strangled Rivka Holden and slit her throat before dismembering her body with a two-and-a-half inch Stanley knife blade, the Old Bailey was told yesterday. Ms Holden suffered horrific wounds in the attack at her home, in Colindale, north London, including slashes to her hands and face. Prosecutor Timothy Cray described the attack as 'sadistic' and said large amounts of cash found in the flat show that Patraucean was not motivated by money. 'We would say it's particularly serious on the grounds of sadism,' he added. Judge Timothy Pontius adjourned the sentencing until October 24 for more pathologist reports to be carried out on exactly how Ms Holden was killed. 'I cannot pass sentence today, I need to consider in some detail the relevant evidence before considering what the appropriate sentence will be. 'There is quite a lot of evidence, not least from expert pathologists.' Ms Holden, who worked as a prostitute, was found dead on March 16 this year at her home. Police also discovered her red Hyundai, usually parked outside, was missing. Patraucean had been drinking heavily in the 24 hours before the killing and had also taken cannabis, cocaine and heroin, it is said. He claims to have no memory of the brutal murder but previously pleaded guilty to the charge. David Spens QC, defending, insisted Patraucean did not suffer from any mental illness. 'Apart from some self-harm, there is . nothing else that we are aware of and indeed the family members who know . him well do not speak of any mental illness as such', he said. 'The problem appears to be one that involves the excessive intake of drink and drugs.' Sitting at the Old Bailey (pictured), Judge Timothy Pontius adjourned the sentencing until October 24 for more pathologist reports to be carried out on exactly how Ms Holden was killed . Speaking after her death, Julian Mann, of the local Kingsbury Synagogue, said: 'She was very warm and would sometimes drop into us for a chat and something to eat. 'My wife and I enjoyed talking to her. 'She also chatted in Hebrew with my son, who is a Rabbi, and asked which Rabbis she could go to for a blessing for her health. 'She had already had an operation on her foot and her walking was limited.' Patraucean, of Stanmore, north west London, admitted murder. He will be sentenced on 24 October.","Nicolae Patraucean strangled Rivka Holden and slit her throat, court hears .

"You might think the origin of the world’s largest river would be easy to find. But scientists have debated where the mighty Amazon river begins for at least four centuries. The confusion has meant that at least five Peruvian rivers have been crowned as the source at some point since the 1600s. The Mantaro River is a long river running through the central region of Peru and marked in red. Its name means 'great river'. Scientists now believe this is the source of the Amazon river . Now a new study by the University of California, Berkeley, argues for yet another origin, according to a report by Jane Lee in National Geographic. Using GPS tracking data and satellite imagery, researcher James Contos and his team discovered that the Mantaro River is about 10 per cent longer than the Apurímac River. Mantaro River, which translates to ‘great river’, runs from northeast to southeast through the Mantaro Valley in the central region of Peru. The researchers, who results have been published in Area, claim that the Apurimac River (pictured) has wrongly been attributed as its source since 1971 . Throughout the 1700s, the Marañón River in northern Peru was thought to be the Amazon's source.

Ticlla Cocha at the base of Mismi as the headwaters and the Apurímac as . the longest upstream extension of the Amazon River. The latest study suggests that the Mantaro River in Peru is the source. The researchers, whose results have been published in Area, claim that the Apurimac River has wrongly been attributed as its source since 1971. If they're right, the discovery would add 47 to 57 miles (75 to 92km) to the length of the Amazon, which currently measures 4,000 miles (6,437km). But whether scientists accept their results will be based on their definition of a river’s source. The source of the Amazon could be defined as the most distant point in the drainage basin from which surface water ran year round. But it could also be the furthest point from which water could possibly flow to the Atlantic. Some geologists argue that the Mantaro River can’t be the Amazon’s source as it runs dry for five months of the year. Flowing water is the important in determining the true source of a river, said Juan Valdés, the geographer at National Geographic. Scientists have debated where the mighty Amazon River begins for at least four centuries. The confusion has meant that at least five Peruvian rivers have been crowned as the source at some point since the 1600s . Throughout the 1700s, the Marañón River in northern Peru was thought to be the Amazon's source. This is because the Marañón held the largest volume of flowing water compared to other tributaries flowing into the Amazon. The Ucayali River—a lower extension of the Apurímac River—took the crown for a while too s it had the longest tributary into the Amazon. A National Geographic team established Mismi as the river's source in 1971, . Then in 2000, a follow-up National Geographic expedition confirmed Lake Ticlla Cocha at the base of Mismi as the headwaters and the Apurímac as the longest upstream extension of the Amazon River. So while the latest study can provide a new angle, the mystery about the source of the Amazon remains far from decided. In 2000, a follow-up National Geographic expedition confirmed Lake Ticlla Cocha (pictured) at the base of Mismi as the headwaters and the Apurímac as the longest upstream extension of the Amazon River .","Scientists believe source is the Mantaro River, which runs through Peru .
If they're right, it could between 75km to 92km to the length of the Amazon .

"Liverpool have their swagger back and are charging towards claiming a place in next season's Champions League. Their latest victory at Southampton, which has put them within touching distance of the top four, showed them to be resilient, confident and organised – a far cry from when their season looked as if it might combust in November. But how has it all turned around? Here Sportsmail examines the key areas that have been crucial in the Reds' revival. Liverpool's 2-0 win at Southampton, where Raheem SAterling (above) scored the second after a superb early opener from Philippe Coutinho, has seen them gain momentum in the race for a top-four finish . Liverpool are currently sixth in the league table with 45 points, two behind Manchester United in fourth . The Reds were in ninth place on Boxing Day (left)  but have since gone on a superb run to climb the table . ALL ABOUT THE SYSTEM . During the depths of Liverpool's bad run in the autumn, when they were losing games and looking distinctly ordinary, Brendan Rodgers had a number of nights when, unable to sleep, he ended up pacing the floor of his kitchen trying to find a remedy for his team's ills. The bold decision to switch to 3-4-3 from 4-2-3-1 has transformed Liverpool. Though they lost the first game in which it was deployed – 3-0 at Manchester United on December 14 – they are been unbeaten in the subsequent 10 Barclays Premier League fixtures, winning seven and drawing three. It was a brave call. Rodgers was under scrutiny and had it backfired, the criticism would have intensified. But the courage he had in his convictions has reaped dividends. The way the team is set up also allows some who had previously looked uncomfortable, such as Mamadou Sakho and Alberto Moreno, to flourish. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers made a bold call in switching his team's formation to 3-4-3 from 4-2-3-1 . Playing with three centre backs has helped Liverpool to improve their defensive record . A GOLDEN GLOVES CONTENDER . Had you suggested in November Simon Mignolet would head into spring as being in the running for the Premier League's top goalkeeper award, you would have been laughed out of town. Liverpool's defending was miserable and their No 1's confidence was shot. The transformation, however, has been remarkable. Mignolet has emerged from a spell in the wilderness and his shutout at St Mary's was his 10th of the campaign – two behind Fraser Forster, who leads the Golden Gloves race. In front of him, the chemistry between Emre Can, Martin Skrtel and Sakho is also right and that has enabled them to become a tighter unit, with no goals conceded away from home in their last five games. It is a feat that was last achieved in the 1984-85 campaign. Rodgers was asked when Liverpool were shipping so many goals whether he would bring in a defensive coach. His brusque answer was 'No. No. No chance. No chance. No.' The faith he had in his ability and methods is being proven right. Goalkeeper Simon Mignolet has experienced a huge upturn in form after a stuttering start to the season . Mignolet has kept 10 clean sheets in the Premier League this season; only Fraser Forster has kept more . Liverpool have not conceded a goal in their last five successive away games in the Premier League . NEW FACES PLAYING LIKE OLD HANDS . The criticism which came Liverpool's way over their summer transfer policy was ferocious when results plummeted. During this impressive run, though, the emergence of Can, Moreno and Lazar Markovic – combined cost £43million – has been noticeable. Can, especially, looks a footballer of the highest calibre. A number of clubs, including Manchester United, scouted him last season and it was felt Liverpool had made a shrewd acquisition when they secured his signature. He is over his early teething troubles. Then there is Mario Balotelli. Whether he is liked or loathed, this point must be made. Liverpool looked at signing Radamel Falcao last summer and he was the preferred option ahead of Balotelli, a star name to fill Luis Suarez's void. Balotelli has not done a massive amount at Anfield but how crucial might the winner he scored against Tottenham two weeks ago prove to be? Whereas Falcao looks woefully out of sorts and expensive failed gamble, it could turn out that Balotelli has scored the defining goal in the top-four race. Lazar Markovic joined Liverpool last summer from Benfica for a reported £20million fee . THE LITTLE MAGICIAN . To see Philippe Coutinho play earlier in the year tested the patience. A player with wonderful ability, he was not having anywhere near the desired impact, flitting out of games, never imposing himself away from home and looking flimsy. The change since has been remarkable. Coutinho has confessed to doing extra training and in recent weeks he created both goals in a 2-0 win against West Ham, scored a stunning goal at Bolton in the FA Cup and then trumped it with a magnificent effort at Southampton. Rodgers believes he can be Liverpool's Luka Modric. Given the way he is playing, there is no reason to doubt that can't scale those heights. Philippe Coutinho is rapidly maturing into a very accomplished playmaker for Liverpool . ALL IN IT TOGETHER . One thing which particularly incensed Rodgers when results dipped was the accusation that Liverpool's dressing room was fractured. He prides himself on having a tight group without cliques and wants to create a working environment with an atmosphere that allows players to thrive. You can see how close the group is now judging by the way they have been celebrating goals in recent weeks. Whoever has scored, be it Rickie Lambert at Aston Villa or Raheem Sterling at St Mary's, the players have joined in en masse. Lucas Leiva even leapt into the crowd at Villa Park. They are all, clearly, pulling in the same direction and that unity will be crucial if Liverpool are going to see the job through and qualify for the Champions League. Difficult assignments loom in the next six weeks but, at present, Liverpool have the form and confidence to meet them head on. Brendan Rodgers has done well to ensure that the morale in Liverpool's dressing room has not dropped .","Liverpool have improved dramatically since their slow start to the season .

"Jose Mourinho's recent fury at referees reached new heights this weekend in Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Burnley  - and by coincidence the man who helped set it all off will be back in the Chelsea boss' firing line at Wembley on Sunday. Anthony Taylor - the man who booked Cesc Fabregas for diving  in Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Southampton in December - is the referee for the Capital One Cup final that pits Chelsea against Tottenham. The 36-year-old official apologised to Mourinho for his mistake after the Portuguese coach slammed Taylor and said he would be 'ashamed' of the decision.

At Southampton Taylor infuriated Chelsea's players, and particularly Cesc Fabregas, with one decision . Fabregas is brought down by Southampton's Matt Targett inside the area but Taylor saw it as a dive . The Special One also said that a campaign had been started against his Chelsea players after the latest in a string of allegations that they were prone to cheating - comments that led to a £25,000 fine from the FA. 'It is a scandal,' Mourinho said at the time. 'I think it is clearly the result of something that looks like a campaign. 'We lose two points in a match where the penalty is there and Fabregas gets a yellow card. Fabregas reacts with incredulity after being booked for simulation after going down in the area . Chelsea's Spanish midfielder cannot quite believe the decision, and now he faces Taylor at Wembley . 'The reality there are penalties and penalties - this one was a huge one. It was not just a small penalty. It was a penalty like Big Ben. In other countries this is front-page news because it's an absolute scandal.

Mourinho spoke out again on his perceived injustice on Sunday in an interview with Goals on Sunday after Nemanja Matic was sent off for reacting to a bad tackle from Ashley Barnes - potentially risking his place at the showpiece at Wembley Stadium. 'The problem is the incidents I'm speaking about and probably now I'm risking my dugout in the final,' he said.

"Manuel Pellegrini believes Manchester City are now better-equipped to deal with Barcelona after the Catalans knocked them out of the Champions League 12 months ago. The Chilean thinks that his men are fresher than they were when the La Liga giants triumphed 4-1 last year thanks to the fact that this time they are not juggling the FA Cup and Capital One Cup.

We arrived at this stage after playing 19 games in two months, I don’t think it was our best moment. I hope this year we will do it after not playing so many games.'

Pellegrini is confident that City can deal with the loss of Toure, who sits out the last 90 minutes of a three-match ban. 'I prefer to play with Yaya and I think we play better with him,' he said.

"Samir Nasri says Manchester City showed Barcelona too much respect last season and warned that they will not make the same mistake again. The French midfielder, speaking ahead of Tuesday night's Champions League last 16 first leg at the Etihad, admitted that Manuel Pellegrini's side let themselves down a year ago when they crashed out 4-1 to the Catalan giants at the same stage. 'I think we respected them too much,' he said. 'But last year we did not have enough experience to deal with a club like this. They know how to win Champions League.

We are not going to be scared.' Much has been made of an apparent lack of appetite for the competition among City fans. Nasri agreed, and called on his teammates to 'make history'. 'I think so because we had a lot of success in the Premier League in the past year so the fans are really passionate,' he said. 'We need to create our history to have this special relationship with the fans. I think Barcelona can be a big step between us and the fans in the competition.'

Manchester City signed Wilfried Bony (left) for a £30m fee from Swansea during the January transfer window . City are currently second in the Premier League with 55 points, five behind the pace of leaders Chelsea . Nasri added that City were not using revenge for last year's exit as motivation. 'We want to beat Barcelona because we want to go as far as possible, not because of revenge,' he said. 'For us it's a different game. We are better physically than last year. 'Last year we had a couple of players injured. It's just a matter of winning the game.' City will be without the suspended Yaya Toure for the clash although manager Manuel Pellegrini revealed that James Milner, who missed Saturday's 5-0 thumping of Newcastle, is fit. Nasri also defended Luis Suarez, the £75m Barcelona signing who has not repeated his Liverpool scoring exploits at the Nou Camp. 'I think it is different,' he said. 'At Liverpool, he was the main striker. You are not going to score 70 goals. He makes a lot assists and opens up space for (Lionel) Messi and Neymar. He is good, he just doesn’t score as much. 'At Liverpool, the team was built around him. At Barcelona you cannot do that when you have Messi at his prime. When you arrive at a big club you have to deal with things like that.' Nasri also spoke of his admiration for Messi, who he put on another level to all except Real Madrid star Ronaldo. 'I think Messi and Ronaldo play in their own galaxy,' he said. 'They compete with each other. The rest, Suarez and Neymar are the same level as Sergio. Sergio when he is fit can lift the team and score goals.'","Manchester City lost 4-1 to Barcelona in the Champions League last year .

"Britain is donating more than £90million a year to Somalia despite strong warnings that its corrupt government is arming Al Qaeda-backed terrorists. David Cameron has approved the huge handouts to the war-torn East African country in an attempt to stop it becoming the next Afghanistan. But a leaked United Nations report has warned of ‘high level and systematic abuses’ by Somali government officials who have passed weapons and ammunition to Al Shabaab – the Al Qaeda-linked Islamic fanatics behind last year’s Kenyan shopping mall massacre in which 67 people died. Brutal: Hundreds of newly trained al-Shabab fighters perform military exercises in Somalia . British aid to Somalia is already channelled through charities and agencies, rather than central government, in a bid to sidestep rampant corruption among officials.

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of FA Cup fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League... 1. Long balls, searching balls, call them what you want but when Marouane Fellaini plays for Manchester United their defenders look for him as their first option. Of 51 passes played into the giant Belgian during the 2-1 defeat at Swansea, some 29 of them came from either the back four or goalkeeper David de Gea. Antonio Valencia, brought on as a second half substitute for right back Paddy McNair, found Fellaini eight times – more often in 45 minutes than anybody else did in 90. 29 of the 51 passes Marouane Fellaini received were from Manchester United's back four . 2. Rio Ferdinand is doing his best to end his career on a high note after a desperate first half to the season at Queens Park Rangers. Restored to the side when Chris Ramsey took over from Harry Redknapp, the 36-year-old was Rangers’ best defender at Hull, making 11 clearances as he tried to rescue the team from Joey Barton’s ridiculous red card. The former England star wasn’t bad in possession, either – he failed to find a team mate with only four of 23 passes, and on each occasion managed to win the ball back. Rio Ferdinand impressed against Hull, making 11 clearances as his team lost 2-1 . 3. Mark Noble was lucky not to get a second yellow card at Tottenham – but West Ham suffered for his lack of discipline anyway. The midfield man was Hammers’ best player until Sam Allardyce took him off after 68 minutes, having set up five chances, covered most ground, and made more accurate passes (35) than any other West Ham player managed in the whole game. But when Big Sam took off his captain to make sure he didn’t get sent off, Spurs regained a foothold to come back from 2-0 down to take a point. Mark Noble (right) was West Ham's best player during West Ham's 2-2 draw against Tottenham . Noble was lucky not to receive a second yellow card after a foul on Jan Vertonghen . 4. Tim Sherwood shouldn’t beat himself up too much at losing his first match in his new job – it’s nothing new for Aston Villa managers. Since the Premier League started only two of 12 Villa bosses have collected three points from their first League match in charge. One was John Gregory who oversaw a 2-0 win against Liverpool in February 1998 - the other Sherwood’s new assistant Kevin MacDonald who scored a 3-0 win over West Ham at the start of a brief spell as caretaker. Tim Sherwood suffered defeat a 2-1 defeat against Stoke in his first game in charge at Aston Villa . 5. Branislav Ivanovic has emerged as a big character in Chelsea’s dressing room in the last few weeks but the desire to be a leader seems to be affecting his discipline. The Serbian full back appeared to have learned some lessons after getting just one booking from the 17 appearances that followed his sending off at Manchester United in October. But in the last six games, in which he’s scored four times, he’s also been shown four yellow cards. Branislav Ivanovic celebrates scoring his fourth goal in six games for Chelsea . 6. Shola Ameobi could be a valuable addition to Crystal Palace’s squad as Alan Pardew aims to make sure they don’t drop back into the relegation fight. The 33-year-old’s return to the Premier League on a free transfer after a spell in Turkey was a deal that went under the radar in the last few days of the January window. But the Nigerian had an impact on his debut – running more than a mile in his 10 minute cameo appearance to unsettle Arsenal’s defence and help fellow sub Glenn Murray find the room to score Palace’s late goal and almost grab an equaliser. Crystal Palace debutant Shola Ameobi ran more than a mile during his 10 minute cameo . 7. Robert Huth will add some power in both boxes for Leicester on the evidence of his debut at Everton, where as well as making 11 clearances he was a constant threat at set pieces. The 6ft 3ins German, on a loan from Stoke until the end of the season, hadn’t started a Premier League game since he got injured in November 2013. 8. Midfielder George Thorne’s return to fitness from a cruciate knee ligament injury is perfectly timed to help Derby’s run-in to try and win promotion. The 22-year-old made a permanent move to the iPro Stadium during the summer after outstanding performances while on loan from West Brom, only to collect his injury before the campaign began. He showed encouraging signs of last season’s form in the 61 minutes he played during the 3-2 win over Sheffield Wednesday. Robert Huth helped Leicester to a 2-2 draw against Everton on his Foxes debut . 9. Bradford’s mudheap of a pitch at Valley Parade might be their ally in the FA Cup but it’s doing Phil Parkinson’s side no favours against League One opposition. Sunderland boss Gus Poyet left there moaning about the playing surface after getting knocked out, and Reading won’t be looking forward to it ahead of Saturday’s quarter-final. Perhaps boss Steve Clarke could ring Walsall’s Dean Smith for some advice. The 1-1 draw with the Saddlers meant Bradford have won only once in the League at home since the turn of the year. 10. Mario Balotelli and Daniel Sturridge could take a lesson in team spirit from Oxford winger Alex MacDonald. The two Liverpool superstars squabbled last week over who should take a Europa Cup penalty – meanwhile down in League Two 24-year-old MacDonald gave up the chance of a hat-trick to help a team-mate. The new signing from Burton had scored twice before Oxford were awarded a spot kick. He was due to take it, but instead handed the ball to striker Danny Hylton to rebuild some confidence by tucking away only his second goal since December. Daniel Sturridge (left) and Mario Balotelli argue over who will take a penalty against Besiktas last week .","29 of the 51 passes Marouane Fellaini received were from Manchester United's back four during 2-1 defeat against Swansea .

"After a blistering start to his career at Old Trafford, Angel di Maria is looking less and less like a £60million player. The British record transfer fee spent by Manchester United  immediately put the Argentine under pressure to perform following his move from Real Madrid - something he appeared to relish at the start of the season. But now he looks lost and is struggling to find the form he showed during his last season in Spain. United need more from their most expensive player ever. Angel di Maria (right), pictured in action against Swansea, has struggled to find his best form this year . Di Maria isn't the only star to have failed to immediately justify a huge price-tag, although others have taken on the responsibility with aplomb. With that in mind, Sportsmail takes a look at how players signed for £50m and more fared after sealing their big-money moves. Gareth Bale - Tottenham to Real Madrid £86m . The most expensive footballer of all time, Bale has endured a mixed spell in Spain since swapping London for Madrid in the summer of 2013. The Welshman slotted into Carlo Ancelotti's star-studded team with ease in his first season, scoring in the Champions League and Copa del Rey finals to win over Real fans. But this season, despite netting 12 goals in La Liga and Europe, the former Southampton youngster has been subjected to boos from some sections of the Bernabeu faithful. VERDICT: HIT . Gareth Bale, pictured in action against Elche, has endured a mixed response since joining Real Madrid . Cristiano Ronaldo - Manchester United to Real Madrid £80m . Undoubtedly the biggest success story on our list, Ronaldo can almost be regarded as a bargain given his goal-scoring prowess since leaving Old Trafford in 2009. The Portuguese star netted his 290th goal in his 281st appearance against Elche on Saturday, taking him to 29 league goals for the season. With one La Liga title, a Champions League crown and the Club World Cup among the trophies to his name already, he could well help Los Blancos win more come May. VERDICT: HIT . Cristiano Ronaldo has been a huge success since leaving Manchester United for Real Madrid in 2009 . Luis Suarez - Liverpool to Barcelona £75m . The main man at Liverpool before his summer move to Barcelona, Suarez has found goals harder to come by alongside superstars Lionel Messi and Neymar. Often forced to play wide rather than through the middle, the Uruguayan has found the back of the net just four times in 15 La Liga outings since returning from a four-month ban for biting. The 27-year-old has eight assists in the top flight and another couple of goals in the Champions League but is yet to recapture the form which almost helped Brendan Rodgers' men to the Premier League title last term. VERDICT: JURY STILL OUT . Luis Suarez, pictured being denied by Malaga keeper Carlos Kameni, has only scored four La Liga goals . James Rodriguez - Monaco to Real Madrid £63m . Signed on the back of a brilliant World Cup campaign with Colombia, Rodriguez has adjusted to life at Real Madrid with relative ease. Comfortable out wide or behind striker Karim Benzema, the former Porto man has scored eight league goals in his debut season  to help Ancelotti's men to the top of the table. Currently out injured for two months with a broken foot, Rodriguez will hope to continue to justify his sizeable fee when he returns for the title run-in. VERDICT: HIT . Real Madrid's James Rodriguez was signed for £63m after a brilliant World Cup with Colombia . Angel di Maria - Real Madrid to Manchester United £60m . Between August 30 and December 31 Di Maria scored three goals, recorded six assists and created 31 chances in 12 appearances. In his six games since New Year's Day, he is yet to score, has two assists and has laid on just 11 chances. The Argentine's dip in form is worrying given the way he took to the Premier League at the start of the season, although it should be noted that United, as a team, are yet to hit top gear. There is more to come from the ex-Benfica midfielder, but he cannot allow this slump to continue. VERDICT: JURY STILL OUT . Di Maria (right) looks dejected during Manchester United's 2-1 defeat at Swansea on Saturday afternoon . Zlatan Ibrahimovic - Inter Milan to Barcelona £59m . When Barcelona paid Inter Milan £40m plus Samuel Eto'o, it was a gamble. Unfortunately for Pep Guardiola, it didn't pay off. The Sweden international scored goals in the 2009-10 season after moving to Spain but problems with his manager and the culture of the club meant that he moved to AC Milan on loan just a year after joining. A permanent transfer for around half what they paid for him followed in 2011. VERDICT: MISS . Zlatan Ibrahimovic joined Barcelona for the equivalent of £59m but left on loan after just one season . Kaka - AC Milan to Real Madrid £56m . One of the best players in the world when Real Madrid brought him to Spain, Kaka never really managed to exhibit the talent which won him the Ballon d'Or in 2007. Injury troubles and poor form restricted him to just 120 appearances over four seasons, a return which did little to justify his then world-record fee. A free transfer back to AC Milan followed in 2013, before a move to soon-to-be MLS side Orlando City. Still only 32, the Brazilian magician never quite fulfilled his enormous potential. VERDICT: MISS . Brazilian midfielder Kaka (right) failed to justify his £56m fee during an injury-hit four years with Real Madrid . Edinson Cavani - Napoli to Paris Saint-Germain £55m . A major investment by Qatari-owned Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2013, Cavani has continued to establish himself as one of the most dangerous strikers in world football since leaving Italy for France. The Uruguayan bagged 16 goals in Ligue 1 during his debut campaign but only has eight so far this term, having often been shunted into a wide role to accommodate Ibrahimovic. The scorer of PSG's goal against Chelsea in the Champions League last week, Cavani continues to attract interest from clubs in England. A similarly massive fee would be needed to take him away from Paris. VERDICT: JURY STILL OUT . Edinson Cavani has been played out of position at Paris Saint-Germain despite costing the club £55m . Radamel Falcao - Atletico Madrid to Monaco £51m . Currently struggling for form  on loan at Manchester United, Falcao hit a more than respectable nine goals in his first 17 games for Monaco before suffering a season-ending injury. He began this season well, scoring twice in three games, but was then shipped out to Old Trafford as the Monaco continued to cut costs after spending big in recent years. The former Atletico Madrid striker looks certain to leave his parent club permanently this summer, although they hope to recoup much of the £51m they paid for him. VERDICT: MISS . Radamel Falcao managed just half a season with Monaco before suffering a serious knee injury in early 2014 . Fernando Torres - Liverpool to Chelsea £50m . Perhaps the least successful big-money signing on our list, Torres' four-and-a-half years at Stamford Bridge were a huge disappointment after his goal-filled spell at Liverpool. The Spaniard scored 45 times in 172 appearances for the Blues but was a shadow of the player who dominated opposition defences under Rafa Benitez at Anfield. A  transfer to AC Milan  followed in January, before a long-term loan to former club Atletico Madrid gave him a much-needed fresh start. VERDICT: MISS . Fernando Torres, pictured reacting to a missed chance, left Chelsea after a disappointing spell in London . David Luiz - Chelsea to Paris Saint-Germain £50m . Not many people could believe it when PSG agreed to pay Chelsea £50m for David Luiz, a defender with an unfortunate habit of making decisive mistakes. The colourful Brazilian made the switch to Paris last summer and has been in solid form for Laurent Blanc's side since, winning 79 per cent of his headers and completing 90 per cent of his passes. Despite some good performances in Ligue 1, Luiz still managed to allow Branislav Ivanovic to score the opening goal when Chelsea visited Parc des Princes in the Champions League last week. VERDICT: JURY STILL OUT . David Luiz (right), pictured in action against his former club Chelsea, was a surprise £50m buy by PSG .","Angel di Maria is in poor form after a promising start at Manchester United .

"On nights as dramatic as this, the temptation is to start with the match-winner and go from there. This is no exception. At the final whistle Chelsea’s manager Jose Mourinho marched across the turf to seek out Petr Cech and throw his arms tightly around the Chelsea goalkeeper in a bear hug. Mourinho knows. And so do we. Without Cech between the posts against Everton, who knows whether Willian would have gone on to score Chelsea’s corkscrew winner in the 89th minute.

Jose Mourinho marched onto the pitch after the final whistle to congratulate his players on a precious three points . More on Cech in a minute because his performance against Roberto Martinez’s team is worthy of much more than a few token sentences in his honour. Everton lost this fixture because for one moment, one crazy moment, they failed to re-organise when Gareth Barry was sent off. In the pushing, the shoving and the shouting match that followed, Branislav Ivanovic almost throttled substitute James McCarthy, and then pushed his forehead into the side of the Everton player’s head. But that was not the most damaging allegation laid at Ivanovic’s door. The question being asked on social media about the Serbian was: did he actually bite McCarthy? It is an amazing charge considering it was Ivanovic who was bitten by Liverpool striker Luis Suarez two years ago. But because this is Chelsea, because this is Mourinho, the repercussions and the recriminations for Ivanovic’s actions are likely to last for days.

Steven Naismith was fortunate to escape without punishment after appearing to handle the ball in the area in the first half . Romelu Lukaku had an excellent chance to break the deadlock, but saw his effort saved by Petr Cech . That is sad, because we should be celebrating a masterful performance by Cech. Chelsea won this game, their 18th in the league this season, because Cech saved brilliantly twice, once in each half, from the feet of Romelu Lukaku. For the first, he threw out a left leg to deflect Lukaku’s effort wide of his post when Ross Barkley had split the Chelsea defence. He had to be on his game again in the second half when Lukaku, unmarked six yards out, should have put Everton in front. Cech’s save was breathtaking. Thibaut Courtois will be sweating ahead of Tuesday’s Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain. It is no longer clear cut who is No 1. ‘He touched the ball twice, he was a spectator,’ said Mourinho. ‘This is what we need — competition with Petr and Courtois. The focus must be permanent and also a keeper can be tired — it can affect your nervous system. Petr worked hard and I believed he was the best option because John Terry was ill in the morning. I wanted leadership.’ This was a functional Chelsea performance, an average game against average opposition. Willian’s finish was stunning, reading Tim Howard’s punched clearance and twisting his body to send his angled drive beyond the Everton keeper’s near post.

Willian drops the shoulder and attempts to outfox Muhamed Besic in the centre of midfield as the battle for possession heats up . It did not help Martinez’s mood that the man who headed the Cesc Fabregas free kick into the penalty area was that man Ivanovic. Was he was lucky to be on the pitch? ‘Don’t make me laugh,’ claimed Mourinho when he was quizzed about the incident with McCarthy. The FA will decide upon the next course of action. The referee had 101 things to think about as players from both sides puffed out their chests. From the free-kick Chelsea scored a goal that keeps Manchester City at arm’s length in the title race. To Willian’s credit, it was a stunning finish. ‘When I have won titles in the past, there are always a couple of games when you win in the last minute,’ admitted Mourinho. They could easily have been ahead in the first half, particularly when Steven Naismith’s bizarre ball- juggling act in the Everton penalty area went unpunished. This was a frustrating evening for Chelsea, one of those games they will be glad to have got out of the way. Eden Hazard was their chief threat and poor Muhamed Besic had to be replaced by McCarthy at half-time having been booked for a foul on the Belgian. McCarthy then did a decent job of spoiling in midfield, but eventually Willian rescued Chelsea with his powerful strike from the edge of the area. Undoubtedly, it was the save of the season so far.

Jose Mourinho probably wouldn’t call it a dropping, but that’s what it seemed like. Courtois took his place on the bench, suggesting there was no injury to the Belgian. With the Champions League clash against PSG on the horizon, on Tuesday to be exact, it’ll be interesting to see who the Special One plumps for. Mourinho has enough time to think about his decision with Chelsea without a game this weekend following their shock FA Cup exit to Bradford. Ray Wilkins was at the Bridge to watch the club he served as a player and coach. He was sat just behind the dug-outs. Perhaps it rekindled memories of his bygone days in the Blues technical area under Luiz Felipe Scolari, Guus Hiddink and Carlo Ancelotti. If Jose Mourinho told his charges to keep a particular eye on Everton midfielder Steven Naysmith, here’s why. Ahead of the encounter, the Scotland international had scored in three of his last four Premier League appearances against the Blues. It would had been Naysmith’s handball in the first-half that caught Mourinho’s eye, though.","Chelsea left it late to break down Everton and maintained their seven-point lead at the top of the table .

"Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho seems convinced that the Football Association and Premier League officials are wagering some sort of war against his team. In his most recent television appearance, Mourinho appeared on Sky Sports' Goals on Sunday to discuss the various incidents that he believes have gone unfairly against the Stamford Bridge club this season. Although the Blues boss makes a compelling argument in some cases, there have been several occasions which have seen Chelsea lucky to escape without punishment. Here, Sportsmail looks at five moments when Mourinho's Chelsea side got away with it. Jose Mourinho appeared on Sky Sports' Goals on Sunday after Chelsea's controversial 1-1 draw with Burnley . Mourinho was upset with this studs-up tackle from Ashley Barnes which went unpunished on Saturday . Branislav Ivanovic vs Everton . Chelsea's star full-back has been one of Mourinho's most reliable soldiers this season, fighting for the cause and often popping up with crucial goals for his team. The Serbian defender took his fighting spirit slightly too far during Chelsea's 1-0 win against Everton earlier this month as he became the main aggressor when both sets of players came together in an angry confrontation. Gareth Barry was shown a red card for a late challenge on Willian, but Ivanovic, who grabbed James McCarthy around the neck before aiming a slight headbutt towards his opponent escaped without a card. Ivanovic then played a crucial part in Chelsea's winning goal, heading the ball towards goal before a Tim Howard clearance was met with a fierce finish from Willian. The FA also decided against handing the 31-year-old any retrospective punishment. Branislav Ivanovic (centre) puts his left arm around the neck of James McCarthy .

Gary Cahill was lucky to stay on the pitch during Chelsea's shock 5-3 defeat to Tottenham on New Year's Day, after  kicking out at Harry Kane. With the score at 4-2 the England defender was tussling for the ball with Spurs' two-goal hero when the striker fell to the floor. Cahill, who had earlier conceded a penalty for fouling Kane, took a swing at the forward, clattering him in the back. With the ball a good yard away it is difficult to see how Cahill could claim to have been attempting to play it, particularly with Kane's whole body between the defender and the ball. Cahill then appeared to stamp on the prone forward's leg, although that was at least closer to the ball, and could have been an attempt to retrieve it. However, referee Phil Dowd seems not to have seen the incident, failing to punish the centre half for the violent play. Gary Cahill appears to kick Tottenham striker Harry Kane during Tottenham's 5-3 victory in January . Kane reacts in obvious pain, but neither the referee or his assistant seemed to notice the offence . Gary Cahill vs Hull . The England vice-captain made headlines for all the wrong reasons after taking an embarrassing dive during Chelsea's 2-0 victory against Hull in December. The dive, which Hull boss Steve Bruce claimed would be more fitting in 'Swan Lake', came in the 53rd-minute as he passed between David Meyler and Tom Huddlestone in the Hull area. Referee Chris Foy did not give a penalty but he enraged Hull manager Bruce by opting against showing Cahill a second yellow. Cahill goes down theatrically in the box for Chelsea during a 2-0 win against Hull City in December . The Chelsea defender was also on a yellow card and risked getting sent off . Chris Foy (second right) points for a goal kick and wrongly failed to produce a second yellow for Cahill . Gary Cahill vs Liverpool . Mourinho's side were lucky not to concede a late penalty at Anfield in November after Cahill seemed to block a Steven Gerrard strike with his forearm. The English defender had also been in the spotlight for a block in controversial block in the first half after he put his should towards Raheem Sterling's effort. The Blues ended up holding onto their 2-1 lead to earn a valuable three points after goals from Cahill and Diego Costa. Even Chelsea skipper John Terry conceded that Liverpool should have been awarded a penalty, saying: 'We have had some not go our way, it evens itself out'. Cahill was at the centre of two handball appeals - the first coming after a Raheem Sterling strike . Steven Gerrard appeals for a penalty after Cahill's second controversial block during Chelsea's 2-1 victory . The Chelsea players celebrate earning a vital three points at Anfield in November, 2014 . Diego Costa vs Manchester City . With the 2014-15 Premier League season only five weeks old, Costa showed England a glimmer of his fiery side after a tangle with City defender Pablo Zabaleta. The Argentine defender was rightly shown a second yellow card for a late challenge on Costa, who reacted by placing his hands around Zabaleta's neck for a split second. Zabaleta's sending off came moments before Andre Schurrle gave Chelsea the lead, with Costa involved in the move leading to the goal. However, Frank Lampard came off the bench to rescue a point for the 10-man champions against his former club. Pablo Zabaleta (right) was shown a second yellow card for this challenge on Diego Costa .

"A crime author and former LAPD homicide detective claims to have new evidence that proves his own father was behind one of Hollywood's most infamous murder cases, the Black Dahlia murder of 1947. Steve Hodel details evidence in his new book, Black Dahlia Avenger II, that he says implicates his father, a prominent LA surgeon of the time, in the gruesome unsolved slaying. According to the author, his father Dr George Hodel was a suspect in the case when he skipped town, never to return. Aspiring actress: Elizabeth Short in a head-shot taken shortly before she was brutally murdered . Horrific murder: Short's body was found mutilated, severed at the waist and with ligature marks on her neck, wrists and ankles, near a busy LA intersection . Steve Hodel claimed earlier this year that his father killed . Elizabeth Short at the family's Hollywood home, the distinctive Sowden . House, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright's son, Lloyd Wright, which is . largely unchanged since the murder. He established that he and his siblings had been away with their mother at the time of the murder. Last . November Hodel, together with retired police Sergeant Paul Dostie of . Mammoth Lakes and Buster, a Labrador retriever trained to detect the . unique smell of human composition, visited the property. Once let loose, Buster quickly established four locations in the basement where he could pick up a faint trace of human remains. Colorful past: This haunting photograph is a mugshot of murder victim Elizabeth Short taken when she was arrested for underage drinking in 1943 . On January 15, 1947, 22-year-old . aspiring actress Elizabeth Short's severely mutilated body was . discovered in a vacant lot near the intersection of 39th Street and . Norton Avenue in Leimert Park, South Los Angeles. Sensationalized: Crime author Steve Hodel, claims to have proof his father was the murderer in the Black Dahlia case that has fascinated the public for decades . Her . body had been cut clean in half at the waist and completely drained of . blood. Her internal organs had been removed. Her face had been slashed . from the corners of her mouth to her ears and she had ligature marks on . her wrists, neck and ankles. Short . also had multiple cuts on her thigh and breasts, where entire portions . of flesh had been removed. The body had been washed and cleaned and . ‘posed’ with her hands over her head, her elbows bent at right angles, . and her legs spread. A woman out walking with her daughter discovered the body, which she initially took for a discarded shop mannequin.The . horrific murder generated huge media interest, and it's been said that . the media, which coined the colorful name Black Dahlia, was partly . responsible for the inability of police to solve the case. Reporters . trampled over evidence and withheld tips in order to score a 'scoop'. To add to the case’s sensational . intrigue, both LAPD officials and newspaper editors received taunting . notes and personal possessions of Short's, believed to be from Short's . killer. Interest in the case hasn't waned over the decades. Numerous film and television productions have been based on the case, and the 2006 film directed by Brian De Palma and starring Josh Hartnett and Scarlett Johanssen renewed the public's fascination with the mystery of the Black Dahlia. Signature: Hodel says his father idolized painter Man Ray and left a distinctive Man Ray-esque marking on the body of Elizabeth Short . Skipped town: LA surgeon Dr George Hodel reportedly skipped town before he could be arrested in connection with the murder of Elizabeth Smart . Sins of the father: Steve Hodel with a copy of his 2003 book 'Black Dahlia Avenger' (left) and speaking about his latest book (right) In Steve Hodel's new book, he claims . his six-year investigation into the case has unearthed brand new . findings that implicate his father in the sadistic killing, including . discounting several urban myths surrounding the case, physical evidence . the murder took place at Sowden House and connecting the murderer to the . vacant lot where the body was dumped, and evidence only a surgeon could . have bisected the victim's body. Lost daughter: Elizabeth Short  pictured with her mother, Phoebe May Short . 'This is new information that I've discovered, and the LAPD is unaware of this evidence,' Steve Hodel told KLTV. Among . the many claims in the book, Hodel says his father idolized his friend, . the painter Man Ray. A distinctive cross-hatching appeared in many of . Man Ray which Hodel says also appeared on the corpse of Elizabeth Short. 'Her body was his canvas and his scalpel was his paintbrush,' said Hodel. The . book also contains full transcripts from bugging devices the police . planted in Dr Hodel's home and office, in which he makes multiple highly . incriminating statements. 'Supposin' I did kill the Black Dahlia. They couldn't prove it now. They can't talk to my secretary anymore because she's dead... They . thought there was something fishy. Anyway, now they may have figured it . out. Killed her. Maybe I did kill my secretary...' George Hodel is recorded saying in 1950. Steve Hodel first made the claim that his father was the Black Dahlia murderer in his 2003 book Black Dahlia Avenger. Dr Hodel, who was also investigated in connection with his secretary's death-by-overdose and faced . sexual abuse claims from his 15-year-old daughter, was only one of 25 . viable suspects the LAPD was investigating. More than 60 people have confessed to the crime at various times. Film fodder: A fictionalized version of the Black Dahlia starring Scarlett Johanssen and Aaron Eckhart, with Mia Kirschner as Elizabeth Short . Hodel remains, along with  Walter Bayley, Norman Chandler, Leslie Dillon, Joseph A Dumais, Mark . Hansen, George Hill Hodel, George Knowlton, Robert M 'Red' Manley, . Patrick S O'Reilly, and Jack Anderson Wilson (aka Arnold Smith) a suspect in the case. Before authorities could bring any charges against the surgeon, Dr Hodel abruptly abandoned his family and relocated to Asia. He died in 1991. The LAPD has yet to respond to Hodel's claims to have solved the murder, but Commander Andy Smith told KLTV, 'We periodically receive pieces of information that come in on old cases. This is an active case. We take everything seriously until it can be fully investigated.'","Crime author Steve Hodel claims his father was the Black Dahlia murderer .

"Under former boss Sir Alex Ferguson, Manchester United were notorious for their late goals that would either see them salvage a point or more than likely win a match. However, this season it is Tottenham who have that handy knack of never knowing when they are beaten. Spurs have earned 13 points with goals scored after the 85th minute in the Premier League this season - more than any other club. Harry Kane scored with the last kick of the game as Tottenham drew 2-2 at home to West Ham on Sunday . Kane earned his side a late penalty but saw his initial effort saved by Hammers goalkeeper Adrian (right) However, the 21-year-old was on hand to tuck away the rebound and rescue Spurs' 13th late point of the term . Mauricio Pochettino's men left it late once more on Sunday as Harry Kane's injury-time strike rescued a 2-2 draw against bitter London rivals West Ham. It is the second time this month that the 21-year-old has bailed out the White Heart Lane outfit following his dramatic winner in their 2-1 north London derby win at home to Arsenal. The never-say-die attitude at Tottenham has proved pivotal to their season so far. Without those late goals Spurs, would be sitting 12th in the table - but instead they are seventh and in with a shout of securing Champions League football. Along with United and Manchester City they are also the only team to have not dropped any points by conceding late on in matches. Kane (second right) scored a late header to give Spurs a 2-1 win over arch rivals Arsenal earlier this month . Second on the goalscoring list sits Arsenal, who have collected six points after scoring in the 85th minute, while Aston Villa and West Ham are the only teams to have not gained anything with late goals. Tim Sherwood's side sit fifth in the rankings for points dropped with goals conceded after 85 minutes. That includes Victor Moses' late penalty to give Stoke a 2-1 win at Villa Park on Saturday . The Villans, who sit 19th in the table, would be four points better off and not in the relegation zone, if they hadn't slipped up late in games. Stoke City were awarded a late penalty at Aston Villa after Ron Vlaar (left) brought down Victor Moses . The Nigeria international picked himself up to tuck away the penalty himself and give Stoke a 2-1 win . Moses celebrates in front of the jubilant Stoke fans who saw their side secure a late victory at Villa Park . Hull are the worst offenders for this statistic though - having dropped seven points after conceding late. They’d be 11th had they not. The Tigers were just moments away from securing their first away win over Manchester City in 85 years earlier this month when David Meyler put them ahead on 35 minutes. However, Steve Bruce's side were dealt heartache when City midfielder James Milner curled home a magnificent 25-yard free-kick deep into stoppage time to equalise.

DMX - real name Earl Simmons - was arrested on August 20, 2013, in South Carolina for driving under a suspended license and marijuana possession . Feldman told TMZ earlier in the week that DMZ had been selected out of a pool of more than 15,000 willing fighters to get in the ring with the infamous killer of unarmed black teen Trayvon Martin. In January Zimmerman, 30, said he has been training for months for a boxing match and that it was his idea to organize a fight. But due to concerns from the public Feldman, apologized Saturday and said he did not wish to go through with it, The NY Daily News reported. 'I wasn't being disrespected [sic] to anyone I had a plan here with this fight I'll let you know soon hope everyone is happy I'm very sorry,' he tweeted. 'I want to thank everyone for the good n [sic] bad comments I've made the choice to cancel the fight w George Zimmermann [sic] more to life then [sic] money.' He also tweeted he wanted nothing to do with a Zimmerman fight. DMX, 43, promised to break every rule in boxing 'to make sure I f--k him right up'. He also threatened to urinate in his opponent’s face if he won. 'I will beat the living f--k out of him,' DMX told TMZ. Trayvon Martin, 17, was fatally shot by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, in Sanford, Florida, on February 26, 2012. Zimmerman is now taking part in a 'celebrity boxing match' 'It was my idea,' Zimmerman said in an interview with Radar Online about the fight in January. 'Prior to the incident I was actually going to the gym for weight loss and doing boxing-type training for weight loss and a mutual friend put me in contact with Damon and provided me with an opportunity and motivation to get back in shape and continue with my weight loss goals and also be able to help a charity out,' he said. 'Boxing isn’t new to me. 'It’s something I had picked up well before the incident and it’s something that I liked, I enjoyed, and I kept up with it and I was able to lose a tremendous amount of weight and get a healthy lifestyle.' 'So it’s not a new hobby, it’s something I have been doing and wanting to pursue to maintain a healthy lifestyle.' In a strange coincidence, today would have been Trayvon Martin's 19th birthday. Zimmerman was found not guilty of all charges levied against him, after he fatally shot the teen during a fight in February 2012 inside a gated community in Sanford, Florida. The Hispanic man claimed that he had killed Martin with a weapon in an act of self-defence. George Zimmerman initially set his aim for Kanye West, saying he should take part in a fight because he constantly attacks people . Zimmerman remained without charge for 44 days after the shooting occurred, which led to nationwide protests and sparked furious debate over racial profiling and the right to use weapons in self-defence. Further demonstrations broke out after Zimmerman was acquitted in 2013. Federal authorities are currently reviewing the entire case to decide whether Martin’s civil rights were violated. Rapper The Game, who has a tattoo of Trayvon Martin on his leg, had previously registered his interest to challenge Zimmerman in a fight. 'I would not be boxing for me,' The Game told TMZ. 'I'd be boxing for the legacy of Trayvon Martin and for his family. 'I would box him to knock him out. 'I would definitely take pleasure in it. 'It's legal, and I want to show him you can solve your disputes without a weapon.'","George Zimmerman, 30, came up with the idea of participating in a boxing match 'for charity'

"We all bemoan the seemingly inevitable encroach of Christmas earlier and earlier into Autumn, but it seems we all contribute to the early decoration by hitting the shops months in advance for presents. The festive season will begin earlier than ever this year according to a new study - with 41 per cent of Britons starting Christmas shopping this Friday. Many won't even wait until Halloween is out of the way to start finding perfect presents for loved ones the research revealed. Unbelievably, many of us will begin planning and buying for Christmas before the leaves have even fallen from the trees . October 24 is now our favourite day to start hitting the shops ahead of the festive season. The study also found that on average we will spend more than a staggering £20,000 on Christmas gifts in a lifetime. The busiest time to shop for presents will be 6.35pm, with research suggesting most people will head to the shops after work. And it seems we aren't afraid to splash the cash for gifts. The average Brit will buy 14 presents for loved ones, each around the cost of £24. This adds up to a quarter of the typical monthly pay - 331 pounds - and a third of us will spend up to two hours planning which gifts to buy. However, one in ten (9 per cent) will spend more time planning the perfect present than they'll spend at work (ten hours). Despite our readiness to get ahead of the rush at Christmas, many of us still fail to be completely prepared. One in six, 17 per cent, leave all their festive shopping to the last minute and buy their presents in December. However some Brits are really keen to make sure they're all done in plenty of time - five per cent even started in January. The survey, conducted by the Ideal Home Show at Christmas and sponsored by Go Compare, found men and women have very different shopping habits at Christmas. While both sexes leave three hours to do the shopping and three hours to wrap the presents, women are the better shopper. Women buy on average three more presents than men . Despite men spending £24  more, 10 per cent of women will spend 11 to 14 days shopping online - only 3 per cent of men can say the same. Thoughtfully, women buy three more presents than men and 7 per cent of women will buy over 50 gifts this year. Lee Newton, CEO of Ideal Home Show owners Media 10,  said: 'This weekend will see most of us starting to plan the perfect Christmas. 'Rather than waste hours worrying about what to buy and pounding the busy shops like the majority of the population, why not come to the Ideal Home Show at Christmas. 'Everything you need is under the one roof!' The results also found that those living in the North are more generous with gifts. Each person in the North West will spend an average of £340 on gifts whereas Londoners will only spend £288. Shoppers in Yorkshire will buy an average of 17 presents yet Londoners will only buy 11. Men even confessed that they spoil their pets at Christmas. Five per cent admitted they spend more on their pet than they will for anyone else. When it comes to brothers and sisters, 21 per cent of women say they spend more on their parents - whilst on 11 per cent of men say the same. However one in five men, 19 per cent, say most of their money goes to brothers and sisters - yet only 15 per cent of women can say the same.","October 24 is now our favourite day to start hitting the shops .

"Cruel: Sean Deakin, 19, battered his dog with a hammer before stabbing it in the chest and leaving it to die . A 19-year-old faces jail after he battered his new dog with a hammer, stabbed it in the chest and left it to die in agony. Unemployed Sean Deakin left the male Staffordshire bull terrier dying on the kitchen floor of his flat while he went to the JobCentre to sign on. The cruel youth returned to find the dog - which he had owned only a few days - lying immobile and vomiting. In all, the dog - named Tyson - took eight agonising hours to die. A witness to the attack alerted RSPCA officers, who found Tyson's body in a wheelie bin outside Deakin's home four days later. Deakin was arrested and charged with three counts of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal. He denied the offences but was found guilty at Manchester magistrates court and now faces up to six months behind bars. The court heard Deakin and his girlfriend Sarah Tame, 19, had taken ownership of Tyson just days before the attack after answering an advert on classifieds website Gumtree in May last year. At around 3am, he struck the dog around 20 times on the head with a hammer. No explanation was given in court. Three hours later, Deakin woke and noticed the dog had urinated on his bed. He chased it around the kitchen, trapped it between his legs and stabbed in it the chest with a six-inch knife he had grabbed from a drawer. Deakin then went to sign on, returning shortly before Tyson died at 2pm. Inspector Danielle Jennings, of the RSPCA, said the attack was the worst case she had ever encountered. 'This was an absolutely heinous crime against an innocent animal who had done nothing wrong other than suffer the misfortune of being taken into that flat,' she said. 'In four years as an inspector this is without a doubt the worst attack on an animal I have encountered. 'Almost as soon as Tyson arrived in the flat a pattern of abuse which amounted to torture began. 'It is a concern that animals are being so easily given away online, seemingly without any checks.' Manchester City Magistrates Court: Chairman of the Bench Hugh Keachie said he was 'appalled' by the crimes and told Deakin he faces jail . Chairman of the Bench Hugh Keachie told Deakin the starting point for such crimes was a custodial sentence. He said: 'As a bench this offence absolutely appalled us and we need to make sure you understand how serious this is.' Tame pleaded guilty to one count of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal at an earlier hearing for not seeking veterinary attention for Tyson. Deakin, formerly of Birchfield Avenue, Atherton, Wigan, will be sentenced at Manchester magistrates court on June 28.

"Jeffrey Fowle, one of three Americans being held in North Korea, has been released, the State Department said Tuesday . Detained American tourist Jeffrey Fowle had been released from North Korea and was on his way home to be with his family. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the United States welcomed the move but pressed North Korea to release two other U.S. citizens as well. 'While this is a positive decision ... we remain focused on the continued detention of Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller and again call on the DPRK to immediately release them,' Earnest said, referring to North Korea. The United States will continue to work actively on those cases, he said. North Korea made it a condition of Fowle's release that the U.S. government transport him out of the country. The Department of Defense provided that transportation within the time frame that was set, officials said. Fowle, 56, a street repair worker from Miamisburg, Ohio, was arrested in May for leaving a Bible at a club for foreign sailors in the North Korean city of Chongjin. The United States expressed thanks to the government of Sweden, which has an embassy in Pyongyang, for its efforts on Fowle's case. Sweden acts as a 'protecting power' for the United States there. Washington has tried for months to send a high-level envoy to North Korea to seek release of the three men. Analysts say North Korea has previously used detained Americans as leverage in its standoff with the U.S. over its nuclear and missile programs, a charge that Pyongyang denies. Scroll down for video . What appears to be a United States Air Force passenger jet, right, is parked on the tarmac of Sunan International Airport in Pyongyang. North Korea made it a condition of Fowle's release that the U.S. government transport him out of the country . Kenneth Bae, was sentenced by North Korea last year to 15 years hard labour for crimes against the state. U.S. special representative for North Korean policy Glyn Davies said Pyongyang's refusal to discuss the issue was a sign that it 'doesn't have an interest in coming back into the international system as a responsible country'. 'One of the greatest impediments to getting back to any sort of a more productive place with North Korea is the fact that for so long they have held Kenneth Bae and have since picked up these other two Americans and as we say are really using them,' Davies said. American citizen Matthew Miller is escorted by a North Korean soldier to a telephone booth at a hotel in the capital Pyongyang, where he was allowed to make a call to his family. He was sentenced to six years of hard labour earlier this month after being convicted of entering the country illegally to commit espionage . Kenneth Bae, who was sentenced by North Korea last year to 15 years hard labour for crimes against the state . North Korea has twice cancelled visits by Robert King, the U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, to discuss Bae's case. 'There have been other efforts behind the scenes to seek to have these conversations with the North Koreans. They simply won't engage us. It's very frustrating,' Davies told reporters in Beijing, where he met Chinese officials before travelling to Seoul and Tokyo. 'It's unhelpful and I think it puts the lie to the contention of the regime that they want a better relationship with us,' he said. Last month another American man Matthew Miller said he is digging in fields eight hours a day and being kept in isolation, but that so far his health isn't deteriorating. Under close guard and with only enough time to respond to one question, Matthew Miller spoke briefly to an Associated Press Television News journalist at a Pyongyang hotel, where he had been brought to make a phone call to his family. It was the 24-year-old's first appearance since he was convicted on September 14 of entering the country illegally to commit espionage. 'Prison life is eight hours of work per day. Mostly it's been agriculture, like in the dirt, digging around,' Miller said when asked what conditions were like in prison. 'Other than that, it's isolation, no contact with anyone. 'But I have been in good health, and no sickness or no hurts,' he said, showing little emotion.","Jeffrey Fowle  left Pyongyang Tuesday .

"One-third of phone users would definitely upgrade to a Facebook phone  - and 73% think the phone is a ‘good idea’. News of the phone emerged this week, with sources claiming that Facebook had hired ex-Apple engineers to work on an ‘official’ Facebook phone. Facebook  has made several ventures into the mobile market before in partnership with manufacturers such as HTC and INQ - but a new phone made by ex-Apple engineers is rumoured to be in production . The previous 'Facebook Phone' - INQ's Cloud Touch -  puts all of your newsfeeds, pictures and other information on a well thought-out homescreen centred around Facebook . It’s not the first Facebook phone to hit . the market – the social network giant has previously partnered with INQ . and HTC to produce Facebook-oriented handsets, including phones with a . built-in ‘Like’ button. Details of the proposed phone are scant, but Facebook is already making moves into the mobile space with a series of high-profile app acquisitions. After its $1 billion purchase of Instagram, the social network bought location-based social app Glancee and photo-sharing app Lightbox. Facebook’s smartphone apps have also seen constant and large-scale redesigns, with adverts more prominent with the news feed. The handset is rumoured to be set for a 2013 release. It could be a major hit – a flash poll of 968 people conducted by MyVoucherCodes found that 32% of phone users would upgrade as soon as it became available. The key to its success could be porting apps to mobile – something Facebook is already doing. Separate camera and chat apps already separate off some site functions, and third-party apps will shortly be available via  a Facebook app store. Of those polled, 57% hoped that it would be cheaper than an iPhone – presumably supported by Facebook’s advertising.

"Martin Atkinson's refereeing duties have been overlooked this weekend following a number of controversial decisions during Chelsea’s draw with Burnley last Saturday. Atkinson will instead be fourth official on the touchline for Manchester United’s clash with Sunderland at Old Trafford this weekend. The clash at Stamford Bridge was Atkinson's 32nd game as head arbitrator this season following his game in charge of Real Madrid's Champions League win at Schalke on Wednesday. Martin Atkinson, the referee for Chelsea's draw with Burnley, will not take charge of any games this weekend . Jose Mourinho did not look happy as he watched on from the sidelines, and later aired his thoughts on TV . The Chelsea boss appeared on Sky Sports' Goals on Sunday after Chelsea's controversial draw with Burnley . However, Atkinson's services will not be needed in the middle of the park this week after his string of contested decisions in west London. Atkinson will, however, take charge of the match between Southampton and Crystal Palace at St Mary's on March 3.

"Ghost hunter Zak Bagans, who presents TV show Ghost Adventures, has bought the house in Gary, Indiana, described as 'a portal to hell' The basement of this house has been described as a 'portal to hell' filled with demons who tormented and possessed a mother and her three young children. During the ordeal back in 2012 the walls of the house allegedly bled clear oil which 'froze' the finger of a social worker who touched it, and ghostly voices were recorded when police went to investigate. So it may be surprising to learn that the property in Gary, Indiana, has now been bought for $35,000. It will be less surprising to learn that the new owner is 'ghost hunter' Zak Bagans. Bagans, who presents Ghost Adventures on the Travel Chanel, bought the house yesterday and says he has not decided exactly what to do with it, but added that it will probably involve research into the paranormal goings-on. He told the Indy Star: 'It's not entertainment. I really do have a passion for this stuff and the research aspect of this stuff.' The ordinary-looking property became world-famous five days ago after the case of Latoya Ammons, a previous owner, came to light. In 2012 Ammos says that demons began to take over her house, that objects were thrown around, her children were possessed and that the whole family nearly lost their lives. Social workers, psychiatrists, priests, police officers, doctors and nurses have all corroborated Ammons story, including one incident in which her son was taken to hospital where staff watched in horror as he climbed backwards up a wall before flipping over his mother's head. Audio recordings taken by police as they went to investigate the paranormal activity also seem to back up the story, as a ghostly voice can be heard whispering 'hey' as the officers talk. Neither of the officers recall hearing the voice that day. One man who did hear something, however, was Cary Indiana Police Captain Charles Austin, 62, who says after one trip to the property a growling voice came from his AM/FM radio saying 'you outta here' before it went back to static. He was also there the day video footage was recorded of Ammos's mother giving a tour of the house. He entered a skeptic and left convinced that he had just witnessed a ‘portal to hell.’ Scroll down for videos . In 2012 a mother and her three children were allegedly tormented and possessed by demons in this house. A spooky figure was pictured in the window, and audio recordings were made of ghostly voices . Latoya Ammons claims she and her three children were possessed and tormented by demons in the basement of her house . Speaking to MailOnline he said: ‘Everyone of us who was there that day in the basement and who saw what we saw, went through what we went through after…we all think the same, we all call it the same. That bit of dirt is a portal to hell.' The unusual happenings also attracted the attention of local priest Father Michael Maginot, who also set out to disprove the accounts, but ended up performing one minor and three major exorcisms on Ammons and her family, and now swears that he has been targeted by demons himself. Ammons also says she saw her daughter levitating above her bed, and a photograph has been widely circulated showing a shadowy figure standing by the window. Zak Bagans has been producing Ghost Adventures since 2008, in which he tours haunted places with his camera crew, interviews locals about paranormal activity, investigates areas allegedly plagued by spirits and often confronts the ghosts. According to his website, Mr Bagans became convinced of an afterlife in Trenton, Mississippi, in 2002 when he confronted the spirit of a suicidal woman in his apartment complex. During the haunting Ammons says the house seeped a clear, odorless liquid, which she claims can be seen here . A social worker who touched the liquid apparently had her finger 'frozen' and then refused to go back . Yesterday Mr Bagans took to Twitter to say that he would address reports of him buying the house 'tomorrow'. According to TMZ, he added: 'If it's true this home is a portal to hell, then I want to go there and see what happens.' Apparently the current tenant, an unnamed woman, was happy to pass the lease on to him. It has been reported that the woman has had no issues with the house herself, and has seen none of the things described by Ammons. However Charles Reed, the current homeowner, said media interest in the house has been unbelievable — so much so that the tenant called Gary police to complain when reporters and photographers showed up.","Zak Bagans, Ghost Adventures presenter, has bought 'portal to hell' house .

"Former Chelsea manager Ruud Gullit has revealed his surprise at Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal's failure to sign 'any good central defenders' during last summer's transfer window. Gullit believes his fellow countryman failed to replace  Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand despite spending over £150million  during his first few months at the club. Defenders Marcos Rojo, who has been deployed at centre back for a large part of the season, and Luke Shaw were brought in from Sporting Lisbon and Southampton respectively - however neither player were seen as ready-made replacements for Vidic and Ferdinand. Ruud Gullit believes Manchester United should have signed Mats Hummels during the summer window . Louis van Gaal was 'crazy about Hummels', according to former Chelsea manager Ruud Gullit . Gullit insists Van Gaal should have signed Germany and Borussia Dortmund  centre back Mats Hummels. Speaking to Goal at Heineken's #ChampiontheMatch event, Gullit said: 'The only thing for me that is a surprise is Van Gaal didn't buy any good central defenders - that had to be his priority. 'He was crazy about Hummels and wanted to buy him. So I would have bought Man United some good defenders because that was the weakest link. 'For me, that they did not was a surprise. Nevertheless, he gets results. The more results he gets, the more confidence they get and the better they will play.'

"The schoolboy killer of teacher Ann Maguire tried to talk his girlfriend into joining him on a killing spree and then going on the run together. Will Cornick - jailed for life last week for stabbing his Spanish teacher to death - wanted the pair to commit murder and spoke endlessly to her about killing Mrs Maguire and the feeling of power it would give him. As well as bringing her into his world of sick fantasies, the 16-year-old would also cut himself with a knife in front of her and regularly ask if he could do the same to her. Scroll down for video . Sick fantasy: The ex-girlfriend of schoolboy killer Will Cornick says he tried to persuade her to join him on a murder spree, telling her the two could then go on the run . Speaking to the Sunday People, the girl said: 'He said I understood him and that it would be great if we could carry out a murder together. 'When we did meet up he would talk endlessly about death and Mrs Maguire and wanting to commit a murder and the feeling of power it would give him. 'He sometimes brought knives into school and he would draw them up and down his arm – ­breaking the skin and letting it bleed. He asked if he could do it to me but it scared me and I began to make excuses not to see him at break.' Cornick attacked Mrs Maguire after boasting to friends that he was going to kill her. He also said he was going to murder other teachers, including a pregnant woman ‘so as to kill her unborn child’. Loss: Ann Maguire's family, husband Don  and daughters Emma  and Kerry, stand outside Leeds Crown Court as a statement is read after the sentencing on Monday . He later told doctors: ‘I said I was going to do other stuff but I never got the chance, other murders. It was a triple homicide.’ After the murder the teenager told psychiatrists that he ‘couldn't give a s***’ and added: ‘Everything I've done is fine and dandy.’ The former girlfriend started seeing Cornick in January but managed to dump him just two months before the disturbed teenager committed murder in front of horrified classmates. The girl, who will not be named, claims their six-week relationship began because they were both loners at Corpus Christi College in Leeds. Hatred: Corrnick would tell other classmates that he wanted to kill Mrs Maguire and often brought knives into school . Unlike other pupils who listened to popular chart music, such as Taylor Swift, the isolated pair enjoyed heavy metal bands and alternative rock. Their brief relationship started after Cornick approached her one day when she was sitting on her own in a school field. The pair would chat to each other a lot, and while initially the subject of conversation was music, Cornick soon began telling her how much he hated the school's teachers - especially Mrs Maguire. She believes the popular 61-year-old, who has been called the 'mother of the school', was killed because she was being tough on Cornick in a bid to unlock his potential. Last week, former student Tom Smith referred to the twisted killer as 'the most intelligent person I knew'. Cornick's former girlfriend says that - despite this intelligence - he did not realise Mrs Maguire was trying to help him and became consumed by his hatred for her. The girl, who decided to leave the school following the tragedy, has also spoken of how they had secret meetings away from other classmates - who thought of Cornick as a 'weirdo'. While they sometimes hugged and held hands, she claims there was no real connection between them and says 'freaky' Cornick would keep his eyes open as they kissed. After the teenager's sentencing last week, other classmates spoke of how the 'typical, nice, lad' had begun to show signs of change in the months leading up to the murder. As one pupil said: ‘The Grim Reaper was the first thing you saw on his [Facebook] page. Cornick's former girlfriend believes Mrs Maguire, who has been called the 'mother of the school', was killed because she was being tough on the intelligent teenager in a bid to unlock his potential . Stable life: Far from being having an unhappy upbringing, Cornick, depicted in a court sketch, comes from a middleclass background and his parents have been described as loving and supportive . ‘That corrected everyone’s opinion. [I thought] what the hell has happened, something has definitely gone wrong.’ Friends had started to think of him as a ‘loner and weirdo’ and ‘disturbing’ aspects of his personality became apparent. He spoke openly about murdering his teacher, messaging a friend on Facebook about brutally killing her and spending the rest of his life in jail. But no one - including his former girlfriend - believed he was capable of carrying out such psychotic threats. After the murder it was revealed that he had numerous images of knives on his mobile phone. Disturbed: The teenager used a picture of the Grim Reaper for his Facebook profile . He also had a keen interest in ultra-violent video games, including Dark Souls II, in which players hack zombies to pieces. Players devour the souls of their fallen enemies to the sound of cries of agony. Disturbing images include a character made up of hundreds of human corpses. It was voted one of the ten Most Violent Video Games of 2014. One pupil recalled Cornick saying disgusting things at a party. He said: ‘He was saying twisted stuff like “imagine jumping on a pregnant woman and seeing the baby come out”, and saying horrible stuff about cancer and stuff like that. ‘He was just saying it in conversation. He thought it was normal but it’s not. He wasn’t normal in the head.’ But for a long time Cornick had been able to hide his ‘anger’ from others by maintaining an appearance of normality. The teenager later confessed to a psychiatrist that the killing had been on his mind for three years, and one expert said he had engaged in a ‘considerable amount of fantasy’ about killing Mrs Maguire. Murder scene: A photograph issued today by prosecutors of the classroom at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds, where Ann Maguire was stabbed to death in April . On Wednesday it was revealed that Cornick is on 24-hour suicide watch and has already been moved from a young offender institution after violent threats . On Monday he was sentenced to life in jail with a minimum of 20 years but a judge warned him he may never be released. Mr Justice Coulson called the murder a 'monumental act of cowardice and evil' and found the teenager's pride and lack of remorse over his actions 'truly grotesque'. He was initially taken to Wetherby Young Offender Institution (YOI) in West Yorkshire before being moved for his own safety. School building: In an attack that shocked the nation, Cornick winked at another boy before he launched into a savage assault in front of a terrified class full of pupils . Cornick - one of 16 children serving indeterminate life sentences in Britain’s YOIs - had been held on the Anson wing in Wetherby, which is designed for long-term inmates, reported The Times. The boy was seen to be at risk from other convicts and placed in solitary confinement in a cell with a glass door, according to a report submitted to Leeds Crown Court by his defence team. He will now be held at Hindley Young Offenders' Institution until he is 18 when he will be moved to another unit. It costs the taxpayer £83,685 a year for each of the 441 prisoners to be held at the unit, reports the Sunday People. Inmates can take part in classes such as English, maths and computer skills, as well as doing vocational ­courses such as cookery, woodwork and painting and decorating. Sports on offer at the unit include football, badminton, indoor bowls, hockey, tennis, weight-training and rugby league.","Girl claims boyfriend Will Cornick wanted them to kill Ann Maguire together .

"Industry figures show Britain is losing its taste for baked beans with the amount spent on the snack falling by £21million this year . Sales in baked beans fell by more than £20million this year. But while the figures are bad news for Heinz, they could be a sign of better things for the economy – as sales of tinned goods tend to go up when times are hard because they are cheap. If people are buying fewer beans it suggests they could be spending on higher-grade foods. The hot summer, compared with the gloom of 2012, may also have contributed as hot food is less of an attraction when the  temperature is soaring. The total value of baked beans sold in the 12 months to October fell by £20.8million to £339.3million. Sales at Heinz, which dominates the market ahead of Branston and Crosse & Blackwell, fell by £16.1million to £216million, said the study in trade journal The Grocer. It said a lack of new product development also contributed to the fall in sales across the market.

"Ashley Barnes will not face retrospective action from the Football Association following his challenge on Nemanja Matic during Burnley's draw at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. The Burnley striker caught the Serbia international with a dangerous studs-up tackle prompting Matic to retaliate by pushing Barnes to floor, earning the Chelsea midfielder a red card. The FA confirmed on Monday that because the incident was seen by referee Martin Atkinson during the game no further action could be taken. Nemanja Matic reacts angrily after being sent off for his reaction to a tough challenge from Ashley Barnes . This studs-up tackle from Barnes infuriated Matic and Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho backed up his player . Nemanja Matic (centre) was sent off after reacting to a challenge from Burnley's Ashley Barnes on Saturday . Barnes slides into a challenge with Chelsea midfielder Willian during the heated contest . 'Retrospective action introduced as deterrent for ‘off the ball incidents’ [e.g. kicks, stamps etc.] committed out of sight of officials,' the FA tweeted. 'In line with this rationale, FA confirm no further action in relation to Ashley Barnes as incident was seen by the officials.' Meanwhile, Jose Mourinho is unlikely to face FA punishment despite his extensive criticism of refereeing decisions during his appearance on Goals on Sunday. The Chelsea manager expressed his grievances in light of Chelsea’s draw with Burnley at Stamford Bridge when Nemanja Matic was sent off and the home side were refused two penalty claims by Martin Atkinson. Mourinho was angered by Ashley Barnes's studs up tackle on Matic – as well as his foul on Branislav Ivanovic – calling the Burnley player’s actions ‘criminal’. The Portuguese also pointed to previous incidents when calls had gone against his team, describing them as ‘too much’. Jose Mourinho described the tackle as 'criminal' during his appearance on Goals on Sunday on Sky Sports . Atkinson shows the red card to Matic after the Serbian pushed Barnes over in retaliation to the tackle . He himself brought up the risk his comments could result in sanction from the FA, suggesting he may be banned from the dugout for the Capital One Cup final, but insisted he was not attacking referees’ integrity and simply being honest. In January Mourinho was fined £25,000 and warned about his future conduct for bringing the game into disrepute by claiming there was a ‘campaign’ against Chelsea. The FA are aware of his latest observations on officiating, but it is believed he has selected his words carefully enough to avoid punishment this time. Mourinho said during the programme on Sky Sports: ‘I cannot go too far but the reality is the incidents I'm speaking [about] week after week is exactly because it is week after week. I know football is football and in football sometimes you have and sometimes you don't have. But I think it's too much. My players are not getting the respect they deserve. The Chelsea manager was not happy with several decisions during Saturday's 1-1 draw at home to Burnley . Mourinho appears on Sky Sports' Goals on Sunday after Chelsea's controversial draw with Burnley . 'At Southampton, the penalty, transformed in a free-kick and a yellow card to Cesc Fabregas. The penalty against Tottenham, handball with [Jan] Vertonghen, against Liverpool, red cards for Liverpool, penalties, it's too much. It's too much. 'If you're asking me about five points difference, I would say to you if we are in a normal situation where the mistakes are part of the game and sometimes go in our favour and sometimes go against us, in this moment it wouldn't be five, it would be 12. Because we are speaking about two points at Southampton, three points at Tottenham. We are speaking about many, many incidents. 'Probably now I'm risking my dugout in the final because maybe tomorrow I have the risk of being suspended because I'm having this conversation. 'I'm not attacking honesty, the dignity of anyone. I'm not trying to - and in this country you love this sentence - bring the game into disrepute. This is what they use when they want to punish me. I'm trying just to be honest. 'They [the referees] are trying but they are not doing well. They are trying. Of course, they are trying. What I would improve? If the referee cannot see a penalty three metres in front of him, some official in front of a screen cannot miss it. 'If we want to protect the integrity and honesty of the referees, if we want to believe that the mistake is a consequence of a misinterpretation, of a bad position, of unpredictability of the situation and the game, I think technology can help.’","Ashley Barnes will not face retrospective action for dangerous tackle .

"Everton's youngsters showed the senior team how it's done with a comprehensive 5-0 win over local rivals Liverpool on Saturday afternoon. The Toffees' Under 18 side were comfortable winners at Finch Farm as a brace from Calum Dyson and goals from Harry Charsley, Jack Bainbridge and Liam Walsh sealed victory.

"The Prime Minister said he would block Serbia and Albania from joining the EU unless there were stringent restrictions on how citizens could move across the continent . David Cameron threatened last night to veto any new members of the EU unless he won sweeping curbs on freedom of movement. The Prime Minister said he would block Serbia and Albania from joining unless there were stringent restrictions on how citizens could move across the continent. The poor Eastern European nations are next in line to join the union, and Turkey and  Bosnia could be next. Mr Cameron said curbs were needed to avoid the ‘huge mistake’ of the unrestricted opening of borders to Poland and other countries nine years ago, with hundreds of thousands coming to the UK for work. The threat, made after yesterday’s EU summit in Brussels, will put pressure on European leaders to increase restrictions on movement. It could see Serbian and Albanian people denied free movement in Europe until their countries’ average earnings or GDP reached a certain level, for example. Mr Cameron hopes it will also pave the way for a more general revision of EU treaties. Days before restrictions on Romanian and Bulgarian migrants are lifted at the end of this month, he said: ‘The EU’s founding fathers simply did not envisage that the accession of new countries would trigger mass population movements across Europe.’ He added that free movement should not mean freedom to get ‘the best benefit deal’. Both Serbia and Albania want to join the EU, but any negotiations will take at least ten years. The threat, made after yesterday's EU summit in Brussels (above), will put pressure on European leaders to increase restrictions on movement. Pictured, the PM talks to Romania's president in Brussels . Unemployment in Albania is 13 per cent, and wages are low – meaning workers might find the UK job market attractive. No new EU member can be admitted without the support of all existing members. Mr Cameron said: ‘On new accessions, they are by unanimity so they don’t happen unless everybody agrees.

"Alex Goode is poised to make his first England appearance for a year and a first Test start since March 2013, after Mike Brown suffered a setback in his recovery from concussion. Having been knocked out in an accidental collision with Italy centre Andrea Masi at Twickenham 10 days ago, Brown was expected to come through the return to play protocols in time to retain his No 15 shirt against Ireland in Dublin on Sunday. However, the Harlequins full-back experienced concussion symptoms again last Friday, after cycling, so he was forced to begin the whole process from scratch on Monday. Saracens full back Alex Goode is tackled by Sale Sharks centre Johnny Leota on Saturday . Goode fields a high ball during an England training session at Pennyhill Park last Tuesday . Mike Brown showcases his aerial skills during England's victory against the Azzurri at Twickenham . While Stuart Lancaster has not yet ruled Brown out of contention for the crucial encounter between the two remaining unbeaten teams in the RBS Six Nations, all the indications on Monday night were that he would not be available. 'Mike was symptom-free, then he did the bike on Friday and there were some symptoms after that, so he had to step down again,' said England's head coach. 'He's had a rest over the weekend and started the return-to-play process again today. 'I've got to be 100 per cent certain that he's right with the type of knock it was and also to go into the size of game that this is. The reality is he won't have trained from the (Italy) game to potentially this Friday, which is 13 days. You have to have the team ready to play. Brown lays motionless on the pitch after the Harlequins full back collided with Italy centre Andrea Masi . Brown received medical attention on the pitch following his heavy collision with Masi . Brown left the field on a stretcher and did not return to the field following his concussion . 'A lot will depend on how the next 24 hours go but a decision will have to be made within the next two days because the team need a chance to prepare with all the pieces in place. It will be a judgement call based on a medical call.' Brown seems increasingly likely to miss out and his loss would be keenly felt. He has been an outstanding main-stay of England's recent victories over Wales and Italy. Goode last played for England on March 9 last year – against Wales at Twickenham – but he has been in fine form for Saracens and Lancaster values his attributes as a playmaker full-back. The 26-year-old hasn't started for his country since the record 30-3 defeat in Cardiff almost two years ago, but his misfortune has been to find himself challenging a man who was untouchable last year, as Brown was named Player of the Championship among a host of personal awards. 'He's been unlucky in the sense that the stand-out player in the Six Nations last year was Mike Brown, in his position. He's had to wait patiently for his chance again. He's certainly confident and he feels he's ready, should his opportunity come, I think he'd be ready to take his chance. Worcester full back Chris Pennell has also been called into the squad after making his Test debut last June . 'He's a different type of player to Mike in that he's equally good under the high ball, he's very good as a positional full-back and he can play fly-half, so he offers that slightly different kicking option, but also the opportunity to be a first receiver-playmaker.' Worcester full back Chris Pennell has also been called into the squad after making his Test debut last June in New Zealand and more recently playing superbly for the Saxons in Cork. However, Goode is surely destined to take Brown's place in Dublin. Courtney Lawes, Tom Wood and Geoff Parling are all expected to be available for training on Tuesday after recovering from injuries, and the three forwards are all theoretically in contention for a return to the match-day 23 at the Aviva Stadium. Lancaster is due to name his team on Friday.

"Jeb Bush, former Florida governor for eight years, is facing questions after it was revealed that he was stood to profit from fracking if plans he was pushing were accepted . A former governor who pushed states to approve plans for fracking was stood to personally benefit from profits reaped from the controversial drilling. Jeb Bush, Florida's governor for eight years until 2007, said that neglecting to approve fracking plans would lead to areas in America languishing. But one of the 62-year-old's private equity enterprises was simultaneously raising $40 million to back a company acquiring fracking wells, the Tampa Bay Times reported on Friday. Inflection Energy, based in Denver, already had active leases in Pennsylvania and hoped that New York would lift its ban. The hotly-tipped 2016 presidential candidate also co-owns a company called Proforce Energy Services, which provides sand for fracking. The release of this information has renewed fresh fears about the relationship between politicians and business. Bush told conservatives in a speech in 2013 that New York was choosing not to grow because of its reluctance to approve drilling plans. 'Some states, like yours here in New York, are choosing not to grow. They won't approve fracking,' he said, according to the New York Post. 'Meanwhile, in parts of New York where huge opportunities exist for the restoration of economic activity, people languish.' He renewed his calls to government to ease regulations on fracking at the National Automobile Dealers Association convention in San Francisco on January 23. Although he accepted fracking wasn't 'cool on the coasts' he told an audience that federal lands and waters should be open to energy exploration. Last year Bush decided to resign from all of his corporate and nonprofit board memberships. Kristy Campbell, his spokesman, said that Bush's review of his business interests were 'a natural next step as he turns his focus to gauging whether there is support for a potential candidacy'. The controversial process is used to extract gas and oils from rocks. One of the 62-year-old's private equity enterprises was raising $40million to back a company acquiring fracking wells .

But the brother of former US president George Bush is said to be still reviewing his role in businesses where he is a principal partner or owner. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a process where water, chemicals and sand are drilled into the earth to break up rocks. Doing this frees oils and natural gas. Environmentalists object to the process because the drilling could also release chemicals into the water supply.

"Chelsea defender Filipe Luis believes Chelsea's 1-1 draw against Burnley cannot be blamed on the performance of referee Martin Atkinson. Jose Mourinho lamented his side's bad luck after the Premier League clash which could have seen Chelsea awarded two penalties before Nemanja Matic was sent off for a push on Ashley Barnes. Luis, however, claimed Chelsea simply couldn't make the most of the chances they created at Stamford Bridge. Filipe Luis refused to blame the officials for Chelsea's 1-1 Premier League draw against Burnley . The studs-up tackle from Ashley Barnes infuriated Chelsea star Nemanja Matic and his manager  Mourinho . He told the Telegraph: 'I don't believe in luck and I don't want to talk about the referee. 'We had chances to win the game [against Burnley], we played a lot better than them and created a lot of chances. We have to improve and play better in every game. 'We created chances, everybody was running in attack. We have to know that every game is not easy, and to be top of the league every game is more difficult because everybody is trying to steal points from us.

Silva fired a brace against Newcastle in Manchester City's 5-0 win against John Carver's side, while Ki Sung-yueng scored in Swansea's home win against Manchester United. Here, EA Sports crunch the numbers to reveal the 10 best Premier League performers from the weekend. Silva was No 1, but who else makes up the top 10? 10. Victor Moses, Stoke City (PPI score: 36.8) Stoke City fought back from a goal down to pick up all three points against Aston Villa and Victor Moses played a major role in his side's winning goal. Moses, who is on loan from Chelsea, converted Stoke's 91st-minute penalty kick after he was fouled by Ron Vlaar. Stoke winger Victor Moses from the penalty spot to give his side the win against Aston Villa . Olivier Giroud thanks Danny Welbeck after playing a key role in the Frenchman's goal against Palace . The EA Sports PPI is the official player rating index of the  Premier League. It measures a player's contribution to the success of his team. The intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses. So, what are the six indices? 1. Winning performance . 2. Player's performance per match . 3. Appearances . 4. Goals scored . 5. Assists . 6. Clean sheets . 9. Danny Welbeck, Arsenal (PPI score: 37.2) Danny Welbeck impressed in Arsenal's win at Selhurst Park on Saturday as he claimed an assist for both of his side's goals. The Arsenal striker was adjudged to have been fouled by Palace left back Pape Souare in the eighth minute, which allowed Santi Cazorla to score from the spot, and he forced Julian Speroni into parrying a shot before Olivier Giroud poked home the rebound. 8. Raheem Sterling, Liverpool (PPI score: 37.4) Raheem Sterling has been in fine form for the Reds since returning from a mid-season break in the Caribbean. The England international struck in the 73rd minute to ensure his side claimed a crucial victory at St Mary's. 7. Bafetimbi Gomis, Swansea City (PPI score: 39.6) It may have been one of the luckiest goals of his career, but Bafetimbi Gomis has been credited with scoring the winner against Manchester United. Gomis deflected a shot from Jonjo Shelvey past David de Gea to pile misery on Louis van Gaal's side. Bafetimbi Gomis, pictured with Jonjo Shelvey, has been credited with scoring against Manchester United . Edin Dzeko is congratulated by Manchester City team-mate Vincent Kompany during his side's 5-0 win . 6. Edin Dzeko, Manchester City (PPI score: 39.7) Edin Dzeko sent a healthy reminder to Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini by scoring his first Premier League goal since September 27. The Bosnia international also claimed two assists to impress his manager ahead of their Champions League showdown against Barcelona. 5. Samir Nasri, Manchester City (PPI score: 40.5) Like Dzeko, Samir Nasri would have been eager to impress against Newcastle in order to seal a spot in Pellegrini's starting line-up against La Liga giants Barcelona. Nasri scored one and set up another to cap off a positive evening for the Frenchman. 4. Olivier Giroud, Arsenal (PPI score: 41.3) Arsenal leapfrogged Manchester United during the course of the weekend thanks to Olivier Giroud's eighth Premier League goal of the season. Giroud scored from close-range to score what turned out to be the eventual winner but also made three important clearances to help his defensive team-mates. 3. Santi Cazorla, Arsenal (PPI score: 41.8) The Spanish playmaker kept his cool to score a penalty in the opening stages of Arsenal's match at Selhurst Park. Arsene Wenger will need the likes of Santi Cazorla to be at his best for the remaining 12 Premier League games in order to secure a spot in next season's Champions League. 2. Ki Sung-yueng, Swansea City (PPI score: 42.4) Ki Sung-yueng scored in Swansea's win against Manchester United during the opening weekend of the Premier League and struck against on Saturday to cancel out Ander Herrera's opener.

"This video captures the moment a bouncer says gay people should be fed to dogs after a clubber claimed to have been beaten by a nightclub worker. Rory Barker says the homophobic slur came after a staff member hit him and then threw him out of the one of the biggest clubs in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, in the early hours of Saturday. Police are investigating after the video emerged online appearing to support Mr Barker's claim. Scroll down for video . Police are investigating after a video captured the moment a bouncer says gay people should be fed to dogs . The clip shows a bouncer at the Corporation club telling another reveller: 'If you want to take a gay man home, you can feed him to your dogs.' Mr Barker, a chemistry student at the University of Sheffield, told student newspaper The Tab: 'It was like being in a boxing match. 'I ended up having to cover my face as he tried to upper cut me, and got punched in the side instead. 'I was then escorted outside where we asked the bouncers if they thought their colleague's behaviour was ok, and they responded by telling us to f*** off.' Corporation club said this type of behaviour is 'unacceptable' and suspended a member of their door team . He added: 'I was then asked by one of them if I was a gay boy, and when I replied 'no, not that it matters', they replied 'are you sure? You look like a slimy little gay'.' Rory Barker says the homophobic slur came after a staff member hit him and then threw him out of Corporation clubs in Sheffield, South Yorkshire . He added: 'I was too astonished and incredulous to their open homophobic comments to feel angry or embarrassed.' Fellow revellers said the incident inside the club was sparked when a staff member grabbed Mr Barker's friend Jess Keane during an argument with another clubber. John Pinkos, who was with the group, said: 'He suddenly grabbed Jess's arm really hard, to the point where she dropped her phone. 'To me, a grown man trying to intimidate a five foot five girl is shameful.' Ms Keane added: 'Rory stepped in to get me away from the bouncer where he then took a punch to the face.' Corporation nightclub said they had suspended a member of their door team yesterday. A spokesman for the club wrote on their Facebook page that the behaviour is 'totally unacceptable' and the incident is being investigated. 'Regarding the comments made by a member of security on Fri 20th Feb, the person concerned has been immediately suspended following initial investigations,' he said.

"New drug: Sofosbuvir, when taken in combination with the current treatment options, cures up to 90 per cent of patients . Experts have declared the end of hepatitis C, thanks to a three-month course of tablets that could see the killer blood disease eradicated from Britain. The development of Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) has been hailed as a ‘game-changer’ in the treatment of the illness. ‘This new drug gives us the opportunity to clear hepatitis C from the UK,’ says Graham Foster, professor of hepatology at Queen Mary, University of London. Hepatitis C is a blood-borne virus that was first identified in 1989. Many of those affected received contaminated blood from transfusions or medical procedures prior to 1989, or by sharing needles or having tattoos. Famous sufferers include Body Shop founder Dame Anita Roddick, who died of a brain haemorrhage in 2007, and former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson. The virus is estimated to affect 215,000 adults in the UK, of whom more than half remain undiagnosed. Untreated, it rots the liver and, over a period of 30 to 40 years, leads to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Death rates have been rising rapidly. In 2011 there were 381 deaths from hepatitis C, but  it now kills more people than diseases related to HIV. Until now, treatments, which can last up to a year, have been fairly effective, with a 60 to 70 per cent cure rate. But they have unpleasant side effects. Sofosbuvir, when taken in combination with the current treatment options – injections of interferon and ribavirin tablets – cures up to 90 per cent of patients in just 12 weeks, and is tolerated by almost everyone. Prof Foster says: ‘If we treat 20,000 patients every year for the next ten years, nobody will transmit the virus and it will be gone. ‘Hepatitis C mutates every time it copies itself, making treating it like hitting a moving target. ‘Sofosbuvir hits at the enzyme at the very heart of the virus, stopping it from mutating or becoming resistant.’ The drug is now awaiting approval from watchdog NICE. At a cost of £35,000 for a 12-week course, it is not cheap, but experts are optimistic it will be seen as cost-effective. ‘It is estimated that hepatitis C currently costs the NHS £156 million per year,’ says William Rosenberg, professor of hepatology at University College London. Blame game: Sufferer Pamela Anderson claims she got Hepatitis C from her ex-husband Tommy Lee after they shared tattoo needles . Prof Foster adds: ‘Later this year we expect to see the availability of other new drugs, which we can combine with sofosbuvir. This will allow us to stop using interferon, which causes the worst side effects and can’t be tolerated by the sickest patients. ‘Studies show these new drugs administered with sofosbuvir have a 97 per cent success rate. It’s possible the treatment period will go down to a few weeks.’ There is just one shadow on the horizon: the low hepatitis C detection rate in the UK, which means many of those needing treatment will not be identified until they are seriously ill. The UK has no comprehensive screening programme, meaning we lag behind other European countries and the United States  in identifying sufferers. ‘We need a proper screening programme if we are to gain full benefit from these drugs,’ says Prof Rosenberg. Charles Gore, chief executive  of the Hepatitis C Trust, says: ‘This will be a huge step forward for patients towards the goal of short, easy-to-tolerate treatments that will cure hepatitis C in almost everyone who takes them. ‘We will be able to stop thinking of the virus as a chronic illness leading to cirrhosis and liver cancer and think of it instead as a nasty virus that is easily treatable. I hope this means that many more people will think about getting tested.’","Hepatitis C is estimated to affect 215,000 adults in Britain .

"The police chief of Ferguson, Missouri has apologized to the family of Michael Brown - nearly two months after the unarmed teenager was shot dead by an officer. In a video released on Thursday, Police Chief Tom Jackson apologized to Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr. for taking so long to remove the body of their son from the street. He also said sorry to peaceful protesters for the police response during the subsequent marches. 'I want to say this to the Brown family: No one who has not experienced the loss of a child can understand what you're feeling. I am truly sorry for the loss of your son,' Jackson said to camera. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson released this video apology on Thursday morning to say sorry to the family of slain teen Michael Brown for leaving his body in the street for so long . 'I'm also sorry that it took so long to remove Michael from the street. The time that it took involved very important work on the part of investigators, who were trying to collect evidence and gain a true picture of what happened that day, but it was just too long, and I am truly sorry for that.' It took police officers more than four hours to remove Brown's body from the street after he was shot dead by white police officer Darren Wilson on August 9. Brown, who was black, was not armed. 'Please know that the investigating officers meant no disrespect to the Brown family, to the African-American community or the people of Canfield,' Jackson went on. 'They were simply trying to do their jobs.' He also said sorry for the police response to protesters. Crowds began marching in the days after the shooting and escalated into violence and looting in some places. The police response was slammed as inept and Missouri Governor Jay Nixon ultimately put the Missouri State Highway Patrol in charge of policing the protests. Killed: Brown's body can be seen in the street on August 9; it took police more than four hours to remove it . Gunned down: Brown, 18, was unarmed when he was shot dead by Police Officer Darren Wilson, right . 'I do want to say to any peaceful protester who did not feel that I did enough to protect their constitutional right to protest, I am sorry for that,' Jackson said. 'The right of the people to peacefully assemble is what the police are here to protect. If anyone who was peacefully exercising that right is upset and angry, I feel responsible, and I'm sorry.' He also acknowledged how the situation blew up overnight and drew Ferguson into a discussion about race relations and the attitude of the police across the U.S. 'Overnight I went from being a small-town police chief to being part of a conversation about racism, equality and the role of policing in that conversation,' he said. 'As chief of police, I want to be part of that conversation. I also want to be part of the solution. 'For any mistakes I've made, I take full responsibility.' The Justice Department is investigating whether the Ferguson police used excessive force, whether constitutional rights of some residents are violated by traffic stops, searches and arrests, and if police engage in discriminatory practices.

Fire destroyed a memorial to Brown at the site of the shooting early on Tuesday, generating new anger among some residents. Police say the cause of the fire is under investigation. The fire may have been the spark for a violent protest Tuesday night. One store was damaged by looting, another was set on fire, and police were attacked with rocks and bottles. Two officers suffered injuries when they were hit by rocks.

"The British Muslim convert known as the 'White Widow' has joined ISIS and is training a female suicide bomber squad in Syria, it has been reported. Samantha Lewthwaite, 30, from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire has spent the past two and a half years on the run and has been repeatedly linked to terrorist plots in East Africa. The mother-of-four - who is the widow of one of the 7/7 suicide bombers - is charged with plotting a bombing campaign across Kenya in 2011. Scroll down for video . White Widow: Samantha Lewthwaite is reported to be in Syria training a team of female suicide bombers . Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, after Al-Shabaab gunmen raided the shopping centre killing more than sixty people. Samantha Lewthwaite is believed to have beena member of the group that carried out the attack . Now she is allegedly overseeing the training of the women in Islamic State's headquarters, as well as teaching militants how to manipulate western media. She is so highly regarded she is known as the 'Special One', reports the Daily Star Sunday. A source told the paper: 'There has been mention of a woman joining IS after being married to a jihadi fighter who became a martyr and there have been references to attacks in Africa. A photo of Samantha Lewthwaite taken from her fake South African passport released by Kenyan police in December 2011 . 'IS have plenty of fighters but they lack someone who really understands how to exploit the western media and this is where her strength is. 'She is a female version of Joseph Goebbels (the Nazi minister of propaganda under Adolf Hitler).' Lewthwaite, who converted to Islam at the age of 17, was identified as a main recruiter for Al Qaeda in East Africa and is an official spokesman for terror group Al Shabaab. The group admitted to a string of attacks in Kenya including last September's assault on Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall last year that claimed at least 67 lives. She is wanted in Kenya on charges of being in possession of explosives and conspiracy to commit a felony dating back to December 2011. After giving Kenyan police the slip in Mombasa in 2011, she has been on the run ever since, reportedly using a false South African passport and alias. Lewthwaite is the widow of Jermaine Lindsay, one of four Islamist suicide bombers who blew himself up along with 26 passengers on a Tube train near King's Cross Station in London in 2005. Following the tragedy, she portrayed herself as another victim of the tragedy and called it 'abhorrent'. Kenyan Police have previously revealed Lewthwaite also financed Woolwich murderer Michael Adebolajo's trip to East Africa for terror training. She has even written poetry praising Osama bin Laden, according to computer files seized by police from her previous home in Mombasa.

The Kenyan investigation team chasing Lewthwaite were summoned to a court in Mombasa in August to explain why she had not been caught since Interpol issued an international Red Notice arrest warrant on September 25 last year. In a statement, Police chief inspector Abednego Kilonzo said she had constantly changed her appearance, name and location while on the run. In answer to a question in court, he confirmed they believed she had undergone plastic surgery. He said: 'She keeps on changing her face all the time. He added: 'She is a person with multiple identification. She keeps on moving from one place to the other. She makes many faces and that is why it is difficult to arrest her.'","Samantha Lewthwaite has reportedly travelled to ISIS' heartland .

"The European Union is ‘not working for Britain’, George Osborne warned last night. The Chancellor said the EU was ‘causing problems for us’ – and warned the continent was ‘pricing itself out of the world economy’. The stark assessment came as the European Commission confirmed the UK would be charged interest payments if it refuses to pay a disputed £1.7billion surcharge levied last month. Scroll down for video . The door is that way: Berlin has also reiterated that Angela Merkel believes the EU’s principle of free movement, which David Cameron wants to curb, is ‘non-negotiable’ Berlin has also reiterated that Angela Merkel believes the EU’s principle of free movement, which David Cameron wants to curb, is ‘non-negotiable’. The German chancellor is said to have warned Mr Cameron that she would rather see Britain leave the EU than allow him to tear up free movement. But a leading think-tank has suggested limiting all benefits for EU migrants for the first three years to reduce the so-called ‘pull factors’. Senior Tory MPs warned the Prime Minister he could not afford to back down over the issue – and Mr Osborne suggested there was no longer a place for Britain in an unreformed EU. He told the BBC’s Newsnight programme: ‘Britain joined [the EU] for economic reasons, and when it’s not working economically for Britain that’s why we get this debate about the membership of the EU and the nature of that membership. ‘I’m someone who wants to stay in the EU, I think that’s right for Britain, but it has to be a reformed EU.’ He said that the EU was ‘morphing more and more into a eurozone focused on the survival of its currency’. He added: ‘It’s perfectly all right for the UK to say as the big country that’s not in the euro, this relationship is not working properly for us.’ Meanwhile, a think-tank has urged Mr Cameron to restrict access to the NHS for migrants from the EU until they have lived here for three years. For that period they should lose access to almost all benefits, including tax credits, housing benefit and free use of the NHS, according to a report by the think-tank Open Europe, which enjoys close links to Government. German Chancellor Angela Merkel shares a joke with Italian Premier Matteo Renzi as she insists that changing the right of workers to move freely throughout Europe is not on the table . The Daily Mail revealed last month that the Treasury is already looking at ways to curb access to tax credits, which are seen as a major incentive for people to travel to Britain to work. Currently, Britain is spending £5billion every year on tax credits for migrant workers from both inside and outside the EU. Former Tory leadership contender David Davis said Mr Cameron should face down Mrs Merkel and demand the right to limit immigration from the EU. He said proposals to curb access to benefits would not be enough to satisfy public concerns. Prominent Eurosceptic Bernard Jenkin backed the call to stand firm, saying: ‘In my view we actually have to take back control over our borders’. Mr Jenkin said Mrs Merkel’s stance was just a ‘negotiating position’ and urged Mr Cameron to call her bluff. Last night there were indications Brussels may back down over the size of the £1.7billion additional levy when Mr Osborne holds crisis talks on the issue with fellow EU finance ministers on Friday. One senior EU official said: ‘There is widespread willingness to find a way forward.’","George Osborne said the EU was ‘causing problems for us’

"Promising sophisticated catwalk videos and stylish outfit advice, the new Marks & Spencer website was bound to attract attention when it launched this week amid great fanfare. But there was one tiny snag with the whizzy brand-new site – the multi-million pound redesign left people struggling to actually buy anything. Now customers are so angry that they are threatening to boycott the store altogether unless they bring back their old website. New look: The new multi-million pound makeover promised catwalk videos and fashion advice . One man complained on the store’s Facebook page, posting: ‘The whole website seems to have crashed. Please don’t treat me like a fool, this is extremely poor.’ Another said: ‘Oh dear, your new website is down! For goodness sake bring your old site back.’ And some shoppers suggested they would boycott M&S and take their purchases elsewhere, with one customer from Liverpool writing: ‘Oh Marks, what have you done! Sorry but I’m off to look at John Lewis and Debenhams.’ Shoppers yesterday were met with an error message when they tried to access the website, asking them to ‘please bear with us’. It added: ‘We are experiencing a higher than usual number of customers. You’re put in a queue. Please don’t close this window.’ Other people reported that items disappeared from their virtual baskets, while some ran into difficulties after being asked to reset their old passwords. Glitch: However many customers complained after an error message greeted them when they tried to pay for products . The problems started after the company decided to revamp the website, taking it away from a tried-and-tested platform developed by Amazon and moving the design and operation in-house. M&S went on to spend millions of pounds building the new website, setting up a software development team of 50 computer and design experts. The new site – which is the result of a three-year development programme that involved two years of testing – is the brainchild of Laura Wade-Gery, executive director for multi-channel e-commerce at M&S. She used to work for Tesco.com but was hired by M&S to oversee the high-profile expansion of their internet store in the UK as well as overseas. Ahead of the launch of the website, Miss Wade-Gery said: ‘We’ve put customers at the heart of our rebuild so our new site really reflects how they want to browse and shop.’ Action: Customers have threatened to boycott the store if the old website is not restored . Some 21.2 per cent of clothes and 26.3 per cent of all the shoes bought in the UK are now purchased online. M&S will have to offer next-day or same-day delivery to compete with web-savvy shops such as John Lewis, which has seen a huge surge in sales linked to its site. A spokesman said: ‘We’re very proud of our new website, which has been positively received by customers and digital experts. We’ve had millions of successful visits, processed tens of thousands of orders and received hundreds of positive comments from users. ‘We did have a minor technical issue on Friday morning. However, we resolved it speedily.’","The multi-million pound redesign left people struggling to buy anything .

"Health warnings on individual cigarettes - rather than just the packaging - would urge more smokers to quit, research shows. They include timelines showing people that each cigarette shortens their life by 11 minutes and a list of harmful chemicals. Academics from Bangor University want to carry out further work but are now urging the Government to consider the warnings. Researchers have found that health warnings on individual cigarettes, rather than just the packaging, would urge more smokers to quit . In a u-turn last month, ministers finally agreed to consider introducing plain-package cigarettes in the hope they will be less appealing to young smokers. The Government announced an independent review of the policy which could lead to all tobacco firms having to use plain packaging by 2015. In this latest study, Dr Louise Hassan from Bangor University’s Business School found smokers were 16 per cent more likely to quit if given cigarettes with health warnings. She recruited 200 smokers from Scotland and Greece who were shown a variety of normal cigaretes and those with health warnings. One type had a timeline of 11 minutes printed along its length to show how much the smoker was shortening their life with every puff. Another had a list of toxins contained inside the cigarette including arsenic, benzene and formaldehyde. In this latest study, Dr Louise Hassan from Bangor University¿s Business School found smokers were 16 per cent more likely to quit if given cigarettes with health warnings . Dr . Hassan now plans to lobby the expert appointed by the Government to . lead the review into plain packaging, a paediatrician Sir Cyril . Chantler. Her study was . published in the journal Tobacco Control and she said other warnings . could include listing the dangers of second-hand smoke on children and . friends. Last year Australia became the first country in the world to introduce plain packaging and all brands are sold in olive-coloured boxes with health warnings. They include stark messages such as ‘smoking causes lung cancer,’ ‘smoking harms unborn babies’ and ‘quitting smoking could significantly improve your health.’ Early evidence has already shown it to be highly effective and a study found it led to smokers being 81 per cent more likely to quit. The Australian government opted for olive-coloured packaging which is deemed less healthy and appealing than white. Last year Australia became the first country in the world to introduce plain packaging and all brands are sold in olive-coloured boxes with health warnings . The charity Cancer Research UK has previously claimed the policy would ‘save thousands of lives’ from lung cancer as well as other forms including breast and mouth. In a statement last month, its chief executive Dr Harpal Kumar said: ‘The evidence shows children are attracted to glitzy, slickly-designed cigarettes and packs and every year more than 207,000 UK children between 11 and 15 start smoking. ‘We are urging the government to introduce standardised packaging to discourage these children from starting this life-threatening habit and to prioritise children’s health over tobacco company profits.’","Smokers 16% more likely to quit if given cigarettes with warnings .

"Millions of pounds worth of footballing talent has been casually tossed aside after the Premier League published their annual list of released players. William Gallas, David Bentley, Florent Malouda and Andrey Arshavin were among the high-profile casualties on a list of 154 players ruthlessly culled from their top-flight clubs. Though the appearance on the list of the retired Michael Owen, Paul Scholes and Jamie Carragher did not come as a surprise, plenty of high-class, and well paid, players have been jettisoned. Gone: Yossi Benayoun was one of eight players released by Chelsea . Competition: Petr Cech is the only goalkeeper in Chelsea's squad after Ross Turnbull's and Hilario's exit . Gallas was earning a weekly salary in the region of £60,000 at Tottenham and club-mate Bentley – who Spurs paid an initial £15m for in 2008 – has also left after failing to impress during his five-year spell at White Hart Lane. Youngster John Bostock has also been let go by Spurs after failing to make the grade. Across in west London, Malouda, who signed for Chelsea for £13m in 2007, had been picking up £80,000-a-week, despite being frozen out of the team and forced to train with the U21s. He did not play a single match for Chelsea last season, though his former club Lyon could provide him with a quick escape route back to France. Yossi Benayoun and goalkeepers Hilario and Ross Turnbull are others among the eight Chelsea players to be heading out of Stamford Bridge. Arshavin, who became Arsenal’s most expensive signing when he joined from Zenit St Petersburg for £15m in 2008, has also been discarded. Arsenal had confirmed earlier in the week that the Russian and fellow flops Sebastien Squillaci and Denilson were to be released. The three are among 14 players to have been released by the North London club – the most of any Premier League team. Shown the exit: David Bentley (left) and William Gallas (right) have both left Tottenham . Exit: Filippo Mancini was axed by Manchester City while Kolo Toure has agreed a move to Liverpool . Manchester City released a clutch of players, including three signed at a cost of more than £40m. Striker Roque Santa Cruz (£18m) was loaned out to Malaga last season, where he played under incoming City boss Manuel Pellegrini, but it seems the Paraguayan does not figure in City’s ‘holistic’ vision of the future. Also released were defenders Kolo Toure (£16m) and Wayne Bridge (£10m), though Toure will be joining Liverpool and Bridge will link up with Reading next season. And it seems that Roberto is not the only Mancini to have recently left the Etihad after his son Filippo, 22, was also shown the exit. Out the door: Hungarian Zoltan Gera (right) has been given his marching orders by West Brom . Thrown out: Rory Delap (left) and Jermaine Pennant (right) have both been released by Stoke . You could make a pretty good team of players released from their clubs... Goalkeeper: Schwarzer (Fulham). Defence: Simpson (Newcastle), Gallas (Tottenham), Upson (Stoke), Shorey (Reading). Midfield: Bentley (Tottenham), Neville (Everton), Gera (West Brom), Arshavin (Arsenal). Attack: Di Santo (Wigan), Cole (West Ham). Subs: Pennant (Stoke), Santa Cruz (Man City), Lichaj (A Villa), Benayoun (Chelsea), Bramble (Sunderland), Diarra (Fulham), O’Neil (West Ham). New Stoke manager Mark Hughes has only . just started his new role at the Britannia Stadium, but he has already . lost a major weapon in his attacking arsenal after long-throw specialist . Rory Delap was released. Other Stoke players seeking new clubs were . Jermaine Pennant, Dean Whitehead and Matthew Upson. Mark Schwarzer’s five-year career at Craven Cottage is also over after the Australian turned down Fulham’s latest contract offer and was released, though the 40-year-old shot-stopper is bound to attract interest from other clubs, notably Arsenal who have been repeatedly linked with him. West Ham’s Carlton Cole and Wigan’s Franco Di Santo could also provide somebody with an effective cut-price strike partnership after both left their respective clubs. Di Santo is one of 11 Wigan players to be ditched as they prepare for life in the Championship, and QPR and Reading have both dumped 10 and 11 players respectively as cost-cutting measures after their relegation from the top-flight.

"A lot has been made of Louis van Gaal's long ball tactics at Manchester United recently, but at one of his former clubs Bayern Munich that art has become an impressive skill. Bayern duo Mario Gotze and Holger Badstuber showcased their impressive ability on the ball as they pinged some long-range passes into each other during a training session. The pair's skills were all the more impressive as they controlled the fizzing passes instantaneously before indulging in some kick-ups too. VIDEO Scroll down to see Mario Gotze and Holger Badstuber in training . Mario Gotze and Holger Badstuber managed to keep the ball in the air while exchanging several passes . Supporters watched on as Gotze and Badstuber showed off their impressive skills during a training session . Badstuber is slowly making his comeback into the German giants first-team plans after injuring his thigh in a 2-0 win at home to Stuttgart in the Bundesliga in September last year. While the 25-year-old isn't expected to feature for Bayern just yet, the same can't be applied to Gotze who has played an integral part in their season so far. The Germany World Cup winner has scored seven goals in 19 league matches this season for the table-toppers. Ahead of Saturday's match at home to Hamburg, boss Pep Guardiola was given a boost with the return of both winger Franck Ribery and defender Rafinha to his squad. German playmaker Gotze has scored 10 goals for Bayern Munich during the course of the 2014-15 season . The pair had been out injured for the last few weeks as Bayern stuttered in the new year. The German champions had been near flawless in the first half of the campaign, but have managed just one win in their opening three league games so far. 'Franck Ribery and Rafinha are back and they trained with the team,' Guardiola told a news conference. 'They are fit and they are an option.' The Spaniard will not have suspended central defender Jerome Boateng at his disposal as they look to build on last week's 2-0 win at VfB Stuttgart. In their last four visits to the Allianz Arena alone, Hamburg have conceded a staggering 23 goals, including a 9-2 demolition in 2013.

"Liverpool have at last adapted to life without Luis Suarez, with Joe Allen going as far as to suggest Brendan Rodgers' side may even be better now. After coming so close to capturing the Premier League crown last term, things looked like they were unravelling in the wake of the Uruguayan's Anfield exit. Suarez's move to Barcelona was compounded by injuries to, amongst others, Daniel Sturridge, and what proved a difficult transition for many summer recruits, leading pressure to mount on Rodgers. Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen (right) believes the club have finally recovered from the loss of Luis Suarez . Suarez prepares for his first return to  England as Barcelona visit Manchester City in the Champions League . The Anfield club struggled at the start of the season, especially after Daniel Sturridge (left) was sidelined . Find out how Luis Suarez has won over the hearts of Barcelona fans . Since December, though, the Reds have improved markedly and on Sunday moved within two points of the top four, thanks to a seventh win during a 10-match unbeaten run in the Premier League. 'At the start of the year we talked about how losing Suarez was going to have an affect but now we have overcome that,' Liverpool midfielder Allen said, following the latest victory at Southampton. 'It took us a little bit of time to overcome that because the injury problems we had were not ideal. 'We are certainly back up to that level and if anything with the different system we play this season we might even have taken a step forward. 'Sometimes (criticism) gets taken out of hand but I don't think it was unfair. There was no hiding places and we were not delivering as players. Suarez was a goal scoring phenomenon during his two-and-a-half season spell on Merseyside . Suarez has won over supporters at the Nou Camp, despite only scoring four goals in La Liga . 'There was no excuse from us. We knew there might be a difficult patch early in the season and that probably went on longer than we hoped and expected. 'At the same time we always knew we would come through it and I think that was the biggest sign we would be where we are at this stage.' As well as the league, Liverpool are through to the FA Cup quarter-finals and travel to Besiktas on Thursday looking to secure safe progress to the Europa League last-16. Allen says everyone at the club is 'digging deep' to cope with their three-pronged attack, epitomised by the resilience showed in winning 2-0 at Saints on Sunday. Philippe Coutinho (left) wheels away after scoring the opener in Liverpool's 2-0 win at Southampton . Here's how Coutinho opened the scoring at St Mary's to take Liverpool within touching distance of the top four . Referee Kevin Friend failed to award Southampton three strong cases for penalties at the weekend . The St Mary's encounter was not without its controversy, though, as referee Kevin Friend waved away three strong, first-half penalty appeals from the hosts. Dejan Lovren handled after Filip Djuricic twice went down in the box, first under pressure from Emre Can and then Allen's challenge. 'If I am being honest I didn't get contact on the ball, which was disappointing because I felt I could get it but missed it,' the latter said. 'I didn't really take him down either so it is one of them where my heart was in my mouth a little bit but at the same time I can see why it wasn't given.' Saints defender Jose Fonte (centre) has called for the introduction of video technology to the Premier League . Those incidents along with others at the weekend led to widespread discussion about the merits of video technology - something Southampton captain Jose Fonte would back. Asked if he would support the introduction of such the measure, the Portuguese centre-back said: 'Yeah, I think so, I think it would be a good solution. 'It's one of those days. Nothing went our way. We kept trying, we kept working hard. 'They got a great goal really early on and then we put the pressure on them, and we just didn't have any luck today, either with decisions or in the game itself.'","Liverpool closed in on the top four with a 2-0 victory over Southampton .

"Radamel Falcao has not surrendered his status as one of the world’s most clinical strikers but may simply be lacking a little love and affection, says Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev. The Colombian forward has scored just four goals during his loan spell at Manchester United and Louis van Gaal, who replaced him after an hour in the FA Cup against Preston, left him to stew on the bench against Swansea on Saturday. United are set to decline the chance to sign the 29-year-old permanently at the end of the season but Monaco insist he is not damaged goods, just because he has not shone in the Premier League. Radamel Falcao takes part in Manchester United Foundation event to promote women's football . The Colombian, posing with Ander Herrera, has failed to live up to expectations at Old Trafford . Falcao has only managed four goals for United since arriving from Monaco with reputation for scoring goals . ‘I am not worried for Falcao,’ said Vasilyev. ‘He is a great player and goal scorer. Mentally he is strong and technically he is one of the best. Sometimes you have a difficult spell, and little things make the difference. It can be the trust of the coach. ‘Football has many examples of amazing players who go from one team to another and are not the same, then go back and explode. Falcao was relegated to the substitute's bench for United's weekend loss tom Swansea City . Monaco VP Vadim Vasilyev has suggested that the striker is not getting the love he needs from Louis van Gaal . ‘After a difficult period you need support, you need confidence.’ Falcao’s contract ties him to Monaco until 2018 and his £280,000-a-week wage is a huge commitment from any club outside the French tax haven. ‘It is always possible he can play for Monaco again,’ said Vasilyev. ‘We have interest from other great clubs but we are waiting for the decision of Manchester United.’ Real Madrid and Valencia have been linked with a move for Falcao.","Radamel Falcao has not impressed since arriving on loan at Old Trafford .

"Cristiano Ronaldo would be a perfect match for Monaco. It should be no surprise they tried to lure him to a poser’s paradise where security is as high as the tax is low, and where the yachts are as big as the dogs are small. You can picture the hair gel glistening in the sun as his Ferrari glides by Casino Square. It is not so easy to envisage him performing to sparse crowds at the Stade Louis II, but maybe one day it will appeal. ‘It’s true we met Ronaldo,’ nodded Vadim Vasilyev, Monaco’s vice- president and right-hand man to billionaire owner and president, Dmitry Rybolovlev. ‘I know Ronaldo, but it was not quite on. Monaco's days of signing A-list talent like Radamel Falcao (left) and James Rodriguez (centre) are over . Monaco have downgraded their transfer policy from signing Falcao to the likes of Dimitar Berbatov (right) Rodriguez left the principality to sign for Real Madrid for around £60m in the summer . Monaco's vice president Vadim Vasilyev concedes a France FA bill and FFP regulations have cut spending . ‘We were joking one day he might come. He likes Monaco, the project, and our president, they know each other. We sat down with Ronaldo but knowing we were looking a bit more in the distant future. We did not enter into serious discussions with Wayne Rooney, but we had contact about signing him. We were almost at the point of meeting Rio Ferdinand but he did not want to come.’ These targets were set in the heady days after the Rybolovlev takeover saved AS Monaco from relegation to the French third tier and the threat of extinction in December 2011, and then restored them to Ligue 1 within 18 months. Since then, strategy has changed. A-list players are no longer such prime targets. Stars like Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez have left, but the ambition remains to keep this club at the top. The Ligue 1 club held talks with Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo during the height of their financial power . Wayne Rooney (left) and Rio Ferdinand were also courted by the formerly big spending French side . ‘Monaco is an attractive place,’ said Vasilyev. ‘Families and wives of players fall in love with it. For some, it’s important to have a stadium full of 60,000 fans. For others, it is to have the feeling and security this country can offer. With equal terms, some players will say no, no, not Monaco, and others will say yes, yes, every time. This was the case with Falcao.’ When Falcao moved on loan to Manchester United, soon after James had been sold to Real Madrid, fans protested and rumours were rife Rybolovlev was bored, feeling the pinch of his divorce or had fallen out with Prince Albert, after failing to acquire Monegasque citizenship. These were refuted by the owners, who put the policy shift down to UEFA’s Financial Fair Play rules and a £41.5million bill from the French FA to offset the club’s tax-free status. ‘To jump-start the project, massive investments were needed,’ said Vasilyev. ‘Our president is a very ambitious man and we accomplished what we did. But since the summer 2013, I said: “Look, there won’t be massive investments.”’ Little known Silva Bernardo celebrates after scoring the winner in Monaco's 1-0 defeat of Nice at the weekend . Monaco's rise from the French third division to the Champions League has been bankrolled by billionaire owner Dmitri Rybolovlev, pictured here with Prince Albert II (right) The principality's lavish lifestyle, low taxes and high security are a lure for professional footballers . FFP rules squeezed this club, with its tiny fan base inside a nation with a population of 35,000. ‘Nobody wants an unfair competition,’ said Vasilyev. ‘The trick is how to implement this in real life. Is the recent (£5billion) TV rights deal in England unfair to other European clubs? Can they compete at the same level when Premier League clubs can buy almost any player? ‘Under these rules, a project like Chelsea or Manchester City is no longer possible. Is it good big clubs stay big and small ones stay small?’ One arm of Monaco’s new strategy is to revert to the strengths of the era when Arsene Wenger was in charge, producing talent like David Trezeguet, Lilian Thuram and Thierry Henry. Leonardo Jardim’s squad is the youngest left in the Champions League, even with Ricardo Carvalho (36) and Dimitar Berbatov (34) boosting the average age to 23.9 years. Thierry Henry is one of several France legends to have been groomed at Monaco . Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim has  the youngest squad left in the Champions League . ‘When we signed Ricky (Carvalho) there was so much criticism because of his age,’ said Vasilyev. ‘But when I met him for the first time, at night in Madrid, in his jeep so no one would see us, I recognised his positive personality and it has helped us a lot.’ Another arm of the plan is to lean on Monaco’s global appeal and association with its Royal Family and Grand Prix. The club crest has been redesigned to include the word Monaco rather than the initials ASM and this season’s team photo was taken at the opulent Opera de Monte Carlo. ‘Monaco is a historic club — one of the major clubs in France — and the ambition was always to give back this identity,’ said Vasilyev. ‘We are unique. We consider ourselves part of the principality, which stands in this world for many things: luxury, sports, ecology.’ Arsene Wenger will return to his former club when Arsenal face Monaco in the Champions League last 16 . The Gunners prepared for Wednesday's clash with a 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace at the weekend . They are into the knock-out stages of the Champions League for the first time in a decade and the draw against Wenger’s Arsenal laces the revival story with emotion. ‘Wenger is revered as one of the great coaches in Monaco history and one of the iconic coaches in modern football,’ said Vasilyev, but he quashed the idea the 65-year-old may return to the club he led to the French title in 1988. ‘We have to accept Arsenal is a different level in European football. He has been there for nearly 20 years and done an amazing job. We have the greatest respect but to come back to Monaco is not on the agenda. We are going for coaches who still have to grow and prove themselves and develop as part of the project.’ MAY 2011 .

"Former Ireland international Kevin Kilbane has made an official complaint to the FA after West Ham fans chanted offensive songs mocking the disabled at Spurs on Sunday. The Match of the Day pundit contacted the FA after a close friend reported West Ham fans sang ‘Harry Kane talks like a **** and plays like one too’ during the 2-2 draw at White Hart Lane. The former Everton, Sunderland, Hull, West Brom and Wigan winger, whose daughter 10-year-old Elsie has Down’s Syndrome, has been told the FA is launching a full investigation into his complaint. Kevin Kilbane has made an official complaint to the FA after West Ham fans chanted offensive songs . The songs were directed at Harry Kane who scored Tottenham Hotspur a last-minute equaliser in the game . Other members of the public have also contacted the FA to make complaints which follows reports that West Ham fans chanted an anti-Semitic song on a train. Kilbane, a patron of the Down’s Syndrome Association charity, said: ‘I am sure they understand they are causing offence. You cannot sweep it under the carpet and label it as ignorance. It is visible and clear and like racist or homophobic chanting, it is intended to cause offence. ‘I want to be able to take my kids to football matches and when Elsie gets older she will understand about her condition and I would not want her to hear that kind of chanting. If her sister Isla heard it, she would be devastated too, as my friend’s sons were. West Ham fans sang ‘Harry Kane talks like a **** and plays like one too’ at White Hart Lane on Sunday . ‘I spoke him and he was extremely upset and I felt I had to report it. No family should have to put up with it at football matches. ‘It was very clear and sadly it appeared to be from a large number of West Ham fans in the ground. This was not isolated to a handful of people. ‘This is a wider society problem, not just a problem with football and idiots are using football as a tool to show their ignorance and discrimination. ‘I have spoken to the FA and they have assured me they will investigate it thoroughly. Kane celebrates after scoring a late penalty for Tottenham against West Ham at White Hart Lane on Sunday . ‘In all my time playing and watching football, I have never heard this before. Hopefully we can do something to make sure it isn’t again and this awful chant does not spread.’ A West Ham club spokesman said: ‘If any individual is found to have behaved in an inappropriate way, the club’s zero-tolerance policy dictates that they will face the strongest possible action, including the option of a life ban.’ Although Kilbane was not at the game on Sunday, Andy Merriman, a Spurs season ticket holder and ghost-writer of his autobiography Killa contacted him immediately afterwards. Merriman wrote the moving book A Minor Adjustment following the birth of his daughter Sarah who also has Down’s Syndrome. His son Dan, a trainee lawyer, has also written to the FA to complain about the behaviour of West Ham supporters.","Kevin Kilbane has made a complaint to the FA about West Ham fans .

"Paris Saint-Germain want talks with Chelsea over defender Branislav Ivanovic. Not content with taking David Luiz for £50m, the French champions have expressed interest in Eden Hazard, Oscar and Petr Cech. Yet they have Ivanovic back on the agenda after realising Chelsea will not offer him a new contract just yet. The Serbia defender, 30, has two years left on his deal and is keen to tie himself to Stamford Bridge until the end of his career. French fancy: Branislav Ivanovic is wanted by big spending PSG amid uncertainty over his next contract . However, Chelsea's policy now is similar to other big clubs, where they will only offer one-year extensions to players of 30 or above. That means any proposed talks will be shelved until next summer when Ivanovic has 12 months remaining. The defender and his representatives wanted to add another two years to his deal supported by statistics that show he has averaged over 40 games a season for the past five years. PSG are willing to offer Ivanovic that security and will bid around £15million for him should his relationship with Chelsea deteriorate. Hair raising! PSG have already lured David Luiz to Paris for a world record £50m for a defender . Bon voyage? Big spending PSG have also expressed an interest in Eden Hazard (right) and Oscar (left) Aaron Ramsey still wanted by Barcelona and Bayern Munich . Mario Balotelli offered to Arsenal for £30m by AC Milan . Jose Mourinho is in the throes of lowering his squad's age with the likes of 19-year-old Kurt Zouma due to arrive and tentative enquiries made for Real Madrid's Raphael Varane, 21, yet the coach recognises a need for experience if they are to win the big games. That has been reflected in their talks with Atletico Madrid where they have discussed four players, notably 28-year-old left back Filipe Luis, 28-year-old centre back Diego Godin plus free agent Tiago, 33, and Diego Costa, 25. Ivanovic is still a favourite with Mourinho but the club policy may force his departure. Tottenham have made contact over Swansea defender Ben Davies as Mauricio Pochettino looks to strengthen his options at left back. Pochettino wanted Davies, 21, when at Southampton as a replacement for Luke Shaw and is now keen to take him to White Hart Lane. Top boyo! Swansea's Ben Davies is on Tottenham's short list to become their next left back . Ryan Bertrand has also been mentioned while Fabio Coentrao will be offered to top English sides over the coming weeks also. Both are possibles for Liverpool if they fail to complete a deal for Alberto Moreno from Sevilla. West Ham are waiting on Cheikhou Kouyate to decide his future after making a bid for the Anderlecht defender. Valencia are the main competition as they have matched the offer and look set to bring in some big names over the summer should owner Peter Lim ratify his financial investment. Upton spark! Senegal's Cheikhou Kouyate, pictured battling against Yaya Toure, is wanted by West Ham . The 24-year-old Kouyate has forged a strong reputation for himself in Belgium with Arsenal having watched him in recent seasons too but Sam Allardyce has taken the initiative. Hertha Berlin are in talks over a move for former Fulham and Everton defender Johnny Heitinga. The 30-year-old is a free agent after leaving Craven Cottage last month and also has an offer from Besiktas. Another former Fulham player Steve Sidwell is weighing up interest from Stoke, Leicester and QPR ahead of making his next move. The 31-year-old is a free agent. Flying Dutchman: Herha Berlin are interested in former Everton and Fulham defender Johnny Heitinga . Meanwhile, Hertha striker Pierre-Michel Lasogga, who spent last season on loan at Hamburg, is still in talks over a possible move to England with Newcastle favourites for the 22-year-old. Torino want to take Gaston Ramirez back to Italy. The 23-year-old is eager to return to Serie A after joining Southampton from Bologna in 2012. He failed to hold down a regular place under Mauricio Pochettino and has been looking for a move in recent months. AC Milan showed some interest but they only want a loan with the club strapped for cash and that does not suit Southampton. Return policy: Gaston Ramirez could be on his way back to Italy, with Torino and AC Milan interested . Bayern Munich have expressed an interest in Manchester City's Aleksandar Kolarov. The 28-year-old has plenty of admirers with Roma and Juventus particularly keen. They want the Serbian to drop his wages to help facilitate a deal but the interesting new element is Bayern who are understood to have contacted Kolarov's brother to sound out the possibilities. Kolarov is in the last year of his contract and is willing to move to play more games. In demand: Aleksandar Kolarov has attracted interest from Bayern Munich, Roma and Juventus . City have targeted Bacary Sagna, have offers in for Mehdi Benatia and Eliaquim Mangala and hope to sign Fernando from Porto this week. A left back has not been a priority but they have considered Ashley Cole knowing Kolarov could go. The former England defender is a possible at Real Madrid should Fabio Coentrao leave while there is the option of joining City's New York franchise too. Manchester City will not countenance offers for Sergio Aguero. Speculation is gathering momentum in Spain as they anticipate bids from either Barcelona or Real Madrid for the Argentine. Sportsmail reported earlier this year that City had made efforts to ensure Aguero was well aware of how important he was to the club's future and that has not changed. Staying power: Manchester City will not entertain any offers from Barcelona or Real for Sergio Aguero . The only way anything will change is if the player says he is no longer content at the Etihad. City did have an interest in Cesc Fabregas a year ago but that has changed and they do not intend to look at any mooted Barcelona proposals of a swap involving Fabregas plus cash. Real Madrid present the greatest threat owing to location and their financial muscle but they are still contemplating a late offer for Luis Suarez too.","Paris Saint Germain are interested in luring Branislav Ivanovic to Ligue 1 .

"Liverpool have announced the signing of England striker Rickie Lambert from Southampton on a two-year contract for a fee in the region of £4million. The deal completes a remarkable comeback for the Scouser, 32, who was a part of the club's academy set-up for five years before being released as a 15-year-old in 1997. Lambert then spent 13 years in Leagues One and Two with Blackpool, Macclesfield, Stockport, Bristol Rovers and Southampton before consecutive promotions with the latter brought him to the Barclays Premier League for the first time at the age of 30. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rickie Lambert gives first interview as a Liverpool player . Homecoming: Lambert holds up a Liverpool scarf with pride at their Melwood training ground . Medical: The England man is examined by the club's staff at the weekend . Pen to paper: Lambert signs his contract at Melwood before flying out to Brazil with England . 'I can't believe it,' Lambert told the club's official website. 'I've loved this club all my life. I left here 17 years ago - and I haven't stopped loving it since. 'I have always dreamt of playing for Liverpool, but I did kind of think the chance of playing for them had gone. I didn't think the chance would come. 'I know how big Liverpool are - and it means everything to me - but I know what is important; I know it's what I do on the pitch and the minutes I play. I know that's what matters, and that's what I'll be focused on.' Lambert's arrival at Anfield came as a surprise, especially considering manager Brendan Rodgers had previously off-loaded Andy Carroll, who is also considered to be a target man, early on in his tenure. However, the Liverpool boss believes Lambert is a different kind of player and is confident he can fit in to the system while also providing another option if required. International duty: Lambert (right) heads to England's team plan on Sunday before flying out to Miami . 'I've seen Rickie Lambert over the years and he's one of those players that probably never got the recognition for what a really good footballer he is,' Rodgers said. 'It's only late on in his career - at 29, 30, 31 - that people are really starting to focus on his qualities. 'He was probably seen as the traditional big No 9, a British striker that is good in the air. 'But he's one of the most accomplished footballers I've seen. 'It has been so refreshing that he's got his call into the England team, and he certainly hasn't let anyone down - he has been outstanding. Formalities: Lambert revealed that his medical had gone well on Sunday . Will Lambert be a success at Liverpool? Will Lambert be a success at Liverpool? Now share your opinion . 'Look at his touch, look at the level of his goals, the different types of goals he has scored over his career, and he's a specialist on penalties as well. 'I think he is a terrific footballer and any team he plays against, he's always a handful.' The initial rejection by Liverpool hit Lambert hard, as he admitted earlier in the season: ‘I was at Liverpool from age 10 to 15 and I was basically told I wasn’t good enough, which obviously was a hard thing to take at the time. 'I thought it was the end of the world. But I can tell people in the same situation that it is not the end of the world. It should drive you on to succeed even more.' Trophy life: Rickie Lambert, aged nine with plenty of silverware at Millbrook Primary School in Kirby . Academy awards: Rickie Lambert with trophies when he was at Liverpool as an 11-year-old . Lambert goes with the blessing of Southampton, whose chairman Ralph Krueger said: 'On behalf of the club, I would like to thank Rickie. He served with distinction and helped to take Saints from League One to the Premier League. 'Rickie has been a shining light in Saints’ growth and will forever remain an icon in the history of the club. He leaves with the best wishes of everyone at Southampton and will always be welcome back at St Mary’s.' Southampton legend Matt Le Tissier added on Twitter: 'Good luck and thanks for a great 5 years Rickie Lambert.' And Robbie Fowler, who knows a thing or two about scoring goals for Liverpool, posted: 'Welcome home Rickie...' After his departure was confirmed, Lambert penned an open letter to Southampton. He said: 'Thank you to all the staff involved in making me the player I am today. Without your knowledge and commitment I would not be here right now at a World Cup with England.' Lambert added: 'When I grew up there was . only one club I loved. I can honestly say now I have two clubs which . will always be in my heart and that is thanks to the Saints fans. Saints legend: Lambert has been a crucial figure in Southampton's rise from the abyss . Tribute: Southampton posted this homage to Lambert on their official Twitter account . 'The people who support this club have been nothing short of amazing towards me and, when I look back in years to come, it will be the relationship I had with the fans here which will stand out the most. 'Southampton have allowed me to realise a lifelong ambition by joining Liverpool FC and taking my family home. The five-year plan when I arrived was to get this club from League One to the top half of the Premier League. Against all the odds we have achieved that.' Lambert is currently in Miami with England's World Cup squad, alongside his new Liverpool team-mates Steven Gerrard, Jordan Henderson, Glen Johnson, Daniel Sturridge, Raheem Sterling and standby defender Jon Flanagan. Southampton duo Luke Shaw and Adam Lallana are also in the squad.

"Regret is etched across Samir Nasri’s face when talk turns to last season’s Champions League defeat against Barcelona. It still rankles. Not only the result, not only Martin Demichelis’s decisive red card in the first leg, but also Manchester City’s approach. ‘Were we naive against Barca? Yes, we were,’ says the Frenchman. ‘It’s still difficult to talk about. We were flying before the Barca matches, but then we had three or four starters who had injuries and it wasn’t the same. Samir Nasri spoke of his regret as a press conference on Monday whilst reflecting on last year's campaign . Samir Nasri and Wilfried Bony enjoy Manchester City training ahead of facing Barcelona on Tuesday night . Wilfried Bony (left), Samir Nasri (centre) and Bacary Sagna (right) are put through their paces in training . ‘I just think last year was a little bit too much for the whole club. Manchester City had never played in the last 16 of the Champions League before, so it was too much pressure, too big a game. ‘Against a team like Barca you cannot make the kind of mistakes we did. You have to play your game. We let them play and we didn’t play our own game. ‘Usually we have possession of the ball but against Barca we didn’t, we just defended. We are not a team who knows how to just defend.’ French midfielder Samir Nasri will hope to continue his fine recent form for Manchester City on Tuesday . Martin Demichelis is sent off during the 2-0 home defeat to Barcelona in the 2014 Champions League last 16 . Nasri, alongside manager Manuel Pellegrini, is optimistic the side can topple Barcelona this season . Fast forward 12 months and Nasri believes he will not be haunted by the same regrets after the clubs’ Champions League sequel. Nasri’s face is now wide-eyed with optimism. He feels Barca are beatable this time. He has spotted chinks in their armour. He knows exactly how the two-legged tie needs to play out for City to make a statement that reverberates across Europe. ‘I watched both Paris Saint-Germain versus Barcelona matches in the Champions League this season and I think there’s things we can do,’ he said. They still have great players, but Dani Alves is not the Dani Alves of four or five years ago. We can hurt their defence. The Manchester City squad jog during their warm-up in training on Monday in Manchester . The Manchester City squad trained hard ahead of their Champions League clash with Barcelona . Nasri claims Barcelona are not the team they were, picking out Dani Alves (centre) in his press conference . ‘I just hope we can keep a clean sheet in the first leg and then we will have a good chance to qualify. ‘We conceded two goals at home last year, so it was too hard for us to go to the Nou Camp and qualify.’ Nasri can expect to play a pivotal role for Manuel Pellegrini on Tuesday night . For he is one of the Chilean’s key midfield creators. The Frenchman’s superb goal in the 2-0 win at Roma that clinched qualification to the knockout stages in December is testament to that. And in Pellegrini, Nasri has a manager he says he has bonded with. Contrast that with his difficult relationship with Pellegrini’s predecessor Roberto Mancini. The Italian spent the summer of 2011 trying to persuade Nasri to leave Arsenal for the Etihad, only for their relationship to deteriorate. Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri (left) shares a joke with manager Manuel Pellegrini on Monday . ‘Pellegrini gave me back the joy of playing football,’ says Nasri. ‘He is like Arsene Wenger. Someone who likes to joke, someone who likes to talk and take an interest in your life. ‘I love to have this kind of relationship with a manager, when it’s not just about football.’ Similarly, there is no love lost between Nasri and France manager Didier Deschamps. A breakdown in relations between the pair resulted in the City forward missing out on a World Cup place last summer. Nine months on, does the 27-year-old wish the situation had been handled differently? Absolutely not. Nasri has scored in his last two matches to help keep up the pressure on Premier League leaders Chelsea . ‘Apart from the World Cup, for me club football is bigger,’ he said. ‘The World Cup is the World Cup and I’m sad I won’t play in it, that’s my only regret. But to play a friendly with my national team, I did it many times so it’s not something I’m missing. ‘I suffered more when I was happy with France. I live in England and I don’t really notice what they say about me, but my family will suffer and I don’t want this.’ Nasri will be hoping even more he does not suffer at the hands of Messi & Co again.

"Former Scotland, Everton and Chelsea footballer Pat Nevin has put a new spin on his colourful career after becoming a sought after club DJ. The BBC football pundit is back  for a fourth stint at the Moustache Bar in Stoke Newington this weekend where revellers can expect to hear tunes from 'the likes of The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, Camera Obscura, The Fall, Belle and Sebastian and New Order,' according to the event's Facebook page. Nevin is also a surprise name in the line-up for a retro festival headlined by the Happy Mondays and hosted by Butlins in November. Former Scotland international and BBC pundit Pat Nevin has been making noises as a club DJ . The 51-year-old is set to play in Stoke Newington on Thursday and a retro festival in November . The former Blues cult hero landed the Shiiine On gig after impressing bosses with musical taste and skills behind the decks on a previous visit to the venue. 'People know me for football but I've been on the decks for more than 30 years — music has always been my main passion. I've played other gigs at that venue before, so they asked me to get involved,' he told The Sun. Nevin played for Everton (left) and Chelsea (right), but admits indie kids don't know he was a footballer . British band New Order, famed for their 1990 World Cup song, are among Nevin's playlist favourites . The 51-year-old first took to the turntables during the 1980s London clubbing scene after being inspired by friend and former radio DJ John Peel. He added: 'Most of them are indie kids so they probably don't know I am. 'I've played the same venues for ages so they don't care that I was a footballer.'","Former Scotland international Pat Nevin played for clubs including Everton and Chelsea during his career .

Make an effort with the  in-laws. Aunt Betty might drive you crazy, but getting along will make your partner feel at ease.
Offer to help. If you see your partner is stressed, suggest you take on some more tasks. Be proactive.
Accept that Christmas  and relationships are never perfect. Lower your expectations and accept  that most of the time, it’s  the effort that counts.
Say I love you. It helps.
Start a deep debate when you have been drinking. It  will only lead to tears and unnecessary arguments.
Bring up past problems. Regurgitating previous relationship issues is likely  to taint memories of the entire festive period.
Complain about how much everything costs. Christmas  is expensive but it creates lasting happy memories, so spoil yourselves a bit.
Forget that human contact can say everything, whether holding hands or cuddling on the sofa. Touching is crucial.
Forget to spend quality time together, especially when your house is full of relatives. Let relatives look after the kids while you and your partner go for a walk.
Let issues build up. If you are feeling neglected, ask your partner for a hug  and calmly explain how you feel. Don’t blow up in a tantrum or sulk."
"Burnley boss Sean Dyche has jumped to the defence of Ashley Barnes following an outspoken attack on the striker by Chelsea counterpart Jose Mourinho. Following the heated 1-1 draw between the sides at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, Mourinho accused Barnes of making a 'criminal' tackle on Nemanja Matic which saw the Clarets man escape punishment and the Blues midfielder sent off for retaliating. A furious Mourinho had described Barnes' challenge on Matic, when he followed through after making a pass to connect with his shin, as potentially career-ending and said the ex-Brighton man had 'a grey past'. Sean Dyche defended his striker Ashley Barnes, insisting the Burnley man had got the ball in the challenge . This studs-up tackle from Barnes infuriated Matic and Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho backed up his player . As Matic lies on the ground, none of the Chelsea players react angrily, as they prepare to defend a throw-in . With Matic about to react, Branislav Ivanovic is appealing for a throw, while John Terry is walking away . As Matic charges towards Barnes, Jose Mourinho stands passively on the touchline, unmoved by the tackle . Mourinho stands, hands in pockets but calm, after Matic is shown the red card for his reaction . He also hit out at Barnes for an apparent kick on Branislav Ivanovic as the pair challenged for a high ball. But in a 10-minute video analysis, Dyche has questioned Mourinho's take on the incidents. With regards to the coming together with Matic, Dyche said: 'On slow mo(tion) of course it looks ugly but there was contact with the ball (from Barnes). I would suggest once you are in that pendulum motion to play a pass it is very difficult to then retract your leg immediately and stop your leg from going through that ball and rising. 'I must make it clear when you see it in slow mo it does not look pleasant,' he added. Nemanja Matic (centre) was sent off after reacting to a challenge from Burnley's Ashley Barnes on Saturday . Dyche makes a point during the ten minute analysis of Martin Atkinson's performance last weekend . 'I find it hard to believe, however, that all these people - especially the manager - using very strong phrases didn't have any reaction at all at that live moment. I find that a hard one to accept. We can all use slow mo, things often look different.' The Burnley boss pointed out that, at the time, none of the Chelsea players, except for Matic, reacted to the challenge. Videos show John Terry turning away from the incident, Branislav Ivanovic appealing for a throw-in, while Jose Mourinho stands calmly on the touchline. 'The likes of John Terry, a real warrior and a top class professional in my opinion, Zouma, big strong boys, Ivanovic, right on top of this moment. 'Jose Mourinho, similar view to me, the crowd behind me, circa 15,000 fans. No one reacts. Apart from Matic.' Mourinho also said Barnes should not have been on the field following the aerial challenge with Ivanovic in which he appeared to lead with his feet. Dyche criticised Mourinho, who he claims didn't react to the tackle at the time, before becoming angry later . Nemanja Matic reacts angrily after being sent off for his reaction to a tough challenge from Ashley Barnes . Jose Mourinho described the tackle as 'criminal' during his appearance on Goals on Sunday on Sky Sports . 'They felt that player should not be on the field of play,' said Dyche. 'It looks like's he's running across to make a challenge. I can't imagine it to be deemed anything more than at most a yellow card. Worst case scenario would be a yellow card - almost impossible to be a red card.' Barnes will not be given any retrospective punishment for the clash with Matic as the referee was deemed to have seen the offence. 'This can be end of career, Matic is a very lucky guy,' Mourinho had said. 'I can't find the word to describe what that player [Barnes] did. The Chelsea manager felt the tackle could have broken his player's leg, and has appealed the red card . Martin Atkinson shows the red card to Matic after the Serbian pushed Barnes over in retaliation to the tackle . 'I can clearly understand that football is about emotions and sometimes you lose emotions. Clearly Matic had a reason to lose his emotions. 'What could be the consequence of his push for the other player? Nothing. The consequence for Matic could be end of career. If you call Diego Costa's actions against Liverpool a crime, the minimum you have to say is this is a criminal tackle.' In a colourful yet controlled rant on Sky's Goals on Sunday, Mourinho added: 'This Burnley player involved in two actions has a grey past. There was a very dark point in his career when he was at Brighton and suspended for seven matches, because of a big incident with a referee.' 30 - Ashley Barnes sends Branislav Ivanovic crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back. Ivanovic rolls over twice before leaping up in anger when he realises no action is being taken. Dyche's Verdict: 'I can't imagine it to be deemed anything more than at most a yellow card. Worst case scenario would be a yellow card - almost impossible to be a red card.' Barnes catches Branislav Ivanovic with his right boot during an aerial challenge in the 30th minute . 33 - Ivanovic fires a shot at goal but Michael Kightly diverts it with an outstretched arm, as he turns his back to goal. Martin Atkinson waves play on. Dyche's Verdict: 'The thing that wasn't picked up is that it actually hits him on his thigh first. It cannons off his thigh onto his arm. That being said usually you would expect that to be given.' Ivanovic fires a shot at goal but his effort was blocked by the raised arms of Michael Kightly . 43 - Diego Costa tumbles to the ground after Burnley captain Jason Shackell leans into him with an oustretched arm. Atkinson waves play on. Dyche's Verdict: 'I think that's one where you're damned if you do, damned if you don't as a referee. He cuts in, Jason Shackell definitely gets a mild hand on him. Is that enough for him to go down? It's a real debate point. I think it's a close one. If it goes against you, you can understand it, if it goes with you, you can understand it.' Diego Costa vents his frustration after being shoved inside the box by Jason Shackell . 69 - Barnes misses the ball and almost snaps Nemanja Matic's left shin with his studs but Atkinson waves play on. An enraged Matic leaps up and pushes Barnes over violently. Atkinson sends off Matic and books Ivanovic for trying to take red card out of his hand. Dyche's Verdict: 'My instant impression was of a coming together at an unusual angle. In live time, no-one reacts. 'After the event when you've had slow-mo, every angle, change, it looks an ugly challenge, but the ball is still made contact with. The motion of the player is at high speed. 'When you see it, after the event, of course it doesn't look a pleasant challenge. BUt at live speed, these are expert people who have been in the game a long time, don't react, don't even flinch at that moment.

"The influx of migrants from Eastern Europe has fuelled a huge rise in the number of schoolchildren who do not speak English as a first language. In five years between 2008 and 2013 the number of Eastern European pupils who don’t speak English at home almost tripled from just over 44,000 to more than 123,000. Astonishingly, one in nine English schools now has a majority of pupils who do not speak English as a first language. The official figures lay bare the enormous strain mass migration has placed on our schools. Top 10 languages poll . The number of pupils who speak Romanian as a first language has seen the steepest increase – rising 527 per cent in five years. The number using Bulgarian at home has risen by 255 per cent. However, the Education Department figures – obtained by the Daily Mail under Freedom of Information laws – only cover the five years before labour market restrictions on both countries were lifted last month, meaning the trend looks set to continue. Schools are already struggling to cope with the demand for places, with some having to teach pupils in temporary classrooms. Official estimates suggest that more than one million extra places will be needed in Britain over the next decade, which will bring the total required to eight million by 2022, the highest for 40 years. The Government is already having to spend £5billion by 2015 on increasing the number of places to help ease the crisis. Official estimates suggest that more than one million extra school places will be needed in Britain over the next decade . Schools are already struggling to cope with the demand for places, with some having to teach pupils in temporary classrooms . Concerns have also been raised about the impact of the rising numbers on other services, including the NHS and social housing. Educating children who do not speak English as their mother tongue also puts a huge financial strain on schools. The cost of educating a non-native speaker has been estimated at up to £30,000 a year, compared to around £5,000 for other pupils, because of the need for intensive classroom assistance. Anastasia De Waal, of think-tank Civitas, warned the strain on resources was damaging the education of both English children and those from recent migrant families. ‘In too many cases our schools are simply not set up to accommodate very high proportions of children who start school without fluent English,’ she said. ‘Those who lose out most in this scenario are these very pupils, as they don’t receive adequate opportunities to develop their English language skills and are therefore at risk of going through the education system at a significant disadvantage. In turn, in an environment where teachers are struggling to cope because they are not given the time and facilities they need to strengthen language, those pupils for whom English is their first language can also suffer educationally and by default be neglected.’ Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real English, said non-English speaking immigrant children ‘often bring an excellent work ethic to the classroom’. But he said: ‘It means a lot of teacher time has to be spent addressing language issues.’ The total number of pupils whose second language is English went up by a fifth to 1.1million between January 2008 and January 2013. Educating children who do not speak English as their mother tongue also puts a huge financial strain on schools . Nine of the ten fastest-growing foreign first languages are from Eastern Europe – the exception being the southern Indian language of Malayalam. The second highest increase in pupils with English as a second language was among Latvians, on 414 per cent, followed by Hungarians, with 359 per cent. In both cases exact numbers were not recorded initially as they were below 1,000 – suggesting the percentage increase could be even higher. Rising demand for school places has been caused by a growing birthrate, immigration and the fact that ever fewer middle-class families can afford private education. But as well as the number of families migrating to Britain, further pressure is created by the high birthrate among those families once they have moved, the Office for National Statistics has said. Romanian women on average have 2.93 children here compared to 1.25 at home. British women average 1.84 children. Employment figures on Wednesday showed the number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in the UK rose by 40 per cent last year to 144,000. Last year five primary schools were identified as not having a  single pupil whose mother tongue is English. There were also 240 schools where at least 90 per cent of children grew up learning another language. The number of languages and dialects spoken in primary and secondary schools is now 309, ranging from Afrikaans and Amharic, from Ethiopia, to Shqip, from Albania and Kosovo, and Zulu.","Between 2008 and 2013 the number of Eastern European pupils almost tripled from 44,000 to 123,000 .

"Ahead of Barcelona's titanic tussle with Manchester City in the Champions League on Tuesday night, we look back at seven classic encounters between the Spanish giants and English teams. Leeds 2-1 Barcelona (Apr 1975) Fifty-thousand crammed into Elland Road to see the world’s most expensive player Johan Cruyff in action in the European Cup semi-final first leg. However, goals from Billy Bremner and Allan Clarke gave Leeds a lead to take to the Nou Camp, where a 1-1 draw saw them into the final. Aston Villa 2-2 Barcelona (Mar 1978) Cruyff and Rafael Zuviria gave Barcelona a 2-0 lead at Villa Park in the UEFA Cup quarter-final first leg, but Villa refused to give up and Ken McNaught and John Deehan struck to salvage an impressive draw. Barcelona won the second leg 2-1. Newcastle 3-2 Barcelona (Sep 1997) Newcastle had a commanding lead over Louis van Gaal’s Super Cup holders within 50 minutes of their Champions League group match, thanks to a stunning hat-trick from Faustino Asprilla. Despite late goals from Luis Enrique and Luis Figo, the visitors slumped to a shock defeat. Newcastle midfielder David Batty slides in to tackle Barcelona's Giovanni Silva . Manchester Utd 3-3 Barcelona (Sep 1998) En route to their first Champions League title, Manchester United faced holders Barcelona in the group stage and quickly went 2-0 up through Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes. Barca fought back but a magnificent David Beckham free-kick made it 3-2, before Figo equalised from the spot. Manchester United midfielder David Beckham shoots past Barcelona's Michael Reiziger . Chelsea 1-1 Barcelona (May 2009) The performance of referee Tom Henning Ovrebo soured this Champions League semi-final second leg, which saw Andres Iniesta’s late leveller send Barcelona through after Michael Essien had put Chelsea in front with a stunning volley. Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack screams at referee Tom Henning Ovrebo . Arsenal 2-2 Barcelona (Mar 2010) With Cesc Fabregas’ proposed move to Barca rumbling on in the background, tension was high between the clubs. Zlatan Ibrahimovic punished Arsenal’s backline twice in 13 minutes, but Theo Walcott turned the match. He scored and won a penalty, which Fabregas smashed home. Barcelona midfielder Xavi Hernandez holds off Arsenal duo Cesc Fabregas (left) and Denilson . Manchester Utd 1-3 Barcelona (May 2011) Wembley hosted a repeat of the 2009 Champions League final, but United failed to make home advantage count.

"It’s about . time we all started giving Harry Redknapp the credit he truly deserves. His reputation remains well and truly intact as one of the best . managers England has never had. Let’s not underestimate the job he has . done at Queens Park Rangers. A bunch of high-earning, under-performing players - a squad rotten to the core - has been shaken up and transformed into Wembley winners in a short space of time. It reminds me of the incredible job Redknapp did at Spurs – taking them from the relegation zone to the quarter-finals of the Champions League in a flash. Credit where it's due: Harry Redknapp won promotion to the Premier League with Queens Park Rangers . Huge difference: The former Tottenham boss has transformed the dressing room atmosphere at Loftus Road . Thump! Bobby Zamora scored a late winner to sink Derby County in the play-off final at Wembley on Saturday . When he took over, Ryan Nelsen - a . senior player Redknapp considered the best at the club - came to him . saying he was leaving, and telling the boss he had ‘no chance’ with the . QPR squad because it was ‘the worst dressing room’ he had ever . witnessed. Eighteen months ago QPR had a player who chose to pay a fine of two weeks' wages - £130,000 – rather than sit on the bench for a Premier League game. In January 2012 Redknapp’s chairman signed a player for a huge transfer fee, put him on £100,000 a week, only for the manager to then find out he wasn’t fit and was ‘mentally fragile’. Just over a year ago Redknapp had reason to believe an agent fed a ‘story’ to a newspaper to whip up more trouble in the QPR camp. At the start of this season Joey Barton told his Twitter followers he would not be playing for QPR in the Championship. Somehow Redknapp turned this belligerent hate figure into a dedicated professional and a crucial part of their promotion picture. The critics tried to pin the blame for the huge Rangers wage bill on Redknapp, when clearly most of the players had been signed under different management. The Harry-haters laughed as Rangers flopped, and seized on their golden nuggets like: ‘QPR’s wage bill is bigger than Atletico Madrid’s.’ Redknapp didn’t sanction the wages – almost all the high-earners arrived before he did. And those on big money were awful flops who refused to perform and refused to move away from Loftus Road. That criticism of Harry smacks of desperation, and yet I can’t quite work out why people seem to be so anxious for Redknapp to fail. His teams try to play decent football, and at Bournemouth, Portsmouth and Spurs he achieved unprecedented success in the modern era. After a succession of players and agents were allowed to strip QPR of its money and its dignity,  Redknapp has restored pride in this terrific football club. Redknapp . arrived to find a dressing room full of bad players with bad attitudes . on big money. That situation requires strong and clever management. The . fact that QPR now find themselves back in the Premier League tells you . Harry not only got the stinking, sinking ship cleaned out and floating . in calmer waters again, he’s also steered it in the right direction. If you’re not prepared to give Harry Redknapp credit for that then your dislike of him is personal, and a little bit strange. What's the smirk for? Jose Bosingwa was the epitome of everything that was wrong at QPR last season .","Former Tottenham boss inherited high-earning squad .

"It must require nerves of steel to drive a £1.6million one-off porcelain supercar through Paris’ notoriously congested streets, let alone parallel park it. The super-wealthy owner of this astonishing Veyron L'Or Blanc - or White Gold - must have breathed a sigh of relief when it arrived at the hotel unscathed. This unique edition of the 253mph, 1,000bhp car - created in conjunction with a firm that usually makes tea pots - had never been seen on the road in Europe. Exclusive: The 253mph car, which is the worlds first car to 'wear the finest porcelain on its body', arrived at the Plaza Athenee Hotel, and soon drew a crowd of onlookers . High-octane: With a price tag of £1.6, and with a porcelain body, it takes calm nerves to parallel park the Veyron in Paris' narrow streets . And when rumours started circling it had popped up in Paris, the 'car-parazzi' packed their . tripods before heading for France. Fans from England, France, Holland and . Germany quickly arrived at the Plaza Athenee Hotel where they found the . world's first car to ‘wear the finest porcelain on its body’. Tim Burton, 24, drove down from London after hearing the rumours. He said: ‘I heard the one-off Veyron . had been seen in Paris and I couldn't miss the opportunity to head to . France and see it with my own eyes. ‘Fortunately it was parked out on the road and what an amazing car it truly is.’ One-off: The astonishing porcelain Bugatti Veyron L'Or Blanc was made last year but it has never been seen on the road in Europe until now . Drawing a crowd: Fans from England, France, Holland and Germany quickly arrived at the Plaza Athenee Hotel where they found the world's first car to 'wear the finest porcelain on its body' He was joined by a group who travelled . from Dusseldorf, Germany while Dutchman Seger Giesbers, 18, said there . were ‘at least’ 15 photographers at the scene when he arrived. The £1.6 million L'or Blanc edition of the Veyron Super Sport model was . built by Bugatti with help from a German ceramics company better . known for making high-end tea sets. As well as its swirly porcelain white and blue paint work, its exterior features filler caps, badges and wheel caps made from specially constructed from the material. Bugatti's design experts came with the . psychedelic blue and white paintjob as a tribute to the 'Stelvio Pass', . a legendary stretch of road in Italy. The supercar firm even went as far as . describing the creation as an ‘unusual idea’, with the one-off vehicle . sold to a super-wealthy Saudi Arabian customer. It is powered by an 8-litre W16 engine . which develops a mammoth 1,000bhp. With this power it can accelerate . from 0-62mph in 2.5 seconds and reach a top speed of 253mph. Dr. Stefan Brungs, Director of Sales and Marketing at Bugatti Automobiles said at the time of the car's launch in, last year: 'At first, it seems to be an unusual idea to use porcelain in a car, especially in the world's fastest convertible. 'But this is what Bugatti stands for: the realization of exceptional ideas whilst striving for the utmost in quality and aesthetics. This allows us to continue Ettore Bugatti's heritage, who himself loved to experiment with new materials.' Glimpse: Rumours that the one-off Bugatti had popped up in Paris caused the 'car-parazzi' to flock from across Europe in the hope of a sighting .",The 253 mph car drew a crowd after being spotted outside a Parisian hotel during its first sighting in Europe .
"Islamic State militants are raking in money at a remarkable rate, earning about $1 million a day from black market oil sales alone, a Treasury Department official said on Thursday. David Cohen, who leads the department's effort to undermine the Islamic State's finances, said the extremists also get several million dollars a month from wealthy donors, extortion rackets and other criminal activities, such as robbing banks. In addition, he said the group has taken in at least $20 million in ransom payments this year from kidnappings. Scroll down for video . David Cohen, who leads the department's effort to undermine the Islamic State's finances, said the extremists also get several million dollars a month from wealthy donors, extortion rackets and other criminal activities, such as robbing banks . 'With the important exception of some state-sponsored terrorist organizations, ISIS is probably the best-funded terrorist organization we have confronted,' Cohen, undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a speech at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. 'It has amassed wealth at an unprecedented pace.' The group extracts oil from territory captured across Syria and Iraq, and sells it to smugglers. ISIS, led by Iraqi Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, wants to create a caliphate, or Islamic empire, in the Middle East. It initially tried to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad, but other groups, including al-Qaida central command, turned against ISIS because of its brutality. Unlike the core al-Qaida terrorist network, ISIS gets only a small share of funding from deep-pocket donors and therefore does not depend primarily on moving money across international borders. Captured oil field near Baghdad: ISIS is extracting oil from territory captured across Syria and Iraq, and then selling it to smugglers, said Cohen . Instead, it obtains the vast majority of its revenues through local criminal and terrorist activities, Cohen said. He acknowledged that the Treasury's tools are not particularly well-suited to combating extortion and local crime. 'They rob banks. They lay waste to thousands of years of civilization in Iraq and Syria by looting and selling antiquities,' he said. 'They steal livestock and crops from farmers. And despicably, they sell abducted girls and women as sex slaves.' In the Iraqi city of Mosul, Islamic State terrorists are reportedly going door to door and business to business, demanding cash at gunpoint, he said. 'A grocery store owner who refused to pay was warned with a bomb outside his shop. Others, who have not paid, have seen their relatives kidnapped. ISIS is receiving several million dollars a month from wealthy donors, extortion rackets and other criminal activities, such as robbing banks . 'We've also seen reports that when customers make cash withdrawals from local banks where ISIS operates, ISIS has demanded as much as 10 percent of the value,' Cohen said . But oil is the biggest money-maker. 'It is difficult to get precise revenue estimates... but we estimate that beginning in mid-June, ISIS has earned approximately $1 million a day from oil sales,' Cohen said. Other estimates have ranged as high as $3 million a day. The Treasury said ISIS is selling oil at substantially discounted prices to a variety of middlemen, including some from Turkey, who then transport the oil to be resold. 'It also appears that some of the oil emanating from territory where ISIS operates has been sold to Kurds in Iraq, and then resold into Turkey,' he said. White House press secretary Josh Earnest, right, introduces Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David Cohen to give a briefing about actions the Treasury Department is taking to combat financing for ISIS . Cohen said the Syrian government also has allegedly arranged to buy oil from ISIS. He noted that U.S-led airstrikes on the group's oil refineries are threatening the militants' supply networks, and that Turkey and the Kurdistan regional government - the official ruling body of the predominantly Kurdish region of northern Iraq - are working to prevent ISIS oil from crossing their borders. Cohen acknowledged, however, that ISIS moves oil in illicit networks outside the formal economy, making it harder to track. 'But at some point, that oil is acquired by someone who operates in the legitimate economy and who makes use of the financial system. He has a bank account. His business may be financed, his trucks may be insured, his facilities may be licensed,' he said. 'We not only can cut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze their assets, but we can also make it very difficult for them to find a bank anywhere that will touch their money or process their transactions.'","'ISIS is probably the best-funded terrorist organization we have confronted,' said David Cohen .

"It's a fashionable way to shed the pounds. But following the Paleo or caveman diet may have another even more important benefit. Researchers say it could slash the risk of bowel cancer by half. Followers of the diet shun processed foods – such as takeaways, packaged goods, bread and pasta. Instead they only eat foods which would have been available to our hunter-gatherer ancestors such as fruit, vegetables, nuts and lean meat. Scroll down for video . Former cricketer Andrew Flintoff has followed the 'caveman' diet which avoids modern-day staples such as bread, potatoes and pasta . England cricketer Andrew Flintoff and film stars Megan Fox and Matthew McConaughey are among those who lost weight on the diet. However, the latest research is the first to uncover a possible positive knock-on effect on bowel cancer, which kills 16,000 Britons a year. US researchers from Emory University, in Atlanta, studied the dietary habits of 2,301 men and women aged between 30 and 74. Participants were ranked according to how ‘Paleolithic’ their diet was. They were also tested for a Mediterranean eating pattern which allows for moderate consumption of milk, yoghurt, grains and alcohol. Then the dietary data was set against their medical records. In all, 564 developed a colorectal adenoma – a benign tumour which is a precursor to the disease. But for women with the most Paleolithic regime, the risk of developing the tumour fell by 29 per cent, and those who ate Mediterranean diets were 26 per cent less at risk. For men, these diets had an even greater effect, with the odds slashed by 51 and 42 per cent respectively. Actress Megan Fox has followed the diet, which encourages people to eat a wide range of fruit and vegetables . The study was published in the American Journal of Epidemiology. Scientists have claimed since the 1970s that our bodies are more attuned to a prehistoric diet. But the idea became fashionable following the publication of The Paleo Diet by US nutritionist Loren Cordain in 2010. Critics of eating this way say it doesn’t take account of how humans have evolved and may leave us undernourished. Nutritionist Dr Sarah Schenker said: ‘This study shows there’s a lot of value in the principles of the Paleolithic and Mediterranean diets. Ultimately, we live in the 21st century so it’s impossible for people to live like cavemen. ‘So instead of adhering strictly to any one diet, we should weave those good messages into our lifestyles. If, for 80 per cent of the time, you can buy fresh, unprocessed food and cook it from scratch, that’s the best a lot of people can manage.’ Sarah Williams, senior health information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: ‘We know that a balanced diet with lots of fibre, fruit and vegetables and less red and processed meat helps cut the risk of bowel cancer.’ The Paleo diet has similarities with the Atkins diet, known the world over for its strict approach to cutting carbs. The most important aspect of both programmes is to avoid modern everyday staples such as bread, potatoes, pasta and rice and instead fill up on lots of protein from meat, fish and eggs. But while the Paleo diet also encourages followers to eat a wide range of fresh fruit and vegetables, traditionally these are limited on Atkins. Atkins also embraces processed meat such as bacon and dairy products such as cheese and cream, which would never be found on the Paleo menu. However, Atkins has changed in recent years to incorporate more fruit and veg and less meat following concerns over the diet’s long-term health risks.","Researchers say following the diet could reduce risk of bowel cancer by half .

The following day, Sunday September 21, she will first attend an Independence Day Service at St John’s Cathedral and later view two Caravaggios in the Cathedral Museum – which will no doubt be of considerable interest to Kate given the 2:1 History of Art degree she obtained from St Andrew’s. Kensington Palace announced that Kate will stay at the Maltese President's official palace during the trip . Kate will have ten official events during the two-day visit for the Maltese independence celebrations next month . The Duchess will also visit the Agenzija Zghazagh or Agency for Youth, a government organisation which runs initiatives for young people. The Duchess will hear about the work of the agency from the young people who use the centre and their support workers. Members of the public will be able to catch a glimpse of the 32-year-old royal as she takes an afternoon walk through Vittoriosa Square on route to the Church of St Lawrence to view a Maltese art collection. She will also tread in the steps of numerous tourists before her as she takes a boat tour across the Grand Harbour to see the iconic views between Vittoriosa and Valletta. Kate has been on several solo Royal visits in Britain but this will be her first foreign trip on her own . Her final engagement of the trip will be the British High Commissioner’s Garden Party at their official residence, meeting a staff and notable local members of the community. It is understood that the Duchess has discussed the trip at length with the Queen – and will no doubt be asked to report back on her return. The Queen spent some of the happiest months of her life on Malta as a newly-wed. Although she and Prince Philip were accompanied to the island by a retinue which included an equerry, a valet, a lady-in-waiting, and the Princess's childhood nanny, as well as their ever-present police bodyguards, the newly-weds were pretty much free to come and go as they pleased. For the future Queen, this was simply unheard of. There were parties, picnics, swimming expeditions and boat trips. The young princess even went out shopping and on visits to the hairdressers with the other young officers' wives. Philip, meanwhile, discovered a life-long love of polo. ‘It was a fabulous time,’ he later recalled. Despite achieving independence after World War II, Malta has retained the Queen as head of state . The Queen and Prince Philip lived on Malta, pictured,  where Princess Anne was conceived late 1949 . The couple lived at Villa Guardamangia, an idyllic holiday home rented by Philip's uncle, Lord 'Dickie' Mountbatten. During her stay in Malta the Queen left her first child, Prince Charles, back at Buckingham Palace with his nanny and grand-parents, although she returned home for frequent visits. Her daughter, Princess Anne, was conceived on the island, and although she went back to England for her birth in August 1950, the Queen returned to Malta several times afterwards. In July 1951, she and Philip were forced to move back to Britain for good, however, when her father, George V1, fell seriously ill - bringing an end to one of the most carefree periods of her life. The Queen and her husband lasted visited Malta in 2007, to mark her diamond wedding anniversary. In a statement, Kensington Palace said: ‘Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge will visit Malta on 20th and 21st September 2014 to represent Her Majesty The Queen on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Malta's independence.’ Malta voluntarily became part of the British Empire in 1800 but achieved self-rule after the Second World War. Following a constitutional referendum in 1964, the island became an independent state retaining the Queen as its Head of State.","Kate will travel to Malta next month for the island's independence day event .

"Nick Clegg ignored warnings his flagship free school meals plan would be so expensive that spending cuts on ‘teaching and learning’ could be required, emails revealed yesterday. The Deputy Prime Minister railroaded through a controversial pledge to give free meals to all infant school pupils in the face of opposition from Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove. The Liberal Democrat leader always claimed the scheme was fully funded. But leaked emails show that officials knew that this was ‘not true’. Big spender: Nick Clegg ignored warnings his flagship free school meals plan would be so expensive that spending cuts on 'teaching and learning' could be required, emails revealed yesterday . The revelations prompted a former aide to Mr Gove to accuse Mr Clegg of ‘lying’ to cover up the ‘abuse of taxpayers’ money’. The correspondence was revealed yesterday after being leaked to Radio 4’s World At One programme. When the Daily Mail and other media tried to access the emails via a Freedom of Information request, the request was blocked on the grounds of cost, apparently after the direct intervention of Lib Dem education minister David Laws. According to the leaked documents, a letter was sent by Mr Gove to Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, on November 29 last year, saying the policy would cost more than £1.1billion over two years. ‘I am sure that you will agree with me that we must not risk forcing schools to subsidise meals by reducing their spending on teaching and learning,’ he wrote. ‘I would be grateful for your assurance that my budget will be increased to fully cover the cost of this new commitment, as I am unable to fill any shortfall from within my existing budget.’ A week later, Mr Clegg made an announcement that an extra £150million had been found to fund free school meals, part of which came from unspent Department for Education maintenance funds. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, pictured, railroaded through a controversial pledge to give free meals to all infant school pupils . An email was sent from a senior civil servant at the DfE to the offices of Mr Clegg, Mr Laws and Chancellor George Osborne that morning, pointing out that the statement was wrong, and warned scarce resources may have to be diverted away from the maintenance of buildings and ensuring there are enough school places. It read: ‘First, the £150million is less than the £200million we believe will actually be required to deliver this policy. ‘Second, more importantly, the gap between the Deputy Prime Minister’s figure and the Treasury funding will require our Secretary of State to divert money from providing school places to meet basic need or from meeting urgent maintenance needs in schools. ‘Both these scenarios are wholly unacceptable to this Department and to our Secretary of State.’ A second email sent to civil servants in the Treasury said: ‘I am concerned that there is a risk that the Deputy Prime Minister and others are about to make public statements that suggest that the additional £80million for free school meals capital can be found from within the Department’s budget without an impact on other education capital budgets. ‘Firstly, because this is not true, and secondly, because it will be relatively easy for people outside the Department to see that it is not true.’ Dominic Cummings, Mr Gove’s former special adviser, told the BBC: ‘Clegg has been lying about the announcement from the start to cover up the abuse of taxpayers’ money for his personal ends. Gove was trying to safeguard taxpayers’ money but Clegg ignored him.’ Lib Dem deputy leader Sir Malcolm Bruce accused ‘disgruntled’ Tories opposed to the policy of deliberately leaking the information. According to leaked documents, a letter was sent by Michael Gove, left, to Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, right, last year, saying the policy would cost more than £1.1billion over two years . Referring to Mr Gove he said: ‘I think it would do him some good if he actually put a bit of a constraint on some of the ideologues who are trying to undermine it and acknowledge that he has signed off this policy and fully supports it.’ Mr Laws said: ‘The funding package announced in December was agreed across government and the full amount of estimated revenue cost was transferred to the DfE from the Treasury so that schools would not have to pay for free meals from their teaching budgets. ‘We also secured a capital settlement which does not involve any reductions in capital maintenance or basic need budgets.’","Deputy Prime Minister railroaded through controversial free meals pledge .

"The Coalition has been branded a ‘zombie . government’ after it emerged MPs will take a 19-day break because there . are not enough new laws to debate. The Commons is set to break up early for the Queen’s Speech because there are not enough issues to debate. With David Cameron and Nick Cleg’s parties at loggerheads on several fronts, MPs are preparing to pack their bags on Thursday and not return until the Queen’s Speech on June 4. The Commons is expected to break up on Thursday, a week earlier than expected, because MPs have run out of laws and issues to debate . Ministers have been stung by the idea they have run out of policies to debate, with Commons Leader Andrew Lansley branding the idea a ‘fantasy’. The House of Commons was due to sit until May 22, the day of the European and local elections. But MPs are likely to be given an extra week off, because there is no more legislation to debate ahead of the prorogation for the Queen’s Speech. It will fuel suggestions that the Queen’s Speech itself will contain little in the way of major new laws, because the two coalition parties cannot agree on their final legislation programme before the general election. Labour has repeatedly accused the government of running out of ideas, and the latest break will only add to the impression. Shadow Commons leader Angela Eagle said: ‘We are likely to rise a week early showing that this is a government that hasn't only run out of ideas, it's run out of steam.’ Jon Ashworth MP, Labour’s shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: 'This is just the latest example of David Cameron's zombie government that simply staggers on despite the fact that Ministers have run out of ideas and have nothing left to say. 'We need positive measures to deal with the cost-of-living crisis which the Tories and the Lib Dems cannot provide. Only Labour has answers.' It means MPs will not be back in Westminster until June 4, when the Queen will announce the last package of laws before the general election next year . Embarrassingly MPs have only been back in Westminster for eight days since they returned from a 17-day Easter recess. They also had nine days off in mid-February for a half term break, which came only four and a half weeks after their Christmas break which last from December 19 to January 6. In a debate last week Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn said the government is ‘obviously grappling with how to fill up the hours of the day and the days of the week’. He called for the spare time to be used to allow backbench MPs to pass their own laws. Leader of the Commons Andrew Lansley dismissed the idea the coalition has run out of ideas as a 'fantasy' ‘In that way, Parliament could become a real debating Chamber, enabling us to debate the issues that affect ordinary Members of this House rather than being sent into yet another recess because the Government have run out of business.’ Shadow welfare minister Chris Bryant also raised fears that if Parliament is prorogued early it cannot be recalled to debate emergencies. He said: ‘It will be impossible for this House to be summoned, even if the Prime Minister wants it, even if the Leader of the House wants it, even if 649 Members of this House write to the Speaker and demand it, even if the Clerk of the House wants it. ‘We will not be able to sit for three weeks, and during that time, first, there will be elections in Ukraine, which could well be an important flashpoint for NATO troops, let alone anybody else; and, secondly, the Prime Minister will have to decide who will be the British Commissioner, and how Britain will vote on replacements for Mr Van Rompuy and for the President of the European Commission. ‘Would it not be better if we did not prorogue until the day before the Queen’s Speech, so that it was available for us to summon the House if necessary, to hold the Government to account?’ Mr Lansley insisted no final decision has been made. ‘We have no intention of proroguing unless and until all the business that requires to be transacted in this Session has been completed,’ he told MPs. However, when he set out fortchoming business for the Commons he gave no details beyond this Thursday. Tuesday 13 May—If necessary, consideration of Lords amendments, followed by remaining stages of the Consumer Rights Bill. The agenda for this week is hardly packed. At 2.30pm on Monday they will put questions to defence ministers before considering Lords amendments to a Care Bill and the last stages of the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill. On Tuesday Nick Clegg will face Deputy PM's questions, before a debate on all-party parliamentary groups and any other amendments to laws proposed by the House of Lords. Wednesday will see the last Prime Minister's Questions of the session, and debates on the Deregulation Bill and more consideration of Lords amendments. And on Thursday itself there is only questions to Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and 'If necessary, consideration of Lords amendments'.","Tories and Lib Dems order break because they have nothing to debate .

"Violent tackles by Burnley’s Ashley Barnes, a lack of protection for Eden Hazard and Jose Mourinho and Chelsea at war with the world. Southampton too had reason to complain after numerous penalty appeals were rejected (although they did it a little more quietly) and so referees are again back in the spotlight. Sportsmail’s panel of experts, Jamie Redknapp, Martin Keown and former top referee Graham Poll, got together to discuss the fall-out. Head of Sport Lee Clayton asked the questions and listened in. Sportsmail trio Graham Poll (left), Jamie Redknapp (centre) and Martin Keown (right) have aired their views on the weekend's refereeing controversy . Q: Describe the current standard of refereeing in three words please, gents. Poll: Inconsistent, inaccurate, outdated. Keown: Not. Good. Enough. But I want to qualify that. Working as a co-commentator for the BBC, I understand their difficulty. I sometimes need two or three replays to see what has happened at high speed. Referees get one go. We should always try to remember that. What is most irritating, however, is when it happens right under their noses and they fail to see what is blindingly obvious. Redknapp: You asked for three words, didn’t you? Honest. Average. Difficult. Q. Do players and managers have to take their share of the blame too for causing this crisis? Poll: Of course! It’s players more than managers. Refereeing has never been harder. Players exaggerate or even simulate contact and go down so easily that you struggle to believe what you are seeing. The way they roll around as if injured to get opponents in trouble is embarrassing to watch. Look at Branislav Ivanovic on Saturday after he was fouled by Ashley Barnes. Managers are understandably frustrated at some of the very poor decisions this season but they should try and help rather than attack. Ashley Barnes (right) catches Branislav Ivanovic with his right boot during an aerial challenge . This studs-up tackle from Barnes (centre) infuriated Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic (right) Atkinson shows the red card to Matic after the Serbian midfielder retaliated to the tackle . Atkinson (right) cannot see the full extent of Barnes’ horror challenge as Matic is blocking his view . Keown: There certainly needs to be more honesty. Players have introduced confusion by diving, so is it a foul, or not? Also, I’m not buying this ‘agenda’ claim from Mourinho. His latest outburst is a contrived attempt at cranking up the pressure on officials. There is no campaign against him. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman had just as many reasons to be furious at the weekend, but he rises above it. Matic reacts angrily after being sent off for his reaction to a tough challenge from Barnes . Ivanovic fires a shot at goal but his effort was blocked by the raised arms of Michael Kightly . Former Arsenal defender Keown has praised Ronald Koeman for his conduct, despite a number of decisions going against his Southampton side at the weekend . Redknapp: Is there really a crisis? Yes, there is diving, but get used to it, it is here to stay. Referees have made mistakes this weekend, but it’s only because of the attention applied by Jose Mourinho that we are having this debate. Look, the game is so quick, the rewards are so high and everyone is looking to gain an advantage, but behaviour towards referees isn’t any worse than when I was playing. Ask Graham! Jose Mourinho (right) shouts at former referee Poll during a Premier League clash in May 2007 . Q: Eden Hazard is being kicked all over the place, so does Jose Mourinho have a point – are Chelsea being mistreated? Redknapp: Hazard is so quick, of course he will be tripped and draw fouls. They are trips, kicks. There is nothing malicious behind it. And Chelsea are not being mistreated. Come on! They are a team of men, they have every trick in the book themselves. Keown: My only concern with Hazard is this: Is he always being fouled, or is he buying the foul? He’s a brilliant footballer, I love it when he runs with the ball, but he is difficult to referee because he lightening quick. As for Chelsea… they are not mistreated, but they’ve had some poor calls. They can handle it. Eden Hazard was fouled a remarkable nine times during Chelsea's Champions League clash against PSG . Marco Verratti (left) goes in with studs showing on Hazard during the encounter at the Parc des Princes . Poll: Chelsea have not had the rub of the green, they’ve been unlucky. One could argue that Mourinho has brought this on himself with his constant bleating, but the main point must be that however the Chelsea manager behaves, referees must see each individual incident on its own merits and deal with it accordingly. As for Hazard, yes, he needs better protection (as does Diego Costa – to stop him taking the law into his own hands). They are outstanding footballers and we don’t want them kicked out of matches. Chelsea's Diego Costa reacts after not being awarded a penalty during Saturday's match against Burnley . Q: Do big clubs try to bully and influence referees in a game-management style? Is this new? Keown: The aggressive behaviour of players isn’t new, especially when they swarm around the referee. It’s unpalatable, but I remember George Graham once accusing us at Arsenal of ‘being too nice’ and to ‘get around the referee’ in a game against Manchester United. John Terry is the leader of the pack now. He runs faster towards a row involving the referee than he does in the rest of the game! He will argue his captain’s armband gives him the right to be there, but there is more to it than that. He leads the charge. John Terry (right) remonstrates with referee Martin Atkinson after the latter sent off Nemanja Matic . Redknapp: Sir Alex Ferguson demanded it of his teams too and then followed up by pursuing the referee down the tunnel. His Manchester United team were good at it, they won key decisions because of it. Mourinho is trying it now. Poll: Players will try to influence referees, they always have. Referees have to be strong and they mustn’t be influenced by it. Fergie was the past master at it and was better at it than anyone around at the moment. He had a fear factor that Mourinho does not have. Alex Ferguson (middle) had history of pursuing referees down the tunnel when he was a manager . Chelsea boss Mourinho speaking on Sky Sports' Goals on Sunday programme during the weekend . Q: What can be done to help officials? Poll: To solve any problem one must first accept that there is one. Select referees need better support, motivation and direction. Look at Atkinson on Saturday at Chelsea and you see a man fatigued. Just back from a trip to Germany where he focused on performing to get to France 2016 he looked tired and lethargic. After all it was ‘only Chelsea v Burnley’. He missed blatant offences which, if he were at his best, he would not have. Redknapp: A radical change would be a referee in each half, like two umpires in hockey. But, before that, we must allow retrospective punishment, even if the FA have to overrule the officials. How can Ashley Barnes get away with his tackles at Chelsea on Saturday? If the referee misreads it or misunderstands what he has seen, he must have the chance to rectify it, or else he looks stupid and football looks stupid. They need help, so please let’s help them. Keown: I agree with retrospective punishment, but they also need to help themselves. When a player has had a bad game, he goes straight on the training pitch and begins preparing for the next match and the chance to put it right. Referees can’t do that. I’d like to see the elite group refereeing midweek under-21 matches, which would give them the chance to restore confidence and also the opportunity to build relationships with the next generation of players. Poll believes Atkinson is fatigued and as a result is not at his best resulting in his recent below-par display . Q: Who are the three top referees in the country? Poll: Mark Clattenburg, Michael Oliver and Mike Dean . Keown: I don’t disagree with Clattenburg and Oliver, but I’m struggling to find any more. Lee Probert is a good referee and took charge of the FA Cup Final last season, but was then injured and it coming back via the Championship. It’s a damning indictment that there aren’t more. Redknapp: Michael Oliver is the best, no question. None of the others stand out – as I said to the first question, they are honest people, whose performances have been average this season and they have a difficult job. Let’s move on. Redknapp regards Michael Oliver as the best English referee in the business, bar none .","Sportsmail columnists Graham Poll, Martin Keown and Jamie Redknapp discuss the weekend's refereeing controversy .

"A father-of-one who was due to star in a new reality TV show set in Birmingham killed himself because he feared he was too short, an inquest has heard. Jonathan McNally, 27, a personal trainer, was due to appear in a Birmingham version of The Only Way Is Essex called The Project after auditioning for the show in May. However, just a few weeks later he hanged himself in a friend's back garden after a battle with depression sparked by issues over his height - despite the fact that he was 5ft 7in. Scroll down for video . Jonathan McNally, 27, was due to star in new reality TV show The Project after auditioning in May, but hanged himself just weeks later after a battle with depression sparked by issues over his height . Speaking after Mr McNally’s inquest on Tuesday, his sister Gina McNally said: 'He had issues with his height from a young age. 'All through school he was tiny and had tests which showed he was behind by about two years. He was depressed from a young age about it. But he eventually shot up and was around 5ft 7ins. 'Other things added to the way he felt. All this should have been picked up from when he was a child, but it never was.' Birmingham Coroner’s Court heard that Mr McNally, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, died six days after being found hanged on June 1. Coroner Louise Hunt recorded a verdict of suicide. At an inquest into his death, Mr McNally's family said his depression was sparked by issues over his height when he was a child, despite the fact that he eventually grew to be 5ft 7in (Mr McNally pictured left) Sisters Jamie, 32 (left), Gina, 23 (centre), and Leanne, 34 (right), believe Mr McNally did not intend to kill himself, and blame a lack of support from metal health services for his death . However, Mr McNally's family said they did not believe he had intended to take his own life and called for improvements in mental health services. Gina, aged 23 and from Sutton Coldfield, said her brother had been given tablets for his depression but more could have been done. She said: 'Jon had gone to the doctors but all he got were tablets. He heard voices in his head. 'He wasn’t offered any counselling and I don’t think enough was done to help him or take care of his mental health issues. There was a lack of support.' Mr McNally (left), a personal trainer, died six days after hanging himself in a friend's back garden on June 1 . Older sister Leanne Harper, 32, who also attended the inquest with brother Wayne, 36, and a third sister, 34-year-old Jamie, added: 'We don’t think he wanted to commit suicide. He was up and down over the years but did his best to cover it up.' Jamie thanked Mr McNally’s friend Kim Myles and her neighbour Amy Daniels, who both tried to keep him alive. Mr McNally's parents Micky, 49, and Lynn, 56, were too upset to attend the inquest but issued a joint statement saying: 'We forgive Jon for what he did. 'It takes a brave person to do what he did, not a coward. We love and miss him loads.'","Personal trainer Jonathan McNally hanged himself in a friend's garden .

"Stuart Lancaster has issued a reminder on the behaviour he expects from his England players as Steffon Armitage prepares to discover the ruling over his alleged assault charge. The judgement of a Toulon court is due on Tuesday with French prosecutors having recommended a suspended jail term of between five and six months. Armitage denies the charge that relates to his arrest alongside teammate Xavier Chiocci in January following an incident involving a 30-year-old man. Steffon Armitage holds off Neil de Kock during the Heineken Cup Final between Toulon and Saracens . The 29-year-old back row is not a member of England's RBS 6 Nations squad, but he may involved at the World Cup if Lancaster decides to temporarily relax the rule on not picking overseas-based players. 'I've not spoken to anyone from Toulon or the player. I'll wait and see how the process unfolds,' Lancaster said. 'Clearly from my point of view, behaviour and standards on and off the field are critically important in any team. We'll wait and see, but ultimately you know my view on it.' Armitage celebrates after scoring a try despite a tackle by Llanelli Scarlets' wing Michael Tagicakibau . Armitage runs with the ball during the Heineken Cup semi final match between Toulon and Munster . Lancaster has offered his thoughts on another player who will not be involved against Ireland on Sunday but may yet figure at the World Cup, Sam Burgess. Burgess has been disappointing since his switch from rugby league to union late last year and his performance for Bath against Northampton on Saturday was poor, but Lancaster remains upbeat over his progress. 'I think he his doing well. He's been here three months in a new code, playing at highest level,' Lancaster said. 'Realistically the Six Nations was always going to be a push. And the World Cup would be too, but never say never.'

"Rafael Nadal, who suffered an upset defeat in the Rio Open semi-finals at the weekend, said on Monday he was confident of taking another step towards recovering his best form in Buenos Aires this week. The Spaniard, ranked fourth after Saturday's loss to Fabio Fognini ended a run of 52 consecutive semi-final wins on clay, will make his bow in the second round of the Argentine Open at the Buenos Aires Lawn Tennis Club on Wednesday. 'I've come here with a different motivation because I've had a spell that wasn't good for me because for the last seven months I've been fairly inactive and had complications,' Nadal told a news conference. Rafael Nadal speaks to the media as he prepares to rediscover his form at the Argentina Open . The Spaniard is slowly returning to the game after a seven month lay off with a wrist injury . Nadal's record of 52 consecutive semi-final victories on clay was ended by Fabio Fognini at the Rio Open . 'I'm closer to the level I want to reach which is why I feel I'm taking little steps forward and that's good. Recovery is like a ladder which you don't climb running but rather step by step.' The 28-year-old, back at the tournament in Buenos Aires 10 years after his first visit, lost the No 1 ranking to Novak Djokovic last year after struggling with a right wrist injury. Having won his ninth French Open title in June, Nadal withdrew from the U.S. Open in August due to the injury and lost to Tomas Berdych in the Australian Open quarter-finals last month. The heat in the Argentine capital will be another test for Nadal after Rio de Janeiro where Italian Fognini ended his defence of the title.

'Physically I'm good. In Rio de Janeiro, I don't think I had a bad week. I won good matches and lost one which I shouldn't have lost, although it's also true that the timetable of the previous match was strange,' said Nadal, who complained of poor scheduling after Friday's quarter-final win over Uruguayan Pablo Cuevas finished at 3.30 a.m. on Saturday. 'I had cramps which I've hardly ever had in my life and the truth is my opponent played better than me and made better use of the key moments. I'd have liked to have won there but it didn't happen.'

"Jamie Roberts could be granted an early return to Wales if Racing Metro go ahead with plans to terminate the centre’s contract before the World Cup. Sportsmail understands that, although nothing has been finalised, the 28-year-old is considering his options and could leave France this summer if a severance deal is agreed with the Parisian club. A dual contract with the Welsh Rugby Union is one possibility and, speaking to Sportsmail last month, the Lions star revealed that he would ‘love’ a return to the Cardiff Blues at some stage in his career. ‘I wouldn’t dream of playing for any other team in Wales apart from Cardiff,’ said Roberts. Wales centre Jamie Roberts looks to close down Scotland fly half Finn Russell at Murrayfield . A media report in Wales on Monday claimed that Racing are considering letting Roberts go . ‘In England, if you grow up playing for Bath I’m sure you would have no qualms about going to play for Leicester or a London club. Demographically in Wales it’s very different. ‘When I finish in France, there will be some big decisions to make. That’s a bridge I’ll have to cross pretty soon and I’m looking forward to doing it. I would love to go back to Cardiff one day.’ Cardiff Blues chief executive Richard Holland last night told Sportsmail he would be keen to open negotiations with Roberts, while a source close to the player said he is ‘looking at his options’. Roberts is contracted to Racing until the end of next season but, despite a man-of-the match showing against Northampton recently, has made only 26 appearances in 18 months. Roberts will be entrusted with shutting down France centre Mathieu Bastareaud in Paris on Saturday . ‘If Jamie was to become available, we would of course be keen to have discussions,’ said Holland. The centre was left out of Sunday’s squad for the top-of-the-table clash with Clermont Auvergne and, speaking yesterday, Wales assistant Shaun Edwards said he would be welcomed back across the Channel. ‘We want all of our players back in Wales, but I haven’t spoken to Jamie about it,’ said Edwards. ‘I just want Jamie to concentrate on one thing this week and that’s the match against France. ‘It’s a big help having the players in Wales. I remember when Mike Phillips was with Bayonne. In those down weeks where they normally have a rest and get their body back together, they have to go back and play again. In the end, it is very taxing.

"The BBC has banished men in tights for its new lavish period drama because they are not 'masculine' enough. Actors dressed in stockings have been a staple of television drama such as Shakespeare and Robin Hood for decades but The White Queen costume designers they would be too 'distracting'. The series, set in the 15th Century, tells the story of the scheming for the throne during the War of the Roses. Tights on men have been banned from the set of the BBC's new lavish period drama The White Queen . Costume designers said tights were not 'masculine' enough and replaced them with tight trousers . Men in tights have been a staple of period dramas, such as in Errol Flynn's depiction of Robin Hood . Such is the garment's association with poor period dramas that a film was named after the joke, Robin Hood Men In Tights. Costume designer Nic Ede decided to dress actors such as Max Irons, from Red Riding Hood, and James Frain in tight padded trousers instead. He said 'these days tights are associated with Robin Hood movies and bad jokes'. The White Queen, starring Rebecca Ferguson and Janet McTeer, which starts next month, is set against the backdrop of the battle between the House of Lancaster and the House of York. It is the BBC's major 10-hour adaptation of Philippa Gregory's bestselling historical novel series, The Cousin's War. Not only are the costumes a departure from the norm, but so is the make-up. The hair and make-up department on the show said they deliberately 'dulled' the actors' appearance 'to make their faces look almost tired on camera - rather than what is usually applied to ""brighten"" faces for TV'. However, it was not all bad news for the talent. Ferguson, . who plays Elizabeth Woodville - the beautiful commoner who marries . Edward IV, was given a waist-long real hair wig and a coronation gown . made from gold crochet fabric adorned with hundreds of pearls. Mr Ede said it was his favourite costume that he created on set. The BBC is hoping the series will be a ratings winner. Controller . of BBC Drama, Ben Stephenson, said: 'One of the most ambitious series . the BBC has made, this 10-part series is an epic drama that makes real . history as gripping as the best fiction, featuring a cast of . extraordinary new talent and some of our finest actors.'

"Dangerous: Bright Starts 'Start Your Senses' Zebra toy has been withdrawn from sale . Thousands of baby toys are being recalled from UK stores and homes because they include a colour dye that is considered a cancer risk. The ‘Start Your Senses Zebra’ is sold as an educational toy on the basis that it ‘helps develop baby’s senses of sight, hearing, and touch’. It has been available from leading retailers including Tesco, Asda, Mothercare and Amazon, which have all issued a product recall and advised parents to return or destroy it. The product includes a teether, mirror, rattle, crinkle paper and ribbons, while the highly coloured toy is designed to be attached to buggies and cots. However, it has emerged that the award winning product sold under the Bright Starts brand contains a colour including the chemical 4-Aminoazobenzine, also known as Aniline Yellow. It is a yellow dye used in computer printers, insecticides, paint and varnishes, however it is toxic and a cancer risk with the result it is prohibited from products that might be chewed by babies. In 1981, a criminal gang in Spain sold huge quantities of olive oil containing the chemical in a catastrophic food fraud that left 20,000 sick and 400 dead. A warning poster in Asda and other supermarkets advises parents to ‘Stop using this product immediately’. It adds: ‘If you have a Bright Starts ‘Start Your Senses Zebra’ with the code ‘Q’ followed by a four digit number, please stop using it and destroy immediately.' A scientist at Leeds-based company Green Chemicals, which develops products using safer chemicals, was not surprised the product was recalled. Technical director, Dr Jamie Hawkes, said: ‘Overall, as the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified this as a Group 2 carcinogen - it suggests that it is possible to be carcinogenic to humans via ingestion or contact with skin. ‘In the case of this toy, the dye will probably be pretty well fixed into the fibres. Therefore any exposure to unfixed dyestuff and hence a carcinogen would be small – although any exposure is a risk that most people would not want to take.’ At risk: Babies could have been infected with the yellow dye, which killed 400 in Spain in 1981 . Supermarkets including Asda warned parents: 'Please stop using it and destroy it immediately' The website RecallUK issues alerts and information on products that have been recalled because they may be dangerous. It warned that it will be difficult to get all the toys back. Spokesman, Barry Mulcahy, said: ‘The purpose of a product recall is to remove known safety issues from products that have been sold to consumers. ‘Many recalls have a success rate of only 10-20per cent, meaning that 80-90per cent of products, with known safety issues, remain in consumers’ homes years after the recalls were launched. ‘The consequences of these failures are many more fires, injuries and deaths than would be the case if the recalls had been successful. ‘The biggest challenge facing most recalls is that manufacturers often do not know who owns their products. This is a serious issue as the most effective communication tactic used by manufacturers is to write to the owners of affected products.’ The firm behind the brand and toy is Kids II, an American company which describes itself as the world’s fastest growing baby product companies with global sales of 22.8milllion products. Parents were advised to contact the UK office of the company, Kids II UK Ltd, which is based in Luton, Bedfordshire, for a refund.","It features a toxic yellow dye which killed 400 people in Spain in 1981 .

"Former official Keith Hackett has spoken out on the referee's decisions that marred Saturday's 1-1 draw between Chelsea and Burnley, siding with Jose Mourinho's version of events. Chelsea claim they were denied two penalties before Nemanja Matic was sent off for his aggressive reaction to a career threatening foul by Ashley Barnes - who should have already been sent off for a foul on Branislav Ivanovic. Hackett slammed referee Martin Atkinson for a ‘pretty appalling performance’ while claiming the Serbian midfielder was fortunate not to have suffered a broken leg following Barnes' challenge. Nemanja Matic reacts angrily after being sent off for his reaction to a dangerous challenge from Barnes . This studs-up tackle from Barnes (centre) was missed by Martin Atkinson during an 'appalling performance' Atkinson (right) cannot see the full extent of Barnes’ horror challenge as Matic is blocking his view . Former referee Keith Hackett supported Jose Mourinho's version of events in an interview with Chelsea TV . Speaking to Chelsea TV, Hackett said: ‘I asked the question: is this the worst performance by a Premier League referee ever? It certainly borders on that, but when you get one incident in a match you might be able to discuss it and condone it, or find a method of understanding why the referee made an error, but I think we had a catalogue. ‘I found myself nodding in agreement with Jose Mourinho in terms of the incidents. In the 30th minute out on the wing Barnes clearly commits a red card challenge on Ivanovic. ‘Then you follow it up in the 33rd minute with the Burnley player [Michael Kightly] holding out his arm, making himself bigger. He knew what he was doing and, in my opinion, it should have been a penalty kick.’ Atkinson also missed Barnes' red card challenge on Branislav Ivanovic (left), claims Hackett . The former referee agrees that Chelsea should have been awarded a penalty for  Michael Kightly's handball . Atkinson supposedly made a 'catalogue' of errors during the game that saw Chelsea's lead cut to five points . The former general manager of the Professional Game Match Officials Board was also at a loss to explain why Barnes did not receive his marching orders for his foul on Matic. ‘Nobody can condone the challenge that Barnes puts in on the Chelsea player,’ said Hackett. ‘He’s off the ground, out of control and he’s taken the player. How he’s escaped without a broken leg is beyond me. ‘My view is that the players wouldn’t have to take their own action if they had confidence the referee was doing his job and, in this case, the referee wasn’t doing his job. In my opinion he had a pretty appalling performance.’ Atkinson shows the red card to Matic after the Serbian midfielder retaliated to the tackle . Mourinho appeared on Sky Sports' Goals on Sundato discuss the controversial draw with Burnley . Chelsea's official website appears to have adopted Mourinho's seige mentality following the Portuguese manager's claims that there is a 'campaign' against his team. The site outlined the four incidents that Mourinho had highlighted in minutes 30, 33, 43 and 69: an unpunished challenge from Burnley's Ashley Barnes on Branislav Ivanovic; being denied two 'clear' penalties and a shocking Barnes' challenge on Nemanja Matic - again unpunished. Following Match of the Day's analysis of the match, the website also posted a lead article entitled: 'Match of the Day: Referee ' had a terrible game'. 30 - Ashley Barnes sends Branislav Ivanovic crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back. Ivanovic rolls over twice before leaping up in anger when he realises no action is being taken. Verdict: Should have been a free-kick and could have been a yellow card. for Barnes. 33 - Ivanovic fires a shot at goal but Michael Kightly diverts it with an outstretched arm, as he turns his back to goal. Martin Atkinson waves play on. Verdict: Should have been a Chelsea penalty. 43 - Diego Costa tumbles to the ground after Burnley captain Jason Shackell leans into him with an oustretched arm. Atkinson waves play on. Verdict: Could have been a Chelsea penalty but would have been very soft. Diego Costa vents his frustration after being shoved inside the box by Jason Shackell . 69 - Barnes misses the ball and almost snaps Nemanja Matic's left shin with his studs but Atkinson waves play on. An enraged Matic leaps up and pushes Barnes over violently. Atkinson sends off Matic and books Ivanovic for trying to take red card out of his hand.

"About 45 minutes have been cut from the nearly three-hour blockbuster The Wolf Of Wall Street for Dubai audiences, or a quarter of the film, leaving many viewers disappointed and confused about the sequence of events. The cuts come as the movie has drawn criticism even from film critics in more liberal countries for its portrayal of drugs, sex and money. Detractors say the film glorifies unchecked greed, includes full nudity and is loaded with a reported record for F-bombs in a movie - more than 500. Moviegoers said all profanities were bleeped out from the Martin Scorsese movie featuring Leonardo DiCaprio. Scroll down for video . Banking excess: DiCaprio, who plays Jordan Belfont, starts a corrupt stock-brokerage in The Wolf Of Wall Street, which has been cut by censors in Dubai by around 45 minutes because of its portrayal of drugs and sex . One woman wrote on the Facebook page for Reel Cinemas, which operates two theaters in Dubai, that she and her friend walked out after about 40 minutes because they felt the movie was simply incoherent and unwatchable. It is standard policy across most of the Middle East for governments to preview and censor uncut versions of movies, although the extent of the censoring may differ. Censors edit out even kissing scenes in local theaters and on certain Arab satellite television channels. Juma al-Leem, director of media content at the National Media Center, said censors in the United Arab Emirates, which includes Dubai, typically cut out scenes or language deemed blasphemous or harmful to national security, along with excessive nudity. However, al-Leem told the Associated Press that in this case the regional distributor, Gulf Film based in Dubai, was responsible for the heavy edits. 'We felt that the editing was done abroad and we will not accept editing done abroad,' he said. 'We want to see the whole film first and decide.' Hedonism: The film features DiCaprio's character having sex on top of a pile of money . Gulf Film, which distributes Paramount and Universal titles in Dubai and other Gulf Arab countries, and its parent company Qatar Media Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Qatar Media Services is wholly owned by the government of Qatar. Al-Leem said that while U.A.E. censorship officials did approve the movie after Gulf Film's edits, they felt the cuts were excessive because audiences 'should feel the soul of the film.' He said Gulf Film should have shown U.A.E. censors the uncut movie rather than making one sanitized version for the entire region. Dubai, which hosts an annual international film festival, has a reputation for being much less conservative than countries like Saudi Arabia, where traditional movie theaters are banned. 'There are some scenes we accept that other Gulf countries may cut,' al-Leem said. Strict controls: Censors in the United Arab Emirates, which includes Dubai (above), typically cut out scenes or language deemed blasphemous or harmful to national security, along with excessive nudity . The movie, 'The Wolf of Wall Street', is adapted from Jordan Belfort's memoir about his heady rise from a penny stock trader to a wealthy stock swindler. The film has turned into the most debated of an award season otherwise lacking much controversy. Scorsese and DiCaprio in recent days have defended their film as a thought-provoking portrait of decadence run amok. In a recent interview with the AP, DiCaprio said he and Scorsese would look at each other during filming and ask if they were going too far. Rarely was the answer 'yes.' In October, moviegoers in Dubai saw the screen turn black after a character was heard cursing in Arabic in Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger's latest action flick, Escape Plan. Authorities quickly censored the profane words out of the movie, and the revised version was back in theaters within hours.","Critics say Leonardo DiCaprio blockbuster contains a record 500 F-bombs .

"British troops have been deployed to save Kenya's elephants being slaughtered by terrorists for their valuable tusks. Al Shabaab, a group linked to Al Qaeda, is said to be funding their training and attacks by selling elephant and rhino horns on the Somalian black market - a trade worth £12billion a year. In the past year, 60 wardens and 38,000 elephants have been killed by illegal poachers. Catastrophe: Around 38,000 elephants are slain by illegal poachers each year for their highly valuable tusks . In an initiative backed by Prince Charles and Prince William, 25 soldiers from 3rd Batallion Parachute Regiment have been sent to train Kenyan rangers. The paratroopers, currently based 200 miles north of Nairobi, will spend the coming weeks teaching the Kenyan Wildlife Service, Kenyan Forestry Service and Mount Kenya Trust to patrol better, work more effectively as a team, and how to tackle poachers. The Government has also arranged for a British prosecutor to also advise her Kenyan counterparts in a bid to cripple terrorist funding in North Africa and protect the endangered species. Environment secretary Owen Paterson, who was in Kenya last week, said: 'Illegal poaching is having a devastating effect on some of the world’s most iconic species. Trade: It is thought terrorist group Al Shabaab earn £400,000 a month selling 'blood ivory' on the black market . Action: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and Prince William are working on the government project to tackle illegal poaching. Earlier this year William told leaders it would be a 'catastrophe' if we ignored the crisis . 'By joining forces with those on the frontline in Kenya, our armed services will be able to provide training and support to the courageous people who put their lives on the line every day.' Earlier this year, Prince William urged leaders to take on illegal poachers to 'determine the fate of some of the world's most captivating species.' He said failure to do so would be 'a catastrophe'. Brigadier Duncan Francis, the UK’s defence attache in Nairobi, said: 'This is an excellent example of the British Army taking positive action on an issue close to many people’s hearts. 'The 25 soldiers will be making an immense contribution to securing the future of some of the world’s most endangered species.' Danger: 60 Kenyan rangers have been killed by poachers. British troops will spend the coming weeks training them . As the price of 'blood ivory' - . illegally poached tusks - soars in Africa, gangs have developed new . techniques to slay animals, such as poisoning watering holes. Al Shabaab is believed to be one of the key groups behind the increasing figures. The terrorist clan earns £400,000 a month in the trade - enough to pay their jihadists £75 a week, the Sunday Express reported. In a bid to quash the business, Hillary Clinton unveiled an $80 million plan to tackle elephant poaching in September. She . warned that money from the wildlife crime could have funded the attack . on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya last month, a theory which is . backed by elephant conservation groups. Rhinos are also highly sought after in the trade. Sellers are now said to be pricing single rhino horns higher than its weight in cocaine. Last . month the Kenyan government said every rhino in the country would have a . microchip implanted in its horn to help stop the trade. The micro-chipping project is being supported by the World Wildlife Fund, which donated the chips. Rhino horn is highly sought after in Asia, where it is used in traditional medicines.","Al Shabaab is thought to earn £400,000 a year selling ivory in Somalia .

"Former Prime Minister Tony Blair, giving a speech today, admitted his military intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan has made the West less inclined to tackle radical Islam . Tony Blair today warned Britain will pay a 'heavy price' for failing to intervene in Syria. The former Prime Minister again defended his decision to invade Iraq and warned of the 'consequences of non-intervention'. But he admitted that his military interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan had made the West less inclined to tackle radical Islam. He urged a deal with Bashar Assad in Syria and suggested the West must work with Russian President Vladmir Putin to tackle ‘radicalised and politicised view of Islam’ despite increased tensions over Ukraine. Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4: 'I totally understand the reasons why people didn't want to intervene in Syria. 'Personally I would have had us intervene - not full-scale troops on the ground or anything of that nature - but a couple of years ago, I think we could have created a situation in which an optimistic solution for the country was possible. 'I think now we're faced with a situation where it's a choice of two very bad options - no one wants to see Assad stay, people are rightly, I think, now very anxious about elements within the opposition with extremists and so on - and this is, in my view, going to cause us problems for many, many years to come. 'Having been through Iraq, Afghanistan and so on, I know what the difficult consequences are of intervention. But if you look at Syria, you see the consequences of non-intervention, and I think non-intervention there is, I think, something for which we will pay a very heavy price.' In a major speech in central London, Mr Blair listed nations where he says there is an ‘essential battle’ to be fought against radical Islam, including Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan. ‘There is no engagement that doesn’t involve putting yourself out there. There is no commitment that doesn’t mean taking a risk,’ he added. Sources said it was ‘far too blunt’ to suggest he was advocating ‘only military engagement’, saying he would back the revolution in Egypt which overthrew the Muslim Brotherhood government as the ‘necessary rescue’ of the country. Mr Blair attacked the ‘absurdity’ of Britain and its allies spending billions on security and defence to protect themselves against the consequences of the extremism ‘advocated in the school systems and institutions of the very countries with whom we have intimate security and defence relationships’. Mr Blair, who is still dogged by his controversial decision to take Britain to war in Iraq and Afghanistan, insists the West should have bombed Syria last year despite opposition led by his successor Ed Miliband. He used today’s major speech in the City to acknowledge that ‘recent conflicts’ had taken away many governments’ appetite to engage in the Middle East, but he will assert that the case is stronger now than at any time. Britain and the rest of the world must 'take sides' in confronting a 'deadly' mixture of religion and politics across the Middle East, Mr Blair said . No backing down: Rather than shy away from the invasion Mr Blair has continued to defend it prominently . Tony Blair must not be allowed to . delay the release of the Chilcot report into the Iraq War, a former . Labour Attorney General warned today. Lord . Morris called for ‘urgent clarification’ on whether Mr Blair, ex-PM . Gordon Brown or the Cabinet Office are to blame for the delay in . publication. The former law . officer in Mr Blair’s first Cabinet urged David Cameron to make a ‘firm . decision’ to release the report well ahead of next year’s General . Election. Lord Morris, who spent two decades on the . Labour frontbench, warned there is ‘now the real danger is that the . publication will run into the 2015 election’. Writing in the Daily Mirror, he urged Mr Cameron to commit to publication as soon as possible. ‘Who is responsible for the delay? Not Chilcot and his colleagues, who must be anxious to publish,’ Lord Morris said. ‘Two . past Prime Ministers - Gordon Brown and Tony Blair? A cabinet office . fighting to maintain a precedent that cabinet minutes and discussions . between the two previous Prime Ministers should be permanently kept . private? ‘Parliament deserves a clear statement from Mr Cameron as to the reasons for the delays.’ His remarks are the closest  he has come to an expression of regret over the impact of his military decisions. He . said: ‘At the root of the crisis lies a radicalised and politicised . view of Islam, an ideology that distorts and warps Islam’s true message. ‘The threat of this radical Islam is not abating. It is growing. It is spreading across the world. ‘It is destabilising communities and even . nations. It is undermining the possibility of peaceful coexistence in . an era of globalisation. And in the face of this threat we seem . curiously reluctant to acknowledge it and powerless to counter it . effectively.’ Mr Blair suggested an Islamist ideology that mixes politics and religion in ‘such a deadly way’ must be confronted. The UK and other countries should examine ‘how we should be building alliances to achieve this, including the recognition that on this issue, whatever our other differences, we should be prepared to reach out and co-operate with the East, and in particular, Russia and China’. Apart from being a ‘global energy supplier’, the Middle East is significant because it is ‘on Europe’s doorstep’, he added. Insisting that the future of Islam’s relationship with politics will be determined in the region, he added: ‘This is controversial because the world of politics is uncomfortable talking about religion. But I assert it nonetheless. ‘ . He said the West must back the ‘principles of religious freedom and open, rule-based economies’. Mr Blair branded the turmoil in Syria 'an unmitigated disaster', calling for a settlement with President Assad - whom he has previously condemned. 'We are now in a position where both Assad staying and the opposition taking over seem bad options,' he said. 'The former is responsible for creating this situation. But the truth is that there are so many fissures and problems around elements within the opposition that people are rightly wary now of any solution that is an outright victory for either side. 'Repugnant though it may seem, the only way forward is to conclude the best agreement possible even if it means in the interim President Assad stays for a period. 'Should even this not be acceptable to him, we should consider active measures to help the opposition and force him to the negotiating table, including no-fly zones whilst making it clear that the extremist groups should receive no support from any of the surrounding nations.'","He names Egypt, Yemen, Lebanon, Syria and Pakistan in speech today .

NFL player Eric Berry has a crippling fear of his team's own mascot - a horse named War Paint that unfortunately for Berry, takes a victory lap every time the team scores a touchdown . The 6-foot, 211-pound Kansas City Chiefs safety avoids War Paint at all costs, though every game he's forced to share a stadium with the animal . Berry says his fear comes from an unfortunate incident in his past where he was bitten by a pony at a petting zoo . In one clip, he's standing on the sideline about to go out on the field when he suddenly spots the horse. 'Oh, hell naw. There go that horse. I don't f*** with that horse,' he says, as he returns to the sideline bench. 'Huh?' another player asked, apparently unaware of Berry's fear. 'That horse. I wait till the horse pass,' Berry continues. 'I don't mess with horses, bro. It might come over here and throw a tantrum.' In another clip, the team is huddling with a coach when Berry suddenly breaks away from the group. 'Hold up coach, that horse out there,' he says, pointing at the animal. 'Horse.' Kansas City Chiefs safety Eric Berry returns an interception during an NFL game against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday September 15 . Berry (pictured with his father) has no fear of other animals. His father says he thinks his son's fear of horses is 'hilarious' Berry says he doesn't trust horses and worries that the animal might 'throw a tantrum' Berry watches videos of War Paint to prepare for a meeting with the horse, in which he will try to overcome his fear . 'You need to go on ahead with that horse now,' he shouts. 'I don't fool with no horses. Hell naw.' Berry says his fear comes from an unfortunate incident in his past. 'You know all the cartoons and all the TV shows you see when you are young - like horses and ponies are always really, really cool and happy. They always got like a rainbow and some stars flying behind it. You know what I'm saying, like, ""Oh, it's a pony! It's a pony!"" 'So I'm at the petting zoo and for some reason the pony came and bit me. When it happened I turned around and looked at it. Aside from the fact that the horse didn't look anything like the cartoon or what I saw on TV, it was like, ""Dang, horse. I trusted you!"" You know what I'm saying? I was really betrayed.' His teammates and his own father think the fear is silly. 'I sort of think it's hilarious that he's afraid of horses,' his father said. Berry (left) warily approaches War Paint in the stadium in hopes of confronting his fear . Berry is unsure whether he wants to approach the animal . Finally, Berry reaches out and pets the animal. But he stays an arm's length away . But Berry finally decides to confront his fear at the end of the 'NFL Films Presents' special, and he agrees to meet War Paint in the stadium. He reaches out to pet the animal with a few fingers, but that's as close as he would get. He did offer War Paint a heartfelt apology, however, for being so judgmental of him. 'War Paint, I'm sorry that I, uh, talked about you like that on TV but I feel like we are making strides toward a good relationship,' Berry told the animal.

"Passing the torch: David Dimbleby has been adamant that he will not be giving up his position as leader of the election coverage, but despite this, the next general election coverage will be his last . David Dimbleby has won the right to present the BBC's general election covering next year, beating out Huw Edwards for the spot. However, this will be Dimbleby's last time heading the coverage, as he is to step down from fronting after his ninth and final time. Rival Huw Edwards was apparently given a 'cast-iron guarantee' by former director general Mark Thompson that he would succeed the 75-year-old in the anchor role, but Dimbleby lobbied the new director Lord hall to overturn the decision. For next year’s election night . broadcast, Dimbleby will be on air from 10pm as the polls close, through . until the next morning. Edwards, 52, will then take over from 7am through to . the 10pm news bulletin, monitoring results and providing commentary on the progress of the forming of a . new government. In an interview in 2010, Dimbleby made it clear he had no intention of stepping down for a successor . He said: 'I don’t have any instinct to make way gracefully. I shall be dragged kicking and screaming from my chair.' Dimbleby presented his first election results programme in 1979, on the year Margaret Thatcher rose was elected as prime minister. Although the 7am handover will mark the end of his general election tenure, Dimbleby will not actually be finished for the day. He will return that evening to present a special edition of Question Time. James Harding, the BBC’s director of news, said: 'This election is likely to be one of the most complex and closely fought in recent times and we are delighted to have such an experienced team to lead our coverage.' Huw Edwards has been gradually taking over Dimbleby's role as the head of 'event' coverage, seen here anchoring the coverage of the Royal Wedding in 2011 . Dimbleby was the BBC’s trusted voice of state occasions for many years but has gradually been succeeded by Edwards. In addition, Dimbleby was the guide for key moments such as the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales and the Queen Mother, but Edwards took over for 2011’s royal wedding.

"You might look at your desk and think it looks pretty clean. But a gruesome new video shows how it could be riddled with invisible bacteria all the way from the bathroom - and is easily spread to your hands and mouth. As one in four office workers fail to wash their hands after going to the loo, anything from the door to the keyboard and computer mouse is covered with millions of bacteria. In order to avoid getting ill, experts have revealed the best ways to try and remain as germ-free as possible. Flushing the loo without putting the seat down causes a 'sneeze effect', in which bacteria is sprayed all over the cubicle and can cover surfaces as far as 20 feet away . Bacteria spreads throughout the office. Previous studies have revealed 3,000 organisms per square inch on a keyboard or over 1,600 on a computer mouse . Touching the keyboard and then later eating lunch transfers the bacteria from the hands to the mouth . Using hand sanitiser throughout the day can stop the spread of bacteria, experts say . It's known 16 per cent of people carry the norovirus – which causes vomiting and diarrhoea – but show no symptoms . Dr Lisa Ackerley, Professorial Fellow at the Royal Society of Public Health, warns of the 'sneeze effect' when flushing the toilet. Failing to put the toilet lid down before flushing means bacteria is sprayed and can cover surfaces as far away as 20 feet. She said: ‘If you go to the toilet and you don’t put the lid down before you flush, when you do flush the germs that are in the toilet will spread around the toilet cubicle. ‘This means they could land on the toilet seat or toilet paper itself and that means they could be spread on your hands and other surfaces later on.’ To combat the sneeze effect, use an antibacterial seat cleaner to wipe the germs away, she added. Usually after going to the toilet we have around 200 million bacteria per square inch on each hand. And hands contaminated with viruses can transfer them to five more surfaces or 14 other subjects. In fact, U.S. researchers found that when they contaminated a single doorknob or table top with a 'tracer virus' it spread through an office building, hotel or healthcare facility within two to four hours. After using the bathroom one hand has 200 million bacteria per square inch, often picked up from the toilet paper or toilet seat . Contaminated hands transfer viruses to five more surfaces or 14 other people. Previous research found viruses can spread through and office within two to four hours . 700 harmful bacteria inhabit car interiors., but almost half of illnesses can be reduced by washing hands effectively, experts advised . Dr Ackerley continued: ‘We know from studies 3,000 organisms per square inch can be found on a keyboard or over 1,600 a computer mouse. ‘Over the course of a day you might be picking up those bacteria and then if you suddenly decide to have lunch at your desk without washing your hands first, you’re basically transferring those bacteria into your mouth.’ It's known 16 per cent of people carry the norovirus – which causes vomiting and diarrhoea – but show no symptoms. 'So you may feel perfectly fine and well but you’re carrying around the virus and spreading it around the office’ Dr Ackerley said. She recommended using a hand sanitiser after leaving the bathroom, and over the course of the day. Office workers come into contact with 10 million bacteria every day, with many spreading the norovirus around the office without knowing it . A keyboard is covered with 3,295 organisms per square inch and a computer mouse riddled with 1,676 organisms per square inch .

"Buskers have launched a legal bid to stop squads of 'Simon Cowell Cops' judging street performers on quality. Controversial measures enforced by Liverpool City Council give police and town hall officials power to end street performances they deem 'poor quality'. The scheme has been dubbed 'The Simon Cowell Cops' after the music mogul who is known for his ruthless treatment of hopefuls on The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent. Musician and busker Ashley Dean, playing the guitar and busking on Matthew Street, in Liverpool city centre, outside the Cavern Club, made famous by the Beatles . Buskers are outraged that it has been left to the musically untrained ears of police and council officers to decide who is good enough to perform on the streets of the city. A ‘Keep Streets Live!’ campaign has now enlisted the support of solicitors to seek a judicial review on what they describe as 'restrictive terms and conditions'. Under the regulations launched on August 1st, street performers including mime artists and dancers have to pay £20 for a permit and £100 public liability insurance a year. The regulations are part of Liverpool City Council’s Street Management Plan backed by the Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson. Solicitor David Kirwan said: 'Entertainment is the heartbeat of Liverpool’s culture - it defines our city’s personality and gives us inspiration through good times and bad. 'Liverpool is also the birthplace of popular music. Serenade: A musician and busker plays to shoppers on Liverpool city centre, as TV presenter Claire Sweeney, right looks on . 'I have witnessed the creative influence of street performers on our popular culture from the 1960s Merseybeat era to its role in the European Capital of Culture in 2008. 'We need our streets buzzing in order to prosper. 'This is an important campaign for our city and other towns and cities across the UK whose council leaders may be tempted to follow Liverpool’s poor example. 'While arguably trying to make improvements Liverpool City Council has created a problem - but it’s not too late to fix it. 'Some of the new measures are not only at odds with the spirit and culture of our city but also the law. 'We are seeking justice for the street performers by challenging through the courts if necessary.' More than 3,000 supporters have signed an online petition Keep Spontaneous Street Performance Alive! being led by busker-turned-campaigner Jonathan Walker. The 32-year-old founder of the Association of Street Artists and Performers, said: “Visitors to the city rightly expect our streets to be animated with art and music. 'The council is attempting to impose control and excessive regulation on one of the areas of city life where it is least needed. 'We are delighted that Kirwans have backed the campaign and street performers all over the city and will use their legal expertise to help us put right a wrong.' Liverpool's buskers are fighting a City Council policy which allows police to intervene and stop 'poor quality' buskers . A Liverpool City Council spokesperson said: 'Keep The Streets Alive! are aware that, following consultation, the policy was introduced on the basis of a three-month trial. 'We aim to assess and review its guidelines by October. 'We are currently talking with as many people as possible from street entertainers and shop owners to the Musicians Union, music venues and organisations to see how, where and if the policy can be refined.'","Liverpool City Council’s Street Management Plan gives police power to stop acts they think are not good enough .

"A gang of drug dealers have been jailed after two of them posed for photos with bags of cannabis and bundles of cash. Eugene May-Dyer, Russell Turner, Ian Cunningham and Grant Barnhurst, all from Birmingham, were arrested during a series of raids in the Kings Norton area of the city in February last year. Officers seized almost £1,000 of cannabis, dealer bags and digital scales, plus mobile phones containing a back catalogue of text conversations between the group discussing drugs. Examination of the phone also revealed an image of 18-year-old Turner, from Green Acres, showing off with handfuls of cash and used notes stuffed into his waistband. Incriminating: Russell Turner (left) with 24-year-old Eugene May-Dyer (right), examining dried cannabis leaf scattered across a floor. The two men and another pair have now been jailed . In another photograph seized from a mobile phone, Turner can be seen with 24-year-old May-Dyer, from Halladale, examining dried cannabis leaf scattered across a floor. All four admitted conspiracy to supply Class B drugs at Birmingham Crown Court. Yesterday, labourer Turner was jailed for 13 months - including an additional month for breaching an earlier suspended sentence - and May-Dyer for 12 months. Fellow drug suppliers Cunningham, 24, and 21-year-old Barnhurst were both handed nine-month sentences. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Bannister, head of West Midlands Police’s Gang Taskforce, said: 'These are young men who’d formed a fledgling gang that was on the up.' Wads of cash: 18-year-old Russell Turner with handfuls of cash and used notes stuffed into his waistband which was shown as evidence in the trial . He added: 'We managed to intercept them at an early stage before their criminality could escalate and potentially cause more damage in the Kings Norton community.' 'As a police force we are committed to a policy of drugs prevention through education and diversion - especially where young people are concerned - but we will not hesitate to push for custodial sentences if necessary. 'Our communities repeatedly tell us that taking action against drug dealing in communities is a priority for them and urge us to take action; no-one should have to put up with that on their doorstep. 'That’s what we’ve done and four young men who cockily posed for photos boasting of their drug dealing are now paying the price.' Police discovered the rookie gang’s cannabis ‘den’ on 10 November 2012 when officers stopped a car being driven away from Turner’s home. Police found drugs in the car and then searched a shed in Turner’s garden - which had been turned into a 'chillout summer house' with a TV - and they found 1.3kg of cannabis. Fingerprints belonging to May-Dyer and Cunningham were found on the drugs bags while a BlackBerry phone found in the shed contained over 60,000 messages, many of which linked the four men to drug dealings. Inspector Vanessa Eyles is the Neighbourhood Policing Manager covering the area. She said: 'The impact these individuals had while dealing and supplying drugs locally was negative and destructive. 'Their criminal activity caused anti-social behaviour and crime everywhere they dealt. My officers worked closely with the Gangs Task Force to ensure the right people were targeted.'","Four men have been jailed for a drug operation in Birmingham .

"A message posted on Facebook by Navy SEALS claiming that President Obama denied them backup as forces overran Benghazi was taken down twice by the social networking site. The move has stoked accusations that Facebook was censoring the SEALs’ message to ‘quietly squelch opposition’ to President Obama’s alleged failures. The message contained in a meme suggesting that Obama relied on the SEALS when he wanted to get Osama bin Laden, but then turned round and denied them back up when they called for it in Benghazi. Censored? The SOS post was taken down by Facebook twice... but not before it had been shared online by thousands . US ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other American embassy staff were killed in the attack by Islamist militants in Benghazi, Libya on September 11. The tragedy has become a controversial issue in next month's presidential election due to ongoing confusion over how much the administration knew about the circumstances of the attack. Sources present during the deadly six-hour assault have said that a desperate last request for military assistance once the CIA themselves came under attack was denied, even though elite counter-terrorism units were only two hours away. The Facebook message about the attack was posted by Special Operations Speaks PAC (SOS), an organisation founded by Special Operations veterans dedicated to protecting forces at home and abroad. Attack: The US Consulate in Benghazi is seen in flames during fierce clashes in which US Ambassador Chris Stevens died . The image was shared on Facebook between 30,000 users within 24 hours of it being posted online. However it was taken down at the weekend for what SOS claims was an ‘unspecified violation of Facebook’s terms of Rights and Responsibilities.’ Retired SEAL Captain Larry Bailey said:  ‘It looks like Obama’s liberal followers in Facebook HQ are terrified of how damaging the Benghazi scandal is for the President. 'We understand that Facebook can run their site however they’d like, but when they’re trying to quietly squelch opposition to what is a clear leadership failure that resulted in the tragic deaths of some of our nation’s heroes, they deserve the to be called out on it.’ Tragedy: Walls at the main entrance of the US consulate in Benghazi, apparently stained with blood . Colonel Dick Brauer Jr, retired from the US Air Force, added: ‘Americans across the country deserve the truth about what happened in Libya, and they certainly deserve to know when people who hold the keys to a lot of their online communications are trying to keep that from them.’ After the post was removed twice and SOS’s Facebook account suspended for 24 hours, the post was reinstated and SOS received an email from Facebook apologising. It said: ‘A member of our team . accidentally removed something you posted on Facebook. This was mistake, . and we sincerely apologize for this error. We've since restored the . content, and you should now be able to see it.’ SOS . responded to the apology: ‘We accept their apology but do not accept . that it was an innocent mistake. It was clearly a means to protect Obama . on Libya.’ A spokesperson from Facebook said: 'This was an error and we apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused.

"Bill O'Reilly showed footage shot by CBS during the Falklands conflict as Fox News continued their defense of the veteran broadcaster. During his Monday night show, The O'Reilly Factor, he played clips of police roaming the streets of Buenos Aires in 1982, using tear gas and firing rubber bullets during protests which he claims led to one of his photographers being injured. The 65-year-old also interviewed NBC New's former Miami bureau chief Don Browne, who was responsible for the network's coverage in the region. The former journalist backed up claims the Argentine capital was a dangerous place for reporters and 'wasn't a joke'. His support comes as O'Reilly continues to vehemently deny claims he embellished stories of what was going on in the South American country at the time. The station's retaliation was prompted by a Mother Jones article last week calling into question O'Reilly's claims he reported in a 'war zone' or 'combat zone' during the brief conflict between Britain and Argentina. Scroll down for video . Retaliation: Bill O'Reilly showed footage shot by CBS during the Falklands conflict as Fox News continued their defense of the veteran broadcaster . In the archive footage, none of the stories mentions O'Reilly, then a young CBS reporter, or makes any specific reference to a crew member being hurt. Few reporters made it to the front of the war, some 1,000 miles from the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires. O'Reilly has said that he covered an anti-government demonstration in Buenos Aires that turned violent and that a photographer he was working with was knocked to the ground and was bleeding. Describing the events two years ago, O'Reilly said he 'dragged off' the photographer from danger. Former CBS News correspondent Eric Engberg, who also was covering the event, characterized O'Reilly's account as 'dishonest' and 'completely nutty' during a Huffington Post interview on Monday. Engberg said none of the camera operators working the night in question remembers any colleague being injured. The camera person who was said to be hurt has not spoken publicly about the matter. During one of the CBS reports, then-anchor Dan Rather said that several television crew members were knocked to the ground and that North American television crews were 'jostled.' An Engberg report, also released by CBS on Monday, said police fired guns with tear gas and plastic bullets. He said in the report it was unknown how many people were hurt but at least some were seriously injured. Back in time: In the archive footage, none of the stories mentions O'Reilly, then a young CBS reporter, or makes any specific reference to a crew member being hurt . Controversy: The voice of Eric Engberg was heard in one of the clips showing police in the streets of Buenos Aires. He openly criticized O'Reilly's claims in a Facebook post over the weekend . An Associated Press account of the demonstration said that police officers charged a group of about 50 journalists, beating some and trampling others. 'Two news photographers were reported injured by rubber bullets fired by police,' said the June 16, 1982, account by AP writer Douglas Grant Mine. The release of the videos, while providing more detail about the situation O'Reilly faced 33 years ago, did not resolve the issue of whether his retellings of the experience have been completely factual. In addition to his work at Fox, O'Reilly has become a force in the publishing industry with a series of books on the deaths of historical figures like Abraham Lincoln and Jesus Christ. O'Reilly, on his program Monday night, showed portions of the CBS video and said it proved the event was no 'walk in the park.' Browne said the situation 'got progressively more intense' and there were demonstrations in Buenos Aires every day. He said: 'I was surprised at the article because interesting enough you [O'Reilly] came on my radar. I was overseeing the coverage in El Salvador, it was a brutal war and you were there to cover the war. 'It was an opportunity for young journalists to get their ticket punched. And that was the time when satellite news was on and it was the number one news story at the time. Support: O'Reilly also interviewed NBC New's former Miami bureau chief Don Browne, who was responsible for the network's coverage in the region. Describing the escalation of violence in Buenos Aires, he said: 'Let me give you the progression of the war. It was a joke, at first nobody took it seriously. We had the only reporter that actually got on the Falkland Islands. Robin Lloyd actually got on there through the Argentine Navy. 'At first it was casual, and then it became more and more serious and as the military were losing badly, the populous began to turn on the military leadership. 'There were tanks on the streets of Buenos Aries. It was a real country at war. It wasn't a joke. It was a real war and they were taking it very seriously. He said the city was a good place to be if you were covering the war, but it progressively got more and more intense as it went on. 'These were veteran correspondents, we saw the situation escalating, they weren't surprised. But they were surprised at the over-reaction. 'To them it was business as usual. It didn't happen over one day. You call it a riot, it was a very intense situation where people got hurt and there was a very serious confrontation and it was a defining moment when the populous turned on the military.' 'He agreed that it was a violent and volatile situation where reporters were in danger. The Mother Jones piece was printed shortly after NBC News anchor Brian Williams was suspended for misrepresenting his experiences in the Iraq War. O'Reilly, long the most popular prime-time figure in cable news, has called the piece a political hit job. 'I want to stop this now,' O'Reilly said. 'I hope we can stop it, I really do.' Fox News CEO Roger Ailes has said he fully supports O'Reilly. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","News segments were aired on the O'Reilly factor on Monday evening .

It is believed at first that she was raped - but when it is later discovered she was not sexually assaulted, police turn their attention to her private life. The book was also labelled by the Mail’s reviewer as ‘elegant, spell-binding and unbearably sad’.

Mr Wainwright warned that Bitcoin - a 'crypto-currency' based on mathematical formulae and independent of any government or central bank - is propping up a criminal black market. He also warned that police and politicians were struggling to keep up with the pace of online crime, thanks to widespread anonymity online, and easy access to encryption technology which can make criminals almost impossible to track down. Mr Wainwright warned that the principle that everyone's online activity should be anonymous by default needs to be challenged in order to police the internet effectively. He criticised the sluggish response from the police, politicians and big businesses, saying that equivalent levels of crime in the physical world would be 'front page news.'

"A college student from New York was waiting for UPS to deliver some weightlifting equipment he had ordered - but instead he received a government drone. The shocking discovery was made Monday by Reddit user Seventy_Seven, who promptly took to the online forum to share photos of what he found inside the UPS parcel. The box delivered to the engineering student's doorstep contained wings, a control panel and a card stating that the items were federal property and should be returned to a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) office at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida. Special delivery: An unsuspecting college . student got a UPS delivery containing a Puma AE drone, which was property of the federal government . Incomplete set: The box was one of eight containers carrying parts of the drone used for environmental observation . Pricey video game: The parcel contained a control panel used to operate the drone from the ground . The box came with this card explaining that it was federal property that came from a NOAA office at MacDill Air Force Base . 'I think I just got a drone in the mail.' the unsuspecting recipient wrote in a Reddit post that quickly went viral. When the student called UPS about the package, he was allegedly told that because his name and address were on the box containing the equipment, the drone was his to keep, if he so chose. ‘In all fairness, the UPS guy that delivered it said it was part 2 of my package, so I genuinely thought at first, that it was part of the weight lifting bench set I ordered,’ the student said. ‘Not sure if that will protect me from the government though.’ Another Reddit user, who described himself as an Afghan war veteran, identified the drone as a Puma AE unmanned aerial vehicle, The Daily Dot reported. The soldier said the NOAA drone features high-definition thermal camera, a range of nearly 13 miles, and if handled improperly, its rotors could easily cut off a finger. ‘The thing will take a beating!’ the soldier wrote. ‘Don't play chicken with this thing, I've seen one go half way through a car door.’ When fully assembled, a Puma AE unmanned aircraft like the one seen in this picture is worth about $350,000 . NOAA . spokesman David Miller later confirmed that the machinery that was . mistakenly brought to the home of the college student was indeed a Puma . drone worth about $350,000 when fully assembled, which had been shipped . in an eight-box set from Tampa to Stellwagen Bank Marine Sanctuary in . Massachusetts. But . somewhere en route from Florida to Massachusetts, one of the boxes . containing drone parts allegedly got mislabeled and went missing. UPS spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg has released a statement confirming the delivery snafu. She . added that the shipping company, which delivers nearly 17million . parcels each day, was working to recover the drone from the Reddit user . and ship it to the sanctuary as intended. Rosenberg . said she suspects a label became displaced from a package ordered by . the student and wound up on the NOAA box shipped out last Thursday. UPS . is still investigating exactly what happened to the package. Seventy_Seven has revealed himself as somewhat of a drone enthusiast, calling them an 'awesome tool.'  He told the Huffington Post that he was . especially eager to return the unmanned aircraft to NOAA because it was . meant to be used in the observation of marine life and migratory birds. Point of departure: The $350,000 unmanned aircraft was shipped in eight boxes from MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa last week . Mistaken identity: UPS says that the name and address label from a box containing the student's weightlifting bench may have somehow ended up on the box containing the drone . On Tuesday night, UPS staff reportedly picked up the box with the Puma wings and control console, and it is said to be on its way to the Massachusetts nature preserve now. According to NOAA, the Puma drone is a ‘flying camera’ that researchers use to ‘spy on nature,’ the Washington Post reported. The hand-launched aircraft comes with 5-foot wingspans, a 5-megapixel camera and can fly for two hours at speeds up to 55mph and altitudes up to 10,000 feet, according to Stars and Stripes. The Reddit user admitted that he should not have posted photos of the drone online before contacting NOAA, and said he was glad the situation was resolved without him being led away in handcuffs, or ‘dead,’ as he wrote half-jokingly in response to other users’ quips. ‘Generally, I was an idiot,’ the student wrote. ‘But I'm a lucky idiot, who currently isn't serving jail time. Even so, I really don't think hypersensitive government equipment would be shipped through UPS, let alone get delivered to a civilian.’","Reddit user Seventy_Seven, an engineering student from New York, got a UPS box with his address containing drone blades and control panel .

"A 16-year-old transgender teen who claims fellow students at her California high school bullied her for years is the only student to have been charged after a schoolyard brawl that was caught on camera. Family and friends of Jewlyes Gutierrez, 16, have launched a petition asking the Contra Costa County district attorney to drop a misdemeanor battery charge against her. The November 13 fight was caught on camera and went viral after being posted to YouTube. Bullied: Transgender teen Jewlyes Gutierrez says she 'snapped' after being bullied for years by girls at her school . 'It sucks': Gutierrez says she's upset by the district attorney's decision to charge her . Write caption here . Chase: According to police, the transgender girl (left) hit another girl, who chased her and began a brawl (right) The cell phone video shows four girls screaming, hitting and pulling each other's hair. The brawl was allegedly sparked by cruel taunting and bullying by Gutierrez's classmates. The teen's sister Valerie Poquiz wrote on her Change.org petition that Gutierrez's gender identity has made her a 'victim of taunting, harassment, and bullying by her peers.' After repeated episodes of bullying, writes Poquiz, Gutierrez went to the assistant principal in fear for her safety, but no action was taken. On November 13, the teenager was 'pushed over the edge.' 'Out of fear of physical violence, Jewlyes finally stood up for herself. Several girls who were tormenting my sister then physically attacked her,' she wrote. Playground fight: The school district will meet to discuss the fight and bullying among students . The criminal charge comes after the school district thought the matter had been settled. All . four girls involved in the fight were suspended and the school district . held special meetings to discuss anti-bullying policies. Gutierrez . spoke at one meeting of the West Contra Cost Unified School Board . focused on bullying and sexual harassment in early December. 'People who are different, I feel, should stand up for themselves,' Gutierrez said, according to KTVU. Gutierrez said the fight she was involved in came after a protracted period of bullying. 'I was just kinda like, enough is enough. Because you can stretch a rubber band so far and then it will just snap,' she said. Sophomore: Gutierrez is a student at Hercules Middle High School where she has faced bullying because of her gender identity . Bullying: The fight was reportedly sparked by ongoing harassment against a 16-year-old transgender student by a group of girls . Unfair fight: Two girls can be seen pulling the hair and hitting the transgender girl . School board president Charles Ramsey told KTVU he doesn't know why the district attorney's office has chosen to step in. 'If . a crime happens, a crime happens but, I’d like to have a better . understanding of the rationale and motivation behind it and sort of . learn why this is not a punishment enough, especially when the child . expresses a position that they had been bullied,' he said. Gutierrez's public defender Kaylie Simon was also surprised by the charges. 'I . don’t understand quite why the district attorney’s office would . prosecute someone who’s already been a victim of bullying. I think it’s a . further victimization of someone who’s been a target,' she said. Prosecutors have not explained why Gutierrez is being charged. 'I cannot discuss anything about any juvenile matter without a court order,' Deputy District Attorney Dan Cabral said. Gutierrez is due in court February 5th for a pre-trial conference where it's hoped the charges against her will be dropped. 'It sucks,' Gutierrez told KBCW. 'I really want … like, the charges against me to be dropped.' So far, 1,121 people have signed the Change.org petition.","A California district attorney's office has charged a 16-year-old transgender Jewlyes Gutierrez with misdemeanor battery .

"Chris Gayle become the first person to score a double century in a World Cup match as batting records tumbled in West Indies' 73-run Duckworth-Lewis victory over Zimbabwe. In an action-packed match at the Manuka Oval in Canberra, destructive opener Gayle overcame a nervy start, including surviving a tight lbw call in the first over, to thump 10 fours and an incredible 16 sixes in a superb knock of 215 off 147 deliveries - the third highest one-day international score of all time. The 35-year-old needed just 33 balls in his second ton as he moved into an elite club, with Gary Kirsten recording the previous highest score at cricket's premier 50-over competition when he made 188 not out for South Africa against the United Arab Emirates in February 1996. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cricket World Cup 2015: Chris Gayle hits 215 off 147 deliveries . Chris Gayle holds up his remarkable individual score against Zimbabwe at the Cricket World Cup . The West Indies batsman became the first player to hit a double century at the sport's biggest event . Gayle celebrates after reaching his double ton, breaking the previous record (188) set by Gary Kirsten in 1996 . The 35-year-old smashed 10 fours and an incredible 16 sixes in a knock of 215 from 147 deliveries . 215 runs from 147 balls . Sixes: 16 . Fours: 10 . Percentage of runs in boundaries: 63.25 . Percentage of dot balls faced: 40.13 . No. of balls for first hundred: 105 . No. of balls for second hundred: 33 . Strike-rate (per hundred balls): 146.25 . Innings since last century: 19 . Average in previous seven innings this year: 15.85 . Gayle's landmark innings was the first individual one-day double hundred outside of India and the fifth overall. He fell to the final ball of the innings as the Windies reached 372 for two before Zimbabwe were bowled for 289 - with Gayle claiming two wickets - as they failed to reach their target of 363. The left-hander also played his part in setting the highest ever partnership in ODIs as he and Marlon Samuels (133 not out) scored all of their side's runs, along with 24 extras. 'With the innings, I struggled at the start and it was scary the first ball. I was like ""come on you're not serious, I can't be out on this first ball"". I needed a chance and got a break and made the best use of it,' he said on Sky Sports World Cup. 'There's been a lot of pressure and the runs haven't been coming. This is the first time ever in my career that so many people wanted me to score runs and the messages keep coming in on Twitter, it's the first time I've ever seen so many people wanting Chris Gayle to perform. 'In the end, I'm glad I gave them something to actually cheer about. Overall, I'm really happy and I want to try and build on this as much as possible. The team can gain some momentum going into South Africa.' Zimbabwe actually made an ideal start despite losing the toss as Tinashe Panyangara's second delivery nipped back into Dwayne Smith's off stump, but that was as good as it got. Gayle was rapped on the pads two balls later but he was reprieved by the on-field umpire and the decision review system. It was a crucial let-off for the veteran left-hander and he gradually started to find some fluency with a towering six off Sean Williams giving an indication of what was to follow. He brought up his century - his 22nd in ODIs and first since June 2013 - in the 36th over, a position from which he propelled himself in expert fashion. Gayle was given a life on 121 when he was caught on the long-on boundary, but the umpire correctly ruled bowler Tinashe Panyangara had overstepped and the batsman made sure they were punished. He fell to the final ball, skying a catch to midwicket, but by then it was damage limitation for the Zimbabweans. Between them, Gayle and his batting partner Marlon Samuels (right) scored all their team's runs . Gayle survived a scare early on after Zimbabwe bowler Tinashe Panyagara's lbw appeal . In reply, Zimbabwe lost Regis Chakabva cheaply to Jason Holder and the rain covers came out with the score 18-1, but play resumed less than 20 minutes later with a new revised target for 363 with the loss of two overs. Hamilton Masakadza (five) lost his wicket soon after as he was bowled lbw by Jerome Taylor and the Zimbabwean wickets continued to tumble as opener Sikandar Raza, who was their biggest threat hitting five fours in his 26-run total, fell to a well-taken catch from Lendl Simmons in the deep off Holder. Tendai Chatara of Zimbabwe is bowled during his country's response to Gayle's fireworks . Brendan Taylor (foreground) falls onto his back as he evades a bouncer delivered by Andre Russell (right) Gayle had the last laugh and celebrated the wicket of Zimbabwe's Stuart Matsikenyeri . Brendan Taylor (37) and Williams began to steady the ship with a fourth-wicket partnership of 80 before the former fell victim to Samuels and Williams' (76) time at the crease came to an end in the 28th over as Holder claimed his third wicket. Jerome Taylor (three for 38) dropped Craig Ervine on the boundary a ball after Zimbabwe had reached the 200 mark but Gayle claimed his scalp for 52 shortly after and Stuart Matsikenyeri (19) followed, bowled lbw to the double centurion. Panyangara (four) and Elton Chigumbura (21) - caught by Gayle at extra-cover - were both skittled by Jerome Taylor to leave Zimbabwe with a mountain to climb before they crumbled to defeat with Tendai Chatara (16) the last man to fall.","Chris Gayle is the first person to score a double century at the World Cup .

"A drunk Chinese man fell into a container full of raw sewage when he took a short cut home from the pub in the hope of avoiding an argument with his wife. Chi Fang, 42, had spent the evening drinking with friends in his home city of Wuhu in eastern China's Anhui District when his wife called and ordered him to come home immediately. Leaving the pub as quickly as he could, Mr Chi decided to take a quick route home, passing over a bridge that would usually shave several minutes off his journey and potentially spare him a confrontation with his furious wife. Nauseous from all the alcohol he had consumed, Mr Chi was forced to stop to be sick but he unfortunately lent too far over the railing and toppled off the bridge into a tank full of sewage. Drunk: Chi Fang, 42, fell into a container full of raw sewage when he took a short cut home from the pub in the hope of avoiding an argument with his wife . Describing his ordeal, Mr Chi said: 'It was very dark and I was feeling a bit queasy so I lent over a railing which I thought was part of a bridge. 'I can't exactly remember what happened next, but I suddenly fell over the edge, and head first into the sewage,' he added. 'At first I thought it was water, until I became aware of the smell...That sobered me up pretty quickly,' Mr Chi went on to say. Having fallen into a vat of raw faeces, Mr Chi's mobile phone stopped working, so he was forced to shout for help until a group of passers-by eventually called the emergency services. A police spokesman said: 'When we arrived it was difficult to see where he was as he was covered in sewage and completely black. 'We eventually spotted him though and managed to haul him out, which was very unpleasant.'

'It's like being with a child sometimes,' she added. Mrs Chi forced her disgraced husband to spend the rest of the night sleeping in their pet dog's kennel, but even there he wasn't welcome.

"Andy and Jamie Murray could team up in their own backyard to form a highly-charged doubles partnership for Great Britain against the USA in next week's Davis Cup first round in Glasgow. The less celebrated Murray sibling was recalled to the GB side for the first time since 2011 when the squad was announced on Tuesday morning for the prestigious fixture starting a week on Friday at the Emirates Arena. There is every likelihood that he and his brother will be thrown into the doubles to tackle the world number one twins Bob and Mike Bryan, although Captain Leon Smith has also included GB doubles number two Dom Inglot as another option. Andy Murray is set to play in all three of Great Britain's Davis Cup matches against USA next month . Murray could be partnered in the doubles alongside his brother Jamie for the clash at the Glasgow Arena . Jamie Murray has earned his place having reviving his career in the last two years after it had slipped into the doldrums. He is now ranked the world's 31st doubles player following victory in the ATP Brisbane Open and reaching the final in Rotterdam earlier this month with Australian foil John Peers. The presence of him and Andy in the team promises to make it an emotional three days, as this will be the first time they have played in Scotland since his younger brother won the Wimbledon title. The world number three is likely to have to take on the responsibility of playing three days in a row, although that could depend on the outcome of the first two singles matches. This will be the first tie in the elite World Group knockout held in the UK since 2002, with the winners going through to face either France or Germany in the last eight. The doubles could decide the tie unless James Ward can produce one of his outstanding Davis Cup performances and upset one of the higher ranked Americans as second singles player. Yorkshire youngster Kyle Edmund will be the travelling reserve. Jamie Murray (right) has been recalled to the GB side for the first time since 2011 after an upturn in form . 'From a selection point of view we've been able to choose our strongest possible team which is spearheaded by Andy Murray who is significantly ahead of where he was 12 months ago,' said Smith. 'The tie will be a huge deal for him personally as he returns to play in Scotland for the first time since winning Wimbledon in 2013. In James Ward we have somebody who has already proven himself against the US Davis Cup team, and I'd back him again to put in another excellent performance after some consistent recent form has seen him on the verge of cracking the top 100 for the first time. 'I've selected our top two doubles players in Jamie and Dom, and again they've showed real consistency this year to earn their place in the team. As a group, all the guys deserve this opportunity.' The American team, captained by Jim Courier, is expected to be made up of world No 20 John Isner, No 44 Steve Johnson and the world champion Bryan brothers .

"England bought themselves time with their win against Scotland to ponder whether they have the best batting combination to make a World Cup impact. The protracted nature of this tournament means England, with one match in the next 14 days, can carefully consider if they should finally let Alex Hales loose when they meet Sri Lanka on Sunday. England on Tuesday returned to Wellington, scene of their criminal defeat by New Zealand, where the immediate World Cup future of Gary Ballance will be very much at the top of their agenda in the coming days. Alex Hales - who has yet to appear at this World Cup - hits out during training in Wellington last week . The brilliance of Moeen Ali in the 119-run win over the Scots papered over the cracks in the England batting line-up that were epitomised by Ballance. England’s decision to bring Ballance in at the last minute ahead of their World Cup opener against Australia has yet to be justified, with the Yorkshireman looking out of form in scoring 10 in each of the three matches. That means England must decide whether they should resist more changes and give Ballance another chance to show he can be as effective in one-day cricket as he was in the Test game last summer or introduce the dynamism of Hales. Gary Ballance trudges off after another poor innings comes to an end against Scotland . Moeen Ali has been England's standout batsman so far after his hundred against Scotland . Hales in an intriguing one. His Twenty20 form appeared to guarantee a proper chance in 50-over cricket but India exposed limitations in his technique last summer that led to England preferring Moeen at the top of the order. There have also been concerns about his discipline and attitude but Mark Ramprakash, the England batting coach, made a point of praising Hales' maturity when he said last week that the Notts batsman was ‘knocking hard on the door.’ The question is, if England do not trust Hales enough to give him a chance now, presumably at three with James Taylor continuing at six, then there is little point in him being here and they should have brought a different spare batsman. Hales watches on from behind the stumps as Ballance lets fly during training in Wellington . England could, of course, go back to Ravi Bopara and give themselves an extra bowling option too but they seem to have lost all faith in his bowling while believing his batting in the Tri-series did not warrant a place here now. It seemed illogical for England to change a settled line-up at the 11th hour before this World Cup but, three games in, they need to have a good hard look at Hales in the nets over the next four days and not be afraid to make a switch again.","England have lost two of their opening three World Cup matches .

"When Phil Mickelson, five times a major winner, begins checking his green maps standing over a three foot putt, it is fair to assume he is feeling a little tense. Even on the first morning of the first day, the Ryder Cup can do that to a guy. Even a cool guy like Mickelson. He stayed calm enough to drop it, though. And as it fell, Paul McGinley's marquee pairing went down the hole with it. Rory McIlroy and Sergio Garcia, the world number one and number three, had no way back from there. Mickelson saved his best for last, his birdie on the 18th giving America an unassailable and perfectly timed lead in the Friday session. To be fair, it probably didn't need to be Mickelson's absolute best. The European didn't play well enough to provoke that. Mickelson made his four via a bunker, but so abject was the performance of the European pair on the final hole that this was still plenty good enough. Rory McIlroy and Phil Mickelson watch on during their fourballs encounter on Friday morning . McIlroy didn't enjoy his best morning on the first day of the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles . The world No 1 was unusually insipid when the European team were looking to him to lead from the front . VIDEO McIlroy saves point . Neither McIlroy nor Garcia made the green of Gleneagles ultimate par five in the regulation three shots. At one stage Garcia chipped from rough straight into a bunker. McIlroy was barely in contention, either. He had a dreadful first round, with the European team looking to him to set the standard. It was a close game, but one that Europe certainly could have won. If McIlroy had delivered even an approximation of the game that has taken him to the pinnacle of golf's rankings, it would have been too much for the opposing pair. Instead, he was insipid, Garcia inconsistent, and America cleaned up at the death. Europe led by a hole coming away from the 15th, but Keegan Bradley eagled the 16th and Mickelson won the last to give European captain McGinley plenty to consider at the turnaround. In Medinah, last time out, 12 of the 28 matches went to the last hole, and Europe collected nine and a half points from those games. Here, two went the distance in the morning and Europe gleaned half a point. To see McIlroy and Garcia fall so dramatically was a particularly crushing blow. 'Find McIlroy and break him,' was the instruction of Paul Azinger, the last American captain to win the Ryder Cup. What impact this defeat was going to have remained to be seen, but it was certainly a positive start for Tom Watson's stars and stripes. Having got their noses in front late, nobody expected to see Europe's strongest pair crumble so spectacularly. Mickelson shakes the hands of Europe's Garcia and McIlroy after beating the pair . Sergio Garcia (left) and McIlroy leave the 18th green dejected after surrendering a point . The American Keegan Bradley celebrates with a victory punch after winning the 16th hole . Not that Mickelson and Bradley are inferiors as a unit. At the end of the morning session, they were on the best run of any American duo at a Ryder Cup since Larry Nelson and Lanny Wadkins in 1979. Yet the golf played did not have to be that of a great partnership. Indeed, anyone expecting a masterclass from players of such pedigree would have left this corner of Perthshire sorely disappointed. Far from an exhibition, this was something altogether earthier. A scrap, a dust-up, a bundle in the playground. The match fluctuated because the performances fluctuated, and wildly. McIlroy played the first home like the world number one, and the second like a club handicapper. Find McIlroy, as Azinger suggested? It would have been hard because he spent so much time in unfamiliar surroundings: off to the left in heavy rough, short in greenside bunkers. Nerves make the Ryder Cup special, but this better resembled a monthly medal, particularly on the long holes that professionals relish. The Northern Irishman coming up against Mickelson was the blockbuster match-up of the opening day . The hole is a par five, but not one of the quartet took a shot off it. The tone had been set even earlier. 'On the tee, Keegan Bradley,' said the official starter on the first. The resulting was fired a long way left. 'On the 18th tee, Keegan Bradley,' said a jocular soul in the crowd. Bradley – identified by Europe's rabble rouser Ian Poulter as a kindred spirit in the opposing ranks – rode a lot of comments like that. 'Want tea with that slice?' crowed a voice on the fourth, as another tee shot set off along a wayward path. By the sixth – and a hole down after Garcia had chipped in from a bunker on four – even the genial Mickelson was getting tetchy. He snapped at a small party of television cameramen, who had taken a wrong turn and almost knocked him over as they tried frantically to retrace their steps along the fairway. On the eighth there was a row over whether Bradley should get relief from a lousy lie. Europe objected. 'Is there some new rule I don't know about?' asked Mickelson, tartly. Bradley's caddie, Steve Hale, was also distinctly unamused. Then again, he spent much of the morning at war with the world. Spectators, rogue cameramen, shadows, everything seemed to be getting on his wick. Keegan Bradley (left) shakes hands with Garcia with both Mickelson and McIlroy watching on . What was getting on McIlroy's wick was his game. It wouldn't come when he called it. He made precious few interventions worthy of his reputation. McIlroy won the 13th and 15th holes, to take the game from two down to all square, but on both occasions with straightforward pars to American bogeys. Meanwhile, with all the players struggling to find form, there wasn't even the predicted needle. In the phoney war that always precedes this event, Mickelson had made a jibe about the legal battle beteen McIlroy and Graeme McDowell's management company. Would McIlroy give him the cold shoulder? Hardly. On the short buggy ride up to the ninth tee, the pair shared a buggy and Mickelson put his arm around the shoulders of his young rival, laughing. McIlroy smiled back. They were both probably in need of consolation at that point. By the end, however, McIlroy was left to fend for himself.","The  Ryder Cup is underway on the PGA Centenary Course at Gleneagles .

"Chelsea have prepared a dossier of incidents featuring Jan Vertonghen, Jack Wilshere and Joe Hart to present to the Football Association as part of their appeal against Nemanja Matic's three-game ban. The Serbian midfielder was sent off by Martin Atkinson on Saturday for his reaction to Burnley forward Ashley Barnes' challenge that was labelled an 'end of career' foul by Blues manager Jose Mourinho.

"Martin Atkinson has been backed for his handling of Chelsea’s incident packed game with Burnley for ALL of his key decisions by the referees’ assessor. Jose Mourinho claimed Atkinson missed a number of key moments in the game and called for called for more technology to help officials. Mourinho felt aggrieved as Chelsea drew the game with Burnley 1-1 and saw their lead at the top of the Barclays Premier League pegged back to five points by Manchester City. Referee Martin Atkinson has been backed by the referees’ assessor for his handling of Chelsea's game . Speaking on Goals on Sunday, Mourinho said: 'They [the referees] are trying but they are not doing well. They are trying. Of course, they are trying. What I would improve? If the referee cannot see a penalty three metres in front of him, some official in front of a screen cannot miss it. 'If we want to protect the integrity and honesty of the referees, if we want to believe that the mistake is a consequence of a misinterpretation, of a bad position, of unpredictability of the situation and the game, I think technology can help. 'If I was a referee I would welcome it. Same thing with goal line technology. It makes a difference. You go one, two, three, four, five weeks without any incidents where you think goal line technology is not important, but in a certain moment goal line technology will be important. The Chelsea boss feels his side should have been given two penalties in the first half and Ashley Barnes sent off for kicking out at Branislav Ivanovic. Mourinho was left frustrated again in the 70th minute by Barnes again, this time for his challenge on Nemanja Matic – which resulted in the Chelsea midfielder seeing red for pushing the Burnley man over in retaliation. But Atkinson has been backed by referees’ assessor Steve Greaves who was in the stands at Stamford Bridge and monitoring the official's performance. Nemanja Matic was shown a straight red card for his retaliation on Ashley Barnes . This studs-up tackle from Ashley Barnes infuriated Matic and Mourinho backed up his player . Jose Mourinho went on Sky's Goals on Sunday to vent his frustration over the decisions . On the first penalty claim in the 32nd minute for a handball by Michael Kightly, Greaves wrote in his report, which has been published in The Sun, ‘correct decision as ball hit with pace from close range and didn’t see it as deliberate.’ Before the break Chelsea appealed for another penalty when Diego Costa went down after a challenge by Jason Shackell. But again, Greaves backed Atkinson. He wrote: ‘Both in real time and on DVD my opinion is that Costa is looking to go down as soon as contact is made. However, Shackell does put his hands on him so appreciate your thoughts!! Also to note, ref can’t actually see Shackell’s hands on Costa.’ Visit the official Burnley YouTube channel for more Sean Dyche and club videos . Costa looks bemused after Atkinson refused to award him a penalty after a tussle with Shackell . Barnes catches Branislav Ivanovic with his right boot during an aerial challenge in the 30th minute . Ivanovic fires a shot at goal but his effort was blocked by the raised arms of Michael Kightly . On the moment that saw Matic sent off and Barnes avoid punishment, assessor Greaves again agreed with Atkinson’s decision, he said: ‘In super slow mo it obviously looks awful, but in real time live and dvd Barnes catches him as follow through from the challenge. (Does Barnes mean to harm him?-only he knows) Also, looks worse because Matic has his foot planted…’ Greaves also supported Atkinson for sending Matic off for his retaliation. Chelsea have appealed the decision and hope that if successful that the Serbia international will be available for Sunday’s Capital One Cup final with London rivals Tottenham. Greaves has been in football for most of his life and started as a player at Fulham, Preston, Ipswich and Scunthorpe but saw his career cut short by injury and retired at 23. He moved into coaching and has worked for Ipswich and Stevenage before moving to work with the Southampton academy and coached the likes of Luke Shaw, Calum Chambers and James Ward-Prowse. He then became a referees’ assessor with the FA this season.","Referees’ assessor Steve Greaves has backed Martin Atkinson .

"It's always all about Lionel Messi at Barcelona. It has been since the ethereal teenager imposed himself on the British consciousness in a Champions League tie with Chelsea nine years ago. On Tuesday he takes on Manchester City in the Etihad and the questions surrounding him are frenzied as ever. Should he have made a late-night visit to a casino with Gerard Pique and Cesc Fabregas 24 hours after the 1-0 defeat by Malaga? Why did he play so badly against Malaga? What is his relationship with manager Luis Enrique? (Non-existent, say sources at Barcelona). And, most importantly, will the ongoing tax inquiry into his financial affairs by the Spanish authorities cause him to up and leave the club with which he has been synonymous? Lionel Messi laughs as Barcelona train ahead of their Champions League last-16 clash with Manchester City . Messi is the centre of attention as he walks towards the Etihad pitch for training on Monday evening . Gerard Pique (left) and Adriano (right) share a joke with Messi as Barcelona prepare . That is the unspoken fear around the Nou Camp. This summer there are presidential elections at Barcelona and the candidate who is able to demonstrate that he has the backing of Messi and that the Argentine will stay at the club is the candidate who will win a landslide. Just as the coach who can demonstrate he is approved by Messi, will be the coach who takes over from Enrique. The current president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, was forced to deny a report by a Catalan TV station at the turn of the year that he and Messi had come to an agreement: give 100 per cent until the end of the season and then the club will replace Enrique in the summer. Messi denied it too. And the 11-game winning run which preceded the dire defeat by Malaga at the weekend had done much to ease the tension which had bedevilled the club after Christmas. Enrique would have probably been sacked had he lost to Atletico Madrid in January but he won. And the recent run of form suddenly convinced some that three trophies might be looming, the Copa del Rey, Champions League and La Liga. But one defeat is enough these days to allow onlookers to pick open old wounds and, short of winning the league or the Champions League, those close to the club don't expect Enrique to survive the summer. And, it is acknowledged round the Nou Camp, that in order to ensure Messi doesn't decamp to Paris or London, the new coach and, if possible, the new president should have Messi's seal of approval. Barcelona boss Luis Enrique is under pressure to reach the Champions League quarter-finals . Messi looks dejected during Barcelona's home defeat on Saturday - their first loss in 12 games . It is not that his relationship with the club that is particularly bad but the ongoing tax case, with the Spanish authorities pursuing him and his father for £3m tax on image rights deals, which is said to have irked him enough to consider leaving the country. Spanish footballers and sports stars, including some of the heroes of the 2010 World Cup win, have had similar tax issues, claim Messi's team. Only the Argentine is being pursued through the courts rather than being allowed to negotiate a settlement. Aside from Messi, there are myriad problems at Barcelona at present which a new president will have to address. What is the club's vision now and where is it heading? Into the arms of Qatari money, whereby the Arab nation state sponsors not just the once-sacred team shirt but the name of the stadium as well? The club which so bewitched and dominated Europe under Pep Guardiola is no more. The world famous youth system, la cantera, has ceased to be the conveyor belt of world-class talent and the recruitment of foreign players to join it has resulted in a FIFA transfer ban for 2015; the leaders of the great team, Carles Puyol and Xavi, have retired or are feeling their age while Victor Valdes is at Manchester United; and a club which had two managers in nine years under Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola, an era which saw them win three Champions League trophies, have reverted back to type with three in three years. Barcelona last lifted the Champions League under Pep Guardiola after beating Manchester United in 2011 . The La Liga giants have had three managers in three years including Tito Vilanova, who died in April last year . Messi, pictured in action against Malaga, will be hoping to return to form against Manchester City on Tuesday . They could hardly be blamed for failing to foresee the tragic death of Tito Vilanova from cancer at the age of 45. But it appears that since he had to step down due his ill health in 2013, the club has lacked any coherent strategy. Or rather, the only strategy that does appear to dominate is: 'Keep Messi.' Keep him happy and keep him at the club. In Catalunya they have been cheering themselves in the last 48 hours by saying no-one can remember when Messi last had two bad games in succession, the inference being that Manchester City will feel the backlash from Saturday' s anonymous performance . It's quite possible of course. No-one who watches football needs reminding of Messi's genius. Prior to Saturday night, everyone in Barcelona - players, fans, journalists - were relaxed about facing City, expecting a comfortable win over the two legs. And that is still the most likely outcome. And should they win the major trophies at the end of the season, the lack of direction at the club over the past two years will doubtless be forgotten amidst the celebrations. But Real Madrid are forging ahead in La Liga at present and, if not City, then Real, Bayern or Chelsea all look capable of beating them in the Champions League. If that happens both Messi and a new president will have to answer the hardest question of all; what does Barca stand for at the moment, other than keeping Messi happy?","Barcelona face Manchester City in the Champions League on Tuesday .

"On Monday the likes of Ander Herrera, Juan Mata and Radamel Falcao enjoyed kickabouts with kids in schools across Manchester for United's admirable foundation. Across the city, Manuel Pellegrini and Samir Nasri were facing the world's media ahead of Tuesday's Champions League visit of Barcelona. Things have changed in these parts with the blue half seemingly in the ascendency after decades of red dominance. Here, Sportsmail examines whether Manchester City are now a bigger club than Manchester United... Colombian striker Radamel Falcao shows off his dribbling during a school visit on Monday . Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri (left) shares a joke with manager Manuel Pellegrini on Monday . RECENT HISTORY . City undoubtedly hold the upper hand. Two Premier League titles in three years have been greeted deliriously by the previously success-starved blue half of Manchester. This year they are locked in a two-horse race with Chelsea, with United lagging behind in the chasing pack as the home straight looms large. The noisy neighbours have cranked up the volume to 11 and it appears to be stuck there. Getting past Barcelona in the Champions League will see them hit the next level on their upwards trajectory. The Manchester City squad trained ahead of their Champions League clash with Barcelona on Tuesday . Angel di Maria and David de Gea visited a school as United  enjoyed time off with no European commitments . United, on the other hand, are facing a fight to avoid a second season without Champions League football. Currently in fourth, Louis van Gaal's men have a season-defining run-in with a resurgent Liverpool breathing down their necks. The Dutchman has a track record that cannot be questioned and should be judged after next season, but at the moment they are lagging behind their cross-town rivals. OVERALL HISTORY . Not even a contest. United's haul of trophies and City's barren decades make for some lopsided scorelines. Top-flight titles? That'll be 20 to four. European Cups? Three to none. FA Cups? 11 to five. The Stone Roses sang 'the past was yours but the future's mine,' in She Bangs the Drums and City fans believe this so firmly they had the lyrics put on a banner. Manchester City celebrate winning the Premier League last season - their second title in three years . Manchester United celebrate winning the 2008 Champions League - their third European title overall . TRANSFER MARKET . United's summer frenzy had many wondering if Dale Winton had gone on location to film a one-off Supermarket Sweep at Old Trafford. Ed Woodward, keen not to leave his new manager without stock, waltzed down the transfer aisle, lobbing the likes of Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria into his red trolley as the clock ticked towards deadline. There will be no repeat this summer with targets already identified and work underway. This is an approach akin to that now used at City, who these days tend to do their business quickly and, where possible, under the radar. Financial Fair Play sanctions, which the club still believe were unjustified, have stopped them from widening the gap even further. SQUAD . Again, City have the upper hand. As Van Gaal continues to search for the right formula City's old guard is again clicking into gear. Pellegrini has two quality players vying for each position. The spine of his team, Vincent Kompany, Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero would appear to be going nowhere. City have a strong squad that has been improved over a few seasons, leaving them in second in the league . An indication of how much things have changed came in the season's first derby, when City fans drfited away from the Etihad Stadium a little deflated after a 1-0 win that, only a few years ago, would have been deliriously received. TURNOVER . Often used to measure club size, City turned over a record £347million last year which they believe will rise again this time around. Executives are confident that for the first time since their Abu Dhabi takeover, the club will post a profit. Commercial income was £166m, by far a club record, and more partnerships have since been announced. Across town, however, United remain ahead. Last year, they turned over a record £433.2m and made a profit of £23.9m. Their commercial intake was £189.3m. Radamel Falcao poses outside United's sponsored training ground at Carrington . This time around the club have forecast that, thanks mainly to the impact of no Champions League football, turnover will drop below £400m. It could mean that, for the first time in living memory, City's turnover is more than that of their rivals. That said, United's record kit deal with adidas and rapidly expanding commercial machine should see a sharp swelling in the Old Trafford coffers in 2015-16. Officials remain relaxed about the large chunk of Glazer debt that remains (£380.5m). FANBASE . Domestically and internationally United continue to lead the way. They regularly attract crowds of 75,000 to Old Trafford - around 30,000 more than City get at the Etihad Stadium. That gap is expected to narrow when City complete the first phase of their stadium expansion which will see capacity rise above 55,000. A recent survey commissioned by City executives claimed that their global fanbase had expanded at the astonishing rate of 500 per cent in just three years. Juan Mata and his team-mates regularly play in front of 75,000 supporters during home games . City have plans in place to expand the capacity of the Etihad Stadium to 55,000 . The same figures claimed the club now had 37.97m followers across the world. That is dwarfed by the figure United famously use, which states that they have 659m supporters on the planet. This area is hard to measure. Woodward recently pointed out in a call to investors, however, that four of the top five US TV soccer audiences were for United matches. City will no doubt take solace that their recent 1-1 draw with Chelsea attracted 1.34m viewers Stateside, a rise of 316 per cent from the 324,000 who watched the same fixture in 2010. INFRASTRUCTURE . It might not seem like it, with more than £1.15bn spent in six years, but from the start City's Abu Dhabi ownership wanted to make the club a sustainable model. A big part of that process was getting the infrastructure right. When the new owners arrived they were stunned to find an ill-equipped training ground and a Premier League club with no HR department or chief finance officer. Under the guidance of chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak, the transformation on the pitch has been mirrored by that off it. The £200m City Football Academy is one of the finest facilities in world football while the number of staff at the club dwarfs what it was just over half a decade ago. Add to that sister clubs in Melbourne and New York and City appear well-equipped for an assault on global domination. United's Carrington training ground, pictured in 2006, is being changed by Van Gaal . An aerial view of the City's new football academy which was launched in December last year . At the last count, United had a Red Army of 837 full-time staff. Many of those are based in their Mayfair office. When it comes to capitalising on the Premier League's global appeal, United are second to none and got a head start on many of their rivals. While Carrington is world class, Van Gaal ordered a number of renovations shortly after his arrival which should stand them in good stead. The club's academy continues to churn out footballers but, given the changing nature of the game, the success of the Class of '92 may never be repeated. CONCLUSION . United remain the biggest club and should do so for the foreseeable future. That is not to say that the gap has not been substantially narrowed. The longer City remain the dominant force on the field the more danger United will find themselves in of one day being overtaken. Many more seasons without Champions League football could have a dramatic impact. For generations, with City a laughing stock, United considered Liverpool their main rivals. Some will stubbornly say that will never change. It already has, both on the field and off it.","Manchester City have won two Premier League titles in three years .

"They were tried through YouTube and hanged by remote control as hundreds captured their agonising last moments on mobile phones. But though the deaths of Alireza Mafiha and Mohammad Ali Sarvari had all the accoutrements of the 21st century, the essence of their executions was medieval. The pair, executed for robbery, were paraded before a baying crowd of 300 in a public park at the centre of the Iranian capital, Tehran. Shocking: Iranians witness the public execution of Alireza Mafiha and Mohammad Ali Sarvari in Tehran. The two men posted a video on YouTube in December showing them robbing and assaulting a man with a machete .

Seconds later both he was dead along with accomplice  Alireza Mafiha (right) in a very public display by Iran's hardline government . Amid the howls of grief and rage, a . judge recounted their crime and delivered the verdict, that they would . be hanged for ‘waging war against God.’ Sarvari seemed stoical. But the . desperate Mafiha broke down and laid his head on the shoulder of a . balaclava-clad Iranian police officer who put an arm around his back. Moments later nooses were looped . around their necks as a group of women at the front of the crowd begged . their captors for forgiveness. Their pleas fell on deaf ears. As the . sun came up on Sunday morning, the executioners pressed the buttons to . trigger their deaths. Alireza Mafiha and Mohammad Ali Sarvari were hanged after a YouTube video (pictured) was aired on Iranian state television showing them attacking a man . Mafiha, aged 23, and Sarvari, 20, . were raised up by two extending cranes to a height of around 15 feet. They were dead within seconds. The pair had been arrested after . posting a video on YouTube in December showing them attacking a man with . a machete on a Tehran street. It showed four masked men on . motorbikes approaching their victim before assaulting him with a machete . and taking his bag and jacket. The 37-second clip was later shown on . Iranian television and caused outrage in an urban population terrified . by rising crime levels, . Mafiha and Sarvari, who are both unemployed, were arrested along with two other men. Alireza Mafiha and Mohammad Ali Sarvari were convicted of 'waging war against God' when they carried out this attack on a man in Tehran . The YouTube video showed four masked men on motorbikes approaching their victim before two attacked him with a machete before stealing his jacket and bag . According to the Iranian Students News Agency, Mafiha had told his trial they had committed the crime because they were poor. But this defence did not bring them . any leniency from the authorities who have employed the harshest of . methods to deal with relatively minor crimes. They were convicted of 'waging war . against God' - a broad charge that can cover actions ranging from . anti-state organising to violent assaults which under Iran's . interpretation of Islamic law is punishable by death. The pairs’ accomplices have been . sentenced to ten years in jail and 74 lashes. They will then be exiled . to a smaller town for five years. Iran carries out one of the world's highest number of annual executions, according to rights group Amnesty International. But most take place in prisons and a public hanging is very rare.

"More than one in three families are prepared to take children out of school during term time to avoid rip-off holiday prices. Warning letters from head teachers and the threat of a £60 fine are apparently not enough to deter parents from breaking the rules. New research shows the scale of rise in the cost of a family holiday once the schools break for summer is potentially more than £1,000. Life's a beach: Warning letters from head teachers and the threat of a £60 fine are apparently not enough to deter parents from breaking the rules on taking children out of school during term time (file picture) Consequently, when families are suffering the longest cost of living squeeze on record many find taking a holiday in term time is the only way they can afford to take a break. A price comparison by the Nationwide Building Society found a family holiday at Center Parcs during the official school summer holidays was £890 more - £1,928 versus £1,038. Similarly, a family trip to Disneyland Paris was almost £400 more if taken during the official break. Going further afield on a package holiday to Spain, which is the nation’s favourite summer destination, was more than £1,000 more once the schools break up. Nationwide found that 37 per cent of parents admitted they had taken their children out of school to get a good deal on a holiday. Varying prices: A family trip to Disneyland Paris was almost £400 more if taken during the official break . Government rules state that parents can . be fined £60 per child for ‘unauthorised absence’ during term time. However, that is tiny in the context of the holiday price savings. 'With the current challenging economic environment, it’s no wonder that families are looking to shave their holiday costs' Graham Pilkington, Nationwide . Nationwide’s director of banking, Graham . Pilkington, said: ‘With the current challenging economic environment, . it’s no wonder that families are looking to shave their holiday costs.’ He said parents can try and stay within the rules and cut the cost of going away by using price comparison websites and retailer loyalty schemes, which offer money off hotel stays or visits to theme parks. Mr Pilkington warned that while there are savings to be made, these have to be offset against the extra cost of childcare during the official school holidays when parents will be back at work. A study published last year identified rising numbers of primary school pupils were playing truant, with more than 23,000 skipping lessons each day of the spring term this year. Flexibility: Education Secretary Michael Gove (pictured in May 2010 at a school in Edmonton, north London) has announced plans to give schools greater freedom over the length of terms and holidays from September 2015 . Parents who took their children on term-time holidays without permission were responsible for a fifth of ‘unauthorised absences’ recorded by primary schools. Education Secretary Michael Gove has announced plans to give schools greater freedom over the length of terms and holidays from September 2015. This could end the current system when most schools are off for the same six weeks in the summer, making them a captive market for holiday companies and airlines who cash in by hiking their prices. Spreading the demand for holidays over a longer period through the summer months, with some schools breaking in early July, might lead to lower prices.","Family holidays can rise by over £1,000 once schools break for summer .

"For all the fuss of Barcelona players entering a casino, a point seemed to get missed. The odds are that it was the croupiers who ended the night exhausted and nursing an addiction. Has there ever been such a compelling group of players as those who have played for Barcelona over the past 10 years, Catalan teams that have been so easy to look at but also so magnificently efficient in pursuit of trophies? They tick the boxes, one by one. They play beautiful football, they win and their best players have been homegrown. When they lose, it’s a head-spinning crisis of hysteria. But they don’t lose much and that is why they are special. They have longevity. Gerard Pique (left) and Lionel Messi were spotted at a Barcelona casino in the early hours of Monday morning . Both were in action as Barcelona trained on Monday ahead of their Champions League tie at Manchester City . The Catalan club will be aiming to put behind them their weekend defeat to Malaga with a good result at City . Messi looks on crestfallen following Malaga's goal at the Nou Camp on Saturday afternoon . It will be 10 years this spring since they ended their five-season La Liga drought. In that time they have won the title six times, the Copa del Rey twice and the Champions League three times. It’s not a perfect club; they are not the wholesome organisation they were once conveyed as – witness the Neymar tax scandal and their ban from signing players in 2015 – but they are not quite the UNICEF-protected conspirators of Jose Mourinho’s imagination either. Whatever the true morality of the club’s business, they have repeatedly produced brilliant football teams that are better to watch than any other. And now they arrive in Manchester needing to clear a hurdle. It is lost on no-one that three entire seasons have passed since their symbolic day at Wembley in 2011. It is the longest stretch the club have gone without winning the Champions League since Frank Rijkaard bought back into this tiki-taka business a decade or so ago. The signs are that the era might be drawing to a close. That 2011 class of Messi, Xavi and Iniesta was as good as it gets. After Manchester United were demolished in the Wembley final, Sir Alex Ferguson said: ‘No one has ever given us a hiding like that.’ It's been three seasons since Barcelona were last crowned as kings of Europe - in 2011 at Wembley . Midfielder Andres Iniesta (left) was outstanding as Barca swept aside Manchester United 3-1 in that final . Wembley was where the dream team of 1992 had won their first European Cup. Ahead of that final Pep Guardiola spent the night arguing with Andoni Zubizarreta about how many steps they would have to climb to get the trophy. The stadium, in essence, is central to their history. And the 2011 final, with seven youth-teamers in the 11, was the ideal, perfectly-executed conclusion to a narrative. But was it the conclusion to this era? As it happens, Messi, in his battle for the ages with Cristiano Ronaldo, followed that Champions League win with his two most prolific seasons. Mind-boggling scoring figures. But three seasons have yielded only one La Liga title and one Copa del Rey. Not shabby, but not ideal. Xavi is 35 and an unused substitute in five of the past seven Barcelona games. Andres Iniesta is 30. Icons drifting away. The test, should they get past Manchester City, is for Luis Enrique to prove he can build another great side. It will inevitably be led by Messi – Enrique will know there is little merit or job security in upsetting him (not to mention the fact he is going nowhere by virtue of Financial Fair Play) – and Neymar is of gold standard. Luis Suarez has more to prove. Barca manager Luis Enrique (centre) is hoping his reign  can emulate the club's recent success . Messi (centre) will undoubtedly be the catalyst if Barcelona are to dominate Europe once more . Neymar will also prove pivotal to future Barca success - especially short-term following their transfer ban . Luis Suarez (centre) will be hoping to score on his first return to England since leaving Liverpool last summer . There is scope to develop another great side. But just as Spain’s time was up at the World Cup, it is natural to wonder if Barcelona’s slip from extraordinary to very good is a long-term deal. It is natural to wonder what they can do without the ability to sign players this year. The nervousness around the club is tangible. The club won 11 games in a row and defeat against Malaga has coaxed out a few neuroses from fans. The confidence, at times, feels as sturdy as a house of cards. Against that backdrop, who would bet against the best club of recent history now showing Manchester City that class is permanent? Real Madrid 2 Barcelona 6, May 2009 . One of the most astonishing Clasico matches of recent times. Xavi assisted four and Messi scored two (he could have had five more). Andres Iniesta described it as ‘the best Clasico of all time’ and Messi was heralded as ‘Maradona, Cruyff and Best all rolled into one’. Barcelona 5 Real Madrid 0, November 2010 . The 6-2 win was remarkable but folk of Barcelona consider this an even greater victory. And Messi didn’t even score, though it was rated one of his most complete performances. Xavi said: ‘When we got into the dressing room after the game we gave ourselves a standing ovation.’ Barcelona 3 Manchester United 1, Champions League final, May 2011 . Arguably the finest moment of Barcelona’s best crop of players. Ferguson admitted that ‘no-one has ever given us a hiding like that’. Messi scored Barca’ s second and was named man of the match. Ronaldinho goal versus Chelsea in 2005 . It was a strike in a 4-2 defeat in the Champions League, but the brilliance of the moment should not be understated. With a single the flick of his boot from the edge of the area, Ronaldinho wrong-footed three Chelsea defenders and Petr Cech. They lost but it was a truly wonderful piece of skill. Barcelona v Albacete, May 2005 . It was not a big game. But it was a huge moment – Messi scored his first goal for the club. He came on as a substitute and scored a lob within 17 seconds. It was disallowed for offside so he did it again before celebrating in Ronaldinho’s arms. It made the 17-year-old the youngest scorer in Barcelona’s history and he has since gone on to break more than a few other records.","Manchester City host Barcelona in Tuesday's Champions League last-16 tie .

"Ryan Giggs insists Manchester United's commitment to youth development remains strong. The recent sale of academy graduate Danny Welbeck and the heavy spending of the summer transfer window have suggested priorities could be changing at Old Trafford. United have a proud record of having at least one homegrown player in every matchday squad since 1937 - a statistic that could now be under threat following Welbeck's departure. Ryan Giggs claimed that Manchester United and Louis van Gaal are committed to youth development . But Giggs - himself one of United's greatest youth products - denies that is the case. Giggs, who is now assistant manager under new boss Louis van Gaal, said: 'The club will never change. The history of the club is to play exciting football, always give youngsters a chance, keep to the traditions of the club. 'Okay Danny has left, which is obviously disappointing because you never want to see a homegrown player leave, but this is a manager who gave Seedorf his chance, Kluivert his chance, Iniesta his chance, Xavi, Thomas Muller - he has got a track record of giving youngsters a chance. 'Tyler Blackett has played every game this season. Underneath (Robin) Van Persie and (Wayne) Rooney you have got (Adnan) Januzaj, James Wilson. Academy graduate Tyler Blackett has played in every single Manchester United game this season . 'Players will leave but we have got to make sure young players come through because United fans demand it. I want to see young players come through. 'That has been (the case) right through the history of Manchester United and we never want to lose that.' United spent more than £150million over the summer in a major squad rebuild following the disappointments of last season, when they finished seventh in the Barclays Premier League and failed to qualify for Europe. Among the high-profile new arrivals are British record £60m signing Angel di Maria and Monaco star Radamel Falcao, on loan. Van Gaal gave opportunities to the likes of Iniesta, Xavi and Thomas Muller when they were young . Another former youth star, Nicky Butt, who now has a coaching role with the United under-21 side, accepts the club had to play catch-up. Butt, speaking alongside Giggs at the Soccerex Global Convention in Manchester, said: 'I think all clubs are changing. 'I think Man Utd was probably one of the last outstanding ones that had the connection between youth and the first team - to be fair to Liverpool now they are doing that very well - but we are still trying to do that. Manchester United sold Danny Welbeck to Arsenal for £16m, despite the north London club being rivals . 'The Danny thing is just something that has come at a certain time in the club's history. 'Danny wasn't playing in the position he wanted to play in, the club now only has so many games, we're not in Europe. 'I think it is a case of being fair to the player and fair to the club, with someone with Danny's ability who has international credentials and wants his England place. 'It is not a case of giving up on youngsters, giving up on the Academy. 'It is a case of getting the club back to where it needs to be. That is the first priority, to get back to winning ways.'","Manchester United are committed to youth development .

"Dutchman Florentijn Hofman could well be the world's unluckiest artist. The 37-year-old has already had to endure having his installation of a giant rubber duck stabbed 42 times, attacked by an eagle and washed away in a storm.

Hofman had been commissioned to create the 82ft tall 'Moon Rabbit' for the Taoyuan Land Arts Festival in Taoyuan County northern Taiwan, where it had proved a big hit with visitors. But at the end of the 11 day festival, as workers were disassembling the huge sculpture, a fire, believed to have started by sparks from a chainsaw, tore through the rabbit's torso and paws. A spokesman for Taoyuan County's Department of Cultural Affairs said: 'The workers have disassembled and set aside the rabbit's ears and head before removing the limbs of the rabbit'. Aftermath: The Moon Rabbit was gutted by the blaze which is believed to have been started by sparks from a chainsaw . Flammable: The rabbit had been made from Tyvek a waterproof, paper-like material used in the construction industry. It had been positioned lying on its back on a grass bunker staring up at the moon .

"Juventus midfielder Andrea Pirlo has set his sights on Champions League glory this season as the Turin club looks to regain its place at European football's high table. Pirlo has been central to his team's push for a fourth successive Serie A title this term, but the 35-year-old playmaker knows that it is on the continent that Juve must impress to be considered a force again, against the backdrop of Italian football's waning reputation. Indeed, with many Italian clubs' star players moving abroad, the division is not as respected as it once was. Juve last won the Champions League in 1996 and last reached the final in 2003, but were eliminated from last year's competition at the group stage. Juventus playmaker Andrea Pirlo is targeting Champions League glory with the club this season . With Serie A's reputation waning, Juventus will do well to keep hold of star talents such as Paul Pogba . Juve striker Carlos Tevez is attracting interest from abroad and will need an incentive to stay in Turin . Now, as Paul Pogba and Carlos Tevez are attracting interest from foreign suitors, Pirlo feels that stepping up in the Champions League is the only way for Juve to be considered a powerful force once again and retain their best assets. Speaking to La Stampa newspaper ahead of his team's tie with Borussia Dortmund in the competition's last 16, he said, 'I came to Juve in order to win. I am very happy but now we must make the next step up the ladder.' 'I'd like to win another Champions League before retiring,' added Pirlo who won two Champions League titles with AC Milan in 2003 and 2007. Juve manager Massimiliano Allegri meanwhile, recognised Pirlo's unwavering quality despite the midfielder's age.

"Smoking in a car carrying children will become a criminal offence after MPs last night backed a ban in the Commons by a large majority. In an historic vote, Tory and Lib Dem MPs backed plans to make it illegal to light up in a car in England, punishable by a £60 fine or points on a motorist’s licence. It came after Prime Minister David Cameron the ’time has come’ for a ban, brushing aside claims from his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg who branded the ban illiberal and unenforceable. MPs have overwhelmingly backed a bill which will make smoking in cars containing children illegal by next year . The new law will apply to anyone carrying children in a car, not just parents. MPs voted by 376 votes to 107, majority 269, in favour of an amendment to the Children and Families Bill which gives the Health Secretary power to impose a ban. It is expected to come into effect before the election, most likely in April next year. The move was first introduced in the House of Lords by the Labour party, and coalition parties were given a free vote which means they can vote with their conscience and not the party line. During 90 minutes of debate in the Commons supporters of the legislation insisted it was vital to protect children from the dangers of second hand smoke. Tory health minister Jane Ellison said the success of the new law would be measured not by the number of fines issues but ’by the reduction in exposure to second-hand smoke’. Labour's shadow health minister Luciana Berger Labour MP Luciana Berger proposed the ban, arguing that laws governing seat belts and smoking in public places were criticised as unenforceable but had been very effective. She said last night: ‘This is a great victory for child health which will benefit hundreds of thousands of young people across our country. It is a matter of child protection, not adult choice.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (pictured visiting Burrowbridge in Somerset this morning) branded the law unenforceable and illiberal . Mr Clegg said the police could not be expected to enforce a ban on smoking in cars, likening it to controlling what children eat or watch on TV . But opponents said it was further evidence if the ’nanny state’ seeking to interfere in the private lives of drivers. Tory . MP Anne Main condemned the ’illiberal, nonsensical legislation’ adding: . ’I fundamentally believe we should not be making bad, unenforceable . law.’ Fellow Conservative, Shipley MP, Philip Davies said the law was ’yet another in a long line of triumphs for the nanny state’. He . accused Miss Berger of representing the ’smug, patronising excesses of . New Labour who think that the only reason they have come into Parliament . is to ban everybody else from all the things that they don't happen to . like themselves’. Just hours before tonight’s vote Mr Cameron gave the ban is support. Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury said he would back the ban, putting him at odds with Nick Clegg . London Mayor Boris Johnson said the 'bossyboots brigade' were right to want to ban smoking in cars carrying children . Three . years ago the Prime Minister said he was 'not sure whether it is . possible to legislate in that area' and called for a 'change in . attitudes'. earlier today Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb said he hoped the ban would be law before the 2015 general election . But today Downing Street made clear that while Mr Cameron . understands the ’concerns’ that some have expressed, he believes that . ’the time for this kind of approach has come’. However, Mr Cameron is spending 24 hours touring flood-hit communities in the South West so missed the vote. Among . Tories, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Transport Secretary Patrick . McLoughlin and Education Secretary Michael Give were among senior . ministers supporting a ban. London Mayor Boris Johnson appealed to . fellow Tories to accept that the 'bossyboots brigade' he so often rails . against were right in this case. ’These kids cannot protest, and very . often the smoker in the vehicle lacks the will to stub it out,’ he . wrote in the Daily Telegraph. ’This law would give that smoker that . extra legal imperative to obey their conscience and do the right thing.' Ahead of the vote senior Tories including Eric Pickles and Kenneth Clarke voiced doubts about it. Among . Lib Dems, Mr Clegg - who is a smoker - said that ‘as an old-fashioned . liberal’ he believed that ‘laws and legislation are not always the . solution’. He said it was wrong to ‘subcontract responsible parenting . to the state’ and likened it to the police going ‘into people’s homes . and saying “turn the televisions off”’. However, Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander and Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb backed the ban. Ken Clarke, the cigar-smoking minister without portfolio, said police would not spend their time checking if people were lighting up in cars . Split:  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he . would back the ban, but Lib . Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable committed to voting against it . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is to back a ban, after previously warning it was not the state's tole to dictate what people do in private . Nick Clegg, . the cigarette-smoking Deputy Prime Minister:‘A family speeding along . the M4 and mum or dad are smoking, how on earth are you going to . properly enforce that?’ Ken Clarke, . the cigar-smoking minister without portfolio: ‘I don't think our . traffic police are going to be concentrating enormous efforts on racing . up and down the motorway peering into cars, trying to see whether . there's a child in.' Communities Secretary Eric Pickles: ‘My initial intention is to vote against it. We should make things criminal if we feel that they are enforceable.’ Public Health Minister Jane Ellison: ‘We are not persuaded that legislation is the right way forward on that matter.’ (November 2013) Chief Whip Sir George Young: ‘I see some difficulties in trying to enforce a ban on all smoking in cars.’ (November 2011, when Commons leader) Prime Minister David Cameron: . ‘Whatever people have done in the past, the facts show that they really . should change their behaviour. I am not sure whether it is possible to . legislate in that area - we need a change in attitudes.’ (March 2011) Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung . Foundation, said: 'Nearly half a million children are exposed to . second-hand smoke in cars every week, putting them at risk of illnesses . ranging from colds and ear infections through to asthma attacks, cot . death, and meningitis. 'Bans on smoking in cars carrying children are . already successfully enforced in countries like Australia, Canada and . South Africa.’ The toxic fumes deployed from smoking in a care are 11 times more concentrated than lighting up in an open space. An . opinion poll in 2012 by YouGov found that 80 per cent of all adults and . 65 per cent of smokers backed a ban on smoking in cars with children . under 18. A Department of Health survey found 300,000 children a year . visited GPs in England every year with problems linked to second-hand . smoke. Passive smoking is linked to respiratory infections such as pneumonia and chest infections in youngsters. It can also trigger asthma attacks in sufferers and contribute to sudden unexpected infant death. Last week Ken Clarke, the cigar-smoking minister without portfolio, dismissed the plans as ‘gesture politics’. He . added: ‘We do keep creating new traffic offences. I don't think our . traffic police are going to be concentrating enormous efforts on racing . up and down the motorway peering into cars, trying to see whether . there's a child in. ‘We do create too many traffic offences, I really . do think it's gesture politics. We'll probably find two or three people . fined a year. It makes the lobbyists feel better.’ Every . year 160,000 children are adversely affected by second-hand smoking, . costing the NHS in England more than £23 million, the Royal College of . Physicians (RCP) said. John Britton, chair of the RCP's tobacco . advisory group, said: ‘The evidence shows the importance of protecting . children from passive smoking, and cars are still a major area of . exposure. ‘Such exposure is widely associated with adverse health . effects, including an increased risk of respiratory and allergic . symptoms.’ But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said he was disappointed but not surprised' by the decision and accused the Government of being 'spineless. He added: 'Legislation will have very little impact because so few adults still smoke in cars carrying children. Those that do will carry on because it will be very difficult to enforce. 'Government has banned smoking in public places. Now they're going to ban it in a private place. 'The home will be next.'","MPs back new law by 376 votes to 107, a majority of 269 .

"There is no shortage of impressive houses in Harpenden, the commuter-belt Hertfordshire town that’s home to City hedge-fund types, high-flying lawyers and the odd footballer. But none is in the same league as Flowton Priory, a  500-year-old Grade II listed Tudor mansion that has had more care and attention lavished upon it than a king’s mistress. Its ancient timber frame, oriel windows and ornate herringbone brickwork are easy to fall in love with, as businessman and racing driver David Pinkney did back in the 1980s when a friend of his, the former golf champion Ken Brown, pointed it out. Tudor Manor: Flowton Priory, a 500-year-old Grade II listed Tudor mansion in Harpenden, Hertfordshire has been put on the market for £8.75million . At that time Flowton Priory wasn’t for sale, but David never forgot it. Years later, he moved to Monaco, but asked Ken to let him know if it ever came on the market. When it did, in 1994, David put in a sealed-bid offer and won by a margin of just £4,000. The house needed renovating, and over  the next 15 years, David gave it five-star treatment. He carried out major repairs to the roof, completely rewired and replumbed the property, increased the number of bedrooms from five to seven and added  new bathrooms. He landscaped the three acres of grounds and built an elegant glazed summerhouse from which the Priory can be admired in all its Elizabethan glory. ‘I have given this house everything I could,’ says David. ‘It’s such a beautiful and special building that I wanted everything that went into it to be of the very best quality. I have spent an absolute fortune, but the house has deserved it.’ It is certainly an appropriate setting for the motor-racing trophies that fill the shelves. Until 2010, David was a leading name in the popular British Touring Car Championship, which pits high-performance versions of ordinary saloons – Hondas, Renaults, Fords – against each other at Silverstone, Brands Hatch and other well-known circuits. Sprawling gardens: The immaculate gardens at Flowton Priory in green Hertfordshire comes complete with a pond . Unique charm: One of the impressive bedrooms at Flowton Priory, still keeping with the mansions Tudor style . For brighter days: In addition to the seven bedrooms, Flowton Priory also boasts a summer house . Flowton Priory is in West Common, on  the edge of Harpenden. But it wasn’t always in this spot. Its origins are hidden in the  name. For 400 years, the Priory was in the village of Flowton in Suffolk. In the 1920s,  its owner, a member of a wealthy brewing family, had it taken down, transported west and reassembled. A tree-lined drive leads up to the metal security gates, through which you can see the house, with its nine chimneys, set in immaculate formal gardens with box hedging and lollipop-shaped Ligustrum trees. A walk through the heavy oak door into the entrance hall with an enormous chandelier takes visitors to a 36ft drawing room on the right. Driving force: David Pinkney in his racing gear . Its oak-panelled walls and huge stone inglenook fireplace date from Tudor times, as do many of the small-pane leaded windows. Some contain beautiful 16th Century stained glass, with one showing the coat of arms of Cardinal Wolsey, Henry VIII’s Lord Chancellor, who was born in Suffolk. Down the passage from the drawing room  is the pink-walled dining room with a vast antique mirror reflecting its 12-seater polished dining table. ‘We’ve had some fantastic Christmases here,’ says David. No less impressive is the 20ft square kitchen, installed by David himself. Its vaulted, beamed ceiling is supported by enormously thick timber pillars either side of a marble-topped island, above which hangs another giant chandelier. Beyond, is a sitting room, used as a den by David’s nine-year-old daughter, and a large, well-equipped utility room. A door leads out on to a pergola-covered terrace complete with a large circular dining table and barbecue. A shiny black hot tub is even equipped with a DVD player and a TV screen that rises at the touch of a button. A second staircase leads up from this end of the house to two bedrooms and a bathroom, creating a self-contained wing for guests or staff. The main 16th Century staircase takes visitors to the majestic master bedroom and a bathroom. Two more bedrooms, one each for David’s daughters, the eldest of whom is at university, and another bathroom complete this floor. David spent years collecting furniture and fittings for the house. Unfortunately, he can no longer enjoy the fruits of his labours. He and his wife have separated, so Flowton Priory must be sold. It is on the market with Savills at £8.75 million. Will David look for another project? ‘No, I couldn’t do anything like this again,’ he insists. ‘It was a fantastic experience, but it takes it out of you. The house I’m planning  to move to is a modern four-bedroom place – very nice but nothing like this. ‘I’m proud that I’ve helped preserve a piece of English history, though.’ savills.co.uk, 01582 465000 .","Grade II listed seven bedroom Flowton Priory on the market for £8.75m .

"Getting married is a nerve-wracking experience for any couple - but for this adventurous pair, their wedding required even more bravery than unusual. Renat Adykov and Maria Obryvalina decided to hold their nuptials underwater, even though neither had ever been scuba-diving before. But the two lovebirds did not let their lack of experience hold them up - and the bride even wore a veil over her wetsuit for the big day. Scroll down for video of the wedding . Couple: Renat Adykov and Maria Obryvalina got married underwater off the coast of Crete . Vows: The Russian couple used cue cards to exchange messages of love below the Libyan Sea . Brave: Neither Renat nor Maria had ever been scuba-diving before they decided to get married underwater . The couple, from Saransk in western Russia, had been together for two years before they got married earlier this month. Renat, a 28-year-old marketing manager and amateur painter, had long admired Maria, also 28, who works in a travel agency. He took six months to win her heart, and it was another six months before the couple first shared a kiss - but when they decided to get married they took a much less conservative attitude. The pair won a competition to get married in at the Kalypso Dive Center in Crete - even though their hometown in 700 miles from the nearest coast. I do! The happy couple holding up cue cards saying 'Da', the Russian word for 'Yes' You may now kiss the bride: The pair briefly removed their breathing apparatus for the first kiss . Romantic: Renat and Maria released a handful of rose petals into the water to celebrate their wedding . Renat and Maria were given a day-long course in scuba-diving - and just two days later, they embarked on their underwater nuptials. After a short ceremony on the shore, they plunged into the Libyan Sea and reached a specially built platform seven metres below the surface. There they carried out a second ceremony, lasting 20 minutes, in which they exchanged their vows with the help of plastic cue cards. Proud: The pair show off their new wedding rings at the conclusion of the ceremony . Attire: Maria was kitted out with a veil alongside her more practical wetsuit and scuba gear . Inexperienced: Maria and Renat plumped for their unique wedding even though they'd never dived . Atmospheric: The ceremony took place seven metres under the sea and lasted 20 minutes . 'I think this is the first underwater wedding ever to take place in Crete,' said Greg James of the Kalypso Dive Center. 'In the wedding with them we had five divers, including photographers and the priest - who wasn't really a priest, he was actually the owner of our business. 'Maria was a bit nervous, but in the end she was absolutely fantastic. Beautiful: The scene in the bay where the two Russian office workers sealed their marriage . Venue: The Kalypso Dive Center clims to have hosted the first underwater wedding in Crete . 'You don't have to be brave - the only thing they need to do is learn to put their face in the water, and learn that they can breathe underwater.' After the success of their first wedding ceremony, the managers of the centre are keen to do more - pointing out the unique beauty of the underwater seascape. Renat and Maria have now returned to Russia to start their new life together, saying they hope to have a son and daughter to add to the family soon.","Renata Adykov and Maria Oryvalina, from Russia, got married in the Libyan Sea just off the coast of Crete .

"Despite Arsenal confirming their interest in Carlos Vela, Real Sociedad president Jokin Apperibay says the forward wants to stay at the Basque club . The Gunners informed Sociedad of their intent to activate their £3.5m buyout clause, with the Apperibay negotiating with the club in London this week. But Vela has told Apperibay that he would like to remain in San Sebastian, rather than returning to the side he left in 2012. Close: Arsenal will seal a £3.5m deal for Real Sociedad forward Carlos Vela in the near future . Lack of opportunities: But the Gunners are keen to bring the Mexican back to the Emirates . 'We are fortunate that the player is keen to stay in San Sebastian with us and that's an important factor for Real Sociedad,' Apperibay told reporters. The president also explained that the two clubs were yet to reach an agreement for the player, who Arsenal signed back in 2005 from boyhood club Guadalajara. Arsenal are looking for a player to play back-up to current striker Olivier Giroud, as well as helping out wide, a bill which Vela fits. He has said in the past that he would be willing to adapt to the Premier League once again, but this updated news seems to distance him from a summer switch.

"John Kerry, the American Secretary of State, is in Afghanistan to try to broker a deal between the two candidates in last month’s runoff election where both are claiming victory. The dispute between the two men - former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah and former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai – is becoming ever more bitter. Preliminary results put the former World Bank economist Ashraf Ghani in the lead with 56.4 per cent of the vote. However, Mr Abdullah has rejected the count. Scroll down for video .

"Manchester United scouts have checked on Portugal midfielder William Carvalho for the eighth time this season. David Moyes's staff watched the 21-year-old schemer during Sporting Lisbon’s goalless draw with Academica on Sunday evening and their presence was reported in Portuguese newspaper O Jogo. Carvalho made his debut for Portugal in a World Cup qualifier against Sweden in November and is expected to take a place in Paulo Bento’s squad for Brazil. VIDEO: Scroll down to the the bottom to see Carvalho's audacious effort in the rain . Target: Arsenal have been watching Sporting Lisbon's William Carvalho . His contract expires in 2018 and is understood to contain a release clause in the region of £37.5million, although United would hope to negotiate a considerably cheaper deal. Real Madrid and Barcelona are also said to be monitoring the powerful midfielder who enjoyed a loan spell with Belgian club Cercle Brugge last season. Carvalho has scored twice in his 17 club appearances so far this season and his combative style has seen him pick up five bookings. His presence at United could be necessary if Anderson is to be believed. The midfielder, on loan at Fiorentina, claims there could be an exodus at Old Trafford. Target: Manchester United have been linked with a move for Sporting's William Carvalho . He was quoted by ESPN as saying: 'I'm sure that lots of players want out, especially people like myself and Nani who have been in Manchester for seven or eight years. 'Manchester United is a huge club, a club that does everything for its players but sometimes a footballer wants to leave just to experience a different way to play football, to learn something as well.'","The 21-year-old was monitored against Academica on Sunday evening .

"A Fort Lauderdale police officer is facing possible criminal charges after he was filmed pushing and slapping a homeless man at a bus terminal. A witness captured the moment Officer Victor Ramirez led Bruce Laclair, 58, away from the Broward County bus station before apparently becoming frustrated with him and pushing him to the ground. From the floor, Laclair told the officer that he had hoped to use the restroom inside the station. 'I'm telling you right now what is going to happen,' Ramirez can be heard saying on the video. 'You're not supposed to go pee here.' Startling: A member of the Fort Lauderdale Police Department, Vincent Ramirez, apparently pushes a homeless man, Bruce Laclair, to the ground after they exchanged words at a bus terminal at the weekend . Terrifying: Once on the ground, Laclair tells the officer he was there to use the restroom and the officer responds by slapping him so hard that a loud slap can be heard. The man filming gasps in horror . Laclair remains on the floor and does not raise his hands as Ramirez suddenly slaps him across the face, eliciting a shocked cry from the man behind the camera. 'I'm not f****** around with you!' Ramirez tells Laclair. 'Don't f****** touch me.' He then arrests the homeless man for trespassing and hauls him away in cuffs. Laclair spent 20 hours in jail before he was released on Monday. The man, who has been homeless for six months, told Local 10 News that he must pay $300 for court costs related to the charge. He told the channel he was feeling bruised, 'pissed and in pain'. 'I didn't touch him. I didn't get aggressive with him,' Laclair insisted. 'Then he pushed me to the ground. Then he punched me in the face.' On the ground: Laclair, 58, said he did not raise his hands to the officer before he was slapped . Cuffed: He was arrested for trespassing and spent the night in a cell before being released on Monday. The police department is now investigating the incident and Ramirez has been suspended with pay . Gerald Schorder, who saw the slap, agreed that he did not see Laclair raise his hands to the officer. 'The officer just knocked him down with his hands,' he said. 'The guy was defenseless.' It is unclear what the men said before the witness started recording the altercation on his cell phone, but there are signs throughout the terminal warning people against loitering. The Fort Lauderdale Police Department has launched an internal investigation and Ramirez, a nine-year veteran of the department, has suspended with pay paid. Police Chief Frank Adderley said at a press conference on Tuesday morning that they're looking into possible criminal charges against the officer. The agency will also review its use-of-force policy. Probe: Laclair, left, said he did not raise his hands to the officer and a witness, Gerald Schorder, right, agreed that he had not seen the man act aggressively towards the police officer . At the press conference, City Manager Lee Feldman, called the video 'clearly disturbing' and said it was 'not representative' of the police department. 'I'm not going to justify any of the officer's actions,' he told reporters. 'We are committed to doing the right thing - not only the right thing by the city but the right thing by the community.' The State Attorney's Office also is reviewing the incident, he said.","A witness captured the moment Fort Lauderdale Police Officer Victor Ramirez pushed Bruce Laclair, 58, to the ground and slapped him .

"A young Eddie Redmayne is pictured with his family at the idyllic French farmhouse where he spent his childhood holidays... and now you can spend a week in the villa, but it will cost you an eye-watering £9,000. Holiday websites describe it as a Provençal farmhouse and a 'much-loved family home' with six bedrooms. They fail to mention, however, that it is owned by the parents of arguably the biggest British film star of 2015 and is undoubtedly one of the places that shaped the actor as the man he is today. Family snap: Eddie (left) is pictured here on holiday with his brothers James (second from left) and Thomas (right), dad Richard (centre) and mum Patricia (behind) for a property feature . Luxury: The villa is surrounded by forests and the views from the house stretch over its very own vineyard into the Prignon Valley . Winner: Eddie scooped the Best Actor prize at the 87th annual Academy Awards on Sunday night for his performance as Professor Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything . Overjoyed: Eddie Redmayne was all smiles as he landed at Heathrow airport in London on Monday alongside his wife Hannah Bagshawe . The property in Grimaud, Var is nestled into the hillside close to luxurious St Tropez and just two hours from the ski slopes. It boasts a 12-metre swimming pool and tennis court and according to holiday rental sites it can be yours for the week for £9,100. The villa, which sleeps 12 people, is surrounded by forests and the views from the house stretch over its very own vineyard into the Prignon Valley. It belongs to his parents, Patricia and Richard Redmayne, who will surely see a surge in interest now it's revealed as the childhood holiday home of an Oscar, Bafta and Golden Globe-winning actor. Eddie, now 33, spent holidays, half-terms and even weekends at the villa from the age of six. On Sunday night, he scooped the Best Actor prize at the 87th annual Academy Awards for his performance as Professor Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything - something which has 'thrilled' his family. Speaking in the wake of Eddie's Oscar success, his 93-year-old Scottish granny Mary Burke said: 'We’re just delighted. We’re a very close family. We’re thrilled.' She continued: 'He’s one of six grandchildren. I’m very proud of them all. 'We’re a very close family. He still pops up from time to time.' Holding hands: Eddie and wife Hannah Bagshawe couldn't mask their joy as they made their way through the terminal . Eddie and his wife were escorted through the airport by two air hostesses, who looked delighted at having been entrusted with the Oscar winner . Eddie's uncle, Thomas Burke, was not at home yesterday but his wife congratulated her nephew's success. Karen Burke said: 'We just want to say very well done, we're very proud of him.' Eddie thanked his family in his emotional acceptance speech at the Oscars, where he fought off competition from Benedict Cumberbatch. The photographs of the stunning holiday home come as no real surprise - the star has previously admitted his life has been 'insanely privileged'. The Redmaynes posed for the images outside their then-home with a professional photographer, as part of a feature on ‘cross-continental commuters’ for the London Evening Standard in 1999. At the time, Eddie’s father Richard, then 61, told the newspaper: ‘I work these crazy hours in the City, which always forced us to live in central London. 'Then there came a point when we decided that we needed somewhere in the country for the weekends, where we could unwind with the children. 'This is where a bit of lateral thinking came in. It suddenly dawned on us - why not have our weekend place abroad?’ At the time of the photographs, Patricia was 50, Eddie was 17 years old and his brothers Thomas and James were 11 and 20 respectively. His father is now chairman of the leading financial house Cantor Fitzgerald Europe. The 76-year-old has also been a director of the television company TV-AM, as well as helping raise finance for Eurotunnel. Further back in the paternal line, there is Eddie's grandfather, John, an Army major turned stockbroker, and his great-grandfather Sir Richard Redmayne, who in 1908 became the first Chief Inspector of Mines. Holiday websites fail to mention the villa is owned by the parents of arguably the biggest British film star of 2015 . Holidays: Eddie (right) pictured at the villa in France with his brothers Thomas (centre) and James (left), and mum Patricia and dad Richard (behind) As for the family wealth, it can be traced to the early 19th century and a successful linen and drapery business based in London's Bond Street. Eddie's mother Patricia comes from a somewhat more humble background and is the daughter of a customs and excise officer. She was born in Berwick-upon-Tweed. While studying at Edinburgh University she met and married her first husband. But the marriage did not last long and, after relocating to London, she met Richard Redmayne, also a divorcee. Eddie has two brothers - James and Tom - and also has a half brother and half-sister from his father's first marriage: Charles is the CEO of publishing giant HarperCollins, Eugenie an investment banker. The family were raised in a stunning £2.5million townhouse on the Chelsea embankment with vacations spent at a sprawling holiday home in the South of France. Eddie went on to win a choral scholarship to Colet Court - a private school in London - then another to Eton College, which his father also attended. By the time he arrived at the £34,500-a-year public school, a taste for the bright lights was emerging. Family holidays: Eddie (left) is pictured here on holiday with his brothers James (second from left) and Thomas (right), dad Richard (centre) and mum Patricia (second from right) Richard Redmayne (left and right), Eddie's father, is chairman of the leading financial house Cantor Fitzgerald Europe abd met his wife Patricia (right) in London . He attended weekend classes at the Jackie Palmer Stage School in High Wycombe, where classmates included actor Aaron Johnson (his wife is Sam Taylor-Johnson, director of the Fifty Shades of Grey film) and comedian James Corden. Then Eddie landed his first West End role aged 12 in Sam Mendes' production of Oliver!. 'I had one line: ""Books you ordered from the bookseller, sir"",' he has recalled. While sport was not his passion, he represented the school in rugby, playing alongside Prince William, a classmate. But throughout his time at Eton it was in drama that he would excel. The budding actor appeared in a succession of annual school plays including Richard III and A Midsummer Night's Dream. As his final year approached, Eddie considered going to drama school but accepted his parents' advice that it would be good to have a degree to fall back on. International spotlight: It was his portrayal of Professor Hawking in The Theory of Everything that has made him a household name . The Theory of Everything: On Sunday night, Eddie scooped the Best Actor prize at the 87th annual Academy Awards for his performance  in The Theory of Everything . Next stop for Eddie was Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied art history. He left with a 2:1 — achieved despite the slight disadvantage of being colour blind. During his three years there he also managed to fit in the Edinburgh Fringe, land a contract modelling for Burberry and do an internship at City broker Cazenove. But his biggest achievement came in the shape of his first professional role. His old teacher tipped off the actor Mark Rylance (currently starring as Thomas Cromwell in the TV adaptation of Wolf Hall) who was searching for a teenage Viola to play opposite his Olivia in an all-male Twelfth Night. Performed at Middle Temple Hall in 2002, it was this production that launched his career. In the years that followed, Eddie played a series of challenging and diverse characters on stage and on screen. Recognition: Redmayne's role in Les Miserables made him a household name and his popularity has been heading in the right direction since . More mainstream recognition came with his role as Stephen Wraysford, the tortured hero in the television adaptation of Sebastian Faulks's World War I novel Birdsong . These included a psychotic schoolboy in the thriller Like Minds, then Angelina Jolie's son in The Good Shepherd, after which he played Julianne Moore's incestuous son in Savage Grace. More mainstream recognition came with a lead role in the film of Les Miserables, in which his choral training came into its own, and as Stephen Wraysford, the tortured hero in the television adaptation of Sebastian Faulks's World War I novel Birdsong. He also starred in My Week With Marilyn, playing Colin Clark - the Eton and Oxbridge-educated movie studio gopher who befriends Marilyn Monroe during the filming of the 1956 The Prince And The Showgirl movie in London. But it is his portrayal of Professor Hawking that has turned the international spotlight on him. After leaving Cambridge he was in a lengthy relationship with fellow student Tara Hacking, who read languages and acted at university and afterwards, too. Lovebirds: Redmayne met Hannah Bagshawe (pictured left and right), at a charity fashion show arranged with a girls' school near to Eton . After that he was briefly linked to actress Carey Mulligan in 2011 before being spotted cosying up to pop star Taylor Swift. But he denied any relationship. It turns out he was actually dating Hannah Bagshawe, a financial-PR turned-antiques-dealer, whom he had known since meeting her at a charity fashion show arranged with a girls' school near to Eton. The couple married before Christmas at Babington House in Somerset but they had to cut short their honeymoon so that Redmayne could throw himself into the acting awards season. He had promised to make up for that by taking his new wife on holiday as soon as the Oscars were over. Perhaps he already booked his childhood holiday home... but it's unlikely he'll have to cough up the £9,000 per week for the pleasure.

"Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill is open to the possibility of his assistant Roy Keane working at Aston Villa - but wants the issue resolved in the next few weeks. Keane, the former Sunderland and Ipswich manager, has been linked with a post as Paul Lambert's number two at Villa Park over the past week. The 42-year-old had previously been a contender for the manager's position at Celtic but withdrew from consideration. Waiting game: Martin O'Neill (right) wants Roy Keane's situation with Aston Villa to be resolved . O'Neill believes Keane could combine his role with the national team with new duties at Villa but does not want the matter dragging into next season. O'Neill, quoted in the Irish Independent, said: 'I want to be careful about jumping the gun because we had him signed, sealed and delivered to Celtic and that did not materialise. 'I don't really know if this is something that he is going to have a serious look at. 'But if he is then I will definitely speak (again) to Paul Lambert - and see if that kind of role can be combined. 'One thing I want to establish is what sort of in-depth conversations have gone on.

Paul has spoken to Roy about the possibility of it happening. 'Nothing definitive has happened and I don't really know what sort of commitment (the Villa position) would entail. 'If he is actually a full-blooded assistant then that is something to consider. 'I don't mind it (speculation) going on for a week or two.

"Chris Gayle calls himself 'World Boss' and after his record-breaking double century at the Cricket World Cup against Zimbabwe it's impossible to disagree. Gayle scored 215 off just 147 deliveries to become the first man ever to pass 200 at the game's biggest tournament. The 35-year-old Jamaican smashed an eyewatering 16 sixes on top of 10 fours as he announced his arrival at this World Cup with a crash, a bang and most definitely a wallop. Even the way Gayle was eventually dismissed encapsulates why he is one of the great characters of modern sport. He needed to get through just one final delivery to earn the distinction of carrying his bat through the entire innings - a badge of honour that would be cherished by any opening batsman. But was survival on his mind? Not a chance. Gayle tried to belt the ball out of the park. Chris Gayle celebrates as he scores the first double century at the Cricket World Cup . The batsman is also fond of sharing pictures of himself in glamourous locations . Gayle smashed 215 off just 147 balls during his breathtaking innings against Zimbabwe . The 35-year-old smashed 10 fours and an incredible 16 sixes in his brutal knock for West Indies . The ball soared high and fell into the hands of the fielder at midwicket, but did Gayle care? What do you think. 'I always feel happy - you know why? Because I don't expect anything from anyone! Expectations always hurt,' he says on his Twitter feed. He's got plenty to feel happy about, too. His latest act of brutal batting brilliance was his 22nd ODI century, and he is an icon of his sport and homeland. 'Chris Lion' - another of his self-anointed monikers - proves just why Caribbean cricketers are among the coolest cats in the world of sport. At the crease Gayle ensures the swashbuckling spirit of Sir Viv Richards lives on. And when he's away from the field of play, that doesn't mean that the play has to stop.

"The extent of Toni Kroos’ contract stand-off with Bayern Munich has placed all the Barclays Premier League’s top clubs on standby for a £25million summer scramble to sign him. Bayern bosses are digging in their heels over Kroos’ bold bid to more than double his earnings from just over £60,000 a week to around £150,000 and have bluntly told him talks over a new deal will remain on hold until he lowers his sights. The 24-year-old Germany midfielder was even relegated to the bench for the first time in two months on Sunday, in a further escalation of his Allianz Arena woes that has alerted all the Premier League big guns. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Bayern's recent brilliant performance against Eintracht Frankfurt . Toni the target: Premier League clubs are very interested in Bayern midfielder Toni Kroos (right) Sportsmail revealed just over a week . ago how Manchester United manager David Moyes had been first to react to . growing uncertainty over Kroos’ future by watching Bayern’s game at . Borussia Monchengladbach with the 24-year old’s agent. Should . there still be no thaw in relations at the end of the season, it seems . certain Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal and even Liverpool will . declare their hand and make it clear to Kroos they are prepared to meet . his wage demands. In an . intriguing sub-plot, there have even been claims in Germany that Arsenal . missed out on prime target Julian Draxler because Bayern have lined him . up as Kroos’ replacement in the summer. Former . Middlesbrough and Barnsley striker Jan Aage Fjortoft, who works as a TV . pundit in Norway and Germany, tweeted: ‘Bayern Munich managed to stop . the Draxler deal by saying “we take him in the summer.”’ Sub standard? Kroos was dropped to the bench for Bayern's match on Sunday . Reacting badly: Kroos was not happy at being taken off recently against Stuttgart . Fjortoft’s claim is as yet unsubstantiated, but what is beyond doubt is that Bayern will not be dictated to over extending a contract that has less than 18 months to run. Kroos is currently in the middle band of earners, whose pay ranges from £50,000 to £80,000 a week, but feels he should be elevated to the elite section, where the likes of Philipp Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Franck Ribery pocket around £150,000. Bayern are about to add Borussia Dortmund striker Robert Lewandowski to the top earners but are determined to maintain the balance of their pay scale on current lines and are adamant Kroos cannot move up. Bayern buy? Munich have reportedly lined up Schalke's Julian Draxler (centre) to replace Kroos . Their hardline stance has received influential backing from former Germany midfielder Gunter Netzer, who reinforced the view that Kroos will have to climb down or possibly consider a fresh start in the Premier League next season. ‘I would advise Toni Kroos not to overplay his hand,’ he said. ‘There are a few players who cannot be replaced, but he is not one of them. He is playing a risky game at Bayern. The club are determined not to pay huge wages to all their players, in order to stay healthy financially. ‘This could become a situation where Kroos forces Bayern to set an example. He might be overrating himself a bit with his wage demands, in that they might not reflect his worth to the team. He would be wise to have a good look at the squad and rethink his situation.’ Watching brief: David Moyes (centre) was at Borussia Monchengladbach vs Bayern Munich to see Kroos first hand . Interested: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho (top left), Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (top left), Arsenal's Arsene Wenger (bottom left) and Manchester City chief Manuel Pellegrini are all monitoring Kroos' situation . The prospects of a compromise with Bayern have hardly been helped by signs of petulance on the pitch. Kroos threw his gloves to the floor in anger after being substituted at Stuttgart last week and promptly found himself demoted to the bench for Sunday’s crushing win over Eintracht Frankfurt. It is being viewed as evidence that manager Pep Guardiola, like his boardroom bosses, will take no nonsense from a player who has been an integral part of Bayern’s recent dominance but is now embroiled in a dangerous game of brinkmanship over his future.","Toni Kroos involved in contract stand-off with Bayern Munich .

"Premier League match delegate Steve Greaves – whose report backed referee Martin Atkinson in all of his key decisions during Chelsea's controversial clash with Burnley – will only return to his role next week… when Chelsea face West Ham. Sportsmail can reveal that the 45-year-old is not on match duty this weekend but will be in the stands at Upton Park assessing Andre Marriner and his assistants next Wednesday. That means he will again be returning his verdict on decisions involving Jose Mourinho's men. This studs-up tackle from Ashley Barnes infuriated Nemanja Matic and Jose Mourinho backed up his player . Nemanja Matic will miss the Capital One Cup final after Martin Atkinson sent him off . The match delegate backed up Atkinson's calls and will be in his role when Chelsea face West Ham next week . Born in Chelsea, Steve Greaves made his professional debut with Fulham in the late Eighties. He made only one appearance for the Cottagers and also played a handful of times for Ipswich Town, Preston North End and Scunthorpe United. He retired because of injury at 23 and later played for non-league Sudbury AFC. In 2006 he was appointed assistant academy manager at Ipswich having previously coached their youth team. Two years later he moved to Stevenage as assistant to Graham Westley before joining Southampton’s youth set-up, where he coached the likes of Luke Shaw, Calum Chambers and James Ward-Prowse. He left in 20013 before taking up his role as a Premier League match delegate. And in a further twist, we can reveal that Chelsea will cite evidence from a match in which Greaves was the assessor when they bid to overturn Nemanja Matic's red card from Saturday's 1-1 draw with Burnley at Stamford Bridge. Mourinho was furious with Atkinson after he felt his side deserved two penalties in the first half and that Ashley Barnes should have been sent off for kicking out at Branislav Ivanovic. But it was Atkinson's failure to punish Barnes for his high tackle on Matic which led Mourinho to label the challenge 'criminal'. Matic was red carded when he retaliated by shoving the striker and now faces a three-match ban. Chelsea have appealed the suspension which starts with the Capital One Cup final this weekend. They are expected to point to Swansea's successful appeal over Wayne Routledge's dismissal following his reaction to a dangerous challenge from QPR's Karl Henry on New Year's Day. Ironically, Greaves' report was used in that instance. Barnes catches Branislav Ivanovic with his right boot during an aerial challenge in the 30th minute . Ivanovic fires a shot at goal but his effort was blocked by the raised arms of Michael Kightly . Chelsea may point to Wayne Routledge's appeal as they look to overturn Nemanja Matic's sending off - Greaves report was used in the game between QPR and Swansea . But the former Southampton academy coach is sure to have upset Mourinho after reporting that Atkinson was correct in each of his key decisions at the weekend. On the first penalty claim in the 32nd minute for a handball by Michael Kightly, Greaves – who had access to TV replays - wrote in his report: 'Correct decision as ball hit with pace from close range and didn't see it as deliberate.' Before half-time Chelsea appealed for another penalty when Diego Costa went down after a challenge by Jason Shackell. Greaves wrote: 'Both in real time and on DVD my opinion is that Costa is looking to go down as soon as contact is made. However, Shackell does put his hands on him so appreciate your thoughts!! Also to note, ref can't actually see Shackell's hands on Costa.' YouTube/officialburnleyfc . Atkinson was heavily criticised during and after the game as Chelsea drew at home to Burnley on Saturday . On the Matic sending off and Barnes challenge, he returned: 'In super slow mo it obviously looks awful, but in real time live and dvd Barnes catches him as follow through from the challenge. (Does Barnes mean to harm him?-only he knows) Also, looks worse because Matic has his foot planted…' Greaves, meanwhile, was also on duty during the controversial 2-2 draw between QPR and Manchester City in November, a match in which Charlie Austin had a goal ruled out after Joe Hart's two-touch free-kick – which led to the goal - was correctly deemed in breach of the rules.","Match delegate Steve Greaves won't be on match duty this weekend .

"Southampton forward Jay Rodriguez admits the club have lost a 'great manager' in Mauricio Pochettino. Pochettino left St Mary's to take the vacant post at Tottenham, where he was handed a five-year-contract at the end of May. The Argentine guided Southampton to a club-record eighth-placed finish in the Barclays Premier League last season and Rodriguez was full of praise for his former boss. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Pochettino give his first Spurs interview... in ENGLISH! Moving on: Jay Rodriguez is disappointed to be losing 'great manager' Mauricio Pochettino . Finisher: Jay Rodriguez became one of the finest young strikers in the Premier League under the Argentine . 'Mauricio is a great manager and a great guy and was well-respected by the lads,' Rodriguez told Press Association Sport. 'He worked us really hard and we got the good results and finished eighth which we were happy with. 'Football moves on though so it's one of those things.' Southampton face a battle to hang on to their key players this summer with the likes of Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw and Calum Chambers all being linked with moves away. Striker Rickie Lambert followed Pochettino out the exit door to join Liverpool earlier this month and there are fears more players could do the same. 'You don't want to see players going and the team being taken apart,' said Rodriguez. 'You can sometimes never stop it, it is one of those things so I'm trying not to think about it and hopefully we will have everyone at pre-season.' Outbound: Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw are just two of Southampton's stars who could be moving to a bigger club this summer . Gone: Rickie Lambert has already left the club, moving to Liverpool . Rodriguez, who scored 17 goals in all competitions last season, was in contention for a place in England's World Cup squad before he suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury against Manchester City in April. The 24-year-old says his disappointment was eased by support shown to him by the fans. 'It was massive, a really big help to see the support I got,' Rodriguez added. 'How the Man City fans reacted on the day was great for me and obviously everyone at Southampton has been brilliant. 'It was hard at the start and that helped me through it.'","Rodriguez believes former boss Pochettino was a 'great manager'
