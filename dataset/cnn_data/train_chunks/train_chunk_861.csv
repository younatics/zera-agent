"By . James Rush . Fifteen crew members of the South Korean ferry which sank, leaving more than 300 people dead or missing, have gone on trial. Captain Lee Joon-seok, 68, and three senior crew have been charged with homicide - a charge that could carry the death penalty. Two other crew members have been charged with fleeing and abandoning ship, with a maximum sentence of life in prison, while nine have been charged with negligence, which can also carry jail terms. Scroll down for video . Standing trial: Captain Lee arrives at court yesterday. He and three senior crew are charged with homicide . Emotional: Family members of passengers aboard the sunken ferry Sewol struggle with a security officer, right, while attempting to attend the trial of the ferry's crew members at Gwangju District Court yesterday . The Sewol sank off the southwest coast on April 16 on a routine journey from Incheon on the mainland to the southern holiday island of Jeju. Of the 476 passengers and crew on board, 339 were children and teachers from the same school on the outskirts of Seoul. Only 172 people were rescued and the remainder are all presumed to have drowned. Members of the crew were caught on video abandoning ship, the captain in his underwear, while the children, obeying orders, waited in their cabins for further instructions. As the defendants were led in to court today someone shouted: 'That guy is the captain, isn't he? Murderer!' One relative held up a sign that read: 'You are not human. You are beneath animals.' An altercation arose between the relatives and security guards who tried to take the sign away. Rescue: Only 172 people were rescued from the vessel and the remainder are all presumed to have drowned . Court case: Today's raid comes a day after 15 crew members of the doomed ferry went on trial in Gwangju. Above, Captain Lee Joon-seok is surrounded by members of the press as he arrives at the court by bus . Mourning family members packed the court in Gwangju, the closest city to the scene of the disaster, as the 15 were led in and seated on two rows of benches. The 15 have been in detention since they were charged in May. In a statement sent to reporters via text message and read out by a representative before the hearing, a committee of ferry victims' families demanded strict punishment of the crew. 'They say wounds heal as time goes by, but, for us, it's like time has stopped,' the statement said. 'The defendants, who should have saved the passengers first, ran out first and lived... The defendants not only killed the passengers, they also killed the souls of the families and basic trust in our society.' All surviving crew members responsible for the ship's navigation have been charged with negligence and with failing to do their duty to protect passengers. Judges sit to preside over the trial of crew members of the sunken ferry Sewol at Gwangju District Court . Sounds of sobs were heard throughout the courtroom as the state presented its case and the head prosecutor's voice broke as he recounted the last moments of some of the children. One child was caught on video, recovered later, staring death in the face, the prosecutor said. 'I'm not a criminal, I don't know why this is happening,' the child said. 'I haven't done anything that bad.' A Gwangju judge who handles media affairs, Hahn Jee-hyung, said the defendants were unlikely to get a full and concerted defence in the highly publicised case. 'The state-appointed lawyers have taken on the case out of public interest and not of their own will,' Hahn told reporters before the hearing got under way. 'They were appointed by the court, so we hope there is no criticism of them.' Mourning family members packed the court in Gwangju, the closest city to the scene of the disaster, as the 15 were led in and seated on two rows of benches . A panel of three judges presided on the first day of the trial, as the state called for justice to be served and the seven defence lawyers presented their case. South Korea has in recent years revised its criminal law to allow defendants to opt for jury trials, but most of the 15 crew members chose against it. The captain and one senior crew member had written to the court pleading leniency, court documents show, but details were not available. 'The defendants, who should have saved . the passengers first, ran out first and lived... The defendants not only . killed the passengers, they also killed the souls of the families and . basic trust in our society' - Families' statement read out before hearing . Authorities are still searching for Yoo Byung-un, head of the family that owned the operator of the doomed ferry, on charges of embezzlement seen as a key factor that led to compromised safety management. The captain and three other crew members are charged with homicide - a charge that could carry the death penalty, though South Korea has not executed anyone since late 1997. Prosecutors accuse them of tacitly colluding to abandon the ship while being aware that the passengers would be trapped and killed when the ship sank. President Park Geun-hye has called the crew's actions murderous, and the pervading hostility against them has raised questions about the fairness of the trial. The crew is being defended by state-appointed lawyers, three of whom started practicing law only this year. The court said in a statement that it will guarantee the rights of both the defendants and the victims and faithfully investigate evidence for a speedy and fair trial. Nearly two months after the sinking, 292 bodies have been recovered and 12 people are still missing. Divers continue underwater searches for those believed trapped inside the sunken ship off the country's southwestern coast. Disaster: The Sewol ferry, carrying 476 people, sank off the southwest coast of South Korea on April 16 . There are allegations that the ferry operator, Chonghaejin Marine Co., dangerously overloaded the vessel and gave crew members inadequate emergency training, and some company officials also have been arrested. The absence of determined defence may mean that the crew's side of the story - whether, for instance, they were adequately trained or whether they were given strict orders to abandon ship - may never be heard in court. One lawyer, appearing for one of the crew in hearings held behind closed doors to decide the validity of arrest warrants, confessed to being torn between professional obligation and the resignation that lawyers could not make any difference amid a nationwide witch hunt. 'It is a burden for every lawyer, because the crime is something that can hardly be forgiven,' he said in the small coastal town of Mokpo last month. 'It's not just that one person died. There were hundreds. All I could say to the judges is ""we will await your wise decision"". That was it.' There also is widespread anger and frustration with the government over what many see as an incompetent search and rescue effort. Since the sinking, President Park has pushed to restructure government agencies and reshuffle top officials to try to restore public confidence. On Tuesday, Park nominated a former senior journalist as her new prime minister. The outgoing prime minister has resigned to take responsibility for the government's handling of the sinking. Tuesday's appointment comes nearly two weeks after Park's first choice for the job resigned amid allegations of ethical lapses. She also appointed the country's ambassador to Japan as the new spy chief, according to the presidential Blue House.","Trial of 15 crew members of South Korean ferry which sank in April .

"By . Ruth Styles . From stretchy leggings to billowing tunic tops and tent dresses, the wardrobe of the average mother-to-be isn't always a particularly glamorous affair. But that could all be about to change if Chanel supremo Karl Lagerfeld gets his way, after he closed the French fashion house's latest show with a pregnant bride. Dressed in an elegant crêpe de Chine gown with a gold brocade cape and a neat line of buttons along the bodice, the model, her hair teased into a striking quiff, even allowed herself a smile as she processed along the runway on the arm of the German designer. Striking: Karl Lagerfeld gives maternity wear a glamorous makeover during the A/W15 Chanel couture show . Striking: The model closes the show on the arm of Chanel supremo, Karl Lagerfeld . Cheered on by a crowd of clapping fashionistas, among them US Vogue's Anna Wintour, Kristen Stewart and Jared Leto, the pair stopped to take a bow at the end of the runway before the model planted a kiss on Lagerfeld's cheek. It was a dramatic end to a dramatic show which offered up a glimpse of Lagerfeld's romantic vision for autumn: one replete with sculptural shapes and elegantly cosy textures. Brocade, tweed and heavy silk all featured heavily, as did gorgeously touchable prints - many of which appeared inspired by William Morris and the pre-Raphaelites. In a departure from last January's S/S14 collection where models clad in neat, knee-length dresses and trainers took centre stage, Lagerfeld's vision for winter took a darker turn with marabou-fringed tweed and bodices studded with armour-like jewels taking centre stage. Looking good: Beautifully dressed models on the runway at Chanel's A/W15 haute couture show in Paris . Darkly beautiful: Highlights included a red and black distressed tweed dress and a gunmetal gown . Classic: As ever, there was plenty of Chanel's trademark tweed . Sculptural: Bell skirts, albeit covered in sequins, dominated . Elaborate: A model in a striking silver-grey lace dress . But while ladylike might be back, heels, it seems, are not - at least according to Lagerfeld and Chanel. Instead of skyscraper shoes, models on the catwalk at the Grand Palais des Champs-Elysées in Paris wore delicate flat sandals in black, silver and white, each one tied in place with pretty grosgrain ribbons. They might not have been the most practical of winter shoes but for well-heeled pregnant mothers like the star of the show, they could be just what the doctor ordered.

"By . Will Stewart . Specially-trained US military dolphins are to be deployed to the Black Sea as tensions with Russia increase, it was claimed last night. The US Navy’s marine mammal unit plans to send 30 dolphins and sea lions to take part in NATO drills in an area dominated by Russian forces. Moscow-based newspaper Izvestia said the exercises, which could see American military dolphins nose-to-nose with their Russian counterparts, are expected to last for up to two weeks. The Black sea has become a tense focal point for Russian and Western navies amid the current crisis in Ukraine. Scroll down for video . Training mammals for naval operations including spying and mining of enemy ships began in the Cold War . Recently a low-flying Russian air force plane buzzed a U.S. warship sent to patrol here. The Ukrainian navy's warfare dolphins based in Sevastopol abruptly switched sides to Russia recently after Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea. Training mammals for naval operations for spying on and mining of enemy ships began in the Cold War by both the U.S. and the USSR. 'It may so happen that American and Russian military dolphins will meet in the open sea for the first time,' wrote Izvestia. Loyal: The army has been using the underwater mammals since the 70s, and they remained under Ukrainian command after the collapse of the Soviet Union . 'It is known that such dolphins are trained only in Russia and the USA.' The newspaper cited Tom LaPuzza, spokesman for the US Navy's marine mammals programme, as revealing that deployment of dolphins and sea lions was a first for NATO. An ITAR TASS report evidently quoting LaPuzza stated that in the Black Sea the U.S. dolphins would test a new anti-radar which is designed to 'disorientate enemy sonars while sea lions would look for mines and naval divers'. The U.S. is known to have trained dolphins and sea lions to identify intruders swimming in restricted areas, and the retrieve equipment lost at sea. It is understood some $14million (USD) is spent annually training the underwater mammals. They are also seen as skilled mine-finders by their military trainers. In action: One of the 'spy dolphins' is being moved from a pool into the sea, pictured in 1990, before the fall of the USSR . The American Navy Marine Mammal Program found that dolphin sonar, known as echolocation, 'makes them uniquely effective at locating sea mines so they can be avoided and removed', according to one account. After finding the mine, the dolphins signal the discovery to its crew by poking a ball with its nose. It then is given a buoy line or acoustic transponder to mark the spot. America also trains 'attack sea lions' to detect and snare enemy divers. They are taught to attach spring loaded clamps to frogmen who are they pulled backwards through the water by the mammals' naval handlers on a vessel. Part of the team: A military dolphin with two divers in this undated Russian military photo . 'It's difficult to put up effective resistance when you're being dragged backwards through the water,' LaPuzza has previously stated. Between 1986 and 1988 the U.S. Navy, which now has a fleet of at least 75 mine hunting dophins, deployed six on duties in the Persian Gulf. One, called Skippy, died of bacterial infection. Earlier, they were deployed in the Vietnam War. Uniquely, the U.S. has trained Beluga whales for deepwater operations. Izvestia reported that the U.S. mammals would be flown in to Ukraine on planes equipped with special baths when the creatures are constantly watered. U.S. Air Force pictures show how they were transported to New Caledonia in 2009 for exercises off Australia. LaPuzza was quoted denying that the American sea animals are trained to attack people. Search and rescue: Dolphins were sent on bomb missions when the army did not want to risk the life of a diver . 'On the contrary, as part of the training programme, they learn to save people. Their main activities are finding mines and divers.' The Russian bottlenose dolphins - until recently under Ukrainian command - are trained to hunt for mines, plant bombs on hostile ships or attack enemy divers with special knives or pistols fixed to their heads. The use of dolphins as naval assets was begun during the Cold War in Sevastopol by the Soviet Union in 1973. With the collapse of the USSR, they were enlisted in the Ukrainian navy which last month lost its headquarters in Sevastopol after Russia's audacious land grab in Crimea. How to: A dolphin model is wearing some of the specially designed kit in a military museum . The combat dolphins are now back under Kremlin control along with all 193 military units in the region. 'The military dolphins serving in Crimea will be transferred to the Russian Navy,' reported state-owned Russian news agency RIA Novosti at the time. It was also disclosed Russia would invest more in the combat dolphin training programme. 'Engineers are developing new equipment for new programmes so that the dolphins can be used more effectively in underwater operations,' said a source. U.S. Air Force pictures show how they were transported to New Caledonia in 2009 for exercises off Australia . 'Our specialists have been working on new equipment that transform the dolphin's sonar signal at the point of detecting a submarine into a signal on the operator's screen. 'But the Ukrainian Fleet didn't have enough money to develop such know how and some projects had to be closed.' While the dolphins show extraordinary intelligence, sometimes they disobeyed their Ukrainian commanders. Airmen, sailors and contractors unload dolphins assigned to the Navy Marine Mammals Program in California . U.S. Air Force pictures show how they were transported to New Caledonia in 2009 for exercises off Australia . Navy Petty Officer 3rd Class Aaron Nutt gets the attention of his dolphin while aboard a C-17 Globemaster III from Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii in 2009 . Last year three of five spy dolphins went absent without leave in the Black Sea - apparently in search of love, but returned to their duties shortly afterwards. Yury Plyachenko, a former Soviet naval anti-sabotage officer, explained that this was something that had to be taken into account in working with the 007 mammals. 'If a male dolphin saw a female dolphin during the mating season, then he would immediately set off after her. But they come back in a week or so.'","American underwater mammals will be deployed in NATO exercises .

"By . James Rush . Scientists at Harvard have confirmed a 19th century book in one of the university's libraries is bound in human skin. Conservators at the university carried out a series of tests on the binding, which left them '99.9% confident' the binding came from a human. The book, Arsène Houssaye's Des destinées de l'ame, which translates as The Destiny Of The Soul, is described as a meditation on the soul and life after death and is believed to have been bound in skin from the unclaimed body of a female mental patient. Scientists at Harvard have confirmed a 19th century book in one of the university's libraries is bound in human skin . Houssaye is believed to have presented the book, a meditation on the soul and life after death, to his friend Dr Ludovic Bouland . Scientists confirmed the . binding on the book, housed in the Houghton Library, is human skin after using a technique known as peptide . mass fingerprintings to analyse microscopic samples. The . results create a 'peptide mass fingerprint' (PMF) which allows . scientists to then rule out 'fingerprints' from other sources. Bill . Lane, director of the Harvard Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Resource . Laboratory, said: 'The PMF from Des destinées de l'ame matched the . human reference, and clearly eliminated other common parchment sources, . such as sheep, cattle and goat. 'However, . although the PMF was consistent with human, other closely related . primates, such as the great apes and gibbons, could not be eliminated . because of the lack of necessary references.' Further . tests were carried out on the samples however which led the scientists to . conclude it was 'very unlikely that the source could be other than . human.' In a blogpost on the library's website, Heather Cole, Assistant Curator of Modern Books & Manuscripts, claims Bouland bound the book with skin from the unclaimed body of a female mental patient who died of a stroke. A note inside the book, written by Bouland, reads: 'A book about the human soul deserved to have a human covering: I had kept this piece of human skin taken from the back of a woman' In the note, Bouland also refers to another book bound in human skin, Séverin Pineau's De integritatis & corruptionis virginum notis, which is in the Wellcome Library collection .

"By . Will Stewart . An extraordinary display of 'agents of foreign influence' has been erected in Crimea, denouncing Russian opposition figures such as the Pussy Riot singers, implying they are tools of the West. It is unknown who is behind the controversial 'wall of shame' which appeared at Simferopol Airport and railway station, but it evokes memories of the vilification of supposed traitors from Stalin times. An image of Uncle Sam with a no entry sign suggests that the pictured opposition figures are accused as aiding the U.S. and the West. Enemy at the gate: The propaganda posters at Simferopol Airport in Crimea, denouncing critics of Russia and Putin . Sinister: An opposition blogger and anti-corruption campaigner, lawyers, protest musicians and opposition politicians are among those named and pictured . Among those denounced on the display on the Black Sea peninsula, recently annexed by Russia, are opposition blogger and anti-corruption campaigner Alexey Navalny, seen as a prominent foe of Vladimir Putin. The message under his jail-style picture reads: 'Lawyer. Got five years suspended sentence for Kirov timber stealing. 'He carries out all his ""investigations"" in the interests of certain financial groups. He took part in nationalist marches, but then betrayed fellow nationalists for the sake of creating a liberal party.' In bold letters, it adds: 'He called for sanctions against Russia after the Crimean referendum.' The Pussy Riot singers Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 24, and Maria Alyokhina, 25, both jailed for an anti-Putin protest in a Moscow cathedral, are pictured among a dozen 'agents of foreign influence'. Another is Mikhail Kasyanov, once Putin's prime minister but now an opposition politician, along with ex-deputy premier Boris Nemtsov who is also a critic of the Kremlin. An image of Uncle Sam with a no entry sign suggests that the pictured opposition figures are accused as aiding the U.S. and the West . On Andrey Makarevich, founder of Russia's oldest rock band, Time Machine, the citation condemns him for supporting protesters arrested at an anti-Putin rally. 'Musician who lost his popularity and hosted TV cooking show. He played at concerts to support ""Bolotnaya prisoners"". He supported Yeltsin, then Putin, and then turned to opposition.' In bold letters it continues: 'He believes that Russia's participation in the Ukrainian question is a profanation and rude interference with the people's fight for independence.' Top Russian blogger Rustem Adagamov - who highlighted the pictures - wrote: 'I finally realised that Crimea is Russian territory. See what displays were put at Simferopol's airport and railway station.' The anonymous photographer who took the pictures wrote: 'This is all I managed to snap with my phone. Then people in military uniforms came to say that it was prohibited to take pictures there and that I should show my identity documents.' Alien influence: A giant banner shows images of opposition figures alongside creatures from the film Aliens, one holding a briefcase with a white ribbon symbol of anti-Putin campaigners . The display was across the street from the offices of Ekho Moscow, an independent radio station . The display resembles a recent poster that appeared briefly on the building housing a major bookshop in Moscow which complained of a 'fifth column' in Russia. The display was across the street from the offices of Ekho Moscow, an independently edited radio station, along with a Dunkin' Donuts, a Baskin-Robbins and a Citibank branch. A giant banner showed images of opposition figures along side aliens, one holding a briefcase with a white ribbon symbol of anti-Putin campaigners. The sign read: 'Fifth Column. Aliens among us.' A statement said: 'Books were written about aliens capturing earth under disguise. They look like us, and until the moment comes no-one suspects them. 'We haven't met true aliens yet. But sadly the 'fifth column' of national traitors became an indisputable reality in Russia. 'They are in fact just the same aliens. They pretend to act in the interests of Russia and our people, but in fact they serve interests of completely different ""civilisations"".' Echoes of history: A Stalin-era anti-Trotsky poster reads 'Eliminate the viper!' The poster was taken as a sign of a 'xenophobic chill' in Moscow amid the crisis over Ukraine, seen as the most serious rupture in east-west relations since the Cold War. While these stunts are minor compared to the official denunciations of the Stalin era, they recall a Soviet trend. The Stalinist poster above from the early 1930s is entitled 'Eliminate the Viper!' . It reads: 'Wipe out enemy of people Trotsky and his bloody fascist gang!'","Posters recall Soviet-era propaganda and those behind them are unknown .

Convenience: Lebedev changed his official residential address to the nearby village of  Popovka, 177 miles south of Moscow, which meant he would serve his punishment close to his potato farm . This morning he was set to work in designer torn jeans and a warm jacket - both  bought in Los Angeles - carrying timber and digging the ground for a merry-go-round and preparing to install a slide alongside a team of regular  workers. The other workers mixed concrete and put a new seesaw in place, while a police  patrol kept a discreet distance but checked the media magnate was working. 'I am fine, ready to start,' he said, picking up a spade. 'It is a pity that such public works don't use the most of what a person can  do.

Another thing we really need here is good roads.' Lebedev is limited to working four hours a day, three days a week, so he will  take 12 weeks to complete his punishment, by which time there should be thick  snow on the ground.

"By . Will Stewart . Russian scientists are seeking to unlock the secrets of 3,500 year old Bronze Age graves where couples are buried together in a seemingly loving embrace - amid suspicions of a macabre explanation. These images show ancient burials in Staryi Tartas village in Siberia where experts have examined some 600 tombs. Dozens contain the bones of couples, facing each other, some with male and female skeletons, their hands held together seemingly for eternity. Russian scientists have uncovered the bones of dozens of couples buried facing each other in Staryi Tartas village in Siberia . 'Archeologists are struggling for explanations and believe DNA tests will provide the answers to these remarkable burials,' said The Siberian Times. One writer, Vasiliy Labetskiy, described the scenes in the graves poignantly as skeletons in 'post-mortal hugs with bony hands clasped together'. One theory is that these Andronovo burials show the start of the nuclear family, but another version that after the man died, his wife was killed and buried with him. Still another suggests that some of the couples were deliberately buried as if in a sexual act, possibly with a young woman sacrificed to play this role in the grave. Other graves at the site in Novosibirsk region in western Siberia show adults buried with children. Professor Vyacheslav Molodin, director of research of the Institute of Archeology and Ethnography of the Siberian branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said: 'We can fantasise a lot about all this. 'We can allege that husband died and the wife was killed to be interred with him as we see in some Scythian burials, or maybe the grave stood open for some time and they buried the other person or persons later, or maybe it was really simultaneous death. Some graves at the site in Novosibirsk region in western Siberia show adults buried with children . One writer described the scenes in the graves poignantly as skeletons in 'post-mortal hugs with bony hands clasped together' Work is underway to establish the 'kinship' of these ancient couple burials using DNA research . 'When we speak about a child and an adult, it looks more natural and understandable. 'When we speak about two adults - it is not so obvious. So we can raise quite a variety of hypotheses, but how it was in fact, we do not know yet.' Work is underway to establish the 'kinship' of these ancient couple burials using DNA research. Archeologists are struggling for explanations and believe DNA tests will provide the answers to these remarkable burials, it was reported . The graves contain the bones of couples, facing each other, some with male and female skeletons, their hands held together seemingly for eternity . 'For example, we found the burial a man and a child. What is a degree of their kinship? Are they father and son or...? The same question arises when we found a woman and a child. It should seem obvious - she is the mother. But it may not be so. She could be an aunt, or not a relative at all. To speak about this scientifically we need the tools of paleogenetics. 'We have a joint laboratory with the Institute of Cytology and Genetics, of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science,  and we actively work in this direction. We do such analysis but it is quite expensive still and there are few specialists. We are also solving other questions with help of paleogenetics.' With such couple burials, Professor Lev Klein, of St Petersburg State University, has proposed they are linked to reincarnation beliefs possibly influenced by deeksha rituals in the ancient Indian sub-continent at the time when the oldest scriptures of Hinduism were composed. 'The man during his lifetime donated his body as a sacrifice to all the gods,' he wrote. 'The 'deeksha' was considered as a ""second birth"" and to complete this ritual the sacrificing one made a ritual sexual act of conceiving.' In other words, in death a man should perform a sexual act to impregnate a woman. 'Perhaps in the pre-Vedic period relatives of the deceased often sought to reproduce the ""deeksha"" posthumously, and sacrificed a woman or a girl (or a few), and simulated sexual intercourse in the grave,' he said. Professor Molodin doesn't rule out this version, yet makes clear it is only a hypothesis which needs more study. 'It is again a suggestion. As a suggestion, it could be. This idea of Klein can be extended to Siberia too, because significant part of the researchers think that Andronovo people were Iranians. 'So this hypothesis can be extended to them. But, I will repeat, it is only a hypothesis.'","The ancient burials were found in Staryi Tartas village in Siberia .

"By . Associated Press . and James Rush . A court in China has sentenced three people to death for planning an attack at Beijing's iconic Tiananmen Gate which left five people dead and 40 injured. The three were accused of providing funds for the attack, which was blamed on Muslim separatists, on October 28, in which a car ploughed through tourists before crashing and bursting into flames, killing two bystanders and the three attackers. A court in the Xinjiang regional capital . of Urumqi sentenced the three to death, the official Xinhua News Agency . said. Five other people were given prison sentences, with four receiving . terms of five to 20 years and one getting a life sentence. Three people have been sentenced to death for planning an attack at Beijing's iconic Tiananmen Gate which left five people dead and 40 injured in October . The footage of an October attack on the edge of Beijing's Tiananmen Square is seen in court during the trial of people involved . Xinhua said they had travelled to Beijing on October 7, 2013, to deliver money to buy a jeep, gasoline, knives and other materials related to the attack. The eight were arrested within days of the incident. A Chinese visitor and a tourist from the Philippines were killed in the attack, along with the vehicle's driver, his wife and mother-in-law, according to Chinese authorities. The attack was the first to strike Beijing in recent years. It pointed to a new level of violence and lethal intent in the long-simmering insurgency against Chinese rule in the far northwestern region of Xinjiang waged by radicals among the native Turkic Uighur Muslim population. The Tiananmen Gate attack was followed by similar incidents in Xinjiang, including one on May 22 in which men driving off-road vehicles and throwing explosives ploughed through a crowded market in Urumqi, killing 39 people. The trial of three people sentenced to death for their roles in an October attack on the edge of Beijing's Tiananmen Square is seen in this still image taken from video . Police said four suspects were killed at the scene and a fifth was caught that evening in an area about 250 kilometers (150 miles) south of Urumqi. Beijing says unrest among Uighurs is caused by extremist groups with ties to Islamic terror groups abroad, but has shown little direct evidence. Uighur activists say public resentment against Beijing is fueled by an influx of settlers from China's Han ethnic majority, economic disenfranchisement and onerous restrictions on Uighur religious and cultural practices. Death sentences in China are automatically forwarded to the Supreme People's Court for appeal but are rarely overturned. While official figures are not released, China is believed to execute more prisoners than the rest of the world combined.","The three were accused of providing funds for the attack on October 28 .

"By . Will Stewart . In the months before his recent death, the world's greatest gun-maker Mikhail Kalashnikov suffered 'unbearable' pain over the lost lives caused by his weapons, an extraordinary new letter reveals. He sought urgent spiritual guidance from Russia's top churchman on whether he was guilty in the eyes of God, according to his emotional appeal to the Orthodox Patriarch. Kalashnikov died in December aged 93, but the letter penned eight  months earlier from the inventor of the AK-47 showed a startlingly different attitude than his usual practice of blaming politicians for the wars in which his guns were used. Deadly icon: Mikhail Kalashnikov with the weapon that made his fortune - and won him praise and condemnation. There is one AK-47 for every 70 people in the world, the deadliest weapon ever created . 'The pain in my soul is unbearable, and there is one matter I cannot resolve,' he admitted in his personal missive to Patriarch Kirill. 'If my machine gun has taken lives of people, does it mean that it is me, Mikhail Kalashnikov, aged 93, the son of a peasant, an Orthodox Christian, who is guilty of the deaths of people, even if they are enemies?' Yet earlier in his life he was almost flippant when asked about whether he could sleep at night knowing that his 100 million guns had caused the deaths of untold numbers. Mikhail Kalashnikov, chief designer of AK-47, was today laid to rest in December with full state honours in Mytischi outside Moscow . In mourning: Russian President Vladimir Putin carries flowers as he pays his last respects to late Mikhail Kalashnikov . 'I am often asked, 'how do you sleep knowing how many people were killed from your machine gun?', he said. 'I always say back 'I sleep very well, thank you'. 'It should be politicians who start wars that suffer from sleeping problems. My machine gun was made for defence. 'If it wasn't for war, I would have been making agricultural machinery - so it was Germans who forced me to invent it. ' Soviet hero: Mikhail Kalashnikov in 1949, two years after the weapon he invented went into mass production . However, in 2008 he admitted: 'It is painful for me to see when criminal elements of all kinds fire my weapon.' In . his April letter, he wrote: 'The longer I live, the more this question . drills itself into my brain. And the more I wonder why the Lord allowed . man to have the devilish desires of envy, greed and aggression.' He signs it 'a slave of God, the designer Mikhail Kalashnikov'. His . first gun designs came after he saw Red Army soldiers in World War Two . bemoan their inadequate weapons. His inventions were both lethal and . simple. He became a . Soviet hero and received countless Communist honours.  But by the age of . 91 he was baptised and had evidently discovered a religious faith in . his twilight years. Militants: Osama Bin Laden was pictured with the weapon including in this photo in June 2001 . Conflict: A Libyan rebel fighter as she heard Colonel Gaddafi's forces had been driven out of Benghazi in 2011 . In the Vietnam war (pictured) U.S. troops reportedly threw away their M-16s and took Viet Cong AK-47s . 'The Lord showed me the way in the afternoon of my life,' wrote the former Communist rifle inventor. 'When at the age of 91 I cross the threshold of a church, my soul felt as if it had been there before.' The . Russian Patriarch's press secretary, Cyril Alexander Volkov, said the . leading churchman had received Kalashnikov's letter and replied. 'The . Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the . Fatherland, the Church supports both their creators and the soldiers who . use them,' said Volkov. 'He designed this rifle to defend his country, not so terrorists could use it in Saudi Arabia.' Conflict: A Serbian worker armed with an AK-47 during the war in Kosovo in July 1998, in which thousands died . Widespread: Young rebels in Liberia hold an AK-47 during the conflict with the president Charles Taylor in 2003 . Kongolu Mobuto, son of the former President of Zaire, in 1997 when martial law was declared in the nation . Kalashnikov's . daughter Elena admitted the letter was genuine but questioned whether . it had been written with the assistance of a priest. 'I have been in charge of his letters in the recent years but I did not take part in this one,' she said. She . said her father had 'never spoken about his feelings' concerning . religion and he had declined to cross himself when she gave him a small . cross to wear around his neck. 'He said: 'No I just can't, my arm won't do it'.  So he just used to touch his heart with a hand instead,' she revealed.

"By . Will Stewart . and Chris Pleasance . Police used batons and tear gas to stop Ukrainian demonstrators from storm the main government building in Kiev today. The ugly scenes followed the biggest rally since the Orange Revolution nine years ago as more than 50,000 people demanded closer ties with the European Union. Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych refused to sign a pact with the EU last week and opposition leaders allege the decision was dictated by Russian president Vladimir Putin. Tens of thousands of protesters attended the rally in Ukraine yesterday calling for closer ties with the EU after President Viktor Yanukovych refused to sign a landmark pact last week . After the main rally a group of around 100 activists tried to storm the main government building in Kiev but were forced back by riot police using batons, tear gas and sound grenades . Eugenia Tymoshenko (left), daughter of jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko (right), also attended the protesters and read a letter from her mother to the crowd which called the decision 'humiliating' The Kremlin is calling for Ukraine to join a Russian-led Customs Union, and has threatened trade sanctions if it does not. Police estimated the rally attracted 23,000 protesters, while opposition groups estimated they had hit their 100,000 target. While the main rally, during which people waved flags and banners which read 'We are not the Soviet Union, we are the European Union' and 'I Love EU', passed off peacefully, a hardcore of activists then took their anger to the government building. The main square was turned into a sea of Ukrainian and EU flags while protesters chanted pro-Europe slogans . Despite protesters trying to force their way inside the building there were no arrests and police did not try to break the demonstration up . The demonstrations were the largest since the Orange Revolution in 2004, also against Viktor Yanukovych, after allegations that he rigged the election. The race was eventually re-run and he lost, but then won again in 2010 . Several hundred people had to be forced back by police using batons, tear gas and sound grenades, though there were no arrests and the rally was not broken up. Opposition leaders have now called for the protesters to stay overnight and have set up tents in Independence Square, though it is unclear how many have remained. Elsewhere during the two-hour demonstration jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko issued a statement which was read by her daughter, Eugenia . In it she urged people to keep protesting to 'force Yanukovych to change his humiliating decision' and sign up to a pact with the EU. Eugenia also sung the national anthem alongside opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk as they encouraged protesters to stay overnight to show their support for the cause . Protesters have set up camp in the centre of Kiev as temperatures in the capital near freezing point . Demonstrations calling for closer ties with Europe have continued into the evening with more clashes with police . 'Don't let him humiliate us all in this way,' she added.'It's our road map to a normal life.' The protesters responded with chants of 'Freedom to Yulia' and 'Down with the gang,' referring to Yanukovych's government. Tymoshenko has been in jail since 2011 on abuse of power charges which she says were ordered in a vendetta by Yanukovych, and which the West believes were politically motivated. earlier in the day angry activists had shouted 'revolution' while they scuffled with riot police . In the cities of Lviv and Sevastopol protesters also gathered to mimic the demonstrations in Kiev (pictured) Opposition party UDAR claim that their leader Vitali Klitschko, the boxing champion, was prevented from attending the rally after his plane was denied permission to land in Kiev. He was instead forced to land in another airport much further away, after returning from meetings in Europe. Protests also spread across the country, including to the Western city of Lviv where 10,00 people gathered, and also to Sevastopol on the Crimean peninsula where the Russian navy is stationed. President Yanukovych held secret talks with Russia earlier in the month leading to allegations that he is a puppet of the Kremlin and acting on orders from President Putin . Opposition leaders claimed o have hit their target of 100,000 demonstrators, while police put the number at 23,000 . There pro-Western and pro-Russian demonstrators clashed in the centre, leading to police closing off several streets. The Orange Revolution took place in 2004 against the current President, Viktor Yanukovych, after allegations of widespread vote rigging in an election which he won. Thousands of people took to the streets each day until, under international pressure, the race was eventually re-run with the initial loser, Viktor Yushchenko, being declared victor with 52 per cent of the vote. Yanukovych won the next election in 2010, however, after a watchdog said he had conducted it fairly.","More then 50,000 protesters took to the streets of Kiev today .

"By . James Chapman, Political Editor . Nick Clegg is being urged by colleagues to forego his usual holiday in Spain and volunteer for a ‘summer of pain’ doing ordinary jobs outside Westminster. With the Liberal Democrats fearing wipeout at next year’s general election, and the Deputy Prime Minister’s personal ratings through the floor, senior party figures are drawing up a radical plan for him to reconnect with ‘real people’. It is based on former leader Paddy Ashdown’s decision in 1993 to spend several months outside the ‘Westminster bubble’, which was credited with boosting his popularity. Nick Clegg, who is being urged to ditch his Spanish holiday and embark on a tour of Britain . Lord Ashdown set off to ‘see for himself what was going on in Britain’. He travelled from Cornwall to Orkney, spending time on housing estates, in schools and factories, and meeting policemen, miners, dustmen and fishermen. He did stints working underground at a colliery in Scotland and at a gay nightclub in Oxford. He repeated the exercise in 1998, working on hospital wards and in police stations, usually sleeping in the spare rooms of families he visited on estates during the day. Paddy Ashdown, who boosted his popularity with spending several months outside the Westminster bubble in 1993 . Senior party figures want Mr Clegg to use this summer to embark on a similar tour of Britain in an attempt to counter the impression that he has become too comfortable with the trappings of political office. ‘Nick needs to do what Paddy did. He should use the summer to get out and about meeting ordinary folk and listening to their concerns,’ said one. It is not clear whether the Deputy Prime Minister, who is fiercely protective of his holiday time with his wife and three sons, will agree to the plan. He summers every year in Olmedo, a small town in northern Spain, where his lawyer wife Miriam Gonzalez Durantez was born and where the couple were married. A poll this week showed the beleaguered Mr Clegg suffered another sharp drop in his personal popularity between May and June. The Guardian/ICM survey showed his  satisfaction ratings fell 16 points this month to -37 – Mr Clegg’s lowest rating since he became Deputy Prime Minister.","Deputy Prime Minister being urged to embark on a tour of UK this summer .

The elderly driver suffered cuts to her face and had to be taken to hospital following the accident, just yards from her Bournemouth home. The bonnet of the classic car was crumpled into the wall as a result of the impact. An eye-witness described hearing a 'loud bang' and said it is thought the driver mistook the pedals, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake after filling up the automatic car.

"By . Associated Press . Pennsylvania authorities have broken up a drug ring they say was run by two prep school graduates. They say it supplied marijuana, cocaine and ecstasy to students at three colleges and high schools in Philadelphia's affluent Main Line suburbs. Montgomery County prosecutors identified the leaders of the operation as 25-year-old Neil Scott and 18-year-old Timothy Brooks. Both graduated from The Haverford School, a $35,000-a-year prep school. Scroll down for video... Neil Scott, 25,  (left) and 18-year-old Timothy Brooks have been identified Scott as one of the leaders of a drug ring prosecutors say supplied marijuana and cocaine to schools in Philadelphia's affluent Main Line suburbs . Quite the haul: Stacks of cash and semi-automatic weapons are displayed on a table with suspected drugs and dealing equipment . They were arraigned Monday on drug charges and related counts. Scott's lawyer declined to comment. Brooks' attorney, Greg Pagano, says Brooks 'regrettably lost his way' and is remorseful. Prosecutors say the pair hired students to peddle the drugs at Lafayette, Gettysburg and Haverford colleges, and at several suburban high schools. The two named their network 'The Main Line Takeover Project,' investigators said. 'Their intention, as the name suggests, was the two of them would take over drug distribution - in particular, marijuana distribution - in schools and colleges on the Main Line,' District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman said. 'This was not a game. These people were in business, they were in business to make money and they were going to do whatever they needed to do so that no one threatened their business,' she said. Wanted: Timothy Brooks is led into Montgomery County Magisterial District Court. Prosecutors identified Brooks as one of the leaders of a drug ring they say supplied marijuana and cocaine to colleges and schools . Partner in crime: Neil K. Scott covers his face as he is led into court. He was one of the leaders of a drug ring. Scott and the other suspect, Timothy Brooks, were both graduates of The Haverford School . Good upbringing: Both Scott and Brooks the posh attended Haverford College. A private, nonsectarian, preparatory boys' school outside Philadelphia . Scott would receive bulk shipments from a California supplier which would be shipped to his Haverford apartment, which allegedly served as his base of operations. Ferman said local students would be drafted into the drug distribution operation as sub-dealers to allegedly distribute cocaine, marijuana, hash oil and ecstasy. 'The high school sub-dealers were encouraged to develop their business so they could sell at least one pound of marijuana each week,' Ferman said. Brooks - who Ferman said acted as the supervisor of the student dealers - instructed them to make sure there was 'never a drought,' Ferman said. He wanted dealers to make certain there was always a constant supply in the assigned schools. If the dealers met their weekly quota, the incentives included a lower purchase price for marijuana in order to increase their profit margin. Ferman said investigators learned about the 'Main Line Take Over Project' through confidential informants and conducted a one-day round-up in February. In that operation, prosecutors said they confiscated 8 lbs. of marijuana, 3 grams of hash oil, 23 grams of cocaine, 11 grams of Ecstasy, $11,000 in cash, a loaded handgun, an AR-15 assault rifle and AR-15 style rifle. Most of the contraband came from Scott's Haverford apartment, authorities said . Damning evidence: Montgomery County district attorney Risa Vetri Ferman holds a rifle that was part of the drugs, guns, money and other illegal items seized when Lower Merion Police broke up a drug distribution ring . Haul: Drugs, money and guns were seized when Lower Merion Police broke up a drug distribution ring that supplied marijuana and cocaine a number of high schools in Philadelphia's affluent Main Line suburbs . Investigators found approximately eight pounds of marijuana, three pounds of hash oil, 23 grams of cocaine, 11 grams of ecstasy, $11,000 in cash, a loaded AR-15 assault rifle, a loaded 9mm pistol, and a loaded .22 AR-15 style rifle along with ammunition for all of those guns. During the four-month investigation, text messages revealed Scott gave Brooks advice on how to expand the marijuana sales in high schools, investigators say. Brooks then supervised sub-dealers who sold marijuana at local high schools. Brooks and Scott are former graduates of The Haverford School. They also played lacrosse at a Montgomery County private school and coached youth sports leagues. Ferman says the two men exploited those relationships to help build their drug operation. Scott, who is being held on $1 million bail, covered his face and shouted expletives at reporters attempting to get comment following his arraignment on Monday afternoon. His attorney declined comment saying he had just gotten the case. Brook's attorney said the teen 'lost his way' and is remorseful. His parents posted the $25,000 bail to release him from jail. Another one on the list: Conestoga High School is another of the eight schools and colleges that have apparently been caught up in the drugs ring . Caught in the act: Lafayette College another of the private coeducational liberal arts and engineering schools whose name has now been tarnished by the alleged drug ring . Eight suspects have been arrested, and authorities say at least three more are involved. Officials say the drug trafficking operation focused on distributing drugs to students at Lower Merion High School, The Haverford School, Harriton High School, Conestoga High School, Radnor High School, Haverford College, Lafayette College and Gettysburg College. In addition to Scott and Brooks, seven alleged 'sub-dealers' were also charged. They are: Daniel McGrath, 18, a student at The Haverford School; John Rosemann, 20, a student at Lafayette College; Christian Euler, 23, a graduate of The Haverford School and student at Lafayette College; Garrett Johnson, 18, a student at Haverford College; Reid Cohen, 18, a Haverford College student; Willow Orr, 22; Domenic Curcio, 29. Two juveniles, a 17-year-old Radnor High School student and 17-year-old Lower Merion High School student, have also been petitioned by the DA's office.","Multiple people have been arrested following an investigation into a drug ring that allegedly targeted local high schools and colleges .

"By . Lucy Osborne . A mother who defied a council’s bid to gag her after she was prosecuted for taking her children on holiday in term time is fighting for a change in the law. Janice Skelcher and her husband Ian took their two children to visit family in Australia. She says the three-week trip had to be during term time as she is a full-time carer for her dying mother-in-law and that was the only time alternative care could be arranged. Family holiday: Janice Skelcher and her husband Ian took their two children to visit relatives in Australia . They refused to pay a £240 fine imposed by Coventry City Council and were prosecuted. The court imposed a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered them to pay £400 costs but when Mrs Skelcher was invited on a daytime TV show to discuss the case, the council obtained an injunction preventing identification of the children – in effect silencing her. Now Mrs Skelcher has defied the gag and can be named under parliamentary privilege after Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming provided details of the case in a petition laid before the House of Commons. Mrs Skelcher, a former emergency call handler, said: ‘I am very angry because now I have a criminal record. ‘My family circumstances mean that I had no choice but to take the children away when I did – and there are many parents in the same position who cannot take their children away in a period specified by school. Australia trip: Mrs Skelcher says the three-week trip had to be during term time as she is a full-time carer for her dying mother-in-law and that was the only time alternative care could be arranged . ‘Any mother in my situation would do the same. I have not had one negative comment from the mums at the school gates. ‘The law states that there have to be exceptional circumstances. Well, if it is not caring for a terminally ill person with two primary school children, then what is?’ 'The law states that there have to be exceptional circumstances. Well, if it is not caring for a terminally ill person with two primary school children, then what is?' Janice Skelcher . In her petition, Mrs Skelcher is demanding a judicial review of the regulations, and asks MPs ‘to recommend that greater support and flexibility [are] allowed for parents to enable them to more effectively care for their children’. She told The Sunday Times: ‘The school knew the children were suffering emotionally and they still said that I was doing the wrong thing. ‘It’s crazy because... my job is to look after my children and that includes their emotional wellbeing. They [the authorities] are not living in the real world if they think these rules can work. I would do the same if I was in the situation again.’ The Skelchers are one of many families to face action following a government crackdown on parents removing their children from school during term time. Political involvement:  Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming (pictured) provided details of the case in a petition laid before the House of Commons, meaning Mrs Skelcher can be named under parliamentary privilege . Head teachers should approve absences only in ‘exceptional circumstances’ but some have interpreted the new guidance to mean a blanket ban on pupils taking time off – even for weddings, funerals and medical reasons. Mr Hemming said: ‘By petitioning parliament, Janice cannot be stopped from talking about her case.’ 'By petitioning parliament, Janice cannot be stopped from talking about her case' John Hemming, Liberal Democrat MP . He previously used parliamentary privilege to reveal that footballer Ryan Giggs and RBS boss Fred Goodwin had obtained injunctions to protect their reputations. Coventry council said it followed Department for Education guidance. It claimed: ‘On this occasion the parents decided not to accept the penalty notice, but the court’s verdict demonstrates that the council’s course of action was correct.’ The Government recently published a Bill that would allow schools to set their own term dates. The intention is to stagger holidays and drive down high summer prices that prompt some parents to take their children out of school.","Janice and Ian Skelcher took their two children to visit family in Australia .

"By . Chris Greenwood . A Labour peer accused of historic child abuse may not face further questioning due to his rapidly failing health. The politician, who is in his 80s, faces more than 20 allegations of historic abuse at children’s homes. They include deeply disturbing complaints of rape and serious sexual assault while he was serving as an MP. Scroll down for video . The House of Lords: The peer faces allegations of sexual assault while he was working as an MP . But it was claimed yesterday that doctors have advised that he is unfit to be questioned because he has dementia. In an unusual move, police have not interviewed the suspect under caution or arrested him over the damaging allegations. Last night they insisted that their criminal investigation continues and a full file of evidence is yet to be handed  to prosecutors. It will ultimately be for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to decide whether there is enough evidence and it is in the public interest to put him on trial. The Mail knows the identity of the peer, but has chosen not to name him as he has not been publicly identified by police. Those close to the case highlighted that the allegations faced by the Labour peer are more serious than those in the Cyril Smith scandal. The suspect faces allegations of rape and serious sexual assault spanning several decades. It is understood that as many as 25 victims have now come forward to police in the wake of national publicity around their operation. One source said: ‘Police have been shocked by the stories told by some of the victims and are determined to follow the evidence wherever it leads.’ Police are probing claims that he preyed on vulnerable young boys at care homes while working as an MP. Those close to the case highlighted that the allegations faced by the Labour peer are more serious than those in the Cyril Smith (above) scandal . The suspect is accused of using his hobby to get close to his victims and gain their trust. One man said he was seven years old when the politician visited his care home and entertained him and others. He told police the peer then took him aside and sexually assaulted him. He told the Daily Mirror: ‘That man humiliated me. He told me to undress then fondled me. It scarred me for life. ‘I complained previously and the police made a mess of it. But they are being very good now.’ Detectives have compiled a dossier of more than 20 complaints against the peer. It is understood that the historical allegations span several decades. It is understood his office in the Lords has been searched and computer equipment seized. His home has also been searched. A preliminary file has been passed to the CPS and prosecutors are expected to make recommendations on how to proceed in  the autumn. Asked why the Labour peer has not been questioned formally, a police spokesman said it was for ‘operational reasons’. He said: ‘The inquiry continues. A decision on whether to bring charges will rest with the CPS, and so far we  have not asked the CPS to make a charging decision.’ A CPS spokesman confirmed a ‘preliminary file’ has been received and lawyers are waiting for the full document. The peer was not available to comment at his London flat earlier this week.

"By . Associated Press . and Alex Greig . A disabled 78-year-old church deacon living quietly in East Texas has been arrested for a murder committed 33 years ago and 1,300 miles away. After his arrest, the wife of the man known as Roy Eubanks told local media she knew his secret - that he had killed a man in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, many years ago. What Gennell Eubanks, 62, didn't know was that her husband's name is, in fact, Joseph Lewis Miller, and the Harrisburg killing is not the only dark secret from his past. On the lam: U.S. marshals say Joseph Miller, an ex-convict wanted in connection with a 1981 Pennsylvania homicide, is under arrest after he was found to be living under an alias and serving as a church deacon in Mineola, Texas . In 1959, Miller, now 78, shot married couple John and Donna Lumpkins and pleaded guilty to murder after John Lumpkins died of his injuries. He was sentenced to life in prison on January 22, 1960. Miller applied to have his life sentence commuted, and his request was granted in 1971 by then governor Raymond P Shafer after Miller had served 11 years. Fewer than 10 years later, authorities say Joseph Lewis Miller fled Pennsylvania after shooting a man in a parking lot outside a hotel in 1981. He was charged with murder and three other felonies, but the case remained unsolved for three decades until investigators translated a previous tip that Miller had been living in Mexico under an alias - the name of a deceased cousin. First arrest: Miller, also known as Roy Eubanks, was convicted of the 1959 murder of John Lumpkins and served 11 years in prison . The U.S. Marshals Service in Harrisburg traced that name to rural Mineola, Texas, a town of 4,500 people. Miller confessed to the shooting shortly after his arrest, authorities said. People in Mineola knew Miller as Roy Eubanks, a former employee of the local paper plant who was collecting disability checks and walked with a cane. He married at least twice in Texas, most recently in 2010. His wife told The Associated Press on Monday that he had said he killed someone in 'the accident that happened' many years ago. 'He said it was an accident. He was trying to protect his brother, because a man was trying to kill him,' she told Penn Live. According to U.S. Marshals, Miller was charged in the 1981 death of Thomas Waller, 34, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The Patriot-News reported that Waller was found inside his car with a gunshot wound to his head. A . spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Board of Pardons said the agency could . not immediately produce the records related to Miller's 1971 . commutation Monday. It . remains unclear how Miller got from Pennsylvania to Texas, or why he . chose the town of Mineola, about 85 miles east of Dallas. The . man Gennell Eubanks knows as Roy Eubanks has arthritis, a Pacemaker and . walks with a cane, she said. She has never spoken to his relatives, . some of whom she believes live in Pennsylvania, and said he hadn't seen . them since he fled. 'They didn't want him to come back,' she said. 'They told him to leave.' Mineola residents said Miller had lived there likely since the 1980s. City administrator David Stevenson said Miller served on a handful of town boards and commissions and came to him for advice on obtaining a reverse mortgage. Murder site: The shooting of Thomas Waller occurred in a parking lot adjacent to the Times Hotel at the corner of 14th and Regina Streets in Harrisburg in 1981 . 'He always wanted to be active in the community... always wanting to help,' Stevenson said. 'I don't know anything bad or negative about him.'

'This was a real good man,' Gennell told Penn Live, adding that the Eubanks she knew was always eager to help neighbors and friends before his health began to fail in recent years, and the he didn’t drink, smoke or curse.

Smith described him as 'a nice, friendly gentleman.'

He was being held in the Wood County Jail pending court proceedings that would lead to his return to Pennsylvania.

"By . Chris Greenwood . Sir Hugh Orde, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said police are under increasing pressure to record 'playground high jinx' as crimes . Police are under increasing pressure to record 'playground high jinx' as crimes, one of the country's most senior officers said last night. Officers are regularly criticised for not adding petty pranks and boisterous escapades by youngsters to official records, Sir Hugh Orde revealed. In one case police dealt with three eight-year-olds caught bearing their bottoms at passing motorists by simply taking them home and informing their parents. And in another an officer did the . same when he was called to a 10-year-old boy and a younger friend who . were throwing around stolen penny sweets. But . official inspectors later said both incidents should have been recorded . as crimes, potentially triggering a full inquiry, even when the . participants could not be prosecuted because they were below the age of . criminal responsibility. Speaking . yesterday, Sir Hugh, said the trend is causing 'real frustration' to . chief constables who believe they should have discretion to focus their . efforts elsewhere. He said: . 'The point is less around the individual cases than the impact of a . process that obscures the detail and can deliver a false impression of . policing that ill informs the public. 'The . aim must be to improve policing and that is best achieved within a . profession which has the maturity to discuss and learn, not condemn . failures.' Police crime . recording remains in the spotlight after a series of scandals about . tricks and cheats used by forces to manipulate all-important figures. MPs have lambasted forces for 'gaming' statistics by reclassifying crimes and under-recording serious offences to put a gloss on their performance. Last year one chief constable broke ranks to admit that an 'obsession' with reducing crime is leading some officers to manipulate figures. Sir Hugh suggested Tom Winsor, the Government-appointed Chief Inspector of Constabulary, has overcompensated by toughening up the crime-recording regime. Sir Hugh said the trend is causing 'real frustration' to chief constables who believe they should have discretion to focus their efforts elsewhere . Speaking at the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) annual conference, he said complex policing situations are being over-simplified by bureaucrats. He said: 'One chief constable told me that Her Majesty's Inspectors had challenged him on a set of circumstances involving an officer who responded to a call where three young boys aged eight had chosen to bare their bottoms at passing motorists. 'He dealt with the matter by escorting the boys home, speaking to the parents and leaving. If my eight-year-old had behaved in a similar way I would be entirely satisfied and indeed grateful to the officer. 'But apparently that should have been recorded as a crime.' He added: 'I still remember learning that it was an irrefutable presumption at common law that a child aged under 10 is incapable of committing a crime.' An interim report into the crime recording standards of all police forces in England and Wales was published last month and a final version is expected later this year. Crime records are governed by strict standards laid down by the Home Office and the National Crime Recording Standard. In response a spokesman for HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) denied applying pressure to police forces to do 'anything improper'. He said: 'The integrity of police recorded crime is important so that police chiefs know the patterns of offending behaviour in their areas, and can deploy their resources with the maximum of efficiency and effectiveness. 'HMIC inspects against the rules as they stand. There is no question of HMIC deciding what should and should not be recorded as a crime. 'Making an administrative record of a criminal offence reported by a victim does not and cannot criminalise anyone. 'The choices the police then make in relation to the course of action to be taken are at the discretion of investigating officers and ultimately Chief Constables. 'The age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is ten.  No criminal proceedings could be taken against an under-age child. 'It is a common feature in the sphere of public accountability that when entities are held closely and firmly to account, they sometimes dislike and resist it. The police service is no different.'","Sir Hugh Orde said the trend is causing 'real frustration'

"By . James Slack . and Chris Greenwood . Police have no idea where he is: Murderer Robert Donovan (above) has been on the run since fleeing an open prison four years ago . Police were under fire last night for . taking four years to warn the public that a dangerous murderer was on . the run from an open prison. Robert Donovan, who was convicted of stabbing a West End theatre manager to death, walked out of Ford prison in June 2010. Police . considered him so dangerous that he should not be approached by the . public, but not a single appeal was made for help catching him until . yesterday. Donovan, 57, had . been in open conditions for less than a year when he absconded from the . prison near Arundel, West Sussex. Officers said they had decided to act . only after concluding he was probably no longer in the county. Tory . MP Philip Davies, who has campaigned for tighter rules on open prisons, . said: ‘It is quite extraordinary that this is only just coming to light . now. The public should have been informed straight away. ‘People . need to know for their own safety. If the authorities had to make an . announcement every time somebody absconded, I suspect a much more robust . system would soon be put in place.’ Donovan . was jailed indefinitely at the Old Bailey in December 1974 for a crime . that shocked the nation. The sentence – in this case, the juvenile . equivalent of a life term – meant he would be detained until the prison . authorities decided it was safe to release him. He was 17 when he and his brother Patrick, 19, and David Baillie, 17, killed Palladium stage manager Edwin Thornley. Prosecutors . claimed Patrick posed as a rent boy to lure Mr Thornley. He was robbed . before being fatally stabbed in the neck with a flick-knife on . Hungerford Bridge over the Thames. All . three youths admitted robbing him. Robert Donovan was convicted of . murder. The other two were convicted of manslaughter and jailed for up . to six years. Absconded: Donovan was moved to Ford Prison near Arundel, West Sussex, and left there on day release on June 19, 2010, police said . The fact that . Donovan has been at large for four years was made public by Sussex . Police just 24 hours after the Mail revealed how murderer David Richards . was able to walk out of jail and go on the run for nine years. The . disappearance of the 53-year-old Hell’s Angel should have triggered a . manhunt after he absconded from an open prison in Derbyshire in 2005, . but local police refused to look for him and did not alert the public. Back in jail: Michael 'Skull Cracker' Wheatley . He . was able to reinvent himself as a respectable member of society, . renting a flat, claiming thousands in benefits, getting a passport and . going to Ireland on holiday. Richards, who murdered teenager Michael . Groves in 1984, was recaptured only after the Mail was tipped off about . him, traced his whereabouts and spent a week urging police to act. It was left to the Metropolitan Police, which dealt with his murder, to travel to Wolverhampton and arrest him. Finally . making a public appeal yesterday for Donovan’s capture, PC Steve Reed, . from Sussex Police, said: ‘We have been looking for Donovan for several . years without success, which suggests he has left Sussex and could be . elsewhere in the country. We need to speak to anyone who could have any . idea where he is or where he could be.’ He . added: ‘There is nothing to suggest Donovan is currently a danger to . the public, but he has not served his sentence, so we want to get him . back into custody so justice can be done.’ Donovan . was said to have links to London and the Midlands, and may have family . in Portsmouth, according to police. He may also be using the alias David . Green. Sussex Police said: ‘If you see Donovan, do not approach him but call 999 immediately.’ Last . month Michael Wheatley, 55, an armed robber known as the Skull Cracker, . walked out of an open prison in Kent and held up a building society in . Surrey before being recaptured. Ministers said inmates should no longer be kept in open conditions or given a temporary release if they had absconded before.","Robert Donovan, 57, jailed for life in 1974 after stabbing man to death .

"By . Chris Greenwood . and Sara Smyth . Facing jail: Conwoman Juliette D'Souza, who extracted £1million on clients desperate for spiritual healing to fund her excessive lifestyle . She posed as a glamorous shaman who could use magic powers to help her desperate clients. In reality, Juliette D’Souza was a con artist fleecing wealthy victims whose lives were blighted by cancer, disability and fertility problems. Police suspect the 59-year-old was the most successful female fraudster in British legal history. They have been unable to trace all the money she stole but it is possible the haul exceeds the £4.3million stolen by a Goldman Sachs secretary ten years ago. D’Souza bled victims of their life savings and blew the money on luxury flats, first class flights,  jewellery, antique furniture and Louis Vuitton handbags. She even persuaded one woman to have an abortion after years of heartache while trying to  conceive, telling her the foetus was grossly deformed and ‘evil’. But her lies were finally uncovered – along with a treasure trove of ‘voodoo black magic’, including  an abandoned monkey and freezers stuffed with rotting meat. Last night, her spell was broken once and for all after a jury took just an hour to convict her of 23 counts of fraud. She now faces a long jail sentence. The verdicts end an extraordinary saga of deception. D’Souza targeted vulnerable victims who felt traditional medicine had failed them and convinced them of her supernatural powers. Falsely boasting of celebrity clients including Princess Diana and Simon Cowell, she tricked clients into handing over six-figure sums. She even bragged she had cured comedian John Cleese’s daughter of cancer and claimed her sister worked for the Prime Minister in No10. Investigators found some victims were so deeply ‘under her spell’ they agreed to sell their homes and borrow huge sums. They thought the money ‘sacrifices’ were flown to Suriname in South America, where  they would be hung from a magical tree in the Amazon by a shaman called ‘Pa’. Victims: Hampstead osteopath Keith Bender, left, referred clients to D'Souza in the belief she could help. Opera singer Silvia Eaves handed over £256,000 for help with stomach problems and to invest in a clinic in Peru . But the money was instead used to fuel D’Souza’s bizarre luxury lifestyle, in which she bought designer goods she never used and rented luxury homes that were left empty. At the heart of the scam was Hampstead osteopath Keith Bender who unwittingly referred patients to her in the genuine belief she could help. He received payments of up to £55,000 a time into his bank account on D’Souza’s behalf and even travelled with her to the remote jungles of Suriname. Among the victims was a woman married to a globe-trotting City high-flyer who handed over £170,000 as she spent three years trying to become pregnant. When she did unexpectedly conceive, D’Souza told her to have an abortion as the ‘baby was evil’. The woman, now in her 30s, was so traumatised she did terminate the pregnancy and later described the fraudster as the ‘cruellest and most evil person’ she had ever met. Another victim was the mother of a ten-year-old boy with Down’s Syndrome who was conned out of £42,000 when D’Souza claimed she could cure his behavioural problems. Voodoo dolls: D'Souza's con was exposed when Mr Bender and property manager Keith Mcmahon grew suspicious and broke into her four flats at Willoughby Road in Hampstead, north London . Pet: Mr Bender had been visiting one room to feed D'Souza's pet monkey, Joey, but did not dare enter the rest of her property for fear it was cursed. She had told him evil spirits would break his neck if he did . Opera singer Sylvia Eaves, 82, lost almost £500,000, some of which was hauled off by D’Souza in Sainsbury’s carrier bags. D’Souza’s . web was finally untangled in 2007 as she made a series of mistakes . which aroused her victims’ suspicions. She claimed to have attended St . Hilliard’s College, Oxford, which does not exist and got the name of . Princess Diana’s sister wrong. The . woman who had an abortion realised she had been scammed and went to . Hampstead police station in north London, but said officers ‘laughed in . my face’. This left her so . angry she forced her way into D’Souza’s home with the help of Mr Bender, . who was paying the rent on that property, and three others. Inside they . found the voodoo treasure trove – which also included drawings of an . ‘evil eye’, burned photos and a brand new barrister’s wig. The . owner of the property was so shocked he called in a priest to bless it . as he half-jokingly dubbed his disgraced tenant ‘Dracula’s sidekick’. Gear: Piles of rubbish filled the flats and stacks of carrier bags from designer stores littered the rooms . Police still refused to take on the case until her crimes were laid bare by a Sunday newspaper. Eventually investigators discovered D’Souza was a master of deception who hid behind a series of false identities. She . told victims she was an orphan born on a plane with the amniotic sac . over her face – a lucky symbol. In fact she was born Maryan Persaud in . Guyana. Far from having a university education, she was a former . cleaner, receptionist and temp. The . capuchin monkey, named Joey, which had been smuggled into Britain from . South America, was rescued by an animal sanctuary and adopted by . comedian Stephen Fry. After . the verdicts at Blackfriars Crown Court, Baljit Ubhey of the Crown . Prosecution Service said D’Souza, from Hampstead, was ‘a convincing and . manipulative liar’. She will be sentenced today.","'Shaman' Juliette D'Souza conned 11 people out of their life savings .

"By . Chris Greenwood . Andrew Meldrum: The 30-year-old used specialist computer software to spy on girls undressing . A pervert installed spy software on women’s computers so he could watch them undress. IT expert Andrew Meldrum, 30, posed as a helpful friend who would fix their laptops. But the university student abused their trust so he could stealthily watch them during their most intimate moments. Police discovered he amassed more than 11,000 pictures of his two victims, many of them naked, after secretly taking control of their computers. Yesterday, a judge said he was sure the ‘Peeping Tom’ was acting solely to feed his own ‘sexual gratification’. But he allowed him to walk free from court after handing him a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. It is believed to be the first time anyone in the UK has been convicted of abusing webcams to spy on others in this way. The case echoes the spying activities of GCHQ, which was revealed earlier this year to have accessed the cameras and microphones of computers without the owners’ permission. Meldrum’s twisted activities were uncovered when one of his two young female victims realised something was wrong with her computer. In a panic, Meldrum immediately sent her a text saying, ‘Please don’t call the police’. But she did and investigators discovered he had planted a specialist program on their laptops while pretending to fix other problems. It allowed him to watch them around the clock from the comfort of his home via the computers’ webcams without their knowledge. He even persuaded one of the women to keep the laptop at the end of her bed so it was in a ‘better position for watching movies’. In fact it gave him a prime spot for watching her being intimate with her boyfriend, Woolwich Crown Court was told. The women were horrified when police showed them intimate photos of themselves in front of their bedroom mirrors, often naked or in their underwear. In one case the software had been installed for 15 months and was set up to take a photograph every two seconds and transmit it to Meldrum. Twisted: Meldrum's software allowed him to watch his victims round the clock . Prosecutor James Vine said: ‘If you asked most people what a voyeur was, they’d probably tell you it was another word for Peeping Tom. They would be right. ‘That is exactly what this case is about, albeit a very modern version for the technological age. Andrew Meldrum does not peep through keyholes or curtains. He is rather more sophisticated than that.’ The two victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, tearfully comforted one another as he was sentenced yesterday. Recorder Mark Heywood said Meldrum ‘surreptitiously’ installed the software which even allowed him to watch the women on his mobile phone. He told Meldrum he ‘abused these people’s trust and confidence’. Shila Whitehead, defending Meldrum, said he had lost his job in IT and a place at Goldsmiths University as a result of his crimes. She added: ‘He is extremely remorseful and he accepts he violated their privacy. He previously turned to gambling and alcohol and has huge debts.’ Meldrum, of Lewisham, South-East London, was convicted of two counts of voyeurism by a jury and admitted a further three counts of unauthorised computer access. He was told he will be supervised for two years and must undergo 20 sessions aimed at addressing his behaviour. He was ordered to sign the sex offenders’ register for ten years, pay £2,100 in costs and told he cannot use a computer unless it monitors his activities. One of the victims told ITV news: ‘It makes you question your trust in people. And makes you question how you live your daily life, and what you do in your home daily, knowing that someone is constantly watching you.’ When asked about the breach of trust she had experienced, she said: ‘It’s just quite difficult really to know who to trust.’","Andrew Meldrum, 30, posed as a friend fixing the women's laptops .

"By . Chris Greenwood . The U.S. Justice Department has filed papers accusing Russian Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, pictured, as being the leader of the gang behind the software . Computer users were last night warned to take urgent action to protect themselves from a global cyber virus pandemic. Police across the globe launched an unprecedented attack on high-tech criminals behind software, called Gameover Zeus, causing misery to millions. FBI investigators say the virus has infected between 500,000 and one million computers in 12 countries, which will likely cost millions to national economies. 'Gamover Zeus is the most sophisticated botnet the FBI and our allies have ever attempted to disrupt,' said FBI Executive Assistant Director Robert Anderson. But the grip of those behind the so-called ‘malware’ has been weakened by a counter attack on the servers which control the software. The Australian Federal Police assisted the FBI with the operation against the Gameover Zeus botnet. 'The AFP can confirm it has been involved in operational activity supporting the FBI disruption action against the ‘Gameover Zeus’ botnet,' said a spokesperson for the Australian Federal Police. 'The AFP continues to urge individuals to ensure they have the most up to date anti-virus software to protect themselves from malicious software,' the spokesperson said. Those who fail to install anti-virus software risk having their valuable data, including precious photographs, music and personal files held to ransom. In the worst cases, victims could lose access to their bank accounts which could be systematically drained by the criminal network. Gameover Zeus has spread worldwide but has been temporarily disabled by the international effort by law enforcement agencies. Potential victims can protect themselves but have only a short time to do so before the hackers can rebuild their network. The international effort by forces including the NCA, Interpol and Europol, targeted the ‘command and control’ servers behind the virus. Hackers will be able to install new ones, but it is thought that there will be a window of opportunity of at least two weeks for computer users to protect themselves. Many of those whose computers have already been infected will be contacted by their internet service providers. The software installs itself on a computer when the victim clicks on a link in an unsolicited email or via a website. In the worst cases, victims could lose access to their bank accounts which could be systematically drained . Could Russian Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, pictured, be the behind the global cyber virus pandemic? He is the man suspected of being behind a gang that has sparked a global cyber virus pandemic. But the FBI has already spent years looking for Russian Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev who uses the online names ‘lucky12345’ and ‘slavik’. The 31-year-old is already wanted for his alleged involvement in a ‘racketeering enterprise’ that installed malicious software known as ‘Zeus’ on victims’ computers. The software was used to capture bank account numbers, passwords, personal identification numbers, and other information needed to log into online banking accounts. The FBI believes Bogachev knowingly acted in a role as an administrator while others involved in the scheme conspired to distribute spam and phishing emails, which contained links to compromised websites. Victims who visited these web sites were infected with the malware, which Bogachev and others allegedly used to steal money from the victims’ bank accounts. This online account takeover fraud has been investigated by the FBI since the summer of 2009. Starting in September 2011, the FBI began investigating a modified version of the Zeus Trojan, known as Gameover Zeus (GOZ). It is believed GOZ is responsible for more than one million computer infections, resulting in financial losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars. On August 22, 2012, Bogachev was indicted under the nickname ‘lucky12345’ by a federal grand jury in the District of Nebraska on a number of charges including Bank Fraud, Conspiracy to Violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and Aggravated Identity Theft. On May 19, 2014, Bogachev was indicted in his true name by a federal grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania on charges of Conspiracy, Computer Fraud, Wire Fraud, Bank Fraud and Money Laundering. Then just days ago on May 30, a criminal complaint was issued in the District of Nebraska that ties the previously indicted nickname of ‘lucky12345’ to Bogachev and charges him with Conspiracy to Commit Bank Fraud. He is described as white with brown hair (though his head is usually shaved) and brown eyes. He is 5ft 9ins tall and weighs around 180 pounds (82kg). Bogachev was last known to live in Anapa, Russia. He is believed to enjoy boating and may travel to locations along the Black Sea in his boat. He also owns property in Krasnodar, Russia. It then sends out more emails to lure further victims, without the knowledge of the computer users, and spreads quickly across the internet. The virus lays dormant until it spots an opportunity to steal personal details such as online banking information and passwords. It then transmits this information back to the criminal network who use it to drain the victim’s accounts. In a further twist, if the user is not a ‘viable’ victim then the software locks the information on the computer and holds it to ransom. At the moment the software demands one Bitcoin, an untraceable form of online currency favoured by criminals, which is around £300. The U.S. Government admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay this ransom to release sensitive files. The software can lock the information on a computer and hold it to ransom - one Bitcoin, an untraceable form of online currency favoured by criminals, which is around $500. File picture . Last night, the U.S. Justice Department filed papers accusing a Russian named Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev as being the leader of the gang behind the software. The complaint claims the software has been responsible for the loss of more than $100m from individuals and a string of major companies. Andy Archibald, of the NCA, said: ‘Nobody wants their personal financial details, business information or photographs of loved ones to be stolen or held to ransom by criminals. ‘By making use of this two-week window, huge numbers of people in the UK can stop that from happening to them. ‘Whether you find online security complicated or confusing, or simply haven’t thought about keeping your personal or office computers safe for a while, now is the time to take action. ‘Our message is simple: update your operating system and make this a regular occurrence, update your security software and use it and, think twice before clicking on links or attachments in unsolicited emails.’ Computer users who fear they could fall victim to the virus are advised to install anti-virus software and ensure their operating system has the latest security updates. It is thought that the gang first check if a target’s keyboard is in Russian and only strike if it is another language. Eunice Power is one British victim who has been blackmailed by the cyber criminals. After corrupting files on her computer, the gang offered to fix the problem for several hundred pounds. Potential victims can protect themselves but have only a short time to do so before the hackers - whose attempts have been temporarily thwarted - can rebuild their network. The US Department of Homeland Security urged users to install anti-virus software on their computer and ensure that the latest operating systems were also installed on their computers. If systems do not offer automatic updates, people should enable it. The department also advised changing passwords, as original passwords may have been compromised during the infection. The National Crime Agency advised computer users to consult the Government-backed getsafeonline.org website. From that website, computer users can download tailored anti-virus software which has been provided for free by eight companies. Symantec also advised computer users to review all their bank and credit card statements for irregularities. It also advised being cautious when handling unsolicited or unexpected emails, particularly during the two-week window before hackers rebuild their network. Experts have also warned users to back-up all valuable data. Many of those whose computers have already been infected will be contacted by their internet service providers. Miss Power, a chef who runs a business from home, told Channel 4 News: ‘I could actually feel perspiration coming out through me. ‘I lost everything: family photographs, recipes, payroll, my accounts package. It was devastating.’ The attack was so complex that an external storage unit that was connected to the computer at the time was targeted by the gang, preventing Miss Power from accessing it. AEV Ltd, a varnish factory in Birkenhead, was hit with ‘utter disaster’ when the criminals hacked into the company’s bank account to fake two payments costing £100,000. The criminals created two fake payment pages and tricked an employee of the company into authorising them. Managing director Jonathan Kemp said: ‘It started out as a normal day and ultimately by the afternoon in a period of three minutes we were £100,000 down.’ The FBI called the alleged ringleader, 30-year-old Evgeniy Bogachev, one of the most prolific cyber criminals in the world and issued a 'Wanted' poster, pictuted, that lists his online monikers and describes him as a boating enthusiast . Although the company was refunded by the bank, Mr Kemp said he spoke to other companies who had been hit by the scam, accumulating their losses at £3.5 million. Stewart Garrick, from the National Cyber Crime Unit, said that solicitor firms, police stations in America and academic institutions had been targeted. Charlie McMurdie, former head of the national ecrime unit, described the threat as a ‘cyber plague’ and warned that it could also be used to target mobile phones. She said: ‘Once one of these plagues is released everybody will pick up on it, adapt it and people around the world will be using these sorts of virus to carry out crime. ‘It’s not just computers, this kind of malware is now being hitting our mobile phones.’ ‘It can have a significant impact on individuals and companies.’ She said that the virus ‘had been known about for a long period of time’ and said that warnings about the virus had been issued over the last few months.","Up to one million computers have been infected by 'Gameover Zeus'

"By . Jason Groves . and Chris Greenwood . A police officer at the heart of the Plebgate affair boasted she could bring down the Government, it emerged last night. The explosive claim was made by one of those who barred former Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell from riding his bike through the gates of Downing Street.

The woman, who is thought to have been sacked for her role in the affair, also texted friends saying: ‘The Fed need our help.’ The . message appears to be a reference to the Police Federation, which was . fighting a high-profile campaign against Government reforms and which . exploited the ‘Plebgate’ row for maximum effect. PC Toby Rowland, left, is suing Mr Mitchell for libel following the Plebgate row. Right, the Daily Mail on April 1 . Mr . Mitchell writes: ‘Officers on duty were colluding with the Police . Federation to fan the flames for political reasons, as shown by the . text/email exchange, saying, “The Fed need our help”. ’ The affair erupted after Mr Mitchell was stopped from riding his bike through the gates of Downing Street in September 2012. A . leaked ‘police log’ claimed that Mr Mitchell called officers ‘****ing . plebs’. He later admitted swearing in their presence but always denied . using the toxic word ‘pleb’. He later quit his job over the row. Three . officers have now been sacked for their role in the affair and one – PC . Keith Wallis – was jailed after pleading guilty to misconduct in a . public office. A fourth misconduct case is now under way. Mr Mitchell has asked for full transcripts of the hearings, the publication of text messages and other contact between officers, as well as the release of further CCTV footage (pictured) from the incident in central London . Mr . Mitchell’s letter, a copy of which has been seen by the Daily Mail, . raises concerns that the Met has held its disciplinary hearings behind . closed doors. He . says the row has ‘badly damaged’ public confidence in the police, . adding: ‘I am deeply concerned that the disciplinary hearings were held . in private and were not open to public and journalistic scrutiny. In my . view it is in the public interest that it is all put in the public . domain.’ Mr . Mitchell, who has attended the disciplinary hearings, said he had been . ‘extremely surprised at the facts that were revealed about the actions . of numerous police officers before, during and after the incident.’ Mr . Mitchell is suing The Sun, which broke the story, for libel, which the . paper denies. Mr Mitchell, in turn, is being sued for libel by PC Toby . Rowland, who claimed to be on the receiving end of the Tory MP’s alleged . verbal attack. A . Met spokesman said regulations prevented it revealing the details of . the misconduct hearings but the force would publish a report about the . Plebgate inquiry and summaries of each of the misconduct hearings.","Officer texted the boast to friend after infamous incident became public .

"By . Chris Greenwood . When they first met, he was brandishing a large knife and his victim was bravely trying to defend his family business with a stool. But after being caught red-handed career criminal Oluwatobi Ogunbanwo adopted a somewhat different approach. In an extraordinary hand-written letter from prison, he begged for forgiveness from shopkeeper Eamon McCluskey and offered his ‘humblest apologies’. Forgiven: In this image taken from the CCTV footage of the robbery, Mr McCluskey can be seen defending himself against armed robber Oluwatobi Ogunbanwo . The armed robber went on to say that a ‘hardworking taxpayer’ deserves to be able to make a ‘decent living’ without the crook ‘taking what is yours’. The letter was passed to Mr McCluskey by police after Ogunbanwo was jailed for eight years for a robbery spree. He struck at his newsagent in Wimbledon Park, South West London, as Mr McCluskey was about to shut up shop for the night in February. Wearing a mask over the lower half of his face and armed with a knife, he leapt on the counter screaming at the business owner to hand over his takings. His terrified 51-year-old victim grabbed a stool which he used to fend off the attacker as he tried to escape and shouted for help. 'I'm sorry I robbed you with a butcher's knife': Oluwatobi Ogunbanwo, 22, wrote this letter of apology to Mr McCluskey for robbing his newsagent in Wimbledon Park, South West London . Attack: During the robbery, Mr McCluskey defended himself with a stool and threw beer bottles at the young criminal as he jumped over the counter bearing a knife . Ogunbanwo climbed over the counter and removed the till from the shop, making off with £60 which police found on his person when they arrested hm a short time later . But Ogunbanwo blocked him in behind the counter and Mr McCluskey threw bottles of beer at him in a desperate last attempt at self-defence. At that point robber wrenched the entire till off its base and fled down the street, where he had stashed his coat under a parked car. Mr McCluskey’s 78-year-old mother was in the back of the shop and ‘had the shock of her life’ when she came to see what all the commotion was about. Luckily, police were alerted by vigilant neighbours within seconds of the start of the robbery and intercepted the robber less than a mile away. He stole just £60 which was found in his pockets. The horrifying ordeal was caught on . CCTV camera and was the latest in three similar raids in three years at . the cornershop, which Mr McCluskey’s parents opened in 1962. The businessman was so upset by the robbery that he attended Kingston Crown Court to see the young criminal jailed. Afterwards, a detective approached him and passed him the neatly written letter from the defendant. In it, Ogunbanwo said: ‘A hardworking . tax-payer like yourself deserves to be able to make a decent living . without myself taking what is yours and has not business to do with me. ‘I . apologise for any distress I caused your mother or yourself and for any . further damaged caused. I genuinely had no intention to harm you in any . way, but that is still no excuse for my action or for any fear I may . have caused. ‘My mother works in Tesco and I could only imagine how angry I would be if somebody did that to her.’ Big heart: Eamon McCluskey, pictured at his shop in Wimbledon, has said he forgives the robber for what he did after his letter . Speaking last night, Mr McCluskey, 51, said it took him two days to open the letter but he believes the apology is genuine. ‘When I came out of court a police . officer said he had written me a letter. It was early and I was very . upset. I didn’t read it for a few days. Dear Mr Eamon McCluskey, . Before I go any further please let me express my humblest apologies in regards to the robbery that took place at your store. A hardworking tax-payer like yourself deserves to be able to make a decent living without myself taking what is yours and has not business to do with me. I apologise for any distress I caused your mother or yourself and for any further damaged caused. I genuinely had no intention to harm you in any way, but that is still no excuse for my action or for any fear I may have caused. My mother works in Tesco and I could only imagine how angry I would be if somebody did that to her. Both my actions and behaviour towards you were cruel and I sincerely apologise for that. Yours sincerely. Tobi Ogunbanwo . ‘Maybe he was remorseful about the robbery. He wanted to apologise for what he had done. I’m sure he meant it.’ Mr McCluskey said the 22-year-old robber had only been out of prison for 10 days after serving a shorter sentence for similar crimes. He described him as a ‘serial offender’ and said the court was told he had been committing serious crimes since the age of 18. Describing the robbery, the shopkeeper said he had recently installed panic buttons and a remote door lock but had become ‘blasé’. He said: ‘I saw the knife as soon as he came in the door. 'He had a mask on his nose like a motorbike mask and he had a butcher’s knife raised in his right hand. ‘He came to the counter and I went to the security door to get out but he got there before I did. 'I thought ""I have to get out of here or he will kill me or do me harm.’’ He said: ‘I am glad it’s over now - time is a healer and everything is back to normal now.’ Ogunbanwo, known as Tobi, of Battersea, admitted four robberies and three attempted robberies across Merton and Wandsworth.","Eamon McCluskey, 51, has forgiven criminal for robbing his newsagent .

"By . Chris Greenwood . An international ballet dancer cheated taxpayers out of benefits worth almost £28,000 as she toured the world in star-studded performances. Sirena Khalatian, 54, is a respected dancer and choreographer who has worked for the some of the biggest names on the global stage. She was paid thousands of pounds while working for the English National Opera, the Royal Opera House and productions at Glyndebourne, in East Sussex. Caught: Iranian-born Sirena Khalatian, pictured, cheated taxpayers out of housing and council tax benefits worth almost £28,000 as she toured the world as a respected dancer and choreographer . Cheat: The 54-year-old was paid thousands of pounds over eight years while working for the English National Opera, the Royal Opera House and productions at Glyndebourne, in East Sussex . But she failed to tell the authorities about her soaring career in the spotlight and continued to pocket housing and council tax benefits. After being confronted by officials the Iranian-born dancer admitted dishonestly obtaining at least £27,864 from her local council over eight years. A judge said there was no doubt the 'intelligent' artist knew what she was doing was wrong and that she had failed in her duty as an 'honourable citizen'. But despite the attack she was allowed to walk free from court with an order to complete just 120 hours of community service. One campaigning group said the Government must do more to ensure that the benefits system helps those who need it most, not greedy cheats. Khalatian is a respected classical dancer who travelled to China last month where she is choreographing a performance of the French opera Carmen. According to an online biography, she has also worked on productions in London, Paris, Monte Carlo, the U.S. and South America. But Inner London Crown Court was told how she repeatedly failed to inform Southwark Council of her growing earnings as her career took off. Prosecutor Adam Payter said that in the eight years up until January 2011 she received substantial overpayments while working in three different roles. When interviewed she claimed they offences were simply a 'misunderstanding' but eventually pleaded guilty when the case went to court. Among the prestigious venues Khalatian has worked is the Royal Opera House, in Covent Garden, London . Sentencing her to unpaid work for the community, Judge Usha Karu said she 'could not accept' that Khalatian did not realise her actions were dishonest. 'When people claim money they are not entitled to from a pool that is not inexhaustible it deprives those who are genuinely deserving,' she said. 'Particularly during the recent difficult economic climate, there must be others more deserving, honest and truly in need who may not have received the money they should have.' Jennifer Holdsworth said Khalatian, who cares for her elderly mother in Hammersmith, west London, is 'deeply ashamed' of her actions. 'Unfortunately Miss Khalatian is a dancer and actor and her work is sporadic. She suffered quite a bad injury which has resulted in her being unable to work,' she said. 'She will leave her crutch at the side of the stage and take Ibuprofen and go on to dance. She could easily have signed off working. 'But this is her passion and something she has done since she was four-years-old. She is 54 and has worked her way up and is now a choreographer, something she is extremely proud of. 'She is not getting any younger and her work as a dancer requires physical strength and the years are ticking by.' Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayer's Alliance, said: 'This sort of abuse damages the public's trust in the benefits system as a whole. 'The benefits system should help those who need it most, not be used as an extra income for globe-trotting dancers. 'This Government has made welcome strides in addressing fraud in the system, but needs to do much more to ensure that only those who need it receive taxpayers' money.' Khalatian, of south-east London, admitted six counts of dishonestly failing to notify the authorities of a change in her personal circumstances. She paid £150 in costs.","Iranian-born Sirena Khalatian, 54, is a respected dancer and choreographer .

"By . Darren Boyle . A suspected shoplifter was arrested after a new CCTV system compared his face with photographs held on Leicestershire Police's database. The man had not previously come to the attention of officers but his father and brother were known to police. The new computer system compared the suspect's features with those of criminals already held on the force's database and flagged the family resemblance. The new system compares photographs with images already contained on the police's database (file picture) The new technology is not admissible in courts but it provides officers with a possible lead, allowing them to track down other evidence. Leicestershire's Chief Inspector Chris Cockerill revealed that the system managed to identify potential suspects in 44 per cent of cases analysed by the system. He said: 'There's the potential for this to look like Big Brother... but that's not the case. This is not a surveillance tool, it's an information and surveillance tool for searching for suspects.' The new system may be able to identify thousands of other suspected criminals after it was announced that police in London will be routinely issued with body-worn cameras following the shooting of Mark Duggan which led to mass rioting and looting in Tottenham. The man was arrested after the computer flagged the family resemblance with criminals already photographed . Already, police have been equipped with cars fitted with an automatic number plate recognition system. The cameras photograph a car's number plate and run it through police databases, alerting officers if a car is not taxed or insured. Other details such as whether a car is used by a suspected criminal can be included on the system. However, Emma Carr of Big Brother Watch told The Independent: 'This takes the intrusiveness of CCTV to the next level, so it is absolutely essential that people are able to access meaningful redress when they feel their privacy is infringed. 'Many people will see the development of attempting to identify suspects based on the traits of their family members as deeply disturbing.'","Officers from Leicestershire did not recognise the suspected shoplifter .

"By . Darren Boyle . Stand-up comedian and former psychiatric nurse Jo Brand has attacked Simon Cowell's reality TV shows The X Factor and Britain's got talent as she believes they exploit people with mental health problems. The 57-year-old star said TV executives have a responsibility to consider the impact scathing criticism on such talent shows could have on the people taking part. She said that a poor singer might honestly believe they can sing because of a delusion. TV comic Jo Brand, pictured, said she feels angry because reality TV shows such as The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent could be exploiting people with mental health issues 'for other people to laugh at' She told BBC Radio 4: 'I have a huge ambivalence to shows like The X Factor and particularly Britain’s Got Talent because I think they wheel on people who have mental health problems for other people to laugh at. 'I feel very angry about that. 'It is easy for all of us to take the p*** out of someone who thinks they can sing when they can’t and I think that’s very cruel. 'The field of mental illness is complex because as well as issues like schizophrenia or depression there are lots of other different shades of problems. 'Someone may have a personality disorder or schizo affective disorder. 'There’s also delusion but sometimes that can be a symptom of schizophrenia.' According to The Mirror Ms Brand said families should tell the loved ones if they are not able to sing to help them avoid ridicule. She added: 'It’s more and more a feature of society – to hold people up to ridicule for one reason or another. However, producers behind The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent said they have a psychologist on site during the entire audition process. A spokesperson said: 'The welfare of our contestants is our number one priority. We take our duty of care very seriously and contestants are asked to disclose any concerns they have in advance so that we can offer appropriate support.'

"By . Jack Doyle . and Chris Greenwood . and Ian Drury . Taxpayers are shelling out nearly £10million a year so police officers and staff can do union work. Despite the financial squeeze leading to huge falls in police budgets, spending on union activity has shot up by 65 per cent in just two years, figures suggest. The vast majority of that money pays the salaries of representatives from the Police Federation, the embattled body rocked by a series of scandals over recent months. Spend: Despite severe police budget cuts, spending on union activity has shot up 65 per cent, figures suggest . The figures were uncovered by Tory MP Dominic Raab, who questioned last night why so much money was being spent on ‘trouble-making militants’. They were made public as the reputation of policing in Britain was struck by a series of further blows, including: . The revelations emerged in what is seen as a make-or-break week for the Federation, which begins its annual conference in Bournemouth. The Federation, which is still facing fallout from the Plebgate scandal, is under immense pressure to reform after a review found tens of millions of pounds were held in secret ‘number 2’ accounts by local branches without any oversight by senior officers. Insiders also came forward to condemn a . culture of bullying, credit card spending and political campaigning by . the organisation, while the Mail also revealed details of a ‘blitzkrieg’ strategy to halt Government reforms to pay and conditions. The figures were uncovered by Tory MP Dominic Raab, who condemned the increase as 'shocking' This week Home Secretary Theresa May will address the conference and is widely expected to deliver a tough message, as Federation members vote on reform proposals. Police minister Damian Green has said that if the Federation does not put its house in order the Government will change the law to enforce change. Last night Mr Raab condemned the increase in spending on staff. He said: ‘Taxpayers will be shocked to learn that their subsidy to the Police Federation has soared by two-thirds, at a time when front-line policing budgets are under pressure and the Federation’s reputation has been shredded. Taxpayers should not have to subsidise trouble-making militants.’ His figures showed the number of full-time police officers and staff engaged in full-time union activity was 238 in 2012/13, up from 174 in 2010/11. The total cost of police officers and staff engaged in union activity was £9,927,570 last year, up 65 per cent from £6,029,806 in 2010/11. The Federation represents the rank and file among the 130,000 officers in England and Wales. Police staff, who include PCSOs and administrators, are represented by other unions, including Unison and PCS. A Police Federation spokesman said: ‘Representatives are an important asset and contribute to the smooth running of forces. They deal with all employment issues at a local level and assist forces in dealing with grievances before they incur expensive legal costs.’","Union activity spending up 65% despite drastic cuts to police budgets .

"By . Darren Boyle . An Elvis impersonator who sang for Elton John posed as a 13-year-old girl to trade explicit pictures with other internet perverts. Louis Fella, 53, was jailed for a year after being caught with more than 900 indecent pictures and films of children. Some of them were in the most serious category of child abuse images. Fella rubbed shoulders with Sir Elton John at his famous charity White Tie & Tiara Summer Ball and has also played in front of Liam Gallagher, Tom Jones, Lulu and Shirley Bassey at Brit Award after-show parties. Louis Fella, pictured, impersonated a 13-year-old girl while talking online to fellow paedophiles . The father-of-two has travelled around the world with his act under the stage name Louis Rockafella. In 2002, record company Sony BMG snapped him up to promote the release of Elvis’s No. 1s album. He also appeared on US talk show The Jerry Springer Show in Chicago and with other Elvises on the Weakest Link. But the entertainer, who described himself as the UK’s best Elvis impersonator, was condemned by a judge over his internet habits. Judge Andrew Hatton said: 'A significant number of young children experienced abuse and vile degradation in order that you could obtain sexual gratification. 'You were continuing that abuse and suffering by those children by distributing those images to others with a similar wish.' Fella, pictured, was found to have more than 900 indecent images, many of them of the most serious type . Liverpool Crown Court heard police became aware of Fella after the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children flagged up indecent images uploaded to an internet storage facility. They executed a warrant at his home in Birkdale, Southport, last April and seized computers from his home and business, the Sun Recording Studio, named after the Memphis studio used by Elvis. On the computers and an SD card were 917 indecent images and four movies. Further analysis revealed that Fella had shared some of the files to other perverts on the internet. In interview, Fella admitted posing online as a 13-year-old girl called Becky to engage in sexual chats with men but denied distributing the images. But he last month admitted 19 counts of possessing and distributing indecent images. Fella, circled, appeared on a special charity of The Weakest Link with Anne Robinson for charity . David Morton, defending Fella, told the court: 'He engaged in a largely private and deviant fantasy world in which he did not truly understand the seriousness of his behaviour. 'He has expressed instructions that when indulging in this he was suffering from self-loathing and revulsion and on occasion beat it to a point, only to be drawn back in to it. 'He has expressed great regret.' The court heard how his relationship had broken up following the child porn revelations. Judge Hatton, who viewed the images, said he had no option but to impose an immediate custodial sentence. He told Fella, who had shorn off his Elvis-style sideburns ahead of the court appearance: 'It is very easy in these cases for lawyers and judges to make reference to scales, numbers and letters without anyone realising the material that we are dealing with.' He condemned one picture which showed a six-year-old girl being abused. 'A six-year-old girl suffered that abuse and degradation so people like you can sit at your computer and look at it and distribute it to others with similar inclinations.' Fella started performing as Elvis following a 12-year stint in the Army. Last month, when the Liverpool Echo exposed Fella’s sex crimes a close friend said he was left 'numb' by the revelations. He said: 'He is a cracking laugh - he is the last person I could think of that would do something like this. It’s despicable.' Fella was made the subject of a sexual offences prevention order for the next ten years and put on put on the sex offender register. Fella, pictured, even played in front of thousands of Elvis fans in Las Vegas during an American tour . He admitted 11 charges of downloading indecent images, seven of distributing some of them and one of possessing a total of 907 images between November, 2009, and April 8, 2013. Simon Duncan, prosecuting, told the court today that police received intelligence that someone using the name Beckyfella had uploaded indecent images of children to 'cloud storage' in April 2012. Officers attended his home with a search warrant and seized his laptop computer and SD card and they also went to the Southport recording studio he used and seized his Apple computer. Examination revealed that all three devices contained indecent images of children. 'There was evidence of distribution in conjunction with sexualised on line chats with individuals through Skype and email,' said Mr Duncan. The defendant portrayed himself as a 13-year-old girl and used a picture of a girl about that age wearing a skirt. Forensic analysis revealed a total of 917 images and four movies with 179 images in the most serious category involving penetrative sex. The 19 images he had distributed included some in the top category and all had come from 'his stock of pictures,' he said. When first interviewed he admitted searching the internet for dating site and pornography and admitted pretending to be a young girl but denied seeking child porn or distribution. Re-interviewed in March this year after the material had been analysed he admitted distribution but denied obtaining sexual gratification. The court heard that he has previous old convictions, including fraud, but had never been jailed. Mr Morton, defending, said that Fella, who showed no emotion during the hearing, has lost his relationship and contact with his daughter on whom 'he utterly doted' because of his offending. He said the judge had the stark choice between jailing him or allowing the embryonic work that he had begun with the probation service to reduce his risk to society.","Louis Fella from Southport had more than 900 child abuse images .

"By . Chris Greenwood . A Muslim who ran a scheme to prevent violent extremism yesterday became the first Briton to be found guilty of travelling to Syria to fight in the civil war. Police said the conviction of Mashudur Choudhury, 31, was likely to pave the way for others returning from the fighting to be prosecuted. The father of two went to fight with Al Qaeda to escape the shame of lying to his family about suffering from cancer. Choudhury, from Portsmouth, borrowed £35,000 from his family, claiming it was for medical treatment. Mashudur Choudhury, 31, from Portsmouth, Hampshire, travelled to the war-torn Middle Eastern country with the intention of joining a terrorist training camp last October. He was arrested on his return at Gatwick Airport . But he blew it on foreign holidays, a luxury car and prostitutes. Desperate to atone for his actions and ‘make something of himself’ he resolved to become a martyr fighting the brutal regime of Bashar Assad. But he is believed to have failed the selection process to join a hardline group of Syrian rebels and was thrown out of their training camp in disgrace. He was arrested by British anti-terror police on his return to Gatwick in October last year. After a 12-day trial at Kingston Crown Court, West London, Choudhury was found guilty of engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorist acts. Prosecutor Alison Morgan said: ‘The evidence clearly shows this defendant planned for and then travelled to Syria with the intention of attending a training camp.’ Four younger men who travelled with Choudhury remained behind. Another, Iftikhar Jaman, was killed fighting in Syria in December. Choudhury’s motivation for travelling to Syria emerged when counter-terrorist police investigated his background and business affairs. During the two-week trial at Kingston Crown Court, south-west London, jurors heard that Choudhury travelled to Syria (pictured) on October 8 last year with four other men from his local area . Miss Morgan said he was ‘leaving the shame of the life he had behind him to fight and become a martyr and make something of himself’. Choudhury once ran a Muslim youth group and worked as a racial awareness officer for Portsmouth council, where he helped to run the Government’s Prevent programme to counter violent extremism. But he gave up the job after less than two years to open a café near his local mosque. The business failed and he lost £17,000 borrowed from his sister-in-law. Boasts: One of the last images of Ifthekar Jaman, who died while fighting with al-Qaeda in Syria . In 2010, after accumulating further debts, he suddenly told his wife he had cancer. He then borrowed £35,000 from his family for non-existent ‘treatment’, but used it to go on a spree. He made three trips to Singapore where he posed as a businessman while hiring £200 prostitutes and texting false updates about fake hospital operations to his family. Despite growing debts, he bought a £17,000 Audi A6 and made three trips to Morocco with friends, telling his wife he was on business. On his return he became desperate to make up for his actions and decided to travel to Syria to die alongside other Muslim fighters. Police believe he met members of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, a group that was thrown out of  Al Qaeda for being too extreme. But the group is thought to have chucked him out after he failed to make the grade during training. Investigators found messages he had exchanged with his wife, Toslima Akhtar, on social networking sites. In one, she told him: ‘Your treatment of me, I just want to die. I hate your attitude.

"By . Darren Boyle . Linda Parkin told the family of a deceased man she would help close his post office account when he died then plundered the vulnerable victim's account . A care home manager stole money from a dead patient's post office savings after telling the victim's family she would help them close the account. Linda Parkin, 55, spoke to the family after the elderly man who died in September and offered to help them with his affairs. However, Parkin withdrew more than £13,000 from the dead man's account, with £10,000 of this covering fees. She also took £2,000 from an ex-smoker for cigarettes, even though they had given up the habit. Newcastle Crown Court heard that Parkin took the cash because she had been financially mismanaging the Bowland Lodge care home, Western Avenue, Grainger Park, Newcastle. Christopher Rose, prosecuting, said she used the rest of the money to pay off other residents' debts which she had allowed to build up, and to buy shopping for the home. Parkin, from Sunderland, was arrested at home on Christmas Eve and went on to admit theft and fraud. Judge John Evans sentenced her to a community order for two years with supervision and 160 hours of unpaid work. The judge told her: 'This is an unusual case of its kind. 'It is not suggested that you personally benefited, had that been the case, the position would be very different. 'It may be that you found yourself out of your depth.' Rachel Hedworth, defending, said Parkin had put considerable amounts of her own money into the business in a bid to keep it running smoothly. Miss Hedworth said: 'She was expected to carry out the role of numerous other employees as well as manager. 'She was entirely over stretched and wished she had resigned years ago but was very fond of the residents at the home.' Miss Hedworth said the married mother of three was deeply ashamed of what she has done. Newcastle Crown Court heard that  Parkin used the funds to pay off the debts of other residents and to buy food for the home. The court heard that Parkin did not personally benefit after taking any of the cash .","Care home manager Linda Parkin took money from elderly patients .

"By . Darren Boyle . A butler was crushed to death by a service lift as he prepared to serve tea at a stately home which featured on the TV series Middlemarch. Arthur Mellar was rushed to hospital with serious head injuries after the freak accident at posh Burghley House near Stamford, Lincolnshire. Doctors at Peterborough City Hospital battled to save the 48-year-old’s life but he was pronounced dead four hours later. Arthur Mellar, pictured, died after he was crushed by a lift at a stately home used in BBC's Middlemarch . Mr Mellar, pictured, posted on his Facebook page that stately homes were 'an occupational hazard' The house was used as a backdrop in the 1994  BBC adaptation of George Eliot's classic book Middlemarch . Mr Mellar posted a selfie with the 16th century building on Facebook just three months before his death with the comment: 'Stately Homes are an occupational hazard, such a bore.' Mr Mellar had worked as steward at the stately home for the past nine years. Unlike a typical butler whose main role is to serve food, the steward is more concerned with managing the estate and arranging security. Paying tribute to Mr Mellar his partner-of-three-years Gerwin Castillo, 39, said he was a 'loving, generous and kind' man. Speaking from the home they shared in Stamford, the NHS health care worker added: . 'They took him in an ambulance to Peterborough City Hospital. 'When I got there, he was surrounded by paramedics and doctors. He had a ventilator and they were trying to revive him. 'He was in the resuscitation room for four hours, fighting for his life. 'It feels like we were together for 30 years. He was such a beautiful person inside and out. 'He was kind and generous and a very loving man. He had a wicked sense of humour. 'The pain of losing him is immeasurable. He meant a lot to me. We’d made many plans together. 'Now I have to accept that he is no longer here. What I find heart-breaking is that he died in such an awful way.' Gerwin Castillo described his partner as a 'kind, generous and very loving man with a wicked sense of humour' Mr Castillo said: 'I was telephoned by his boss Orlando who said Arthur had been involved in an accident, and eight minutes later I was collected by a porter and taken to Burghley House. 'I was really worried. Orlando met us at the entrance and took me to where Arthur was. 'There were lots of people, paramedics all stood round him. He was unconscious. It was awful. 'At the time my mind was floating. They told me he got caught inside the elevator shaft of the old luggage lift which had somehow crushed him. 'I understand he was in the lift on his own. Somebody told me that the boss' children heard him crying for help. 'When I got there, I knew he was not going to survive. His face was bloated and purple and he had bruises all over his neck. I knew it was something very serious. 'He was taken to Peterborough Hospital by air ambulance but the doctor said he was very poorly and that he was unable to survive. They did their best. 'He no longer was responding to oxygen at that point so the doctor let him die peacefully. 'I stayed beside him until his very last breathe. I was hoping for a miracle.' Mr Castillo had been in a relationship with Mr Mellar for three years after first meeting on an internet dating website. Mr Mellar died following the accident at the Grade I listed stately home, pictured, on July 12 . He added: 'He was just a loving man. He would do everything for you, so kind and generous. 'We met three years ago on Match.com and it was our anniversary on July 8. 'It was like magic. There was so much chemistry. We were perfect. 'He was very proud of his work and didn't like programmes like Downton Abbey because he said there things in them that weren't really correct. Mr Mellar, pictured, even served tea for the Queen Mother and owned a classic Bentley and Rolls Royce . 'We liked to watch YouTube, he was a big Shirley Bassey fan and loved Carry On films. He liked to mimic Shirley Bassey. He was a great entertainer. 'He had been a butler at Burghley for years and had been working as one at other estates around here before that. He had been a butler since he was 18. 'He once met the Queen Mother at an event at work and served her refreshments. he said she was charming. He also worked for Lord Chumley.' Classic car enthusiast, Mr Mellar, who owned a Bentley and a Rolls Royce Silver Cloud, had worked at Grade I listed Burghley House for eight years. He was originally from Barnsley, South Yorkshire where his mother Mona, brother Frederick and sister Ivy live. His father Fred died on New Year’s Eve. Firefighters freed Mr Mellar who was then rushed to hospital in Peterborough by air ambulance, pictured . The Health and Safety Executive confirmed they were investigating the circumstances surrounding Mr Mellar’s death alongside Cambridgeshire Police. A spokesperson for Cambridgeshire Police added: 'We were called to reports that a man in his 40s had suffered serious injuries at Burghley House on Saturday, July 12. 'He was taken to hospital but later died. 'A joint investigation is being carried out by police and the Health and Safety Executive.' Burghley House’s estate director David Pennell said the house would co-operate fully with the investigation. He added: 'It is with the deepest sadness that we confirm the tragic death of Arthur . Mellar, a highly-valued member of the household team at Burghley, following an accident on Saturday, July 12.' Burghley House was designed and built between 1555 and 1587 by William Cecil, Lord High Treasurer to Queen Elizabeth I. The main part of the stately home has 35 major rooms on the ground and first floors but there are more than 80 lesser rooms. There are also numerous halls, corridors, bathrooms and service areas with added visitor facilities including the Orangery restaurant, gift shop and gardens.","Arthur Mellar worked at Burghley House as a butler for the past nine years .

"By . Darren Boyle . Jack Blowers, pictured, bought the goldfish from a pet shop in Lowestoft, Suffolk in February . A man bought a pair of goldfish with the 'sole intention of drinking them' as part of a viral internet craze, a court has heard. Jack Blowers was sober when he went to a local shop to buy the fish, Lowestoft Magistrates' Court in Suffolk heard. The 20-year-old was filmed setting up a pint-sized aquarium, complete with gravel and fish food, in a glass before drinking it in one go. The clip, which was uploaded to Facebook, goes on to show him vomiting up the contents of the glass into a toilet. He then rescued the fish and took them to his grandmother's house, where he put them in her fish bowl. They survived and are still alive today, prosecutor Kevin Batch said. However, Mr Batch said the RSPCA prosecution was in the public interest because of the level of 'pre-meditation' involved. Blowers' lawyer said he did not realise what he did was illegal. Richard Mann, mitigating, said: 'He knew that we all eat fish, we boil lobsters alive and things like that. 'Looking into the law, if he had done this with an octopus or something without vertebrae, this would not have been an illegal act.' Blowers, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, pleaded guilty to failing to protect the fish from suffering and failing to meeting their needs on February 8 this year. Mr Batch said: 'This case involves the current craze of Neknominate. Scroll down for video . Jack Blowers put the two goldfish in a pint glass with water before swallowing the living cocktail . Blowers was filmed by his friend Joseph Meikle, who accepted a caution in connection with the incident . 'The problem with this craze is that more often or not the next nomination has to be more extreme than the previous nomination. 'In this case the nomination was clearly to drink two goldfish.' A vet's report presented to the magistrates confirmed that the fish would have suffered. Blowers' friend, Joseph Meikle, 20, also from Lowestoft, filmed the stunt and has since accepted a caution. Chair of the bench Philip Key fined Blowers £200 and ordered him to pay legal costs of £600. He also disqualified him from keeping animals for 12 months. He told him: 'You bought two goldfish with the sole intention of drinking them and putting them on social media. Speaking outside court, Mr Blowers, pictured,  admitted: 'It was stupid prank which has cost me a lot of money' 'If you do become known for this in future, you've only got yourself to blame. 'We believe this was cruel, reckless and stupid.' Outside court, Blowers said he had not given the fish names. He added: 'I will see them again if I'm round my Nan's house. 'It was a stupid prank which has cost me a lot of money. I won't do it again but my family are glad I didn't do it with alcohol.' Neknomination is a viral craze which involves friends encouraging one another to drink something, often alcohol, before passing on the dare to three others. In June, Robert Atkinson, 20, was filmed buying a goldfish and taking it to a fast food outlet in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, before dropping it into a pint of beer and downing it. He was banned from keeping animals and fined £723 after admitting inflicting unnecessary harm to a protected animal. Two months earlier, Gavin Hope, 22, from Gateshead, was fined £300 after swallowing a live goldfish in a Neknomination challenge. play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video .","Jack Blowers bought two goldfish with the 'sole intention' of drinking them .

"By . Darren Boyle . An Argentina versus Germany World Cup Final was hardly unlikely given each team had their own Pope behind them - even if both men have vowed to remain neutral. During the 1986 World Cup, Argentina had 'the hand of God' in the form of Diego Maradona, however, in 2014, the South American team can call on the support of God's right-hand man. However, Pope Francis from Argentina is known as a fanatical football fan but he has been remarkably diplomatic during the month-long football tournament. Pope Francis, left, and his predecessor Pope Benedict, right, from Argentina and Germany respectively, have announced that they do not plan to take sides during Sunday's World Cup Final between their native countries . The football mad Argentine pontiff has repeatedly said he is remaining neutral during the month-long competition. His German predecessor, Pope Benedict is not considered a sports fan and prefers intellectual pursuits rather than football. Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said Sunday's final is on quite late and it is unlikely that Pope Francis and his predecessor will meet up for the match. Diego Maradona, left, was branded the 'Hand of God' after the 1986 World Cup after punching the ball over England keeper Peter Shilton's head, while Pope Francis, right, is regarded as God's right-hand man . He said the plan could change: 'We'll see in the coming days.' While on the field, the match may be decided by Lionel Messi and Thomas Mueller, superstitious football fans believe a higher power may be crucial factor. Pope Francis has so far refused to offer any special backing for his native Argentinian team who beat the Netherlands last night on penalties. Fr Lombardi said: 'Both would want the better team to win, without taking sides.' Pope Francis met with his favouite team San Lorenzo last December after they won the Argentine league. Pope Francis wished all teams good luck at the start of the World Cup tournament which ends on Sunday . Pope Francis, right, has no plans to invite his predecessor, Pope Benedict, left around for Sunday's game . Argentinian fans believe that 'their' man in the Vatican will inspire the team to victory during Sunday's final . The prospect of each team having their own Pope has captured the imagination of people on Twitter who have began speculating whether this is an advantage for either team. Germany had no problem progressing to the final having thrashed Brazil 7-1 in the biggest semi-final win in the history of the competition. Argentina, on the other hand, struggled against the Netherlands, relying on a penalty shoot-out. However, divine inspiration may have helped the Argentinians as Holland's first penalty was driven straight at the keeper. Argentine fans celebrated wildly after their team progressed to the World Cup Final and hope Pope Francis will put in a good word so their team will beat Pope Benedict's Germany who beat hosts Brazil 7-1 on Tuesday night . German fans could not believe the margin of their victory over hosts Brazil on Tuesday night which saw them progress to Sunday's World Cup final against Argentina . Argentine fans are convinced that Pope Francis is on their side and have even special papal masks - even though the Pontiff has repeatedly said that he will not be praying for his native Argentina during the tournament .","Argentine born Pope Francis has so far refused to back his native team .

"By . Darren Boyle . The mistress of a multi-millionaire businessman has cleared her name after her conviction for forging his £5 million will was quashed. Gillian Clemo, 61, was convicted of fraud after her dead lover’s wife accused her of fabricating the will of property tycoon Chris John. Mr John’s £5 million estate included an extensive property portfolio, luxury cars including an Aston Martin and a Porsche, and a collection of Second World War medals. His estranged wife Helen John, 51, and his mistress of nine years Ms Clemo have been engaged in a long-running legal battle since the 47-year-old businessman collapsed and died in 2008. Gillian Clemo, left, began an nine-year relationship with Chris John, right, after starting work at his office . Mr John was found collapsed at his £750,000 home in Cardiff, which forms part of his £5 million estate . Helen John, pictured, was given a police caution in April 2009 after admitting forging her husband's signature . The Court of Appeal today ruled that the will that Ms Clemo had found was genuine. Commenting after the case Ms Clemo said: 'My life has been a living hell since these false allegations were first made, five years ago. 'I am delighted to have been vindicated - I feel as though the weight of the world has been lifted from my shoulders. 'But I am also angry that this meritless case has gone so far. 'I would like to thank the huge number of people who have believed in my innocence and supported me.' Mr John died of a brain haemorrhage at his luxury £750,000 Cardiff home he shared with Ms Clemo in 2008. Ms Clemo, pictured, said 'I feel as through the weight of the world has been lifted from my shoulders' Helen John, left, received a police caution for forging her estranged husband's signature, while the original will said that part of Mr John's estate should be held in trust for his daughter Isabelle, right, until she turns 27 . Ms Clemo's name was cleared after the Court of Appeal considered the new documentary evidence . Ms Clemo later found a will at the home she had shared with Mr John - but police were called in by estranged wife Mrs John after she suspected it was forged. The disputed document ordered that the bulk of Mr John's £5 million fortune should be held in trust for his daughter Isabelle until she reached 27. Mrs John was only due to inherit the former matrimonial home in Cardiff. The High Court ruled on February 25 2013 that the original will should be executed, but Ms Clemo had to wait a further year to have her name cleared. A second will was later found in the same typeface and with the same signatures as the document Ms Clemo was accused of forging. It was examined by one of the world’s foremost handwriting experts who confirmed both documents were genuine. The fresh evidence went before the Court of Appeal in London who quashed Ms Clemo’s conviction for fraud. Ms Clemo started her relationship with Mr John in 1999 after she started working for the family-run estate agent Chris John and Partners in Cardiff. Mr John died in 2008 after being found collapsed on the bathroom floor of his mansion, Penhill House in the Welsh capital. Ms . After his death his estranged wife claimed to have found a legal document which appointed her as 'executrix and trustee' and lowered their daughter Isabelle’s age of inheritance from 27 to 25. But the executors of Mr John’s estate brought in police because they were were 'concerned about the authenticity' of the document. The Court of Appeal was told Helen John was arrested in April 2009 and was given a police caution after admitting forging her husband’s signature. By then Ms Clemo had found Mr John’s true will among his daughter Isabelle’s drawings, cards and photographs. But when Mrs John claimed it was a forgery, Ms Clemo was arrested and accused of fraud. She was found guilty of using a false statement with intent at Newport Crown Court and fined £1,000 and ordered to pay prosecution costs.

"By . Darren Boyle . A Ukrainian air force fighter jet has been shot down by a missile fired from a Russian plane, according to Ukraine's Security Council. The pilot of the Sukhoi-25 jet was forced to bail out after his plane was hit, said spokesman Andrei Lysenko. Meanwhile, pro-Russian rebels claimed responsibility for strikes on two Sukhoi-25 jets. The Sukhoi-25 ground attack aircraft  was shot down by a Russian jet according to Ukrainian sources, file photo . Rescuers search for bodies after an airstrike destroyed an apartment complex in Eastern Ukraine killing 11 . Pro-Russian rebels blamed the major attack in Snizhne, in the east of the country upon the Ukrainian air force . Ukraine's Defence Ministry said the second jet was hit by a portable surface-to-air missile, but the pilot was unhurt and managed to land safely. Moscow denies it is supporting the separatists or sowing unrest in its neighbour's territory. The incidents came after Russian president Vladimir Putin criticised the latest round of US sanctions against Moscow, saying they are harming bilateral relations and hurting not only Russian but US businesses. Mr Putin's comments came hours after president Barack Obama announced broader sanctions against Russia, targeting two major energy firms, a pair of powerful financial institutions, eight weapons firms and four individuals. The increased US economic pressure is designed to end the insurgency in eastern Ukraine that is widely believed to be backed by the Kremlin. The US penalties stopped short of the most stringent actions the West has threatened, which would fully cut off key sectors of Russia's oil-dependent economy. But officials said those steps were still on the table if Russia failed to abide by the West's demands to stop its support for pro-Russia insurgents who have destabilised swathes of eastern Ukraine. Pro-Russia insurgents have been fighting government troops in eastern Ukraine for four months in a conflict the UN says has killed more than 400 and displaced tens of thousands.","Russian jet destroys Ukrainian ground attack aircraft with a missile .

"By . Katy Winter . It's always going to be a day to remember. But one husband wanted to make sure his wedding day was one his new bride would never forget. Sean Rajaee, from Santa Barbara, California, put together a five-minute dance routine - taking in his other half's favourite songs. The footage of the choreography, which some of the groomsmen had to learn via video tutorials, has been uploaded to YouTube, where it's been watched more than 666,000 times. Scroll down for video . The enthusiastic groom (c) and seven groomsmen shake it on the dance floor to Beyonce's Crazy In Love . The group put on dark sunglasses to re-enact signature boy band moves to Backstreet Boys' 'I want it that way' Sean gets up close to his new bride to sing passionately to her as the watching guest cheer him on . Kicking off with Crazy In Love, Sean and his groomsmen can be seen in the video taking to the dance floor, where they shake their moves to a montage of tracks as the bride sits on a chair. The watching guests erupt into cheers when the first notes of Beyonce's song are played, and Sean and his seven good-humoured friends break into a (nearly) perfectly synchronised ‘booty shake’. As the music moves on to Bootylicious, it becomes clear that while the dancing may not be quite professional standards, the performance is a touching labour of love. Performed with some serious enthusiasm, the men don shades to serenade the bride, with a song by her favourite band, Backstreet Boys’ ballard I Want It That Way. In a nod to Sean's Persian ancestry the group dance to a Persian pop song wearing comical mustaches . An impressive Mexican wave draws cheers from the surprised audience . Sean and his overwhelmed bride share a tender kiss at the end of the montage to Bruno Mars' Marry You . The performance ends - with shrieks from the audience - with Bruno Mars' Marry You. Sean, an Orthopedic Surgery Resident at Cedar Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, presents a rose to his overwhelmed bride, Ariana, and the two, both in their late 20s, share a tender kiss as the watching crowd cheers. The footage was uploaded to YouTube by Sean's sister Shirin Rajaee, who is a news anchor for ABC KEYT Santa Barbara. Shirin wrote on YouTube: 'My brother Sean Rajaee surprised his bride with a choreographed American/Persian groomsmen dance at his wedding June 21, 2014. 'The dance started off with a Beyonce song then went into the bride (Ariana's) favorite boy band the Backstreet Boys and ended with the Bruno Mars song Marry You. 'The group even included a fun Persian dance number. 'Some of the groomsmen flew in from across the country and had to learn the routine last minute and via video tutorial. 'The bride, Ariana, was in shock and so were all the guests.' She added: 'I posted the video because it was so good I wanted to share it, but I never knew it would blow up as fast as it has. 'My brother's dance moves takes me back to our childhood days when I'd have him listen to my favorite groups, Nysnc and Beyonce. 'Our next goal is to get these guys to perform on the Ellen Show!'

"By . Katy Winter . A woman’s diet nearly ended in divorce after her husband of 13 years became convinced she was trying to attract a new man - so she remarried him to prove she only had eyes for him. Lindsey Groves, 32, weighed 17 stone five years ago, and her husband, Alan, 41, had only ever known his wife to be overweight and insecure. The mother-of-three, of Knutsford, Cheshire, finally found her confidence when she shed six stone last year, but Alan became convinced his slim wife would leave him for a younger man. Lindsey Groves lived on a calorific diet of junk food, crisps and chocolate bars, and weighed 17 stone . After losing six stone, and proud to show off her slender figure, Lindsey started going out with friends more . After Alan becoming convinced Lindsey was trying to look for a new man, she reassured him by remarrying him last year (pictured) Teetering on the brink of divorce, Lindsey had to resort to extreme measures to prove to her husband she loved him - so last year she remarried him. Lindsey, a kitchen-assistant, said: 'My diet nearly ended in divorce - my husband was convinced I would leave him for a new man when I slimmed down. 'I knew I had to prove to him that I loved him, so we remarried last year and that convinced him that he is still the only one for me.' Lindsey revealed that she had struggled with her weight from a young age - and was the biggest in her school class. 'I was always the biggest in my group of friends - even at primary school I stood out,' she said. Shortly after giving birth to her youngest daughter, the mother-of-three weighed in at 17 stone . 'I . was a slightly tubby size 14 when I first met Alan in a local pub and . we instantly hit it off - by 2001 we were married and had the first of . our three children on the way.' Shortly after giving birth to her youngest daughter, Lindsey weighed in at 17 stone. On a typical day she lived on a calorific diet of junk food, crisps and chocolate bars. Lindsey said: 'I didn’t really eat three meals a day, I just grazed. I’d eat everything I could at all hours of the day. 'Alan always said the right thing - he loved me whatever size I was, but I was so self-conscious. 'I couldn’t bare to be touched by him, I hated the thought of him feeling all my fat through my clothes. 'The more I hated myself, the more I nagged Alan. I was certain he was going to leave me for someone else.' Constant snacking and bad food choices saw Lindsey's weight rise and her self confidence plummet . Desperate to shift her belly, Lindsey signed up to a local slimming club in 2011. She finally lost six stone through diet and exercise. She stuck to a strict diet eating Weetabix with semi-skimmed milk for breakfast, lean meat and vegetables for lunch, and a pasta salad for dinner. She stopped snacking between meals and shunned junk food in favour of fresh fruit and vegetables. She also started exercising, going to the gym for high intensity cardio classes three times a week. 'I was at the gym most days, and jogging on the others,' Lindsey said. 'I’ve swapped comfort eating for exercise. Lindsey, pictured with her two daughters, also started exercising, going to the gym for high intensity cardio classes three times a week . Having lost the weight, Lindsey began going out more and socialising with new friends, causing Alan to become insecure about their relationship and leading them to the brink of divorce . 'The pounds were quickly dropping off and before long I was a slim 11 stone. It was the best I’d ever looked.' Finally proud to show off her slender figure, Lindsey started going out with friends more frequently. But while she was on cloud nine, her marriage was entering a storm. She said: 'I was expecting Alan to be chuffed with his new hot wife, but if he was he certainly wasn’t showing it. 'He always seemed to be spoiling for a fight, accusing me of fancying other people. 'Every time I went out, he’d throw me a snide comment about what I was wearing, or how many times I’d been out that week. Mrs Groves decided to prove to her husband that, despite her new figure, she was still the same woman he married 13 years ago (pictured left at their first wedding at 2001) 'I knew we couldn’t go on like that and I snapped, demanding to know what was going on in his head. 'That’s when he admitted that after 12 years of living with a wife without any confidence, he was struggling to adjust to the new me. 'He was convinced I was looking for a new man to go with my new body. Our marriage was on the brink of collapse - I was devastated.' Mrs Groves decided to prove to her husband that, despite her new figure, she was still the same woman he married 13 years ago. She asked him if he would marry her again. Getting remarried has proved to Alan that the new slimmer Lindsey still loves him . Lindsey said: 'It was a wonderful ceremony, we got married in a church in front of 60 friends and family. 'I was able to wear a proper wedding dress this time around - as at our first wedding I was too large.' Alan, a handy man, said: 'After she lost weight Lindsey started to go out more. She found a new group of friends who she loved to socialise with, meanwhile I would have to stay at home to look after the kids. 'She had a gorgeous new look and fresh confidence, so I did worry she’d meet another man. 'But when Lindsey asked me to marry her again, I realised that she wanted to show off the fact that we’re still together and in love. 'When I saw her walk down the church aisle I was so proud to call her my wife. She looked beautiful, and I finally believed it was me she wanted.'","Diet of junk food caused Lindsey's weight to rise to 17 stone .

"By . Katy Winter . Relationship break-ups can be tough and sometimes they can take their toll on your body. Some of us might lose weight on the heartbreak diet, others may gain it through comfort eating. Lisa Warmington, from Warwick, fell into the latter category when she split with her boyfriend two years ago – and gained two stone. 'I felt depressed and found myself comfort eating. Any time of the day really, it just made me feel better for a few minutes,' admits Lisa, 30. Scroll down for video . Standing at 5ft 9in, Lisa dropped from 13st and a size 14 to 11st in just eight weeks . 'I was actually aware that I was gaining weight but I just didn’t care as I felt down. Lisa’s formerly svelte figure grew from 11st to 13st and – as her before pictures show – she gained a dreaded muffin top and added bulk to her thighs. 'There were times when I would try to lose weight, but I’d slip back into the habits of snacking on chocolate and so on,' admits Lisa. 'But then there was a moment when I thought that I didn’t want to be like this anymore, and I needed to take charge of it now – if not now, it’s never.' Lisa’s extra weight knocked her confidence especially hard as she had always enjoyed a slim figure and had never had any issue with her weight. 'To me it felt like the end of the world,' she confesses. 'I even considered a gastric band, even though I know they are risky. No1Bootcamp . Lisa turned to junk food and comfort eating when she broke up with her boyfriend two years ago (left) but has since lost the weight she gained (right) 'But then I decided I would do it the healthy way and give myself a proper length of time to lose a proper amount of weight. 'I’d always enjoyed exercise in the past, so I signed up to No1 Boot Camp for eight weeks. 'My goal was to lose the two stone I’d gained within that time. When I arrived at the base in Norfolk I was a Size 14 and – at 5ft 9in. I know that won’t sound heavy to everyone but it wasn’t ‘me’. Lisa admits that it was hard work and there were tears, but never lost sight of the eventual pay-off. 'At the end of each week, you see the weight you’ve lost and it spurs you on,' she says. By the fourth week, Lisa had visibly worked off her stubborn tummy fat and an enviable waistline was forming. Her self-confidence was also growing. Lisa did three daily exercise sessions as well as an hour and half hike every day, meaning that by week 4 (pictured) the changes in her body were already noticeable . 'You do adapt to the exercise – at the start I could barely run, towards the end the team had to set me tougher challenges,' she adds. 'I rarely felt hungry. I struggled a bit at first withdrawing from sugar but after a couple of weeks that passed. We were allowed a treat at the weekend, but you don’t really feel like it.' Lisa left boot camp two weeks ago – at her target weight of 11st and feeling back in possession of a lean, toned body to be proud of. 'I’m at my happy weight,' she smiles. 'It feels great to be back in my old clothes. I’ve found my motivation has stayed strong, I don’t want to put weight on like that again. 'I’m heading back to Norfolk to see the team soon as I want to maintain my weight.' Lisa reveals that she also feels so much better emotionally.

"By . Katy Winter . A rugby player’s girlfriend scored a spectacular drop goal of her own by losing six st in weight after being told she had 'good legs for rugby'. Lindsay Briggs, 24, weighed 16st and wore size 20 clothing after years of struggling to control her weight. The trainee accountant of Bexleyheath, Kent, was shocked into changing her diet and taking up exercise after her well-meaning boyfriend Dave Carey, 25, told her that her larger legs would make her a perfect rugby player. Lindsay, picture with boyfriend Dave before she lost weight, scored a spectacular drop goal of her own by losing six st in weight after Dave innocently told her she had 'good legs for rugby' She said: 'I laughed it off at first, because it was obviously a joke. Then I realised that he wouldn’t have said it unless it was at least partly true. 'I looked down and thought, ‘my goodness, he’s right’. I knew then that I had to do something about it.' Miss Briggs said her problems with weight gain began when she was still in school. She said: 'I’d always been larger but had managed to lose a couple of stone by the time I met Dave in 2010. Dropped from 16st and a size 20 to a trim 10st and her waist is now the same size as one of Dave's thighs . 'But then the weight piled back on as I fell into our new, comfortable relationship. I often went to watch Dave play rugby, where the only food available was fatty snacks. It became a cycle.' Miss Briggs frequently supported Mr Carey, a bricklayer and prop forward for Dartfordians RFC, by accompanying him to matches. A conversation on the way to a match in the winter of 2012 proved a turning point. She said: 'Dave didn’t mean any harm but, joking or not, I realised I didn’t want rugby legs. I suddenly thought, ‘how could I have let myself get like this?""' In early March 2013 Miss Briggs joined her local Slimming World group and kicked junk food into touch for good. She also joined a local sports centre and began participating in jazzercize classes three times a week. Lindsay say that as she became comfortable in her relationship with Dave (pictured together) she piled on the pounds through unhealthy snacking . Lindsay used to eat  typically ate a croissant with strawberry cream and a chocolate bar with a packet of crisps for breakfast alone, and snack more chocolate, energy drinks and takeaways through the day . Before beginning her weight loss regime, Miss Briggs typically ate a croissant with strawberry cream and a chocolate bar with a packet of crisps for breakfast, a tuna melt sandwich with another chocolate bar for lunch, followed by burger and chips or an Indian takeaway for dinner. She would also consume several cans of energy drink during the day. Today, she eats a pre-prepared oat and yogurt mix for breakfast, followed by tuna steak with portion-controlled pasta for lunch, and turkey with vegetables for evening meal. She still snacks, but limits her intake to the occasional sweet or packet of crackers with cheese dip. This March, a year after beginning her weight loss journey, she reached her target weight of 10st. She said: 'My waist size is now the same size as one of Dave’s thighs. I’m so proud of what I’ve achieved. Lindsay now eats oat and yogurt mix for breakfast, followed by tuna steak with portion-controlled pasta for lunch, and turkey with vegetables for evening meal . 'Thankfully there have been no more ‘rugby legs’ comments. Dave can’t get over the difference I’ve managed to make through hard work. 'I feel so much more positive and energised now. I’ll never let myself go back to the way I was. 'I found that giving myself little mottos to repeat helped enormously. One of my favourites is ‘wake up determined, go to sleep satisfied’. It’s  helped me resist the urges to overeat. 'Perhaps I could still play rugby, but I wouldn’t be able to be a prop any more. Now I’d be more suited to the wing.'","Lindsay typically ate a croissant with strawberry cream and .

After being refused weight loss surgery on the NHS, Charlotte decided to take control and began exercising and found she loved it, running four times a week. Now (pictured left and right) she weighs a healthy 12st and says she's 'addicted to exercise' She said: 'I was gutted when I was told I couldn’t have the surgery. I really felt as if I deserved it, considering what I’d been through. But Richard picked me up, and convinced me that I’d be able to slim down if I started getting some exercise. 'He persuaded me to join a gym and I quickly became obsessed. I went more than four times a week. I loved running.' Charlotte, who works in children’s services, found it difficult to control her weight gain following the births of her children Elicia, now 21, Olivia, 19, George, 14, and Harrison, 10. She said: 'After each of the births my weight crept up and despite trying diets, I couldn’t seem to do anything about it. Biscuits and chocolate were my downfall. 'I got post-natal depression after each of the births, and I comfort ate. As my weight went up, the depression hit me harder, so it was a bit of a circle.'

She said: 'It was quite scary while I waited for the tests to come back. 'The doctor said my womb had collapsed onto my bowel because I was overweight, and that the only course of action was a hysterectomy. 'I was gutted.

Breakfast: Grapefruit . Lunch: A tuna salad . Dinner: Grilled chicken and fresh vegetables . Snacks: None . A year later, her weight having reached its maximum of 22st and wearing size 26 clothing, Mrs Green decided to ask her doctor about whether she could have bariatric surgery on the NHS.

"By . Katy Winter . Created: . 04:21 EST, 26 June 2014 . When Michael Jarvis became Michelle, she shed a whopping ten stone and underwent a radical transformation. The father-of-three had felt trapped in the wrong body his whole life and, depressed by his predicament, gorged on takeaways, chips and fry-ups to numb the pain, ballooning to 28st 7lb at his heaviest. But the 52-year-old is now virtually unrecognisable after swapping trousers for skirts - and chocolate for salad. Michelle Jarvis, 52, formerly Michael  says her decision to change gender helped her shed 10st, and is now living as a woman with wife of 10 years Lynn, 57, and their children Michael and Gwyneth (pictured right) Michelle, whose wife Lynn is sticking by her, said: 'I always knew I was different, from a young age. 'I would take every opportunity to dress as a woman behind closed doors. 'I would hide myself away and eat mountains of food. I would eat in secret, it helped numb the pain. I would pile my plate high with as much food as possible. I would eat and eat and eat.' Michael, as he was then known, of Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria, had found himself trapped not only in the wrong body but also in a destructive cycle of over-eating to compensate for his misery. He would gorge on fry-ups for his breakfast, chips for his lunch and a takeaway for his tea, snacking on chocolate and crisps in between. It was in 2010, two years before he began dressing as a woman full-time, that Michael started to shed the pounds. Michael shed six stone before he made the decision to become a woman. She is now known as Michelle and is happier than ever. Michelle and Lynn today . Michelle has been married to Lynn for 10 years and they have three children together. Lynn has accepted her husband's lifestyle choice and opted to stay with her (right: Michelle and Lynn today, left: years ago) Michelle with wife of 18 years Lynn, 57, and their children at their family home in Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria . He radically changed his diet, swapping greasy fry-ups for healthy cereal, cutting out the snacks and walking for up to 14 miles a day. Michael, now a full-time carer to wife Lynn, added: 'I started to feel better in myself. Then I seriously began thinking about changing my sex for good. 'After I began to dress as a woman full-time I lost even more weight. I think the hormones I was taking helped. For some reason I began to crave salad. I had never liked it much before.' The former welder and taxi driver weighed 28st 7lb at her heaviest and has shed 10st in total. However, the medication she takes to assist her sex change has meant that herweight fluctuates and she is now around 18st, and wants to lose more. Michelle is due to undergo final gender reassignment surgery later this year . It was in 2013, after she had shed most of the weight, that she went to Benidorm on her own and spent her entire time among people she did not know,. 'It was then that I realised for sure I wanted to live as a woman permanently. 'I just felt so much more comfortable and so much more myself.' she added. Michelle has been married to Lynn for 10 years and they have three children together; Michael, 18, Gwyneth, 13 and Tara, 19. Lynn, 57, who suffers from a severe form of diabetes, has accepted her husband’s lifestyle choice and opted to stay with her. Michelle added: 'I told my wife Lynn very early on that I liked to dress as a woman as a previous relationship had broken down because of it. 'She was understanding, but neither of us had any idea I would one day change sex.' Lynn said: 'When he told me he wanted to live as a woman full-time I knew things would be difficult and I was shocked. 'But the most important thing is that Michelle is content in her own skin. I have always thought that. 'Of course, it has been hard. Our house has been vandalised and our children bullied as a result. 'I fell in love with a man - and now I am with a woman. 'But we’ve been together for so long. I simply do not know what I would do without her. She is still the same kind and generous person I first met. 'And I am so proud of her for losing so much weight. I couldn’t be happier for her.' Michelle is due to undergo final gender reassignment surgery later this year. She has set up support group Cleveland Transgender Association to lend support to transgendered people in her area as she felt there was very little on offer.

"By . Steph Cockroft . Volunteer divers have joined the hunt for a father's £8,000 prosthetic leg which fell off when he jumped into the water. Roy Wright, 45, from Addlestone, Surrey, lost the limb at Lake Pier in Hamworthy, Dorset on Saturday, when he jumped into the water to cool off during Saturday's hot weather. But Mr Wright, who had his leg amputated in 2009, was pulled down by the strong currents and lost the prosthetic limb. He then had to be dragged ashore by passers-by. Roy Wright, 45, from Addlestone, Surrey, lost his £8,000 prosthetic limb when he dived into Lake Pier, Dorset to cool off from the hot weather . Within hours, news of the incident had spread across social network sites, reaching amateur divers all over the country who offered to take part in the search. The leg - which Mr Wright customised with England football motifs - has still not been found. But divers have returned to the site and have promised to continue the search - and Mr Wright has been amazed at the kindness shown by virtual strangers. He said: 'They've even spoken to someone with a cockleboat who is going to drag the seabed with a net to find it. Divers have returned to the water to try and find the missing prosthetic, after news of the incident spread around social network sites . Mr Wright said he was overwhelmed by the number of people who had helped in the search. A cockleboat is due to drag the seabed with a net in a bid to find the prosthetic . 'I'm . amazed - absolutely amazed - and that's without all the people on the . day who stripped off and searched the water, and all the kids with . sticks probing the bottom to see if they could find it. 'People are giving up time after work and in the evenings to try and help find it. 'It brought a tear to my eye - I felt very humbled. It has restored my faith in human nature 100 per cent.' Mr Wright also described how he was caught out as he went for a swim. Mr Wright had to be rescued by passers-by after he got into trouble in strong currents while going for a swim . He said: 'I have always said to . kids: ""Don't jump off piers because you don't know what is under the . water"". The water looked really inviting and I just thought I would dive . in one more time. Mr Wright decorated the lost prosthetic, pictured here, with an England football team badge . I lost my leg and nearly drowned - . it was a case of not practising what I preached. The water got into my . leg and pulled it off and there was no way of me getting hold of it. 'The . water looked calm but I had to fight hard against the current. I was . really scared and felt really foolish. When I got back to the beach I . just burst into tears, I was really shaken. Mr Wright had his leg amputated in 2009, . after 16 years of battling a leg injury that was caused by a 36-tonne crane . running over his leg. After the crane incident, Mr Wright had operations for 11 years to repair the limb. But just after the final operation in 2009, a supermarket floor collapsed below him, causing him to break his leg again. He tjem developed gangrene and his leg had to be amputated below the knee one month later. Mr Wright also thanked the passer-by who jumped in fully-clothed to pull him to safety after he himself dived off the end of pier. The father-of-three, who is setting up a charity to give amputees holidays, is now struggling on using a painfully ill-fitting spare limb. He added: 'I'm used to being a very active person. 'There is so much I need to do for the charity and this is holding everything up.'","Roy Wright, 45, from Addlestone, Surrey, lost prosthetic in strong currents .

Competitors - who are 'awarded more points for maintaining immaculate trouser creases than crossing the finish line' - take part in events such as umbrella jousting, the 'Tug-'o-Hair' event, the pipeathlon and iron board surfing, while donning stylish bowler hats, monocles and strings of pearls. The pipeathlon event involved running several . laps around the venue carrying a fully-lit pipe, while umbrella . jousting saw competitors fighting off each other while seated in Boris Bikes. The event is the creation of The Chap magazine, a bi-monthly publication edited by Gustav Temple, which glorifies a dandyish . way of life involving tweed, pipe smoking and fine facial hair. Gentlemen were seen kitted out in their finest pinstripe suits and boating hats, while women donned head feathers, A-line dresses and their brightest red lipstick to enjoy the occasion.

"By . Katy Winter . Choosing your wedding dress is probably the biggest style decision a woman will ever make and as wedding season begins once again, brides-to-be should heed the warning of celebrities who have got their outfit oh so wrong on their big day.

"By . Steph Cockroft . The Kinks frontman Ray Davies is mourning the death of two of his sisters in the space of just three weeks. The news of the death of his sister Rosie - who was the subject of one of the band's hits - was posted on the 70-year-old singer's official Facebook page. It comes just weeks after the singer missed his induction into the . Songwriters Hall of Fame in New York after the death of his sister Joyce. Kinks frontman Ray Davies, 70, has lost a second sister in the space of three weeks after the death of his sibling Rosie . On the Facebook post it said: 'Ray has sadly just lost his sister Rosie yesterday. Our thoughts are with him and his family.' Ray's sister Rosie was the subject of the band's 1996 hit 'Rosie won't you please come home'. It is about her moving to Australia with her husband. Ray - who is the second to youngest of eight siblings - once said in an interview that he also called Rosie 'Mum' until he was aged five. According to the Express, a friend who saw him near his home in Highgate, north London, said: 'Ray looked very frail and weak. He is clearly devastated by these tragedies so close together.' After the death of his sister Joyce last month, Ray gave an acceptance speech via videolink at the induction saying: 'I am profoundly honoured and disappointed not to have been at the event but I felt it necessary to be with my family at this sad time of my sister’s funeral.' Ray also lost his oldest sister Irene, or 'Rene', on his 13th birthday. She died of a heart attack just hours after giving him a life-changing birthday present – his first electric guitar. The news about Rosie's death was posted on Ray Davies' official Facebook page . The Kinks was formed in Muswell Hill, north London, by Ray and his brother Dave Davies in 1963. Their first . major hit, You Really Got Me, came along only a year later. The band went on to become one of the most . influential rock groups of a generation and influenced countless other . British bands, including Oasis and Blur. They went on to write and record dozens of hits, most famously Lola and Waterloo Sunset. In 1990, the four original members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band separated in 1996, due to the creative tension between Ray and Dave and their declining commercial success. During their decades as a band, the two . brothers were known for their bickering and dust-ups, reportedly . including fights on stage. In recent months, there was speculation the band could reform and just last month Ray revealed the band may record and tour together once again. Although Dave rubbished reports of a reunion only a few years ago, Ray claims he has spoken to his brother recently about a possible reunion and said he wants to write music with him again.","The news was posted on the 70-year-old singer's official Facebook page .

"By . Becky Barrow . Around three million parents still have their grown-up children living with them at home, a report revealed yesterday. The survey shows the average age of the children, dubbed ‘failed fledglings’, is 27 – although some are in their forties. It highlights the nightmare facing a generation of young adults, who cannot afford to rent a place of their own or buy property. About three million parents over the age of 50 have adult children living with them, a survey has found . But the report from Saga, the old age experts, also raised fears about the pressure on millions of parents who never thought their children would still be living at home. Many complain they are having to raid their savings due to the unexpected expense of paying for their children when they assumed they would be financially independent. And more than half of the failed fledglings had briefly moved out at one point before deciding to return to their childhood home. Typically, they came back after graduating from university, splitting up with a partner or when they need to save for a deposit. The report was based on a poll of nearly 10,500 parents over the age of 50. It found the number of ‘failed fledglings’ is highest in London, where 19 per cent still have grown-up children living at home. The pressure on grown-up children, who cannot afford to buy, is made worse by the fact that the cost of renting is close to a record high . However this dropped to 12 per cent in the South West and East Midlands – the lowest regional scores. The survey comes as the average asking price in the capital has gone over £500,000 for the first time. With an average full-time salary of around £26,500, this means only the rich and the very well-paid can afford to buy in the capital, unless they are given money by their parents. The pressure on the grown-up children, many of whom are desperate not to live with their parents, is made worse by the fact that the cost of renting is close to a record high. The average rent in England and Wales has jumped to £736 a month – a rise of 3.9 per cent over the last year. But workers have seen average pay rises of just 0.8 per cent. Roger Ramsden, chief executive of Saga Services, the financial services division of Saga, said: ‘With so many children choosing to stay at home longer, it just proves that a parent’s work is never quite done. 'They will foot the bill for far longer than they originally expected to.’ Official figures show the number of grown-up children living at home, who are also known as the ‘boomerang generation’, has jumped by 20 per cent since 1997. The Office for National Statistics estimates 1.8million men and 1.1million women between the age of 20 and 34 are living with their parents. It singled out the increase in property prices as one of the main reasons why more and more children are moving back home. The Department for Business has published a 16-page booklet, called the Parent Motivators. The guide is aimed at helping parents with graduates living at home. It includes tips about how to get rid of children who you would prefer to have moved out. It says being ‘too supportive’ is a mistake. ‘Sometimes, it really is necessary to show tough love. If you are making life too comfortable at home, why would they get a job? The grown-up children return home after graduating from university, splitting up with a partner or when they needed to save for a deposit . ‘If you are providing free board and lodgings, a well-stocked fridge, washing and ironing done, plus an allowance, there’s not much drive there. So cut back to help increase their motivation.’ Duncan Stott, from the first-time buyer campaign group Priced Out, said: ‘Living with your parents is an obvious way to avoid sky-high rents, but it is a big sacrifice in terms of independently getting on with your adult life. ‘We would not be forced into making these decisions if the UK’s housing market was not still so severely unaffordable.’ London . 19 per cent of parents over 50 have grown-up children at home .

"By . Taylor Lorenz . It is billed as the future of food - a drink that can replace every meal, providing the body with everything it needs to suruve without ever having to cook. Called Soylent, it became a huge online hit when it was launched last year and thousands ordered it. Now MailOnline has been able to try one of the first batches of the drink to be sold. Scroll down for video . MailOnline's Taylor Lorenz mixing up her first batch of Soylent. The drink is designed to replace meals . Soylent is a futuristic meal replacement formula developed by a group of engineers bent on revolutionizing the way we fuel our bodies. The powdery mixture contains no fruits, vegetables or dairy products, yet claims to fulfill all of the human body's dietary needs. It contains 35 nutrients needed for survival. Robert Rhinehart, the 25-year-old co-founder and chief executive of the company selling the food substitute developed the mixture in 2012 while working for a start-up. He found the process of purchasing, preparing, and consuming food too time consuming and expensive, and hypothesized that ‘the body doesn't need food itself, merely the chemicals and elements it contains.’ Rhinehart took a hiatus from experimenting with software, and began experimenting with meal replacement. He studied health and nutrition books, poured over data from the F.D.A. and U.S.D.A , and eventually came up with a list of 35 nutrients needed for survival. He ordered the necessary components off the internet, sloshed them into a blender, and began living off of it. After 30 days straight consuming nothing but the substance he felt better than he had in his entire life. His food costs also plummeted from over $500 a month, to $154.82. His roommates saw the dramatic effect Soylent had on Rhinehart’s life and health and decided to set up a crowdfunding campaign to sell the concoction to the public. ‘Hunger comes from chemicals triggered by a lack of nutrients as well as mechano-sensors in the stomach.' Soylent is a brown, thick liquid once mixed with water . 'If there's something in your stomach and all your nutritional needs are met you won't feel hungry’ Rhinehart explains on his blog. ‘I feel full after drinking a single glass of Soylent and while the smell of Mexican food from the street used to drive me crazy, now I am unaffected.' 'It's like finding a new partner you really care about.' 'When all your needs are met, you don't have a desire to stray.’ Rhinehart claims that while living off Soylent his physique improved, his skin was clearer, his teeth whiter, and his hair thicker. 'I felt like I'd just had the best breakfast of my life’ he wrote after sampling his first Soylent meal, ‘it tasted like a sweet, succulent, hearty meal in a glass.’ Taylor's first taste: She says Soylent is neither sweet nor savory - and a 'nothing food' Mail Online decided to put the product to the test and see if this food substitute really holds water. The first thing you’re confronted with when you slice open a box of Soylent is a manifesto. ‘The powder you now behold is more than meets the eye’ the pamphlet professes, ‘this mix of mass, energy, and information is the staple food of the future. Refined, robust and efficient, Soylent is food that works.’ Below this inspirational card are large pre-packaged 2,000 calorie bags of Soylent mix tucked between tubes of oil- the only ingredients needed (plus water) to produce an entire meal. I removed a single packet and laid it on the counter with the oil and a Soylent-branded measuring cup. I decided to make two servings, lunch and dinner, in one fell swoop. Normally, preparing two separate meals requires multiple ingredients, conflicting preparation methods and a lot of time. The thought of preparing both lunch and dinner in a single easy mix appealed to me already. I scooped the allocated amount of powder into my mixing jar, added the water and oil, and proceeded to stir. Soylent instructions offer three methods of preparation: stirring, blending and shaking. After 8-10 minutes of stirring I wished I had a blender. Soylent instructions offer three methods of preparation: stirring, blending and shaking. It’s difficult to get the Soylent powder to fully blend, and I noticed small pockets of dry mixture clumping together like half-done pancake batter. I shook the container vigorously until the Soylent was as smooth as a chocolate frosty. Soylent is best served cold, and I briefly considered refrigerating the drink before sampling my first sip. Some people blend it with ice, but using chilled water seemed to adequately cool the mixture. I poured my first portion into a thermos. The Soylent smell hit my nostrils before my taste buds. The beverage smells sterile, but not unappealing, and reminded me of the type of Slim Fast shakes my mother used to drink in the 90s. It sort of tasted that way too, but less chocolaty. I assumed, probably because of the color, that the drink would be sweet. In fact, it’s neither sweet nor savory. Soylent doesn’t really have a distinct flavor. It truly is a ‘non food’ in this respect. The allocated amount of powder into my mixing jar,then water and oil is added. It lives up to its utilitarian beginnings, it’s not burdened with food-like artificial flavors or sweeteners. I can see why some suggest blending Soylent with peanut butter, almond milk, or banana. It’s remarkably tasteless. The texture of the drink is equally benign. It’s slightly mealy (though this could be due to how I prepared it). It isn’t so thick that it’s hard to swallow, but it’s also not smooth enough to chug. My liquid lunch companion compared it to mealy Muscle Milk. The after-taste was as strong as the taste, but not overwhelming. I was left with a cardboard nutty flavor in the back of my throat. It tasted like I had swallowed something milky, but there was no film or residue clinging to my tongue. After consuming 80% of the bottle my hunger was gone and I felt content on a baseline level. I wasn’t craving more food, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I had missed a meal. In fact, I ended up snacking on some quinoa a few hours later and the action of chewing alone left me feeling more satisfied. But overall, I’m not sold.

"By . Steph Cockroft . Christine Walker went to Cheltenham General Hospital with a . bruised elbow but died after contracting norovirus . An elderly woman who was admitted to hospital with a bruised elbow died after doctors failed to check on her for three days, an inquest has heard. Christine Walker, 86, from Silverton, Devon, was treated for minor bruising at Cheltenham General Hospital in March last year after a fall while staying at her son's house in Gloucestershire. Despite having just minor bruising from the fall, Mrs Walker was kept in the hospital under observation. But when she was moved to a different ward the next day, the pensioner was not seen by a doctor for another three days. By that time, Mrs Walker had contracted norovirus - from which she died two weeks later. Speaking after the inquest into her death, the family said Mrs Walker had been well before the hospital admission and had been 'up and down the stairs' just days earlier. In a statement the family said: 'Mr Walker and his family are still . coming to terms with the fact that his mother was admitted to hospital . with a bruised elbow and went on to die.' At an inquest into her death at Gloucestershire Coroner's Court, the hearing heard how the mother-of-two had been kept in hospital under observation because of her age and frail health. Doctors, who saw Mrs Walker on March 17, were concerned that she might have suffered an unforeseen injury during the fall. The next day, the patient was moved into a private room on the Kemerton Ward - which her family claim was dirty and understaffed - but was not looked at by doctors. By the time she was checked on March 21, Mrs Walker was vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea. She died on April 10 from norovirus, pneumonia and haematuria, which is when there is blood in the urine. During the hearing, a consultant physician at Cheltenham General Hospital admitted that no senior doctor had been assigned to look after Mrs Walker. She said: 'That did not happen and I do not know why that did not happen.' Mrs Walker's son Nicholas, with whom she had been staying at the time, said he was told by a . nurse that she was the only person on shift during one particular . morning - an allegation the hospital denies. The inquest heard there were 'staffing pressures' on the ward which . 'could have been an explanation' for why Mrs Walker was not checked for . three days by medical staff - in which time she contracted the virus . The hearing heard the Kemerton Ward is meant to have at least two nurses and two health care assistants on duty at all times. Nurse Jonathan Burford said: 'There was a mixture of ward staff, agency staff and bank staff [cover] on the ward. It was a challenge to meet minimum staffing levels at times.' When coroner Katy Skerrett asked whether that could be 'an explanation for why Mrs Walker was not looked in on for those three days', the nurse replied 'yes'. Lawyer Jamie Gamble, who was representing Mr Walker, told the inquest it was 'highly likely' that Mrs Walker caught the virus on the ward. 'Mr Walker and his family are still . coming to terms with the fact that his mother was admitted to hospital . with a bruised elbow and went on to die' Walker family statement . He said: 'The family made a complaint about the room Mrs Walker was in being dirty. 'The complaint was that there was an incontinence sheet in the room from the patient before.' Sister Sue Harris, the nurse in charge of the hospital at night, apologised to the Walker family and admitted the room was untidy - but not dirty. She said: 'The family were not happy about the nursing care on the ward. I apologised. 'I was unhappy that they had experienced that on the ward as we have a high standard of nursing care. I was upset. The private room was untidy. I would not say dirty.' Recording a narrative verdict, Gloucestershire coroner Katy Skerrett said: 'This woman was admitted to hospital having suffered a fall. She was frail due to her age and various other health issues. 'She was not seen by the medic team for three days, during which she had norovirus. The delay seems to be after she contracted the virus. 'There were staffing pressures at the hospital and there was a medley of Trust, agency and bank staff working in what was a temporary winter ward. 'After a discussion with the family she was placed on the LCP. She died on April 10. I offer my sincere condolences to her family.' Speaking after the inquest, Mr Walker, who has moved from Cheltenham to Devon since her death, said: 'She was not a frail woman. She was up and down the stairs, eating three meals a day.' His partner Sue Taylor added: 'She had a wicked sense of humour. She certainly was not frail.' A statement read on behalf of the Walker family's solicitor Oliver Thorne read: 'Today’s inquest has highlighted a number of failings on the part of Gloucestershire NHS Foundation Trust. 'These include ward cleanliness, communication and staffing pressures. The main one is how Mrs Walker went for three days without being seen. 'Mr Walker and his family are still coming to terms with the fact that his mother was admitted to hospital with a bruised elbow and went on to die.' The Walker family said it is now considering taking legal action against the trust.","Christine Walker was kept in Cheltenham General Hospital for observation .

"By . Steph Cockroft . This shocking photo shows the mangled remains of a car which a mother-of-two ploughed into a motorcyclist while high on drink and drugs, killing herself and two others. Nightclub worker Teresa Mitchell, 38, from Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, caused 'utter devastation' when she drove while twice over the . legal drink-drive limit and after having taken a cocktail of amphetamines. Mitchell lost control of her BMW and ploughed into 47-year-old motorcyclist Alan Dexter, who was on his way to work at a local homeless charity, while driving at 80mph in a 40mph zone near Mansfield on December 20 last year. This picture shows the destroyed remains of a BMW car which was crashed . by Teresa Mitchell, 38, while she was high on drink and drugs. The crash, which took place in Mansfield, Notts, . killed the driver and two others . Ms Mitchell and Mr . Dexter, a night support worker also from Mansfield, were killed instantly in the smash. Ricky Lee Goodall, 24, from Skegby, a passenger in the BMW, was also killed. During the inquest into the three deaths at Nottingham Coroner's Court, it emerged Ms Mitchell also collided with a Ford Ranger pickup travelling behind Mr Dexter, leaving the 29-year-old driver with serious, life-changing injuries. The court also heard Ms Mitchell had been travelling more than 80 mph in a 40 mph zone before spinning out of control, while Mr Goodall had not been wearing a seatbelt. After the inquest, police released a photo of the destroyed car, while Mr Dexter's family spoke out to warn others of the consequences of drink-driving. His son, Jonathan, said: 'I have lost my father, a good man, as a result of this crash. 'It . is totally unacceptable to be drinking alcohol and then driving. Please . don’t do it, don’t leave another family in this situation.' Teresa Mitchell from Mansfield, pictured left, was driving at 80mph when the car she was driving swerved across the road and ploughed into 47-year-old Alan Dexter, also from Mansfield . Mr Dexter’s wife, Alison, said: 'He was a devoted, caring, hard-working father and husband and loyal friend.' Ricky Goodall, 24, who was a passenger in the BMW, was also killed in the crash. He was not wearing a seatbelt . Coroner Mairin Casey ruled that Ms Mitchell and Mr Goodall died in the collision while Mr Dexter was unlawfully killed. She said: 'I find that from the time Ms Mitchell sat behind the wheel of the car intending to drive, she was engaging in a dangerous act without any regard to safety. 'Any objective reasonable, responsible and sober person would inevitably realise that her act of driving was likely to cause serious harm or death.' Detective Sergeant James Greely said after the inquest: 'I’ve worked in crash investigation for eight years and this is one of the worst crash scenes I have ever witnessed. 'It was utter devastation - caused by the dangerous and illegal driving of Ms Mitchell, in what were bad weather conditions. 'Had drink and drug driving, speeding and not wearing a seatbelt not been involved - the outcome could have been very different. 'I can’t say it clearly enough - do not take drugs, do not drink alcohol if you are planning to drive and always wear your seatbelt. It could save your life and save you from the devastation that is being faced daily by the families of those involved in this crash.' Two other people in Mitchell’s car were injured in the crash, but survived following hospital treatment.","Teresa Mitchell, 38, drove her BMW while twice over legal drink-drive limit .

"By . Taylor Lorenz . New York’s first and only Cat Cafe opened its doors to human visitors on Thursday, sparking lines around a block in Downtown Manhattan. The Cat Cafe, a pop-up operated by Purina One, will remain open for four days and during that time patrons will have the opportunity to canoodle with 16 furry rescue cats, all of whom are available for adoption. The North Shore Animal League partnered with Purina One to supply the cats from its center in Port Washington, New York. Purrrfect combination: A visitor to New York's first ever cat cafe bonds with a furry friend . Paw-some host: One of the cats takes up residence on a table in the children's corner . All are available for adoption, and each is introduced by way of a portrait wall directly beyond the coffee counter. By mid-afternoon on day one, six of the 16 cats had been adopted by willing visitors. The cafe itself is located in a temporary space that has been completely transformed into a . cat-friendly environment. Rug covered perches line the sunny windows and . the floor is littered with toys for the felines to play with. The cats . themselves are free to roam while customers can sip complimentary . ‘cat'achino’ coffees practically made for Instagram. Poser: One cat was practically preening as a crowd of adoring visitors snapped away with their iPhones . Smitten with a kitten: A visitor and his two-year-old son give one of the felines a cuddle . Feline like a hug: Visitors couldn't help but grin as they got up close and personal with the animals . A carer on hand at the cafe told . MailOnline: ‘All these cats are used to being together and they have . been verified by our carers as being friendly, agreeable pets.’ But pet adoption isn't The Cat Cafe's sole goal. Throughout its four day operation, Purina One and The North Shore Animal League hope to kick-start a dialogue about cat health and wellbeing. ‘We’re trying to foster a conversation around cat health, and the best conversations happen among friends over a cup of coffee,’ Nicky Roberts from the Purina One brand team explained, ‘Cat people want to be among cats, so it made sense to bring the two together.' Playtime! One of the felines is fascinated by a toy dangled by a visitor at the Cat Cafe . How much is that kitty in the window?

Carrie Ann Inaba, a judge on ABC’s Dancing With The Stars and a champion for cats through her rescue organization, spoke at an event this morning, and other experts and vets will be holding panels throughout next four days on everything from cat-friendly interior design to introducing a new cat to your family. ‘We’d seen coverage of cat cafes in . Europe and Asia, and they seemed to be really popular,’ Roberts told . MailOnline, ‘We heard there were some starting up here in the States, . but none had actually opened yet. So we figured, why don’t we? If you . want to have a conversation around cat health, what else would you do . but open a cat cafe?’ Cat got your tongue? Visitors were offered 'cat'achinos' in the cafe, complete with feline faces in the foam . Cat'achino, anyone? Even the coffee offering had a feline theme at the Purina One cafe . Is this fur real? Cat lovers lined the corner of Bowery and Kenmare Street in Downtown Manhattan on Thursday afternoon for a chance to visit the Cat Cafe . Visitors are welcome to hold the animals, pet them and take photos with friends. And the felines seemed to enjoy the experience too. One was practically preening as a crowd of adoring cat-lovers snapped away with their iPhones. ‘We wanted to make the cat cafe cat health personified, with the picture of cat health, running around,’ Roberts told MailOnline. ‘When you think of cat health, it sounds so clinical.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap  Reporter . A former Halliburton manager who destroyed evidence in the aftermath of BP's record 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has been sentenced to just 12 months probation for his crime. Anthony Badalamenti, of Katy, Texas, had faced a maximum of one year in prison at his sentencing on Tuesday, after pleading guilty to one misdemeanor count of destruction of evidence in October. However U.S. District Judge Jay Zainey said the 62-year-old had 'learned from his mistake' and was 'an honorable man' when he gave Badalamenti the probabation time plus 100 hours of community, and ordered that he pay a $1,000 fine. Badalamenti was the cementing technology director for Halliburton Energy Services Inc., BP's cement contractor on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig. Anthony Badalamenti leaves Federal Court in New Orleans, Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2014. The former Halliburton manager was sentenced to one year of probation for destroying evidence in the aftermath of BP's massive 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .

Anthony Badalamentii (right) leaves Federal Court in New Orleans, Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2014. The former Halliburton manager was sentenced Tuesday to one year of probation for destroying evidence in the aftermath of BP's massive 2010 oil spill . Prosecutors said he instructed two Halliburton employees to delete data during a post-spill review of the cement job on BP's blown-out Macondo well. The data was from separate runs of computer simulations on centralizers, which are used to keep the casing centered in the wellbore. It could have supported BP's decision to use six centralizers instead . of 21 on the Macondo project, but prosecutors said the number of . centralizers had little effect on the outcome of the simulations. Halliburton notified the Justice Department about the deletion of the data, which couldn't be recovered. The judge said that Badalamenti's sentence of probation was 'very reasonable in this case'.

Some 8000 animals were reported dead in the six months that followed the spill . 'I still feel that you're a very honorable man,' he told Badalamenti. 'I have no doubt that you've learned from this mistake.' Badalamenti apologized to his family and friends for causing them 'undue stress'. 'I am truly sorry for what I did,' he said. Halliburton cut its own deal with the Justice Department and pleaded guilty in September to a misdemeanor charge related to Badalamenti's conduct. The company agreed to pay a $200,000 fine and make a $55 million contribution to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, but the latter payment wasn't a condition of the deal. Tai Park, one of Badalamenti's lawyers, said in October that guidelines calculated by prosecutors call for Badalamenti to receive a sentence ranging from probation to six months in prison. Zainey, however, isn't bound by the sentencing guidelines. Four current or former BP employees also have been charged in federal court with spill-related crimes. On December 18, a jury convicted former BP drilling engineer Kurt Mix of trying to obstruct a federal probe of the spill. Prosecutors said Mix was trying to destroy evidence when he deleted a string of text messages to and from a BP supervisor. Mix faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. His sentencing is set for March 26. BP well site leaders Robert Kaluza and Donald Vidrine pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges stemming from the deaths of 11 workers on the Deepwater Horizon. Prosecutors claim Kaluza and Vidrine botched a key safety test and disregarded abnormally high pressure readings that were glaring signs of trouble before the April 2010 blowout of BP's Macondo well triggered a deadly explosion. Former BP executive David Rainey was charged with concealing information from Congress about the amount of oil that was gushing from BP's well before the company sealed it.","Anthony Badalamenti, 62, of Katy, Texas, was the cementing technology for Haliburton Energy Services Inc. - BP's cement contractor - at the time of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010 .

"By . Ap  Reporter . The attorney for a couple accused of abandoning the adopted nine-year-old son they raised since infancy said on Wednesday that the boy has gotten some much-needed help. Anthony VanNoy, attorney for Cleveland and Lisa Cox, said after a brief pretrial hearing that the couple are visiting with the boy and hope to be reunited with him. The Coxes have pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor charges of nonsupport of dependents, and VanNoy said they won't accept a plea deal. Lisa Cox, 52, and her husband Cleveland, 49, of Liberty Township, arrive for a hearing at Butler County Common Pleas Court at the Government Services Center in Hamilton, Ohio, on Wednesday . The trial is scheduled for Feb. 10. The charges allege the couple recklessly abandoned or failed to provide adequate support for the boy. Authorities say the pair, from Butler County's Liberty Township, left the boy with children's services after saying he was displaying aggressive behavior and earlier threatened the family with a knife. ‘The whole goal of the context of children services has always been to get help for the child,’ VanNoy said Wednesday. He says the Coxes have received many letters of support. ‘The blessing is that there has been an awareness of people that there are families that are struggling and they need help,’ VanNoy said. Well-to-do: The couple live in this lovely neighborhood where the median income is around $100,000. They had raised their son since he was three months old . Butler County Prosecutor Michael Gmoser wouldn't comment on specifics of the case on Wednesday but said he was encouraged by VanNoy's remarks. ‘One always hopes in a long process such as this that there is a silver lining,’ Gmoser said. Documents filed by the prosecutor say the parents didn't tell the boy when they left him with children's services that he wouldn't be returning home. The Coxes could each face up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine if convicted of the single count against each of them. Adolfo Olivas, an attorney appointed by the court to protect the boy's interests, has said the emotionally hurt and confused child is now receiving help that the parents should have gotten for him. Not a money problem: The Coxes live in this home valued at more than $330,000 home in Liberty Township . Threatening? Neighbors said the Coxes are good parents and people. One of them described the 9-year-old adopted boy as a 'bad seed.' The couple claims the boy has threatened them with a knife . A defence attorney and prosecutor declined to comment after the hearing. The couple was scheduled to be in juvenile court later overnight for a pretrial hearing regarding custody of the child. People within the adoption community say they worry about emotional trauma to the child. They say giving up a child after so much time is rare and undermines the stability and commitment that adopted children need. The median annual income in the region where the parents live is more than $100,000, and the median home value is more than $280,000, according to census data.","Cleveland and Lisa Cox of Liberty Township, Ohio were charged last November with misdemeanor counts of nonsupport .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap  Reporter . Jerry Sandusky's adopted son has spoken about his life with the serial child molester and prominent Penn State football coach in a new documentary. Matt Sandusky speaks about his ordeal and emotional decision to testify against his own father in Happy Valley, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on Sunday. The 34-year-old describes how he was plucked from a deprived upbringing and brought into the affluent Sandusky family, who were local celebrities. He says: 'His name was a golden ticket. It was good to be next to him, to feel powerful, to feel that people envied me instead of looking down on me.' Speaking out: Matt Sandusky says in the documentary Happy Valley that he has been 'betrayed' by the Sandusky family after he testified against his adoptive father . 'If people thought of [head coach] Joe Paterno as god, Jerry was like Jesus. They were to me the two most powerful people. They could do whatever they wanted, they could do no wrong. according to the LA Times. He also says that he feels 'betrayed' by the entire Sandusky family after he took the decision to testify against his father. But he maintains that he refused to be a 'coward' and risked everything to turn against those who had brought him up. Matt says he took part in the documentary 'to empower other survivors' and that he hopes to one day become an . advocate for such victims. The 100-minute film, which premiered on Sunday at the annual Salt Lake City movie jamboree, explores whether it was an open secret that Sandusky - who was convicted of 45 of 48 sexual abuse charges - was molesting boys over the course of his career. Matt revealed he had suffered seven years of molestation at the hands of his adoptive father - between the ages of eight and 15 - in 2012 after years of denying any abuse, including to a grand jury. He said the decision to share his story on film was not an easy one. 'For . me and all survivors it is important to have control over the timing . and setting of (the) disclosure,' Matt Sandusky told The Centre Daily Times. 'My role in the film was to share the perspective of a survivor, to give survivors a voice.' 'There were many victims in this case . who came forward for the trial — I have immense respect for their . strength — and because of those guys, I had the courage to come forward . to the authorities to tell what I had to tell — the truth.' Scroll down for video . Matt Sandusky attends the Happy Valley premiere at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2014 in Park City, Utah. Sandusky chose the film as the forum for his first public comments of the abuse he endured at the hands of adoptive father and former Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky . Ex-Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky was convicted of 45 of the 48 child sexual abuse laid against him involving 10 boys. A police confession by his son Matt Sandusky was a major turning point in the case . Matt Sandusky, the adopted son of former Penn State University assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, leaves the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, Pa., during his fathers trial on June 20, 2012 . 'I hope that people will begin to understand what I have gone through.' Matt Sandusky declined to elaborate on his comments in the film, but he said he discusses his childhood, the abuse and his relationship with family. He is one of six children adopted by Jerry and Dottie Sandusky. He petitioned last year to legally change his name, and that of his wife and four children. Matt's story first became when a secret tape of a 29-minute interview he did with police during the middle of his father's trial was leaked to NBC. In the tape Matt said his father would enter his bedroom at night and 'blow raspberries' on his stomach, then move his hand down his body, rubbing up against his genitals. Matt Sandusky said he would sometimes cower 'in a fetal position' in his bed trying to avoid his father. Matt met Jerry Sandusky through the Second Mile program and would often stay at his home Pennsylvania home (pictured). Matt was taken in as a foster child and eventually adopted by the family . 'It just was, just became very uncomfortable. You know, just with everything that was going on,' he said on the tape. 'What was, what was going on?' a police detective asked. 'With like the showering, with the hugging, with the rubbing, with the just talking to me. The way he spoke. And just, the whole interaction with him alone. Anything, anytime we were alone just those interactions ...' Matt replied. Unlike many of the victims who testified at Sandusky’s trial, Matt Sandusky said he could not remember if his father ever engaged in any oral or penetrative sex acts with him. 'You said at the beginning of our interview last night that things happened to you, but there was no, that you can recall, there was no penetration or oral sex. Is that correct?' the police detective asked. 'Yes. As of this time, I don’t recall that.' Sandusky had been listed as a defense witness at his father's 2012 trial, but he instead disclosed through lawyers that he had also been abused and didn't take the stand. He said that finally telling his story was about 'righting wrongs', with his confession bringing much more integrity to the testimonies of the child victims. Allegations of molestation against Jerry Sandusky first surfaced in 2011, with a total of 10 boys coming forward with stories of sexual abuse. Sandusky maintains he is innocent . It is also allowed the supporters and family members who had backed Sandusky throughout the case a different perspective. Jerry Sandusky, convicted on 45 counts involving 10 boys, maintains his innocence and is appealing his conviction. He is serving a 30- to 60-year prison term. An online synopsis of Happy Valley, made by The Tillman Story director Amir Bar-Lev, describes the film as a 'complicated and tragic tale'. Matt Sandusky watched the film in a recent private screening. The film’s producer, Ken Dornstein, said in a Los Angeles Times review published Friday that Matt Sandusky was the last person interviewed for the documentary. 'We knew his story could stand in for a lot of the victims’ stories, and we waited for Matt,' the producer said. Jerry Sandusky is led in handcuffs by Centre County Sheriff Denny Nau after being found guilty at the Centre County Courthouse on June 22, 2012 . 'We held the film for him.' The Salt Lake Tribune said it 'leaves the stomach in knots for the entirety of the 100-minute film'. The Times’ film critic called the film 'thorough' and 'thoughtful'. Matt Sandusky said he now hopes to start a nonprofit in the State College area to advocate for child sex-abuse victims. 'It is something I am determined to do,' he said. 'My ultimate hope is to empower other survivors.'

"By . Ap  Reporter . We eat there, we buy our clothes there, and some people suspect teenagers may actually live there. So perhaps it was just a matter of time until funeral homes began popping up in shopping malls. Over the past two years, Forest Lawn has been quietly putting movable kiosks in several of the malls that dot Southern California's suburbs. The move, by one of the funeral industry's best-known operators, expands on a marketing innovation that appears to have begun at the dawn of the decade, when a company called Til We Meet Again began opening casket stores around the country. 'We try to reach our audience where they are at, and the mall is a great way to do that,' said Ben Sussman, spokesman for Forest Lawn, whose cemeteries count among their permanent residents such notables as Walt Disney, Elizabeth Taylor and Michael Jackson. Impulse purchase: Mark Sanchez and his wife Lea' Anne look at a Dodger's theme cremation urn at the Forest Lawn stand at the Glendale Galleria mall in Glendale, California . Funeral homes such as Forest Lawn have started opening kiosk-style outlets in California malls on the belief that more people would plan ahead their funeral if they stumbled across the service, rather than had to go into a funeral home . Forest Lawn planner Henry Best mans a kiosk store at Glendale Galleria mall California . 'And it's also, perhaps, a way to reach people who might be a little leery about coming directly into one of our parks,' Sussman added. As to why folks would be leery about that, industry officials acknowledge the answer is obvious: Who really wants to enter a funeral home even one day before they have to? 'Funeral planning is something everybody knows they must do, but at the same time it's something nobody wants to do,' said Robert Fells, executive director of the International Cemetery, Cremation and Funeral Association. 'Nobody gets up on a Saturday morning and says, ''Gee, it's a nice day. I wonder if I can go out and get myself a burial plot'',' Fells said. But if they're strolling past a funeral outlet at the mall, where they're surrounded by happy, lively people and maybe clutching a bag of Mrs. Field's cookies, the thought is that they'll feel differently. 'When they're going to the mall, people are not going out of need,' said Nathan Smith, co-founder and CEO of Til We Meet Again, which has outlets in malls in Arizona, Louisiana, Kansas, Indiana and Texas. So if they do happen to see a place peddling coffins or urns while they're pricing T-shirts and hoodies, Smith said, it will look far less intimidating. Forest Lawn's effort began modestly, with just one kiosk (one of those movable things that usually sell stuff like calendars or ties) in a mall in the Los Angeles suburb of Eagle Rock. When no one was creeped out, the program expanded to about a half-dozen malls. Forest Lawn regional sales manager Hilda Carabes (left) shows Mark Sanchez and his wife the Forest Lawn stand at the Glendale Galleria mall on January 30, 2014 . Forest Lawn, famous as the final resting place for everyone from Al Jolson to Michael Jackson, has begun staffing outlets at shopping malls, reasoning that planning for death, either for a loved one or yourself, might not be quite as intimidating for some people if it takes place in a lively, happy place like a mall . Now Forest Lawn periodically shuffles them from one mall to another to reach the largest audience. Unlike the people at other such stations, who can seem like carnival barkers as they walk right up to you and hawk discount calling plans or free yogurt samples, Forest Lawn's operators are more discreet. At the entrance to a Macy's department store in the LA suburb of Arcadia last year, operators were quick to smile and hand out brochures when approached. But they kept their distance until people came to them. It was the same at a mall in Glendale last week, where people stopped to examine cremation urns ranging from one with a subdued design of leaves to another that brightly featured the logo for the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team. Also on display was a recruiting poster for potential future Forest Lawn employees, complete with a picture of the great Dodgers pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, who urged them to consider 'joining a winning team'. Still, not everyone is thrilled with the idea. 'You're in a shopping mall and you're walking along and there's a funeral place?' retired high school teacher Stan Slome said incredulously. 'That sounds too deadly.' Mark Sanchez and his wife Lea' Anne look at a cremation urn at the Forest Lawn stand at the Glendale Galleria mall in Glendale . After thinking it over, however, he acknowledged it's something that could catch on. At age 86, Slome said, he gets his share of mail from funeral operators inviting him to seminars at local restaurants, where he can have a meal on them while he hears a pitch on why he should use their services when he exits this mortal coil. He doesn't care for that either, he said, but he figures somebody is attending those seminars. If the mall effort catches on, said Jessica Koth of the National Funeral Directors Association, credit the aging Baby Boom generation at least in part. Historically, people have not wanted to talk, or even think, about their demise. But Baby Boomers, the oldest of whom are pushing 70, are different. Many are beginning to press for so-called green funerals that don't require the use of coffins or burial vaults, Koth said. Others want custom-made coffins or urns that say something about who they were. That often means something that represents a favorite car or sports team, said Smith of Til We Meet Again. He pointed out he even got a request once for a coffin built to resemble a portable toilet — from a guy whose company made portable toilets. With that mindset, could going to the mall and planning the whole deal just steps away from the Merry-Go-Round really be that unusual?","Funeral homes have begun opening kiosk-style stores in California malls in an attempt to sell more funeral plans in an 'impulse buy' fashion .
They say it lowers the barriers for people who find going into funeral homes 'creepy'
Unlike their predecessors, the Baby Boomer generation - the oldest of whom are about 70 - are more willing to discuss death and plan ahead ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporters . A . former Blue Angels commander's tenure was so bizarre and juvenile that he went so far as to encourage his team to paint genitalia large enough to be visible by Google Maps, according to a Navy report recently made public. Capt. Gregory McWherter was found to have 'witnessed, accepted, and encouraged behavior that, while . juvenile and sophomoric in the beginning, ultimately and in the . aggregate, became destructive, toxic, and hostile,' the report states. Slate reports that McWherter created an environment hostile not only towards women (there has never been a female Blue Angel) but also to the man under his command, forcing them to constantly discuss their sex lives in front of one another. A Navy report says former Blue Angels Commander Capt. Gregory McWherter 'encouraged behavior that, while juvenile and sophomoric in the beginning, ultimately and in the aggregate, became destructive, toxic, and hostile' Punished: Capt. Greg McWherter, left, ex-commanding officer of the U.S. Navy flight demonstration squadron, the Blue Angels, received a letter of reprimand for allowing sexual harassment in the workplace during his time as leader of the flying team . '[Redacted] would frequently use his phone to show pictures of his girlfriends to other officers in the Ready Room,' the report reads. 'CAPT McWherter would actively participate in these conversations, would view the pictures, and when [redacted] would go for a period without offering up the pictures, CAPT McWherter would request them out loud in front of everyone.' The report added that some of these photos included nudity and that 'joking or banter' about the women would inevitably occur once the picture was shown. In another incident shortly before Halloween 2011, an unidentified person invited his girlfriend annd two others to his house to carve pumpkins. 'Prior to arrival of [redacted] and her boyfriend, [redacted] downloaded pornographic pumpkin carving stencils, also known as 'pornkins,'' the report read. 'The couples carved two pumpkins that night, each containing a separate pornographic image. 'On a subsequent workday, [redacted] brought the pumpkins into work and placed them in the Ready Room next to Blue Angels memorabilia.' Ousted: McWherter was relieved in April from his post amid the allegations during his second stint as the Blue Angels' leader from May 2011 to November 2012 . And in perhaps the most juvenile display, under the Captain's command a blue and gold penis 'was visible from satellite imagery.' '[Redacted] brought paint with his own money and painted over the penis,' the report read. ' This blue and gold penis existed through the end of the 2012 airshow season. The penis is no longer visible on Google Maps.' This sort of behavior was par for course under McWherter, was often part of conversations including 'crass or offensive terms' such as 'she can sit on my face.' Group communication tool GroupMe was also often said to include pornographic images, 'often of male genitalia.' In June, McWherter was found guilty of violating two articles under the . military's code of justice during nonjudicial proceedings convened in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The articles were failure to obey an order or regulation and conduct unbecoming of an officer by fostering a hostile command climate and failing to stop 'obvious and repeated instances of sexual harassment, condoning widespread lewd practices within the squadron and engaging in inappropriate and unprofessional discussions with his junior officers,' the Navy said in a statement. Raunchy: The Navy said McWherer's command had explicit porn in aircraft cockpits; the painting of male genitalia on the roof of training facilities and homophobic humor on maps and itineraries . He will be given a letter of reprimand that will go in McWherter's permanent file and is widely seen as a career-ender in the service. Sophomoric: The Top Gun fighter pilot school graduate used the call sign 'Stiffy' and encouraged locked-room antics . According to the Navy's 63-page report obtained by Washington Post, newly hired pilots were hazed by being forced to wear 'foam penis' hats. Crew members also kept binoculars in the cockpits to help them spot scantily-clad women in air show crowds. The report stated McWherter, whose call sign was 'Stiffy,' encouraged a sex-obsessed environment more common in a fraternity house than a flight team. McWherter was relieved in April from his duty as executive officer of Naval Base Coronado in California amid the allegations during his second stint as the Blue Angels' leader from May 2011 to November 2012. The Navy said it did not find problems during his first stint as the flying team's commanding officer from 2008 to 2010. 'The investigation concluded that McWherter witnessed, condoned, and encouraged behavior that, while juvenile and sophomoric in the beginning, ultimately and in the aggregate, became destructive, toxic, and hostile,' the Navy said in a statement. The Navy said investigators found no evidence the behavior led to sexual assault. Harry Harris Jr., commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, ordered the investigation after a service member filed an official complaint with the Navy on March 24. The Blue Angels' mission is to publicly represent the best of Naval Aviation and Harris said 'the actions of Captain McWherter jeopardized that mission.' 'Commanding officers have an enduring obligation to maintain a proper work environment at all times and in all places and spaces; and they will be held accountable as appropriate when they fail,' Harris said. High-flying PR: The mission of the Blue Angels, seen here May 23 flying over U.S. Naval Academy graduation ceremony in Annapolis, Maryland, is to publicly represent the best of Naval Aviation . Several junior personnel who served under McWherter received formal written counseling for their behavior, but McWherter was held accountable for the actions of those in his command, the Navy said. The Blue Angels are reviewing procedures, said Vice Adm. David Buss, commander, Naval Air Force Pacific, and its new commanding officer, Thomas Frosch, started implementing measures to clean up the workplace. McWherter also was president of the Tailhook Association for about eight months before he resigned amid the probe. The San Diego-based nonprofit aviator fraternity said it knew nothing of the allegations against McWherter. The group dealt with its own scandal in 1991 when Navy pilots at its Las Vegas convention were accused of sexually abusing female officers. McWherter, a graduate of the Citadel military college in South Carolina, served in the Mediterranean, Persian Gulf and western Pacific, and was an instructor at the famed Top Gun school.","Capt Gregory McWherter, graduate of Top Gun school, was relieved of his post in April amid misconduct allegations .

The Westerly Sun reports that the . three appeared in 4th Division District Court on Friday, where they . entered their not pleas before Judge Frank J. Cenerini. This is not the first time Taylor has had trouble at the $17 million property, which she obtained in May 2013. Police have made two trespassing arrests in the past year. A 55-year-old man, Joseph Bernatche,  was said to have entered the premises to give the singer his phone number last year. According . to local police, Bernatche was charged with trespassing after handing a . security guard a note to pass along to Swift, in late July.

Outside Taylor Swift's Watch Hill mansion in Rhode Island, the entrance is guarded and tourists get a gentle reminder with her lyrics on a no trespassing sign that reads, 'I knew you were trouble when you walked in' from the singer's hit song . The sprawling home has five bedrooms and Swift stays there regularly, usually with friends . He is alleged to have trespassed in April 2013 on a similar mission. The devoted fan's attorney, Michael J. Robinson, has been adamant that Bernatche never stepped onto Swift's property. Robinson told RadarOnline: 'Mr Bernatche showed up and parked at the house next to Taylor Swift’s. He was carrying a note [with his phone number on it]' After parking his vehicle, Bernatche is then said to have handed a note to a member of Swift’s security detail. According . to Robinson, his client told the guard: 'I’m not here to trespass. I’m . just here to deliver this note. If you would kindly give this to Taylor . Swift, that’s my sole purpose for being here.' It was only minutes later that Bernatche was pulled off the road, near the star’s home, by police and booked for trespassing.

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . A man who was killed by a stranger he and his heavily-pregnant girlfriend met on Craigslist for sex was dead 'sometime' before his head was removed, authorities have revealed. Charles Oppenneer, 25, was found decapitated in Gezon Park in Wyoming, Michigan on July 16 and a medical examiner has concluded he was mutilated after his death. His head still hasn't been found. The following day, Oppenneer's eight-months-pregnant girlfriend, Brooke Slocum, 18, was found strangled to death in 31-year-old Brady Oestrike's car. Authorities believe she had been held captive at Oestrike's home for days before she was killed and stashed in his car trunk. Her unborn daughter, Audi Lynn, also died. Killed: . Brooke .

Investigators revealed last week that emails indicated Slocum had connected with their killer through a Craigslist ad and arranged a sexual encounter. The plan was for Oppenneer to meet up with Oestrike and stay present as he had sex with his heavily pregnant girlfriend. Oestrike was then to pay the couple. As the details emerged, the slain woman's father revealed that he knew about the couple's schemes and said that his daughter was desperate to do anything her boyfriend insisted so that they would stay together to bring up their child.

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . She's been rubbing shoulders with royalty and celebrities in London following 10 years of self-imposed exile. So it's no wonder Monica Lewinsky was looking tired after jetting into Los Angeles airport this morning. After making a splash at social events wearing sleek wraparound dresses, the 40-year-old opted for a casual sweater and pants as she pushed her luggage through LAX. Scroll down for video . Sight for sore eyes: Monica Lewinsky looks tired after arriving in Los Angeles following her overseas jaunt . Hiding behind oversized sunglasses, the former White House intern refused to answer questions from waiting media about the rumored presidential aspirations of her one-time nemesis, Hillary Clinton. Lewinsky has indicated she's ready to move on from her sensational affair with former US President Bill Clinton, and has seized numerous opportunities over the last month to make her mark. On June 26, Lewinksy cut a stylish figure at the Masterpiece Marie Curie party at the Royal Hospital Chelsea in London. She . mingled with stars such as Clive owen, Yasmin Le Bon and Princess . Beatrice at the event to benefit the Marie Curie Cancer Care charity, . which provides home nurses to people with terminal cancer. Sleek lines: Monika Lewinsky opted for an all-black ensemble as she jetted in to Los Angeles airport . Casual: Monica Lewinsky was dressed in a black sweater and slacks as she chatted on her phone and walked with a friend at Los Angeles airport . Days later she was spotted looking slender and stylish at celeb hot spot Little House in London's Mayfair. The club, a trendy Soho House off-shoot, is members-only which means Lewinsky would have had to be invited by one of the high-profile members. Lewinsky returned to public life back in May with a revealing article in Vanity Fair in which she opened up about her affair. 'It’s time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress,' she said, poking fun at the infamous '90s attire that she is so closely associated with. 'Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship. Any ‘abuse’ came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position. 'The Clinton administration, the special prosecutor’s minions, the political operatives on both sides of the aisle, and the media were able to brand me. And that brand stuck, in part because it was imbued with power.' Tight-lipped: Monica Lewinsky dodged questions about Hillary Clinton's rumored presidential campaign when she reached LA airport . She also revealed that her decade-long . silence has come at a cost, as she turned down offers that would've . amounted to $10 million because she 'didn't feel like the right thing to . do'. Monica Lewinsky, who was 22 when she began her affair with the president, has also shared details in a new National Geographic documentary, 'The 90s: The Last Great Decade?' As part of her return to the spotlight, Lewinky spoke about becoming 'the most humiliated woman in the world' when salacious details of her affair with then-President Bill Clinton emerged. 'That was one of the worst days of my life,' she said. 'I was a virgin to humiliation of that level, until that day... I was the most humiliated woman in the world.' Moving on: Monica Lewinsky has made a decision to stop laying low and 'It's time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress' The timing of Lewinsky's decision to return to the spotlight is interesting, as it coincides with the release of Hillary Clinton's memoir Hard Choices and as speculation as to whether she will run in 2016 ramps up. Lewinsky says that after laying low when Hillary ran for office in 2008, she's unprepared to put her life on hold for another possibly eight to 10 years. 'I turned 40 last year, and it is time . to stop tiptoeing around my past—and other people’s futures. I am . determined to have a different ending to my story.' Older and wiser: Lewinsky turned 40 last year and wants her life to move beyond the affair with Clinton . Charity gala: Monica Lewinsky and the evening's host Heather Kerzner arrive at The Masterpiece Marie Curie Party . Hillary Clinton says she has 'moved on' from the Monica Lewinsky scandal and wants everyone else to do the same. The former Secretary of State also revealed she did not read an essay Ms Lewinsky wrote for last month's Vanity Fair magazine that focuses on the scandal that dominated. In an interview for People magazine in early June, Mrs Clinton said: 'I think everybody needs to look to the future.' However, Republicans have signaled they don't consider her husband's scandal from the late 1990s out of bounds in the realm of 2016-style political dialogue. Memoir: Hillary Clinton has been doing the rounds on a press tour of her new book Hard Choices. She says she has 'moved on' from the Lewinsky scandal . Life-altering: Lewinsky was just 22 when she and then-President Bill Clinton began an affair that would deeply affect both of their futures . Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, a likely GOP presidential contender, answered criticisms of the Republican record on women's issues by saying in January that the last Democratic president engaged in 'predatory behavior' with a woman, Lewinsky, who was 22 when her liaisons with Clinton began in 1995. Hillary Clinton also refused to confirm or deny calling her a 'narcissistic looney toon' after the affair became public. Lewinsky says she wants to use her experiences to help others facing public humiliation, citing the tragic death of Tyler Clementi, who killed himself after he was streamed via webcam kissing another man and was ridiculed on social media. 'Perhaps by sharing my story, I reasoned, I might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation. The question became: How do I find and give a purpose to my past?' she wrote. 'My current goal is to get involved with efforts on behalf of victims of online humiliation and harassment and to start speaking on this topic in public forums.'","Former White House intern Lewinsky arrived at Los Angeles airport this morning .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . A 48-year-old Florida woman who killed her two teenage children earlier this year shot them in the backs of their heads as they slept in their West Palm Beach home before turning the gun on herself, a newly released autopsy report reveals. Additionally, after killing her two children, 15-year-old Jacqueline and 16-year-old Alexander, Jennifer Berman left a suicide note on the counter in the kitchen, next to two open bottles of wine. 'I am so sorry to those that are hurting because they loved us...,' a portion of the note, obtained by CBS12.com, read. SCROLL DOWN FOR THE 911 CALL... Jennifer Berman (right) emailed her ex-husband on Monday to say that she intended to 'do harm'. Her body was later found along with her children Alexander and Jacqueline (left) who had been shot dead at their Florida home . The rest of the note was not released along with the autopsy report. The . bodies of all three were found by the children's father - Jennifer . Berman's ex-husband - Richard Berman, 51, shortly after the January 13, . murders and suicide. In . a dramatic 911 audio recording, Richard Berman is heard frantically . rushing to the home he once shared with his family immediately after his . ex-wife had told him of her crazed intention to murder their children. Despite the dispatcher's repeated warnings, he went inside and encountered an unimaginably grisly scene. 'He’s . not moving, there’s blood on his ear,' the luxury realtor manages to . sputter after finding the body of his 16-year-old son. 'I can’t believe . this is happening.' In the tense moments before it became . all too clear that 15-year-old daughter Jacqueline and son Alexander . were shot dead by their own mother, Berman told the 911 operator he was . terrified to enter the house. Mr Berman, pictured at a party in May last year, had recently divorced from his wife. Court records show they were both in financial difficulty after the split . Bloody scene: The Florida home where Jennifer Berman, Alexander Berman and Jacqueline Berman were found dead on January 13 in West Palm Beach by their horrified father. The five-bedroom home was in the process of being sold for $590,000 - but court records show there were two mortgages on the home totaling almost $700,000. 'She . sent her cousin a text that she was going to kill the kids and . herself,' Berman's said as he first waited outside for police as the . operator instructed. But then a neighbor decided to enter the home in his stead and moments later came back screaming, according to the Palm Beach Post. 'There's blood on the walls,' the shocked neighbor yelled. 'It . looks like she's laid in bed but she doesn’t have a face,' the neighbor . added. 'I think the girl's up in bed with her but when I saw what was . upstairs I had to run back downstairs.' That's when, in the frenzy of the moment, Berman entered the home and saw the horror for himself. 'I . was just all touching his head and he wasn’t waking up. His alarm was . on and there was blood in his ear,' he said, his voice cracking. Police then arrived and confirmed the worst. Reports of battles over money and the family's foreclosed home are all . the clues left that can paint a picture of what drove a mother to . madness. Jennifer Berman had . reportedly taken her ex-husband to court for financial support after she . was forced to sell her father's watch to pay for gas and groceries. Berman, . a prominent realtor in luxury homes, and his wife divorced in December. Mrs Berman claimed in court documents that she was struggling . financially, taking 12-hour overnight shifts as a nurse to make ends . meet. The mother and . her two children were due to move out of their home in the exclusive, . historically-protected El Cid neighborhood next month. Alexander Berman (left), 16, and his sister Jacqueline (right) 15, were promising music students at Dreyfoos School of The Arts in West Palm Beach . Richard Berman (second right) with his son Alexander and daughter Jacqueline along with two other adults. In a financial affadavit Mr Berman listed his monthly expenses as $4,700 a month but an income of $2,888 . Police were alerted by Mr Berman to the tragic multiple shooting shortly after 8am. Family friend Brian McManus told WSVN that Mrs Berman had recently been going through a difficult time in her life. Mr McManus said: 'Going through a divorce, foreclosure, a lot of that stuff which, it's an upsetting thing when you're going through a divorce and having to sell the beautiful house in this neighborhood, and it's just she just seemed like she had been upset lately. 'You can't fathom, you can't understand what's going on in someone's head for things like that to happen.' Last year, Mrs Berman had also petitioned a judge to remove her husband from the home because of 'emotional abuse'. The family had previously lived at another home in the historic and exclusive El Cid neighborhood which sold for $1.2million in 2010. The home in which the murder suicide took place had previously belonged to Jennifer Berman's mother. The property had been in foreclosure since 2010 but was recently sold. The mother and her two children were due to move out in February. Mrs Berman had been working 12-hour shifts as a night nurse for an elderly man because she needed the money, a friend, who refused to be identified, told the Palm Beach Post. Alexander and Jacqueline Berman were accomplished musicians and attended the Dreyfoos School of the Arts in Palm Beach, Florida . 'The truth will come out': A friend, speaking for Mr Berman, said: 'Richard has been painted as a terrible father who did not care about his children.That is not true. That is so not true' Past times: Mr Berman used to be successful but was hit hard by the housing crash. However, court records show he gave his wife the family home in the divorce and paid $600-a-month child support . Mrs Berman lost her divorce lawyer because she could not afford to pay him last year. According to the Palm Beach Post, she asked a judge to make her husband pay alimony and child support, claiming she was forced to sell her late father's watch to buy gas and groceries. Court records from the attorney's of Mrs Berman claimed: 'The husband has not paid the mortgage on the former marital home during the entire time of the dissolution of marriage proceeding. He has not contributed to the support of the wife or of the minor children. 'In fact, he has refused to pay for toilet paper, buy food and supplies for himself and keeps them where the wife and children cannot access them.' The Bermans married in 1992 in Miami. Mr Berman first filed for divorce in 2008 but the couple reconciled. Mrs Berman filed for divorced in August 2012 but the couple remained living under the same roof for a while. Last year, Mrs Berman allegedly asked a judge to remove her husband from the home, according to the Palm Beach Post, because of 'extreme emotional abuse and fighting (verbal) in home'. The couple shared equal custody of their two teenage children. Jacqueline Berman, 15, was shot dead by her mother alongside her older brother at their Florida home on Monday . Neighbor Marian Sklodowski said that Mrs Berman had recently appeared 'upset, disappointed and confused'. 'You can notice that, from the face, from the eyes, something was strange in her face,' she added. The teens attended the Dreyfoos School of Arts and were promising musicians, their devastated friends said. Close friends and fellow musicians . said they will remember Alexander Berman for being an accomplished cello . player while his sister Jacqueline was extremely talented at the violin . and a straight A student. Grief counselors were on hand at the school to help classmates cope with the tragedy. 'At . first it was just disbelief, going through stages of grief all at once. It's shocking to hear when it's one of your friends, you hear this on . the news and don't think it will happen to you,' a friend told WPTV. 'Everyone was crying, everyone was silent, it was a sad environment,' another student added.

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . DC Comics have reversed their decision to ban the Superman 'S' from appearing on a murdered five-year-old boy's memorial following mounting public pressure. The comics giant sparked outrage on social media after refusing to permit the logo on a life-sized statue of Jeffrey Baldwin who was starved to death by his grandparents in 2002. The Canadian boy had been locked in a cold, urine and feces-stained bedroom in the home of his grandmother, his Catholic Children's Aid Society-approved guardian, and wasted away to the weight of a baby. Scroll down for video . Little Superman: Jeffrey Baldwin died 12 years ago at the age of five after being starved by his grandparents in Toronto, Canada (undated picture supplied by the Office of the Chief Coroner in Ontario) Tragic: Jeffrey Baldwin (pictured in undated photo) had been locked in a cold, urine and feces-stained bedroom in his grandmother's home where he wasted away . 'DC Entertainment uses a flexible set of criteria when we receive worthy requests such as this, and at times have reconsidered our initial stance,' a DC Comics spokesperson said in a statement, according to The Star. 'After verifying the support of appropriate family members, DC Entertainment will be allowing the Jeffrey Baldwin Memorial Statue to feature the Superman ‘S’ shield.' Following an inquest earlier this year, Ottawa IT worker Todd Boyce was touched by the words of Jeffrey's father Richard in his testimony, and started raising money for a statue of Jeffrey. Mr Baldwin had said: 'He wanted to fly. He tried jumping off the chair. We had to make him stop. He dressed up (as Superman) for Halloween one year. He was so excited. I have that picture at home hanging on my wall. He was our little man of steel.' Mr Baldwin added that before his teenage parents lost custody of Jeffrey to his maternal grandparents the little boy was very energetic and loved the superhero. Mr Boyce's appeal to raise money online was successful, and the statue was designed and the model created, with Jeffrey wearing his favorite costume. Backflip: DC Entertainment is now allowing allow the Superman 'S' logo to appear on a memorial statue (pictured) for little Superman fan, Jeffrey Baldwin . But, Mr . Boyce says, when DC Entertainment found out, the comic book giant . refused him permission to use the iconic diamond-shaped 'S' logo. 'It . was important for me because I really felt I wanted to capture the . photograph of Jeffrey wearing his Superman costume and have it as close . to that as possible,' Mr Boyce told CBC News. 'Basically . they didn't want to have the character of Superman associated with . child abuse. They weren't comfortable with that.' Mr Boyce told  CBC News he was angry and emotional when he first learned of their refusal, but after subsequent conversations with people at the company and their lawyers, he softened his stance. Mr Boyce was prepared to change to the design to a 'J' instead of an 'S'. Backlash . Backlash: Jason Marcy joined the Twitter backlash against DC Comics, calling them 'money grubbing and heartless' Outrage: Twitter user Paul Vermeersch questioned whether Superman would be as heartless as the company which owns the super hero brand . Unimpressed: Twitter user Anna Mehler Paperny questioned the PR savvy of DC Entertainment . However DC . Comics' decision led to uproar on social media, with dozens of people . urging the company to change its mind and threatening a boycott. The company today called Mr Boyce saying they'd reversed their decision. 'I . think all along DC has been very sensitive ... that this is something . they really did struggle with as an organization,' Mr Boyce told The . Star. 'In hindsight, maybe they might have been better off just quietly giving us permission in the first place.' One of Jeffrey's sisters has chosen a poem to be engraved on a bench that will be part of the memorial, Mr Boyce said. It begins with the line 'I wish heaven had a phone so I could hear your voice again.' Jeffrey's grandparents were convicted of second-degree murder in 2006. They had custody of Jeffrey and his three siblings. Two of them were treated relatively well, the inquest heard, but one of his sisters was subjected to the same conditions. The difference between Jeffrey and his sister was that she was allowed to go to school and the daily snack she received there probably saved her life, the inquest heard. MailOnline has approached DC Entertainment for a comment.","Bronze statue created after campaigners raised cash to have it made .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . The wife of Justin Harris, the Georgia man accused of killing his not yet 2-year-old son by leaving him in a hot car, was barred from visiting her husband Tuesday when she attempted to see him in jail for the first time since shocking details of the alleged crime were revealed in court. Leanna Harris refused to answer reporters' questions as she left the Cobb County detention facility in Marietta on Tuesday morning, where she'd spent 36 minutes according to WXIA, except to shake her head 'no' when asked if she'd seen her son's accused killer. Harris appeared at least passably distraught as she got in the back seat of an unidentified woman's car, though questions have already begun to arise about her role in 22-month-old Cooper's June 18 death precisely because of her behavior. Turned away: Leanna Harris walks out of the Cobb County detention facility after being turned away from seeing her husband and accused killer of her son on Tuesday morning . Police revealed this week that . Cooper had been switched out of his forward-facing new car seat weeks . before his death - even though he was too big for his old one. Harris . was found dead in his rear-facing car seat in a parking lot in Cobb . County, Georgia on June 18 - after sweltering inside for more than seven . hours. According to Cobb County, Georgia police detective Phil Stoddard, Harris told his wife, 'I dreaded how he would look,' when he 'discovered' his son's dead body. Harris faces a . murder charge but insists he mistakenly left his 22-month-old son inside . the car before heading to work at Home Depot. Loss: Cooper Harris, pictured with his parents Justin Ross and Leanna, had been switched out of a seat that might have been easier for his father to see him in the back of the sweltering car . With the boy in the rear-facing seat, Harris would not have seen his child if he looked over towards it. During a probable cause hearing on Thursday, Cobb County Police Detective Phil Stoddard testified that the boy was 'several inches' too big for the child seat, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. He added that the parents had bought a new, forward-facing child seat just six weeks ago but they switched back to his old seat for reasons that are not yet clear. 'Harris knew the specific make and model of the seat and what the weight limit was for the child to be seated in it,' the warrants state. 'When the seat was inspected the straps for the seat were set on the lowest level for a small child.' Harris told detectives his son was 'developing fine'. Suspicions are also growing about what role Harris' wife may have played in the death. Accused: Justin Ross Harris, pictured at his bond hearing in Mariette, Georgia on Thursday, is accused of leaving his 22-month-old son Cooper to die in a hot SUV on June 18 . Emotional: Harris is facing additional charges of sexual exploitation of a minor as well as murder . Leanna Harris has not yet been charged with any crime but she expressed little emotion throughout last weeks hearing, despite a number of shocking allegations including that her husband had been sexting with six different women, some teenagers, on the day their young son had passed away. Investigators also described her own behavior on the day her son died as odd, if not suspicious. When . workers at her son's day care said that Cooper had never been dropped . off, she calmly responded: ‘Ross must have left him in the car. There's . no other explanation,’ Stoddard said. When . reunited with her husband at police headquarters after he had been . charged with murder, Leanna Harris asked him: 'Did you say too much?' according to Stoddard. When she called home June 18 with the . grim news of Cooper’s death, her mother could be overheard on the phone . saying: ‘Why aren’t you crying? Why aren’t you reacting?’ Her response, according to Stoddard: ‘I must be in shock.’ Familiar face: Leanna Harris, right, wife of . Justin Ross Harris, arrives for her husband's bond hearing in Cobb . County Magistrate Court Thursday. There are also questions surrounding her reactions to her son's death . Aftermath: Guests leave the funeral for Cooper Harris after hearing an emotional call from father Ross from prison as he said goodbye last month . Police . had previously disclosed that, like her husband, she had researched . children dying in hot vehicles prior to her son Cooper’s death, telling . officers it was her ‘worst fear.’ At Cooper’s funeral - and with her husband listening from jail on speaker phone - she said she held no anger toward him. ‘Ross . is and was a wonderful father,’ she told mourners, before telling her . husband of seven years: ‘I love you and I’m doing this for you.’ Some of Leanna Harris’ comments during her eulogy at Cooper’s funeral have also raised suspicions. 'Some . of you might wonder how I’m standing here today and I ask myself the . same question,' the deeply religious mother said. Heartbreaking details: A detective testified last Thursday that there was scratch marks on Cooper Harris' face and abrasions on the back of the toddler's head . 'I should be crumpled . into a pile of tears and snot on the ground. (The Lord) is standing . behind me, holding me up.' The . 250 or so mourners who gathered at University Church of Christ gave her . two rounds of applause as she said she wouldn’t bring her son back, . even if she could. 'He’s in the most peaceful, wonderful place there is,' she said. Detective Stoddard also told the court . that several injuries were found on the boy's body, including . visible marks on his face, revealing that he had struggled to escape as temperatures soared. Justin Ross Harris remains in jail on murder and child cruelty charges. He has been denied bond.","Justin Ross Harris is accused of leaving his 22-month-old son Cooper to die in a scorching hot SUV on June 18 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . A 12-year-old girl whose ear was gnawed off by a raccoon is one step closer to her dream of wearing two earrings. Michigan's Charlotte Ponce was just three-months-old in 2002 when the pet crawled into her crib and chewed off her ear, nose and part of her lip. Now after revolutionary surgery, doctors have attached a new ear which they grew on her arm. Scroll down for video . Update: Beaumont Health Systems posted this photo on Twitter on Thursday morning of young Charlotte Ponce with the caption, 'Charlotte is doing well as Dr. Chaiyasate transfers the molded ear from her arm to her head' ABC News | ABC Sports News . Revolutionary surgery: The lung cartilage was molded into the shape of an ear and inserted into Charlotte's arm during the April 15 surgery . On April 15, surgeons at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan spent seven hours embedding  lung cartilage, shaped into an ear lobe, into Charlotte's arm where it grew for months. Dr. Kongkrit Chiayasate was the plastic surgeon who attached the man-made ear yesterday. He told ABC News Charlotte was doing well and recovering in the intensive care unit. 'First time we met her, she never made any eye contact, did not talk at all,' Chiayasate, who repaired Charlotte's nose two years ago, said. 'In the past two years, she’s transformed. She’s got more confidence.' A 12-year-old girl who was mauled by a raccoon as a baby is back at . home after successfully undergoing surgery to create a new ear. Before the complex procedure, which has only been performed twice before, Dr Chiayasate said he practiced on a potato. He told WBIV: . 'As plastic surgeons we need to think outside the box a little bit - . what can we do to make a life long reconstruction for her. 'I've been practicing carving potato last weekend using this as a template. It's not easy.' Incredible innovation: Charlotte Ponce, 12, holds up her arm to show a fully grown ear at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan, on July 9, 2014, days before her reconstructive surgery . Brave: Charlotte Ponce was just three-months-old when a pet raccoon chewed . off her nose, ear and lips (pictured in April this year) Young Charlotte has undergone at least 10 operations since 2012 to restore her face. 'The raccoon pretty much ate the right . side of her face, all the way back to the ear,' Charlotte’s adoptive mom . Sharon Ponce told ABCNews.com. 'Now, all she wants is to wear two earrings.' Charlotte was just a newborn when her 18-year-old mother and 23-year-old father left her home alone with the pet. The . raccoon was thought to have escaped from its cage after a door was left . open when food had been dropped in, and no one was there to save the . baby when she was attacked. Mauled: Charlotte Ponce as a baby before and after the attack. Her adopted parents say she is still a happy girl . Her great-aunt Sharon and great-uncle Tim only found out about the attack with horror when they watched that night's news bulletin. They gained custody of Charlotte and her brother Marshall, who was then 15-months-old, and they and their friends raised more than $10,000 to help pay for her trips in and out of hospital. Sharon had to quit her job at a daycare center to look after Charlotte after doctors said she would need full time care. Remarkable: Charlotte with her adopted mother Sharon and Dr Kongkrit Chaiyasate after he built her a new nose in a 2012 operation. He said this next surgery will hopefully be the last major work she has done . Attack: It has been a slow recovery for Charlotte, who lived for a decade without a reconstructed nose (pictured left and right) Happy family: Charlotte now lives with (from left) her great-uncle Tim, great-aunt Sharon and brother Marshall . Charlotte previously had a prosthetic ear fitted but it was not an ideal solution and soon became infected and uncomfortable. Yet despite the enormous damage, there is one miracle. Even before the extensive surgery which will grant her a new quality of life, Charlotte's hearing has been largely unaffected.","Michigan's Charlotte Ponce was disfigured in the 2002 attack .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . The California man attacked Saturday by a 7-foot great white shark had an emotional reunion with his rescuer Monday. Steven Robles, who was mauled while swimming off Manhattan Beach, told Today about the horrifying attack and how luck was on his side before coming face-to-face with the man who saved him. 'Huge thank you I mean I don't know. Just, you know — give me a hug man,' he said, nearly choking up. Grateful reunion: Steven Robles, 40, (left) was attacked by a 7-foot great white shark Saturday, but manged to get out of the water thanks to his rescuer (right) 'Huge thank you I mean I don't know. Just, you know -- give me a hug man,' said Robles, nearly choking up as he embraced his modest rescuer . Hero: The emotional reunion came just days after was pulled from the ocean following his terrifying brush with death . Robles, 50, also addressed the revelation that the fishermen who'd hooked the shark were chumming the waters around where he was swimming and had been fighting the ferocious fish for 40 minutes prior to the attack. 'Apparently the shark was very agitated, and I happened to be coming at that exact moment,' Robles said. 'I came very close to dying.' Robles was still rattled as he recalled the attack in new, emotional detail. 'I saw that shark just eyeball to eyeball,' he told Today. 'I grabbed its nose, and I started to pull it off me. I got lucky that it released itself.' Painful: Robles emerged from the sea conscious and talking, but the evidence of the terrifying attack was plain to see . Brave: 'I grabbed its nose, and I started to pull it off me. I got lucky that it released itself,' Robles told Today . Robles was bitten by the seven-foot beast around 9.30 . a.m. Saturday morning at Manhattan Beach while it was snagged on a . fishing line, it panicked and bit the swimmer out of fear while trying . to wriggle free. 'It . came from the bottom of the water. It came up to the surface, it looked . at me and attacked me right on the side of my chest,' Robles told KABC. 'That all happened within two seconds.' 'I saw the . eyes of the shark as I was seeing it swim towards me,' he continued. 'It lunged at my chest, and it locked into my chest.' Lucky to be alive: The shark mauled Robles' hand and side, but did little other damage . Robles has been released from the hospital and is expected to make a full recovery. 'I’m still pretty shaken up. I’m still rattled, my nerves are still shaky,' he told KCAL. 'For a second, I thought this might be it, I was absolutely terrified.' 'I never thought I would die in the ocean.' Fishermen on the Manhattan Beach pier, . one of whom snagged the shark, laughed at the victim just after the . attack, footage has revealed. The . fishermen didn't realize Robles had been bitten and laughed . at his screams, but they quickly clammed up when it the severity of . situation hit them. 'There he is, look at him,' yells one of the fishermen as they reel in the ocean beast. 'Look at him! Look at him!' Grainy footage shows group of swimmers. Among them, the whipping snout and tail of a shark can briefly be made out. In the moments that follow, the group of men and woman watching from the pier all break out into laughter at the man's expense. 'He's right at him,' says one man, as there is a renewed burst of laughter. Steven Robles, 40, says he thanks God for saving his life from a horrific shark attack . In agony: The unidentified man is loaded into the ambulance following the attack . 'Out of the water!': Lifeguard Natalia Vecerek, 22, patrols the beach, telling people to leave the water after the early morning shark attack . The group appears unaware Robles has been seriously hurt, but they know he's terrified and still laugh. 'You hear him screaming?' asks a man. 'He was right on top of him.' But . that's when things take a turn. Robles' blood-curdling screams turns the laughter to . stunned silence. But the fisherman told the Los . Angeles Times they were unaware they had a shark on the line at the time . they were laughing. 'My buddy's pole takes off. He fights for 10 or 15 minutes and passes it to me,' said the man identified only as Jason. 'We spent 20 to 30 minutes not knowing what it is yet. When we catch bat rays in excess of 150 pounds, their pull and tug is similar to a great white. They're called mud marlins because of the way they fight.' It was not until the snagged creature was 150 feet away, about 30 yards offshore and only 10 feet from Robles did they realize it was a shark, Jason claimed. That's when the fisherman tried to pull the shark out to sea before cutting the line, likely causing it to panic and attack Robles. 'We are deeply concerned about the swimmer,' said Jason. 'No one intended this to happen.' Police have no plans to arrest any of the fisherman, sources told the Times. The ailing man was quickly pulled from the ocean as the fishermen yelled to other swimmers to get out of the water as quickly as possible. He was conscious and talking to paramedics while being taken to UCLA Harbor Medical Center, reported CBS Los Angeles. The experienced swimmer was . reportedly with a group of 15 frequent swimmers who dive into the water . every Saturday in popular spots from Hermosa to Manhattan Beach Pier, . and who were training for an International Swim Meet. Robles told reporters he punched the shark in the nose, which is a frequently recommended strategy when faced with an attack.

More bizarre behaviour: Shia LaBeouf, centre, red shirt, haranguing a man outside a New York strip club . TMZ posted the clip to their website on Sunday night, showing the 28-year-old bouncing around a sidewalk in front of another man. It was apparently filmed just a week before the actor had a meltdown in a theatre . The Transformers star appears to be heckling the unidentified male, bouncing from toe to toe in the manner of a boxer waiting to clash with his opponent. The . footage comes just one day after the site revealed LaBeouf had been . banned from a California restaurant after he was allegedly caught . urinating on a wall out front. LaBeouf's erratic behaviour has sparked concerns for his mental health in recent months. Back in May, the actor visited the The Local Peasant in Sherman Oaks, where he stayed for over four hours. The . Nyphomaniac star 'meandered' his way to the back of the restaurant . where he was followed by the manager into the parking lot. Eyewitnesses told TMZ that the manager then called out Shia upon seeing him relieving himself against the wall. Before his arrest: According to TMZ, Shia LaBeouf was banned for life from a restaurant in Sherman Oaks after being caught urinating against a wall in the parking lot in May,  pictured here in Feb 2014 . He reportedly 'profusely apologized in an odd rant' and then went back inside the restaurant and attempted to order food. According . to the website, the manager told Shia to leave, they then exchanged . some words before the actor stormed out 'vowing never to return.' While the embattled star did pay his bill, the manager told TMZ Shia is 'officially persona non grata.' Then, . just hours before LaBeouf's Broadway spectacle, he was photographed . chasing a homeless man around Midtown Manhattan, much to the shock of . baffled bystanders. He repeatedly said to the man: 'It's me, Shia.' Banned: The manager of The Local Peasant in Sherman Oaks told TMZ that Shia is persona non grata . No big deal: He reportedly 'profusely apologized in an odd rant' and then went back inside the restaurant and attempted to order food before being banned for life . On . Thursday, the 28-year-old was escorted out of the Broadway show in . handcuffs for allegedly smoking, acting belligerent and slapping people . on the behind during the performance. The . troubled actor was led away in tears from the Studio 54 theater on West . 54th Street around 9.30pm after causing a disturbance during the first . act of Cabaret, which stars Michelle Williams and Alan Cumming. LaBeouf screamed at the arresting officer: 'F*** you... this is f****** b******t... Do you know my life?' He then added: 'Do you know who the f*** I am?', according to The Smoking Gun. LaBeouf was charged with criminal trespass, harassment and disorderly conduct. He was processed and released from a holding cell on Friday morning, an NYPD spokesman told MailOnline. He is set to appear in court July 24. Walk . of shame: The 28-year-old was spotted leaving court on Friday morning . after being arraigned following his arrest the previous night . Fooling around: LaBeouf posed with a fan before having his public meltdown . Earlier this year, LaBeouf stormed out . of a 'Nymphomaniac' press conference in Berlin, before arriving on the . red carpet for the film's German premiere wearing a paper bag on his . head that read, 'I am not famous any more.' He was also forced to apologise for alleged plagiarism and starred in his own silent art installation in Los Angeles. Musical: Shia was escorted out of a performance of Cabaret which stars Michelle Williams and Alan Cumming . Sadly, Shia LaBeouf's arrest for . disorderly conduct at a Broadway theater on Thursday is just the latest . incident in a string of erratic episodes for the former child star. Bizarre behavior: LaBeouf arrived at the Nymphomaniac premiere in February wearing a brown paper bag . Earlier this year, the Transformers star . made headlines when he walked the red carpet at the Berlin Film . Festival with a brown paper bag over his head. Around the same time he declared he was 'retiring from public life because of attacks against his artistic integrity'. In . January, LaBeouf got into a scuffle with a fellow drinker at the . Hobgoblin pub in New Cross, South London, headbutting him apparently . over remarks made about the mother of his girlfriend Mia Goth. And last year, the actor famously quit the . production of Broadway's ORPHANS then shared several confrontational emails . between himself and fellow actors Alex Baldwin and Tom Sturridge, . explaining why he pulled out of the show. In 2007, he was arrested for refusing to leave a Walgreens in Chicago but the criminal charges were later dropped. In . February 2005, LaBeouf was arrested in Los Angeles and charged with . assault with a deadly weapon for driving into his neighbor's car after . losing his temper about having to wait to get into his garage.

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . They're going to need a bigger boat. New York fishermen have reeled in the second Great White Shark in less than a week just a few miles from popular Rockaway Beach. Bobby Jahrnes, from Queens, caught the 80-pound fish about 6pm Thursday on a fishing trip with his father and son. 'My son brought it to the boat and we thought it was a blue shark,' Jahrnes, who works as a carpenter, told The New York Post. 'But when it came closer, we realized it wasn’t. The colors and the snout on it - it was definitely a great white.' Scroll down for video . Fisherman Bobby Jahrnes hauled in this 80-pound Great White Shark near Rockaway Beach, New York on Thursday . Big haul: Bobby Jahrnes together with his father and son reeled in this big Great White Shark near Rockaway Beach, New York on Thursday night . Jaharnes said it wasn't the same shark that was caught on Sunday by his friend Steve Fernandez, as it didn't have holes or hooks in it. The third generation fisherman said it's likely the place he caught the shark is a spawning ground for them. 'I’ve been shark fishing my entire life. You used to have to go . out 40 miles to even catch a decent-sized shark,' he said. 'But to go . out for three hours and only be five miles off the beach and catch three . different species of sharks - that tells me there’s a lot of sharks out . there. ...There's . a big group of baby Jaws out there.' Fernandez, . 29, a Breezy Point native, was on a fishing trip with friends about one mile from Rockaway Beach when he hauled in an 80-pound Great White. 'We put our hook in the water, got it next to the boat and that’s . when we realized it was a great white,' the insurance salesman said in an interview with The New York Post. This baby great white was hooked a mile from Rockaway Beach by friends Pat Butera, Lawrence Benin, and Steve Fernandez . Fishermen saw the shark's mother swimming just a little farther out . He added: 'I’ve been . fishing my whole life but I’ve never seen one a mile off the beach. 'I . probably know more about fishing than I know about myself. As soon as . we saw it, there’s no mistaking it. ...It’s basically a . miniature version of the shark you see in the movie ‘Jaws'.' He said the shark's 600-pound mother was swimming close by. New York state regulations state that animals such as Great Whites be returned to the water with 'a minimum of injury.' What a big baby! The baby great white shark weighed about 80 pounds . Fernandez also brought in a massive thresher shark, pictured -- which is perfect for steak . Meanwhile, fisherman Greg Grodecki told NBC New York he was fishing with friends about 15 miles off the shore of Fire Island, Long Island on Sunday when a wide-mouthed fish bumped his boar, . He said it looked like a Great White Shark. 'It was just amazing to see it, so beautiful and powerful,' Grodecki said. 'It's just a great experience.' Another shark, also possibly a Great White, was spotted on Saturday off the coast of Cape May in New Jersey. Phil Argiros from the Long Island Aquarium and Exhibition Center told NBC that the Great White population is increasing due to conservation efforts. 'I think their numbers are increasing, so we are going to see more of them,' he said.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Daily Mail Reporters . The man suspected of killing the two-year-old biological son of NFL star Adrian Peterson has been arrested for kidnapping and assaulting the child's mother. Joseph Robert Patterson, released last year on bail and the condition he remain away from Ann 'Ashley' Doohen,'.is now in custody for kidnapping and assaulting her, sources told TMZ. Patterson, 27, was the live-in boyfriend Doohen prior to Tyrese Ruffin's death, he is due in court Wednesday afternoon on two charges of aggravated assault, a single charge of kidnapping and of burglary, the site reported. Back in custody:  Joseph Robert Patterson, charged last year in connection with the death of Adrian Peterson's son and this year for the kidnapping and assault of he boy's mother, is back in custody and due in court Wednesday (pictured during a court appearance last year) Patterson was the only one at her apartment with Tyrese the day he was brutally beaten, and he was later charged with aggravated assault and aggravated battery. Those charges were increased to include second-degree murder and manslaughter following Tyrese's death at a hospital two days later. Patterson's attorney confirmed that he has been released- in spite of his prior domestic violence convictions- and said that there are no conditions or restrictions attached to his bail bond. Tim Rensch, the attorney, said that his client will remain in the area in order to defend himself against the charges. Patterson's father has spoken out about his son's well being and his condition when he was in jail, saying that he was growing frustrated with the accusations against him. Outrageous: Patterson (left), who lived with . Tyrese's mother Ann 'Ashley' Doohen (right), is accused of kidnapping and beating her . back in court: Pictured last year, Patterson is due back in the same courtroom where he was released on bail despite facing a second-degree murder charge . Tragic: Adrian Peterson (right) only learned that he was the biological father of Tyrese (left) two months before the boy's death, and the NFL star had never met the boy until he saw him in the hospital . 'He’s moving into a pissed-off stage now. He’s getting bitter,' Grant Patterson told The New York Daily News. 'There’s a double tragedy in this case. My son’s heart bleeds for the child. I pray there is no rush to judgment. 'There are death threats against my son.' His son was living with the boy's mother, Ann 'Ashley' Doohen, and he had a history of violence. Patterson, 27, had a restraining order filed against him over his high school girlfriend in 2004. Noell Uhlir filed a petition in order to get protection for her daughter Carlie Rae who was dating Joey at the time. 'I believe that Joey is mentally unstable, and it is only a matter of time before he harms himself, my daughter or anyone that may step in,' she wrote. 'Joey needs professional help.' The second legal incident came in June 2012 when he was indicted for multiple counts of simple assault. Strong-willed: The young boy initially survived the beating but succumbed to the injuries at a hospital only days later . The victim in that situation was his then-girlfriend who has not been named and the 3-year-old son that the couple had together. The girlfriend said that Patterson slapped their son on his bare butt causing him to need ice to calm the welts, and later Patterson attempted to strangle her and threatened her life. Following incident, he violated the no-contact order that came in that case, and was due to spend a year in jail over the charges but that was ruled out by his agreement to attend domestic violence conseling. The death of Tyrese last week was brought into the national spotlight as it was revealed that Minnesota Vikings player Adrian Peterson was actually the boy's biological father. Peterson said he didn't know the child was his until about two months ago and had been working with the boy's mother to support the family financially. Such a tragedy: Tyrese was only two-years-old when he was callously beaten to death . 'It was a difficult day, just taking in the circumstance and the whole situation,' Peterson said of Wednesday's funeral in Sioux Falls. 'A child was buried. That's difficult for anyone. 'I was planning on seeing him and I had talked with his mom and had gotten some things together as far as financially helping her. Unfortunately, this situation took place and it's devastating. 'A lot of people won't ever understand the situation that I'm in and see it the way I'm seeing the situation,' he said. 'It's tough, but I'm able to deal with that. I got a good supporting cast around me. I'm standing strong, I am.'","Joseph Patterson was released on bail last year despite facing charges in the death of two-year-old Tyrese Ruffin .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Daily Mail Reporters . Prosecutors say New York Knicks point . guard Raymond Felton is expected to plead guilty in a felony gun . possession case in exchange for being sentenced to community service and . a $5,000 fine. Appearing in Manhattan court on Monday, prosecutors say they outlined the agreement for the 29-year-old, with a plea date now set for June 30. Felton was arrested in February, turning himself in shortly after a Dallas Mavericks-Knicks game at Madison Square Garden. Authorities said his estranged wife's lawyer had brought a loaded semi-automatic handgun to a police precinct, saying it was Felton's and she wanted it out of their house. His wife, law student Ariane Raymondo-Felton, had filed for divorce the week before after 19 months together. New York Knicks point guard Raymond Felton attends a hearing at Manhattan Criminal Court in connection with felony gun charges on Monday June 23, 2104 . The 29-year-old ball player is expected to plead guilty in a felony gun possession case in exchange for a no-jail sentence, prosecutors said Monday . Felton was arrested in February, turning himself in shortly after a Dallas Mavericks-Knicks game at Madison Square Garden his estranged wife's lawyer had brought a loaded semi-automatic handgun to a police precinct, saying it was Felton's and that she wanted it out of their house . Felton was charged with offenses including a weapon-possession offense that carries the potential for up to seven years in prison; it outlaws large-capacity ammunition magazines, under some circumstances. The gun in Felton's case had a magazine that could hold about 20 rounds, prosecutors said. The ball player was arraigned on two felony weapons possession charges then released on $25,000 bail. At the time law enforcement sources told the New . York Post that Ariane Raymondo-Felton, the 24-year-old brunette beauty . who walked down the aisle with the athlete in 2012, told police that . Felton had been juggling several paramours on the side. ‘He's an NBA player. He flirts and stuff,’ a source said. ‘When you're in a position like that you could get 10 girls per week.’ Raymondo-Felton, . who is a student at the prestigious Fordham Law School, also told . police that she and her philandering husband had four fights since the . summer, and on two occasions Felton pulled his FNH Five-Seven 28mm . handgun on her. Scorned wife: Ariane Raymondo-Felton (left), 24, told police her husband, Knicks star Raymond Felton (right), had multiple mistresses and had allegedly threatened her with a gun during domestic squabbles . The final altercation between the newlyweds came on Valentine's Day this year, which erupted over domestic problems. During . the fight, Felton’s wife claimed that the 29-year-old star athlete . brandished the gun in front of her to 'intimidate' her, the woman later . told police. Raymondo-Felton filed for divorce four days after the confrontation with her husband. The . law student's attorney advised her to turn over her husband's . unregistered handgun, which Felton had been keeping under their bed in . the couple's apartment on West 63rd Street. Rumors . of Felton’s extramarital trysts have long been swirling around the . dashing Knicks player - and they have even made it into a song. Rapper Fabolous allegedly alluded to Felton's status as an avowed ladies' man in the ‘Cuffin Season' lyrics. ‘4 . Celtics, Knicks guard, you know Felton,’ he rapped. ‘This n—- in . Atlanta AirTran her, no Delta. Been naughty all year trying to end it . nicely, Summer hoes turning into winter wifeys.’ Ladies' man: It has been rumored that Felton, 29, had multiple affairs since tying the knot in July 2012 . In their wedding video from July 2012, Felton vowed to be true to his leading lady. ‘Beautiful . as ever, from the first day I met her,’ the Knicks player declared. ‘I’m going to take care of her. You have my word. I promise you. No . matter what it is, I’m always there for you. I love you.’ Wearing . a black sweatshirt with a peace sign and other symbols on it, Felton . was seemingly upbeat as he appeared before Judge Diana Boyar, nodding . affirmatively after he was ordered to stay away from his wife, Ariane . Raymondo-Felton. He did not enter a plea, which is common for this stage . in the case. 'Mr. Felton has no interest in having . contact' with her, one of his lawyers, James Walden, told the judge. Court records show she filed for divorce from Felton last week. Prosecutors . say they were told Felton stored the Belgian-made FN Herstal model . handgun in the home from August through February. Wife: A lawyer for Felton's wife, a student at Fordham University School of Law, dropped off the weapon at a stationhouse on Manhattan's upper West Side on Monday February 24, shortly before the Knicks played a game at Madison Square Garden . Final straw: Raymondo-Felton filed for divorce just days after a Valentine's Day fight with her husband, during which the man allegedly waved his handgun in her face . The gun had 18 rounds of live ammunition in its magazine, which can hold about 20 rounds, prosecutors said. He was charged with criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and criminal possession of a firearm. The firearm charge is punishable by up to four years in prison. The weapons charge is punishable by up to seven years in prison. The section under which he was charged concerns having a large-capacity ammunition magazine. Police had originally arrested Felton on charges that included a mid-level weapons-possession charge that can entail having a loaded gun outside one's home or business or having a loaded gun with the intention to use it against someone. Released: Raymond Felton was arrested in February but released shortly after, making $25,000 bail . The Knicks brought the point guard back for a second stint in New York in July 2012, opting to let Jeremy Lin leave, and Felton helped the Knicks win the Atlantic Division last year. But he has had a disappointing season, averaging 10.4 points and shooting 40 percent while missing 16 games with a series of injuries. He has been frequently criticized by fans as the Knicks have fallen to 21-36. Felton had allegedly stored an FN Herstal similar to this in his Upper West Side apartment since April . NBA spokesman Tim Frank said the league was monitoring the case. It could fine or suspend Felton, but usually waits until after the legal case has been resolved. The league did break from that policy . to suspend Gilbert Arenas for the remainder of the season after he . brought guns to the Washington Wizards' locker room during the 2009-10 . season. He was eventually sentenced to 30 days in a halfway house. Felton . is not the first pro athlete to run afoul of New York's strict gun . laws. Plaxico Burress was a New York Giants wide receiver when he was . arrested in 2008 after accidentally shooting himself in a Manhattan . nightclub. He served two years in prison. Fighter . Robert Guerrero was arrested at John F. Kennedy Airport last year after . he presented a locked gun box containing an unloaded handgun during . check-in. He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was ordered to pay . a $250 fine and complete 50 hours of community service. In . other high-profile cases, multiplatinum-selling rappers Lil Wayne and . Ja Rule both were arrested in Manhattan, separately, on gun-possession . charges in their vehicles after leaving the same concert they had both . played in 2007. Both pleaded guilty to attempted gun possession charges; . Lil Wayne spent about eight months in a city jail; Ja Rule served most . of a two-year prison sentence. Felton . is set to earn $3.8million next season and has a player option that . would pay him $4million in 2015-16. The Knicks could attempt to void . the contract, but that would likely be challenged by the players' association.","Felton, 29, was arrested on three counts of criminal possession of a weapon on February 25 .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Daily Mail Reporters . A man who has been arrested on suspicion of killing two young brothers and one sibling's fiancee has a previous criminal record. The San Diego Union-Tribune reported Sunday that 29-year-old Carlo Gallopa Mercado was arrested on gun charges in April but later released. Mercado was arrested late Friday in Mira Mesa and booked on suspicion of killing Salvadore Belvedere and Ilona Flint, both 22, in the early hours of Christmas Eve last year outside Westfield Mission Valley mall in San Diego. Belvedere's 24-year-old brother, Gianni, was found dead in a car trunk about 3 ½ weeks later and some 90 miles north in Riverside. Victims: Gianni Belvedere, 24, Ilona Flint, 22, and Salvatore Belvedere, 22, were murdered in California last year. An arrest has now been made in connection to the triple homicide . Killed: Brothers Gianni Belevedere (left) and Salvatore Belvedere (right) were victims of homicide late last year. An arrest has now been made in their murder case . Dead: Gianni Belvedere's body (left) was foun in the trunk of his car. He had not been seen since the  murder of his fiancee, Ilona Flint (center) and his . younger brother, Salvatore Belvedere. They were found shot dead in a San . Diego mall parking lot on Christmas Eve 2013 . Police have scheduled a Monday news conference to discuss the arrest. Gallopa Mercado is scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday. The connection between Mercado and the triple homicide is not yet known. At the time of the murders, San Diego police were baffled by the crime, having no motive and no suspects. The mystery began on Christmas Eve at Westfield Mission Valley mall. Macy’s had extended their shopping hours until 2am for Christmas shoppers. Flint, who worked at a small shop in the mall, called 911 about 1:15 a.m. and said she had been shot. She said she did not know where she was but was somewhere near the mall. Police found her and Salvatore Belvedere in a black sedan between Macy’s and a Christmas tree lot. The pair had been shot in the head and upper body. Found: Gianni Belevedere's body was found in the trunk of his own Toyota Camry in Riverside on Janaury 17 . Ilona Flint, 22, and the little brother of her . fiancé, Salvatore Belvedere, 22, died from gunshot wounds after being . attacked outside this San Diego mall on December 24, 2013 . Flint is believed to have given some information about the suspect during the 911 call. She died at the scene, while Belvedere died two days later. Police quickly determined that Gianni Belvedere was missing. They did not identify him as a suspect, but as a missing person at risk. His decomposing body was found in the trunk of his green Toyota Camry about three weeks later, on January 17, in the parking lot of a restaurant in Riverside, over 90 miles from the crime scene. A resident had reported a foul odor while passing the vehicle. In late January, San Diego homicide investigators said they were looking for an unidentified person of interest in the mall slayings. Family and friends fatheried in San Diego earlier this year to stage a vigil for the death of brothers Gianni and Salvatore Belevedere . A man wearing tan pants and a black hooded sweatshirt with white stripes around the upper arms had been seen in the mall hours before the shootings. Police said he may have driven off in a 2008 to 2011 dark gray Honda sedan. Homicide investigators booked Mercado about 7.30 am. Saturday. 'The . detectives told us an arrest had been made for all three murder . victims,' Antoinette Belvedere, a sister of the boys, told UT San Diego at the weekend. 'Upon hearing this, our family was overcome with emotion and relieved at the same time.' She said the family gave the police their 'deepest appreciation and thanks'.","Ilona Flint, 22, and Salvatore Belvedere, 22, were found shot dead in their car outside a San Diego shopping mall on December 24 .

"By . James  Nye . and Daily Mail Reporters . One of two brothers accused of hiding a video that could potentially help solve the mysterious disappearance of Tennessee nursing student Holly Bobo has angrily denied that it even exists. Jeffrey Pearcy, who along with his half-brother Mark Pearcy was charged with tampering with evidence last month, has said that since his arrest he has lost his job and cannot provide for his six children. 'I have no video. I have not seen a video, never even heard of the video until I was questioned about it the day of my arrest,' Pearcy said. Scroll Down for Video . Denials: Jeffrey Pearcy said that he does not have a video which could help solve the murder and disappearance of Holly Bobo, has never met her and doesn't know her family . Furthermore, Pearcy claims he has never met Holly - who went missing in April 2011 after being led into woods - doesn't know her family and certainly hasn't met the two men charged with her kidnapping and murder, Zach Adams and Jason Autry. 'As far as me being around anyone that would even be affiliated with anything like that, I wouldn't want to hang around people like that. I work, and I come home and I raise kids,' Pearcy said to WSMV. However, despite these strong denials, Pearcy stands accused of having watched and owned a video which could lead to convictions in the case of the missing Tennessee nursing student. 'I don't know if they're grasping at straws,' Jeffrey Pearcy said. 'This is the closest thing to a modern-day witch hunt that I've ever seen.' Two more men have been arrested in connection with the Holly Bobo case, the Tennessee nursing student who went missing on the morning of April 2011 . Jeffrey Pearcy, left, and Mark Pearcy, right, have both been charged with accessory after the fact and tampering with evidence . Released with an GPS ankle monitor to track his whereabouts, Pearcy claims to have been fired from his position as a master jeweler - leaving him fearful for the future and his children. 'It's going to cost me the next 25 years of my life that I was planning college, a car. It's taken me from that to where I don't know if I can buy them food next week,' he said to WSMV. 'It's not just something you can get back by them saying, 'I'm sorry.' They have destroyed by life.' Jeffrey Pearcy says he wants people to know he's an innocent man. 'I have been up front and honest about everything. I have willingly given them everything. Take it, I mean, it's there,' he said. He also has a message for the Bobo family. Suspect: Jason Wayne Autry has been charged with the kidnap and murder of Holly Bobo . 'My heart goes out to the Bobo family. It could have very well been one of my kids. For someone to give them false hope, and that's exactly what's been done to them,' he said. 'But for the justice system to just haul someone in and destroy their whole life, I mean, there's no sense in that at all.' According . to the affidavit for Jeffery Pearcy, investigators believe he has 'shown . a visual recording on an electronic device to an individual. 'According . to the witness, this visual recording shows information that will prove . to be beneficial in the prosecution of a current on-going investigation . being conducted by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.' The affidavit doesn’t mention if the charges are in relation to the Bobo case, reports the Jacksonsun.com. Investigators believe that Jeffrey Pearcy has possession or has knowledge of where the video is, according to the affidavit. The . affidavit states that Jeffrey Pearcy is an 'accessory after the fact . due to his conduct concerning the concealment of evidence into the . investigation.' Tampering with evidence is a Class C Felony and accessory after the fact is a Class E Felony. Loss: Nursing student Holly Bobo was seen being led from her Tennessee home in April 2011 . Threats: Adams appears in court earlier this year over claims he threatened his brother, who is a witness in the case . A . TBI spokesperson said in a statement, ‘…out of respect for the judicial . process, we cannot speak to the particular possible pieces of evidence . in this case. We continue our work to follow the leads wherever they . might lead. We won’t stop until we find a sense of justice and closure . for the family and friends of Holly Bobo.’ Mark Pearcy was transferred from Decatur County to Carroll County last week and is also being held without bond. He was . also charged with failing to register as a sex offender and unlawful . possession of a weapon. According to online records, Mark Pearcy registered as a sex offender in 2000 for statutory rape. The arrests are the latest development since Jason . Wayne Autry became the second man to be charged with the murder and . kidnapping of the missing student, who was last seen by her brother . being led into woods at their home. Connection: Autry, who is currently serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault, is described as a long-time friend of Adams . Autry, 39, is a longtime friend of Zachary Adams, who was also charged with her kidnap and murder in March. Tennesse . Bureau of Investigation director Mark Gwyn said they have sworn . statements from witnesses who claim to have seen Miss Bobo alive with . Autry and Adams after she had been reported missing. He added that they also had physical evidence being analyzed at two crime laboratories, and several witnesses. 'We believe other individuals have knowledge, and possibly others have involvement,' Mr Gwyn told News Channel 5. 'They can expect us to be on their doorsteps very soon.' He . added: 'This is a case the TBI has been continuously working hard to . solve now for three years. It has not been easy but I do know truth will . prevail.' Charged: Zachary Adams, left, and Jason Wayne Autry, right, are suspected of kidnapping and killing Holly Bobo . 'Anyone who had anything to do with Holly's disappearance will be brought to justice,' he added. The . first major break in the case came in February, when the Tennessee . Bureau of Investigation agents and FBI searched several areas around . Decatur, including the home of Zachary Adams. Adams, 29, was arrested and charged with kidnapping and murder shortly afterwards. Miss Bobo's body has never been found. Adams . appeared in court in April on charges of coercion of a witness after . allegedly making threats to his brother who is due to testify against . him. Adams' brother allegedly told the FBI he had seen Miss Bobo, 20, alive at his home after she was reported missing. Heartbroken: Holly's mom Karen Bobo is led into court by attorney Steve Farase in March, when Adams was charged with her murder and kidnap . Adams is accused of asking a fellow inmate to tell his brother: 'He's the one who started this s*** and if he don't shut his mouth he will be in the hole beside her,' CBS News reported. Autry, 39, has been indicted with especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree felony murder. He is already in prison serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault.

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . An Ohio high school music teacher has been fired for posting a racist rant on his Facebook page after catching African-American teenagers urinating near his yard. The Akron school board on Monday accepted an investigator's report which found 51-year-old David Spondike's post violated Firestone High School's staff conduct and social media policies. The Copley resident had been suspended with pay after an anonymous whistle blower emailed his expletive-filled Facebook tirade to several local media outlets. The October 2013 post, which has now been deleted, said: 'I don’t mind if you come to my neighborhood from the . ghetto to trick-or-treat. 'But when you whip out your teeny d**** and . p*** on the telephone pole in front of my front yard and a bunch of . preschoolers and toddlers, you can take your n*****-a** back where it . came from.

Foul-mouthed tirade: David Spondike posted this racist rant on his personal Facebook page in October 2013. It has been deleted . In a letter to the school district in November, Spondike took 'full responsibility' for the post, but asserted his right to express himself. 'It is, however, my position that I have the right to use such language in explaining my feelings about the general state of the community in Akron,' he wrote, according to Fox 8 Cleveland. 'These remarks were in no way directed at the Akron School District or, to my knowledge, any person involved in the district.' In addition to the letter, the father has taken to social media and YouTube to defend his comments. 'I have always been clear and never minced my words on this issue,' he wrote on Facebook on October 28 last year. 'Please don't expect me to be anything less than consistent today.'

"By . Lydia Warren . and Daily Mail Reporters . Hired! Justine Sacco has landed a new job six months after she was fired for a racist tweet . The . PR executive who was fired last year after her racist Tweet sparked a . revolt on social media has landed a new job - working for a revamped . version of the app Hot or Not. Before boarding a place to Cape Town on December 20 last night, Justine Sacco tweeted, 'Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!' - and promptly became public enemy no. 1. While she flew to South Africa from the U.S., she was unaware that the tasteless tweet . had been shared thousands of times and had even sparked memes and the hashtag . #HasJustineLandedYet. When she landed, she was promptly fired from her job at IAC, a media company that owns Match.com and Vimeo, and holed herself up in her family's home in South Africa. But . after admitting she was 'ashamed' for her attempt at a joke and . deleting all of her social media accounts, she has now reemerged and landed a new job. She . will help with the promotion and relaunch of the app Hot or Not, . which allows users to rate the appearance of other people who have . uploaded their pictures, Buzzfeed reported. This . time around, the app, which is owned by British company Badoo will use . location-based data to help you find the most attractive people nearby. Offensive: She tweeted this racist message before boarding a plane from the U.S. to Cape Town last year . Realization: Sacco was snapped as she left the airport last year and learned about the anger against her . The new job comes after she lived in Ethiopia for a month carrying out volunteer consulting for a non-government organization. After the debacle last year, she was pictured arriving in Cape Town airport looking shocked and talking on her phone - and moments later, her Twitter account vanished. She later apologized in a statement released to The Star, a South African newspaper. ‘Words cannot express how sorry I am, and how necessary it is for me to apologize to the people of South Africa, who I have offended due to a needless and careless tweet,' she said. ‘There is an AIDS crisis taking place in this country, that we read about in America, but do not live with or face on a continuous basis. Unfortunately, it is terribly easy to be cavalier about an epidemic that one has never witnessed firsthand. New job: She will now promote and help with the relaunch of the app Hot or Not, which allows users to rate the appearance of other people. The new version will also find attractive people nearby . ‘For being insensitive to this crisis - which does not discriminate by race, gender or sexual orientation, but which terrifies us all uniformly - and to the millions of people living with the virus, I am ashamed.' Before . confirming they had fired her - and with Sacco still in mid-air - IAC . released a statement condemning her behavior as 'outrageous and . offensive'. ‘Unfortunately, . the employee in question is unreachable on an international flight, but . this is a very serious matter and we are taking appropriate action,' a . representative from IAC said.

"By . Associated Press . The United States shut down its embassy in Libya on Saturday and evacuated its diplomats to neighboring Tunisia under U.S. military escort amid a significant deterioration in security in Tripoli as fighting intensified between rival militias, the State Department said. 'Due to the ongoing violence resulting from clashes between Libyan militias in the immediate vicinity of the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli, we have temporarily relocated all of our personnel out of Libya,' spokeswoman Marie Harf said. The withdrawal underscored the Obama administration's concern about the heightened risk to American diplomats abroad, particularly in Libya where memories of the deadly 2012 attack on the U.S. mission in the eastern city of Benghazi are still vivid and the political uproar over it remain fresh ahead of a new congressional investigation into the incident. Scroll down for video . Evacuated: In this Sunday, July 13, 2014 file image, smoke rises from the direction of Tripoli airport in Tripoli, Libya. The United States shut down its embassy in Libya on Saturday, July 26, 2014, and evacuated its diplomats to neighboring Tunisia under U.S. military escort amid fighting between rival militias . Smoke rises in Tripoli on Thursday July 24 . 'Securing our facilities and ensuring the safety of our personnel are top department priorities, and we did not make this decision lightly,' Harf said. 'Security has to come first.  Regrettably, we had to take this step because the location of our embassy is in very close proximity to intense fighting and ongoing violence between armed Libyan factions.' The evacuation was accompanied by the release of a new State Department travel warning for Libya urging Americans not to go to the country and recommending that those already there leave immediately. 'The Libyan government has not been able to adequately build its military and police forces and improve security' it said. 'Many military-grade weapons remain in the hands of private individuals, including antiaircraft weapons that may be used against civilian aviation.' American personnel at the Tripoli embassy, which had already been operating with limited staffing, left the capital around dawn and traveled by road to neighboring Tunisia, according to Harf.  As the evacuation was underway, residents of the city reported in real time on social media that American military aircraft flew overhead while U.S. soldiers escorted a convoy of vehicles out of town. The State Department would not confirm the evacuation until all staffers were safely in Tunisia. The department said embassy operations will be suspended until a determination is made that the security situation has improved, it said. Tripoli has been embroiled for weeks in inter-militia violence that has killed and wounded dozens on all sides. The fighting has been particularly intense at the city's airport. 'We are committed to supporting the Libyan people during this challenging time, and are currently exploring options for a permanent return to Tripoli as soon as the security situation on the ground improves.  In the interim, staff will operate from Washington and other posts in the region,' Harf said. The evacuated staffers will continue to work on Libya issues in Tunis, elsewhere in North Africa and Washington. The move marks the second time in a little more than three years that Washington has closed its embassy in Libya. In Feb. 2011, the embassy suspended operations amid the uprising that eventually toppled longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi. After the formation of a transitional government in July, 2011, the embassy reopened in September. Gadhafi was killed in October of 2011. The Obama administration has been particularly sensitive about security of U.S. government employees in Libya since the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. mission in the country's second largest city of Benghazi that killed ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. The administration is still fending off criticism from Republicans and others that it did not either enhance security in Benghazi or evacuate the mission due to rising violence in that city in the months prior to the attack. The Benghazi mission was abandoned after that attack and never reopened. The embassy In Tripoli has been operating with reduced staff since but has remained open even as the violence intensified. On Friday, U.S. Ambassador to Libya Deborah Jones appealed for fighting near the embassy to stop. 'We have not been attacked but our neighborhood a bit 2 close to the action,' she tweeted. 'Diplomatic missions 2 B avoided pls.' On Sunday, Jones tweeted about 'heavy shelling and other exchanges' of fire in the vicinity of the embassy and speculation about the potential evacuation had been rife at the State Department for more than a week. A man looks out at smoke on Thursday. American personnel at the Tripoli embassy, which had already been operating with limited staffing, left the capital around dawn Saturday and traveled by road to neighboring Tunisia . Clash: Smoke rises over the Airport Road area after heavy fighting between rival militias broke out near the airport in Tripoli July 25, 2014 . Libya is now witnessing one of its worst spasms of violence since Gadhafi's ouster. In Tripoli, the militias are fighting mostly for control of the airport. They are on the government's payroll since authorities have depended on them to restore order. The U.S. is just latest in a number of countries to have closed down their diplomatic operations in Libya. Turkey on Friday announced that it had closed down its embassy and militia clashes in Benghazi have prompted the United Nations, aid groups and foreign envoys to leave. In Tripoli, clashes near the international airport have forced residents to evacuate their homes nearby after they were hit by shells. On Friday, the official Libyan news agency LANA reported that explosions were heard early in the day near the airport area and continued into the afternoon. The battle in Tripoli began earlier this month when Islamist-led militias — mostly from the western city of Misrata — launched a surprise assault on the airport, under control of rival militias from the western mountain town of Zintan. On Monday, a $113 million Airbus A330 passenger jet for Libya's state-owned Afriqiyah Airways was destroyed in the fighting. The rival militias, made up largely of former anti-Gadhafi rebels, have forced a weeklong closure of gas stations and government offices. In recent days, armed men have attacked vehicles carrying money from the Central Bank to local banks, forcing their closure. Libyan government officials and activists have increasingly been targeted in the violence. Gunmen kidnapped two lawmakers in the western suburbs of Tripoli a week ago and on Friday armed men abducted Abdel-Moaz Banoun, a well-known Libyan political activist in Tripoli, according to his father. An umbrella group for Islamist militias, called the Operation Room of Libya's Revolutionaries, said in a brief statement on its Facebook page on Friday that 'troops arrested Abdel-Moaz over allegations that he served under Gadhafi' and 'instigated rallies against' the Islamists.","The United States shut down its embassy .

"By . Ian Drury . Sham marriage is ‘spiralling out of control’ in Britain, with officials called in over bogus ceremonies nearly four times a day, an MPs’ report has revealed. The Home Office Select Committee said that arrests over fake weddings have more than tripled in a single year, as the ‘precious institution’ of marriage is routinely ‘hijacked’ by foreigners intent on illegally entering Britain. Their damning report accused the marriages – often between ‘away-day brides’ from Eastern Europe and men from outside the EU – of making a ‘mockery’ of our legal system. Officials are called in over bogus wedding ceremonies near four times a day, reveals a new report (file picture) And it said the Home Office is hopelessly unaware of the ‘alarming’ scale of the scandal, which represents a ‘significant threat’ to immigration control. It is thought that as many as 10,000 out of 173,000 civil weddings each year in England and Wales are fake. A sham marriage does not just allow a non-EU national the right to stay in Britain, but also their children, grandchildren, parents and grandparents – piling extra pressure on public services. Last year, immigration officials carried out 1,338 raids connected to sham marriages, up from 529 in 2012. The number arrested for taking part in a fake union more than tripled from 221 to 725 over the same period. But remarkably, an ‘absurd’ legal loophole means that two people living in the UK can be married by proxy, without any ceremony actually taking place in this country. This means they can technically get married without leaving the UK, as long as they are ‘represented’ at their overseas wedding ceremony, usually by a family member. Warning that the situation was ‘spiralling out of control,’ committee chairman Keith Vaz, a Labour MP, said: ‘There is an industry of deceit in the UK which uses sham marriages to circumvent immigration control. ‘Marriage is a precious institution and should not be hijacked to make a mockery of the law or our immigration system. We cannot afford for any town or city to become a back-door entry to our country.’ Last year immigration officials carried out 1,338 raids connected to sham marriages in the UK . He added: ‘It is absurd that we accept marriages where the two parties do not attend the ceremony. This allows an easy ticket into the UK. This proxy marriage loophole must be closed immediately.’ Sham marriages are increasingly popular among immigrants because anyone who enters a bogus relationship successfully can use it to stay in Britain for five years and eventually obtain citizenship. Under Brussels rules, they can then apply for permission to bring in their extended family. Officials have found a growing number of Eastern European women are being paid to visit Britain for a few days and supposedly marry a man, then return alone to their home countries. Their fake husbands are mainly from Nigeria, Ghana, Brazil and Pakistan. The report calls on Home Secretary Theresa May to start routinely publishing figures on the number of sham marriage reports, interventions, arrests, prosecutions and eventual deportations. It also suggests that the Home Office should write to the embassies of European nationals commonly involved in sham marriages, warning them that it could lead to a criminal record and being booted out of Britain. The report demands beefed-up enforcement teams and more efforts to encourage reporting of suspected sham marriages. And it urges the Home Office to give registrars extra training so that they are better qualified to recognise scams, as well as giving them more power to stop marriages they believe are suspicious. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We are taking ever tougher action, including through the new Immigration Act, to crack down on those who try to cheat our immigration system by abusing marriage laws.’ But Sir Andrew Green, of MigrationWatch, said: ‘Sham marriages are a huge cost to the taxpayer. This is a very serious loophole in our immigration controls and must be part of our renegotiations with the European Union.’ An illegal immigrant who was afraid that her sham marriage was about to be exposed deliberately became pregnant to try to stay in Britain. Leya Mtonga, who comes from Zambia, wed 29-year-old Portuguese national Nuno Moriera in Nottingham in 2009 to get the right to live in the UK. He was paid to join in with the pretence. Photographs seized by investigators showed the pair smiling together and looking every inch the happy couple after the ceremony. Portuguese national Nuno Moriera at his sham wedding to Zambian Leya Mtonga, who became pregnant when she feared the marriage was to be exposed . But the fake union was uncovered as part of a major crackdown on sham weddings. A probe in the city uncovered an immigration scam involving a dozen bogus unions. Mtonga was arrested by Home Office immigration officials in June 2012 and then got pregnant in a bid to prove that her relationship was real. She was expecting a baby during her three-week trial at Nottingham Crown Court. But Mtonga was accused of committing a ‘selfish and cynical’ act as she was jailed for two years in December last year for her involvement in the sham marriage ring. Sentencing her, Judge Philip Head said of her pregnancy: ‘I’m driven to the conclusion that it was a conscious and deliberate decision to try to bolster your claim to a genuine marriage.’ Mtonga, 39, came to Britain on a student visa to train as a dental nurse, but never went home. She is now facing being deported from Britain.","Arrests over fake weddings have more than tripled in a single year .

"By . Daniel Miller . Two Russian Ambassadors have reportedly been caught boasting about annexing Scotland in a leaked recording following Vladimir Putin's lightning takeover of Crimea. The recording of an expletive-laden conversation said to be between Igor Chubarov, the ambassador to Eritrea, and Sergei Bakharev, the ambassador to Zimbabwe and Malawi, surfaced on YouTube earlier this week. The two men are heard boasting about invading areas with independence movements around the world including Scotland, Alaska, Catalonia and Venice. Two Russian Ambassadors have reportedly been caught boasting about annexing Scotland in a leaked recording . And they even suggest London and Miami as potential target for Russian troops. After congratulating Mr Bakharev on persuading Zimbabwe to back Russia’s takeover of Crimea at the UN, the voice, said to be that of Mr Chubarov, jokes about future conquests. He says: 'We've got Crimea, but that's not f****** all folks. In the future we'll damn well take your Catalonia and Venice, and also Scotland and Alaska. Chubarov then suggests Russia should make a move for 'all those f****** border countries', presumably referring to Estonia, Romania and Bulgaria. Boasts: During the expletive-laden conversation the men are heard boasting about taking Russia taking over Miami and even London . But the two men later agree it would be better to leave Bulgaria, Romania and the 'Baltic s***' in the EU, with Bakharev saying it would be more interesting to go for California or Miami. 'Exactly, Miamiland is f****** 95 per cent Russian citizens,' says Chubarov, adding: 'We have a full right to hold a referendum'. Bakharev responds by suggesting holding a referendum in 'Londonland', at which the men both break out in laughter. It is thought the leaking of the conversation is in revenge for leaked conversations between western diplomats including one in which US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, seen here with Ukrainian opposition leaders is heard to say 'f*** the EU' It is thought that the leaking of the recording is revenge for leaks of Western diplomats discussing the annexing of Crimea, including one in which US assistant secretary of state, Victoria Nuland, is heard saying 'f*** the EU'. Maria Zakharova, deputy spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry, claimed the recording was 'clumsy US handiwork'. Writing on Facebook she said she had no idea who it was talking on the tape, but said the attached photograph of Bakharev bore no resemblance to him.","Taped conversation said to be between Igor Chubarov, ambassador to Eritrea, and Sergei Bakharev, ambassador to Zimbabwe and Malawi .

"By . Daniel Miller . On the eve of the First World War it was just another ordinary British street - a nondescript cul-de-sac of 60 terrace houses, home to dozens of hard-working blue-collar families. But by November 1918, some 161 residents of Chapel Street in Altrincham had stepped up to serve their country in the trenches of the Great War. Of those 29 were killed in action while a further 20 would succumb to their injuries on their return. Such was its sacrifice that King George V called Chapel Street the 'bravest little street in England' for having provided so many volunteers. Sacrifice: Chapel Street in Altrincham, Cheshire. From this one cul-de-sac 160 volunteered to fight in the trenches during World War One . Chapel Street today: The terraces houses were torn down in 1939 as part of a slum-clearance project, a Blue Plaque on the wall of an Italian restaurant commemorates those who volunteered and those who lost their lives . Today the rows of terraces are gone, torn down in 1939 as part of slum-clearance project, to give way to modern flats. A blue plaque attached to the side of an Italian restaurant is the only reminder of men who volunteered to do their duty and those who paid the ultimate price. Many of the men of Chapel Street were Irish immigrants who worked as labourers. The lack of work in the winter months was one reason why so many were quick to volunteer. A memorial, unveiled outside All Saints Church by the Earl of Stamford on April 5, 1919 . Private Hugh Hennerley, left, who survived the war and died in 1937 aged 59 and Private William Curley, pictured with his wife Ellen , who died in the trenches aged 41 . They were ideal recruits, fit and strong from doing . building work, some had experience of fighting in the Boer War, others . wanted a chance to become a hero and earn respect. Of the 161 who served, 88 joined up immediately. The youngest was just 16, the oldest 44, meaning  both would have lied about their age to sign up. They included Hugh Hennerly, who joined Cheshire Regiment and took part in the Battle of Mons in 1914 – during the retreat told to hold the line to the last man. At the end of the battle out of 1,000 men of the 1st Bn Cheshire Regiment, only 200 were left so had to bring men back from posts in India to replenish the ranks. And there were the three Wyatt brothers - Frank who joined up in 1914 aged 23, Joseph the eldest who joined up in 1915 aged 25 and the youngest Thomas, who joined up a week later aged 22. Joseph rose to the rank of Corporal with the Cheshire regiment and lost two fingers on his left hand in 1916 while fighting on the Somme. Farewell: Crowds gather on Chapel Street in 1914 to wish the departing men good luck . 'Over the top' during the Battle of the Somme in 1916, where Joseph Wyatt, the youngest of three brothers from Chapel Street who all volunteered lost three fingers on his left hand . Thomas was a driver in the Royal Field Artillery, while Frank's service record has been lost. All three returned but Thomas died in 1921 aged 27, possibly as a result of being gassed. Frank struggled to find work on his return and died in 1937 aged 47 and was buried in a pauper's grave. The Wyatt brothers are among those remembered at a special exhibition at the Imperial War Museum in Salford Quays, to mark the centenary of the war. Of course the loss of so many of its young men took its toll on Chapel Street. Without their breadwinners many of the families fell into poverty. On April 5, 1919, a memorial was unveiled outside All Saints Church by the Earl of Stamford to commemorate those who served and those who did not return.

"By . Daniel Miller . Mystery: Former golden girl of British athletics Donna Hartley-Wass died suddenly while sunbathing in her garden . A former golden girl of British athletics died mysteriously while sunbathing topless in her back garden, an inquest heard. Olympic 400m bronze medalist Donna Hartley-Wass had been suffering from high blood pressure and an irregular heart rhythm for which she was taking prescribed medication. Although a pathologist said as an elite athlete her heart had been 'worked harder than most' he could not ascertain the cause of her death. Mrs Hartley-Wass, 58, was found lying on a sun lounger in her bikini bottoms by . her husband, comedian and actor Bobby Knutt. He . said in a statement she had been to work as a fitness instructor at a . local gym, then saw a physiotherapist for back pain before she began . relaxing with a glass of wine. He . said: 'We went into the garden to enjoy the sunshine and she was just . wearing bikini bottoms. She went on the sun lounger to do her back face . down. 'I . went inside to watch a DVD then came back out to talk to her but she . appeared to be sleepy so I thought better of it and left her. 'I went back in to watch some more DVDs then went outside again to see if she wanted some suntan lotion rubbing on her back. 'She . was still in the same position face down with her head resting on her . arms but her face had turned purple and she looked like she had died.' He phoned for an ambulance to their home at Elsecar, near Barnsley but she could not be resuscitated. He . went on: 'She was fit and did not take drugs and would only have a . couple of glasses of wine. I’m shocked. It was completely unexpected.' Mrs Hartley-Wass's distinctive shoulder-length blonde hair and speed on the track earned her the nickname 'golden girl' in the late 1970s. Pathologist . Dr Charles Wilson said Donna had been suffering from hypertension and . an abnormal heart rhythm for which she was taking tablets to lower her . blood pressure and prevent complications. Golden girl: Donna Hartley graced the cover of . fitness magazines during her bodybuilding heyday in the late 1980s . (left). She way pictured early this year (right) before her 58th . birthday . But her heart, lungs and liver were completely normal and there was no blockage of the coronary arteries. He . did find a 'striking' build up of iron in her liver which he said was . almost always genetic yet does not often cause sudden death. Donna married fellow athlete Bill . Hartley in 1977, but the relationship ended in divorce. She met TV actor . Bobby Knutt in 1984 and they married three years later. Donna took her husband’s real surname Wass and moved to live in his native Sheffield. After retiring from athletics she became a champion body builder and won the ‘Miss Britain Physique’ title. Champion: Donna Hartley won a bronze medal in . the 4x400m relay at the Moscow Olympics (left). She was awarded an MBE . in 1979 (right) Amazonian: Donna Hartley was famed for her athletic good looks. She died while sun bathing in a bikini on Friday afternoon . She later ran a line dancing school in the city and had been working as a hotel leisure club manager when she died. A . self-confessed sun worshipper, she returned home early from work on . Friday to soak up the rays in her garden and make the most of the fine . June weather. Mr Knutt, 67, . said they went outside together at about 3pm and he returned inside to . watch television about half-an-hour later. When he went back out some . time later to speak to his wife she was dead. ‘I . went out to see her and she had gone. I don’t know what happened, she . might have had a heart attack.’ The couple have no children but Mr Knutt . has a daughter from a previous marriage. Fit and healthy: Donna Hartley led keep-fit classes near her home in Sheffield . 'She had none of the common features of liver failure,' he added. However he did discover a pigment in her heart which is normally only seen in elderly people. Donna Hartley-Wass was born in Southampton in 1955 and came to early prominence in the athletics world when she became a south of England sprint champion while still a teenager. The talented runner originally became well known under her maiden name Murray and her distinctive looks made her an instantly recognisable figure. She and won the AAA's 200 metres in 1972 then the 400 metres in 1975 but it was the 400 metres in which she excelled. In 1977 she became UK 400 metres champion and also became one half of a UK athletics golden couple she married fellow athlete and European 400 metres champion Bill Hartley. The marriage later ended in divorce. In 1978, Hartley won two Commonwealth gold medals in Edmonton, Canada, in the 400 metres and the 4x400m relay. In 1979 she was European cup semi finalist winner in both the 400 metres and 400m relay again and crowned a stellar year with a visit to the palace to pick up her MBE. The highlight of her career came in 1980 when she won a bronze medal at the Moscow Olympic Games in the 4x400m relay. After . retiring from athletics with an achilles heel problem, she married . actor and comedian Robert Wass, better known as Bobby Knutt, and became a champion body . builder winning the Miss Britain Physique title in 1988. 'Because . she was an athlete her heart would have done an awful lot more work . than the average person’s heart,' said the pathologist. 'I . don’t know whether this caused heart failure. I couldn’t see anything . which suggests that to be the cause. We have a previously healthy lady . who has died suddenly.' Dr Wilson said it was possible the electrical activity of the heart was interrupted causing an irregular heart beat which led to death or there were several natural possible causes. He had carried out a full review and toxicological tests but concluded it was unascertained. 'I don’t know the underlying precise pathological cause of her death,' he said. 'Her heart was worked much harder than the average person but I don’t think it is sufficient to give a cause of death,' he said. He told assistant Sheffield coroner Louise Slater that he was satisfied Donna died from natural causes. 'It fits the category of natural disease which we can’t detect with current medical science,' he said. Det Sgt Stuart Hall said police were called in to investigate the death after blisters were found on Donna’s back but it turned out to be nothing untoward as she had been lying in the sun. In his statement Mr Knutt said: 'She did all her training clean. She had strong moral compass and was immediately successful in her body-building career.' He went on: 'It was completely unexpected because she was fine earlier in the day.' Recording a conclusion of death from natural causes, the coroner said: 'It was a completely natural event however unexpected. Science cannot prove what happened at that time. 'These are very unusual circumstances. I know what a terrific athlete and body-builder she was.' After the hearing Mr Knutt said: 'It was the biggest shock of my life. She was as fit as a butcher’s dog and only looked about 42. She used to worry about everything but that is how she was.'","Donna Hartley-Wass was found lying on a sun lounger by her husband .

"By . Daniel Miller . Nigel Farage's former flatmate has branded the UKIP leader a 'salesman' claiming he is not not up to the job of leading the party and should step down to make way for someone younger. Godfrey Bloom, a former UKIP MEP now sitting as an independent after losing the whip for hitting a journalist and calling women sluts, shared a flat with Mr Farage in Brussels for several years. But on the eve of Mr Farage's second televised debate over Europe with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, he took a swipe at his former colleague saying UKIP needed to 'sharpen its game'. Attack: Former UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom, right, has branded Nigel Farage a 'salesman' suggesting he should step down as party leader and make way for someone younger . In an interview with the Daily Telegraph Mr Bloom was asked if he believed Mr Farage was intelligent, to which he replied: 'In what way?' And he suggested that Mr Farage was effectively standing in the way of many 'bright young people' who were waiting in the wings. He said: 'Nigel has been doing it for 20 years: I think perhaps one might argue that's too long.' In 2012 Mr Bloom made the headlines for outspoken comments about . aid to ‘Bongo Bongo Land’ and women being ‘sluts’ for not doing the . cleaning properly. He was finally forced out of UKIP after he hit . a TV journalist over the head with a conference programme in an angry . on-camera clash. Yesterday Mr Farage boasted how his party is harvesting thousands of votes from the BNP, with his anti-EU agenda and tough line on immigration was proving increasingly attractive to supporters of the far-Right party. ‘I would think that we have probably taken a third of the BNP vote directly from them.’ BNP candidates secured 940,000 votes in the European elections in 2009, but the party’s support has slumped since then. Nick Clegg is expected to ramp up his attack on the Ukip leader after polls suggested the Deputy Prime Minister came off worst in the first clash last week, which included arguments over immigration figures and the number of laws coming out of Brussels. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and UKIP leader Nigel Farage in their first televised debate. They will go head-to-head once more tonight . A YouGov survey of 1,003 viewers found that 57 per cent thought the Ukip . leader had performed better, with 36 per cent backing the Deputy Prime . Minister. Mr Farage was criticised over recent days after naming Russian president Vladimir Putin as the world leader he admires most. Mr Clegg has already branded the comments 'grotesque' and 'extreme', and is almost certain to raise them during the discussion. Farage has insisted he was merely expressing respect for Mr Putin's handling of the Syria crisis, not his political approach. Ukip membership is said to have surged over 25,000 in the LBC radio hosted debate last Wednesday, and party strategists will be hoping he can raise their profile further. Meanwhile, Mr Clegg is seeking to gain wider advantage by painting himself as a conviction politician - and the only genuine pro-European among the main three leaders. He said he believed he could 'unsettle' Mr Farage who he described as 'touchy' and unable to cope with the pressure of real political debate. A poster launched by the party ahead of the showdown on BBC2 this evening mocks David Cameron and Ed Miliband as 'missing in action', saying the Liberal Democrats are the only ones 'standing up for British jobs'. Party president Tim Farron said: 'David Cameron and Ed Miliband have ducked these debates. Nick Clegg is the only political leader prepared to put his neck on the line and stand up for British jobs.",Godfrey Bloom suggested UKIP needed to 'sharpen its game'

"By . Daniel Miller . As a fresh-faced Lance Corporal fighting for the British in Borneo, he single-handedly took out dozens of enemy soldiers before hauling two wounded comrades to safety through a hail of machine gun fire. So it is unlikely that at 74, Captain Rambahadur Limbu, the only surviving Gurkha to win the Victoria Cross, was particularly nervous before addressing Parliament on the issue of the fearsome Nepalese soldiers’ welfare. Captain Limbu, who was awarded the VC - Britain’s highest military decoration - for storming an enemy position during the Indonesian Confrontation in 1965, addressed the Gurkha Welfare Inquiry into the soldiers’ outstanding grievances. War hero: Captain Rambahadur Limbu, 74, the only surviving Gurkha to win the Victoria Cross, addressed Parliament over the issue of the fearsome Nepalese soldiers' welfare . Wearing his heavy row of medals on his . left breast and walking with a stick, Limbu posed for pictures outside . the Houses of Parliament in London. The cross-party panel of lawmakers is considering the Gurkhas’ appeal for higher pensions and rights for their adult dependents in Nepal to settle in Britain. The Gurkhas - known for their . ferocity, loyalty, bravery and razor-sharp kukri fighting knives - first . served as part of the Indian army in British-run India in 1815. Captain Limbu is in Britain to give evidence at a Parliamentary investigation into alleged injustices faced by Gurkha's in terms of pay, pensions and welfare . On November 21, 1965, after weeks of reconnaissance, Lance Corporal Rambahadur Limbu's 16-man squad was ordered to take out a key Indonesian position on the island of Borneo. Around 150 yards from enemy lines they were spotted by a sentry. A second sentry in a tower opened fire. The Battle of Bau had begun. Almost immediately one of Lance Corporal Limbu's comrades was shot in the stomach as he cocked his machine gun to return fire. Another Ghurka was then shot in the head. Corporal Limbu quickly hurled a grenade to take out one of the sentries, but soon found himself the target of a hail of machine gun fire. But rather than diving for cover he picked up the soldier who had been wounded in the stomach and carried him to safety. Then, as the bullets continued to fly, he went back once more for the soldier who had been shot in the head. Cut off from the rest of the squad he crawled out of cover to grab a machine gun only to find it was broken. So he picked up a rifle and opened fire on the enemy reenforcements that were begining to arrive, killing several. The Indonesians went into retreat with the British in pursuit. At least 24 Indonesians were killed that day while the British lost three men killed and two wounded, one of them seriously. Around 200,000 fought for Britain in World Wars I and II; some 43,000 were killed or wounded. Around 3,100 currently serve in the British army. Gurkhas . should get the same pay, pension and other conditions as their British . counterparts for doing the same job, said the organisation Gurkha . Satyagraha. 'The Gurkhas are . a much valued part of the British army and are held in high self esteem . and with considerable affection by the British public,' said lawmaker . Jackie Doyle-Price, who is chairing the inquiry. 'Whilst . there have been significant developments in recent years in terms of . the pay and conditions of Gurkha soldiers and the extension of the right . to settlement there remain some outstanding grievances which the . Gurkhas are determined to have addressed. 'This . will give the Gurkhas the opportunity to make their case to a committee . of parliamentarians and for the Ministry of Defence to publicly address . the points.' The public hearings will continue into . April. The government has pledged all relevant departments will . cooperate fully with the inquiry. The extremely rare VC, given for valour in the face of the enemy, takes precedence over all other military honours. It . is said they are struck from cannons captured at Sevastopol during the . 1853-1856 Crimean War in which Russia lost to Britain, France and the . Ottoman Empire. Besides . Limbu there are only three other living holders of a British VC, four of . the Australian VC and one of the New Zealand VC. A squad of Gurkhas patrol the river Limbang, near the frontier of the 'Forgotten War' in North Borneo . Captain Limbu, pictured as a young Lance Corporal, left, at around the time of the Battle of Bau and proudly wearing his medals, right . Known for their loyalty, courage and fearsome Kukri fighting knives, the Gurkhas are Nepalese soldiers who have fought for Britain for over 200 years. More than 200,000 fought in the two world wars, and they have served in Kosovo, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Borneo, Cyprus, the Falklands, Burma, Java, Malaya, Egypt, Tunisia, Iran, Libya, Greece Iraq and Afghanistan. Stories of extraordinary . gallantry, such as that of Captain Limbu, are far from uncommon among the Gurkhas, and many involve tales of desperate hand to hand fighting involving the iconic kukri knives which every Gurkha carries. Fearsome: A squad of Gurkhas brandish their kukri knives . Kukris are the traditional utility knives of the Nepalese people, but they are mainly . known as the symbolic weapon for Gurkha regiments all over the world. The kukri signifies courage and valour on the battlefield and is sometimes worn by bridegrooms during their wedding ceremony. The kukri’s heavy blade inflicts deep wounds, cutting muscle and bone in one stroke. It can also be used in stealth operations to slash an enemy’s throat, killing him silently. Modern warfare: British Army Gurkhas take a break in the shade prior to going on patrol, in Southern Helmand province, Afghanistan in 2007 . More than 200,000 Gurkhas fought in the two world wars, and they have served in Kosovo, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Borneo, Cyprus, the Falklands, Burma, Java, Malaya, Egypt, Tunisia, Iran, Libya, Greece Iraq and Afghanistan . The Gurkhas are currently fighting for the right to claim the same pensions as their British comrades. Their latest campaign follows the decision in May 2009 to allow all Gurkha soldiers with four or more years of service to settle in the UK with their wives. Until 2007, Gurkha pensions were far lower than those of British soldiers as they were based on the cost of living in their homeland Nepal. After widespread criticism, ministers decided that those who retired after 1997, when the Gurkhas were based in the UK instead of Hong Kong, could have a full pension. Attempts to extend the benefit to all veterans have failed, and the latest bid in the Court of Appeal in October last year failed after the Court disagreed that the Ministry of Defence unlawfully discriminated against them on the grounds of age and race.An estimated 7,000 soldiers who retired before 1997 with service of under 15 years are forced to survive on charity handouts.","Captain Rambahadur Limbu, was awarded the VC .

The fight, which was captured on a security camera outside a fire station in Alexander, Arkansas, took place on February 19. The father, who claims his son was the victim of repeated bullying at Bryant High School, said he had arranged to meet with the accused bully's mother to discuss the matter. Scroll down for video . Pandemonium: Dozens of parents and schoolchildren brawl in Arkansas after a father confronted a mother about his son being bullied . But according to a court affadavit, the woman arrived with a group with family and friends. The situation quickly descended into chaos as rival parents and children exchanged punches and threw weapons at one another, it is claimed. The astonishing footage begins with a large group of people milling around the fire station courtyard. As a fight breaks out between two individuals others rush over to join in, and within a matter of seconds around 25 people are fighting furiously. At one point a man arrives in a sports car and is seen rushing out of his vehicle and steaming in to join the fray. Children are seen looking on in astonishment as the parents battle one another. According to one witness the fight only ended after someone fired shots. Bad example: Children, pictured on the left, watch on as the parents battle one another furiously . When local law enforcement arrived on the scene they were met with a wall of silence and no arrests were made. But the prosecutors office later obtained a two party warrant on the case, which means the parents involved must appear in court. Saline County Sheriff's Lt. Scott Courtney told arkansasmatters.com: 'We attempted to speak with a couple of people and no one wanted to talk to us about the incident. 'Our involvement in this is pretty much wrapped up since the two parties involved in this are going to court and this is in the judicial system'. A spokesman for Bryant school said the bullying allegations were thoroughly investigated by an assistant principal in line with and district procedure.","Fight captured on fire station security camera in Alexander, Arkansas .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The service of millions of unknown soldiers will ‘forever be part of our national consciousness’, David Cameron has said in a moving letter to those who fought and died in the First World War. The Prime Minister penned the evocative letter as part of a project to connect today’s generation with the sacrifice of those sent into battle a century ago. In his letter, Mr Cameron tells the young soldier how ‘our world would have been far darker if you had declined the call to act’. Prime Minister David Cameron has written his own moving tribute to an unknown soldier (right), paying tribute to the sacrifice of a  generation of young men a century ago . The letter was released as the PM hosted a reception in the Downing Street garden or veterans, secondary school pupils and representatives from organisations involved in marking the centenary . Thousands of people have already written their own tribute, inspired by a statue on platform one at Paddington Station of an Unknown Soldier reading a letter. It is one of many tributes to the thousands of soldiers who died in the battlefield, and never came home. More than 6,000 people have already submitted letters, including thousands of schoolchildren and authors Stephen Fry, Andrew Motion, Sheila Hancock and Andy McNab. Organisers say 'it's a striking way to make a personal and permanent mark on this centenary'. In his letter Mr Cameron says the one soldier stands for the ‘millions of young British men who have fought to defend our freedoms and for the millions of us left behind who will be forever in debt to the extraordinary service and sacrifice of your generation’. He writes how the names of soldiers who fought and died will be recorded on war memorials ‘across the land’, and plays, poetry, monuments and art works will honour and celebrate them. The letter, part of 14-18Now commemoration project, was released Mr Cameron hosted a lunchtime reception in Downing Street for veterans, secondary school pupils and representatives from organisations involved in marking the centenary. The project is inspired by a statue on platform one at Paddington Station of an Unknown Soldier reading a letter . In his letter Mr Cameron writes that 'our world would have been far darker if you had declined the call to act' The Prime Minister writes how the names of thousands of soldiers would be honoured on war memorials across the country, adding: 'Your service will forever be part of our national consciousness' The tomb of the unknown warrior in Westminster Abbey is the grave of the body of a soldier brought back from France in 1920, as a tribute to all those killed in the conflict from 1914-19 . The Prime Minister paints a picture of millions of ‘angry, sad or afraid’ young men leaving Britain in the hope it would be a short war. ‘When you left our shores you did so with hope and purpose. Posing proudly in your uniform, you had a sense of mission and perhaps even of adventure,’ he writes. ‘You knew that you were volunteering to help your country fight a just cause. You did so eagerly, with honour and with the expectation that you might well be home by Christmas. ‘Today as you read this letter you know, better than we can ever imagine, the monumental horror and suffering of this War.’ Mr Cameron talks to a group of Chelsea Pensioners as he hosts the reception in Downing Street . The government has urged schools to get involved in a number of projects marking the outbreak of the war in 1914 . A £5 million fund will help conserve Britain’s First World War memorials. The cash will be taken from Libor fines paid by bank to repair and protect memorials and graves across the UK and oversea. The War Memorials Trust, which looks after memorials in the UK, will receive up to £3 million over the four-year period of the First World War Centenary to boost support for its grant schemes and expand a team of specialist Conservation Officers. Imperial War Museums will receive £500,000 to develop a website, delivered by August 4 this year, to help communities find out where information about war memorials can be found. By 2018 the site is hoped to be a fully-searchable, free, national register of all recorded First World War memorials in the UK, allowing people to find out where their relatives may be commemorated. As part of today’s announcement, English Heritage will receive £500,000 to provide better protection for war memorials by tripling the number of listed war memorials; delivering a larger pool of specialists to repair memorials; and developing an education toolkit for schools so pupils can research their local memorials. Mr Cameron said: 'As we reflect on the events that saw so many people make the ultimate sacrifice, I believe it is vital that we ensure our memorials are fitting tributes to the fallen.' Almost every family was touched by tragedy during the war, Mr Cameron adds. ‘So many friends have been lost; so many loved ones snatched away from us in their prime.’ He goes on: ‘But be in no doubt: however dark this time of War - our World would have been far darker if you had declined the call to act. ‘Without your service, our security, our values, our very way of life would have been lost.’ More than 6million British men were mobilised during the war, and more than 700,000 were killed. The letter writing project is one of many launched to mark the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the conflict on July 28 1914. In his letter, Mr Cameron tells the soldier: ‘Know too, that from your toil and sacrifice there will in time be a better world. It will not happen immediately. ‘There will be yet more unthinkable horrors along the way. But one hundred years from now your grandchildren and great-grandchildren will enjoy a peace in Europe and a quality of life that is almost unimaginable.’ Some of the world’s great advances were made by the generation which fought during the Great War, the PM adds. ‘Your bravery and selfless determination will never be forgotten. 'Your name - and the names of your fellow servicemen - will be celebrated on memorials in villages, schools, churches and universities across the land. ‘Plays and poetry will honour you. Paintings and monuments will depict you. Ceremonies will be inspired by you. Thousands will write about you, many will even write to you a hundred years from now. ‘So as you go from here, know that you are in our hearts. Your service will forever be part of our national consciousness. We are humbled by what you have given for us and we will never forget you.’","PM says their service will ‘forever be part of our national consciousness’

Troopers add a possession of marijuana after they found a baggie full of the drug in her car. Still, Smith was un-phased and continued giggling in the back of the squad car. Once the trooper left her alone, she woofed down the marijuana in the baggie. Smith allegedly crashed her car, drove the wrong way up a highway and then crashed again Thursday night . When she got back, she had crumbs on her face and on the seat. 'Bags of weed just don't go missing inside a police car. And I've got it all on video,' the trooper tells Smith. Police said between the residue left on Smith's face and the little bit of the drug left in the baggie, they have enough proof to charge her with destruction of evidence. Smith has been suspended from her job working for a Brevard County, Florida, judge after the arrest.","Tavish Smith, 45, faced misdemeanor charges of driving under the influence, fleeing the scene of an accident and possession of marijuana .

A couple in British Columbia, Canada, captured video of a black bear raiding their freezer for a pie - after tossing out several packages of vegetables first.

However, she was confused, because there was usually no mess. She would just find the door open an items missing. She set up a camera and caught the culprit, erm, red-pawed. 'You could tell he had been in there before and the first time he opened the lid probably whacked him on the head,' Ms Lewis told Castanet.net. 'This time, he pushes it open and looks to make sure it doesn't hit him.' Mrs Lewis says the bear has been hanging around the camp for years. He never bothers any of the people or animals - he just breaks into the trash sometimes. After finding his pie, this beast proves he's smarter than the average bear by making a hasty retreat . His freezer raids are a relatively recent caper, though none of his antics are too bothersome, Mrs Lewis says. 'We've seen him out in the pasture with the horses, rolling around in the grass - the horses don't even care about him,' she said.

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Michael Zennie . Homeward bound: Justina Pelletier, 16, will be returning home to her parents in Connecticut Wednesday after spending 16 months in state custody . After 16 months spent in state custody, Justina Pelletier will be allowed to return to her parents in Connecticut Wednesday, a judge ruled this afternoon. The founder of Liberty Counsel, a conservative law firm representing the girl's parents, said Boston Juvenile Court Judge Joseph Johnston signed a court order to release Justina to her parents in West Hartford, Connecticut. ‘We are thrilled that Justina will finally be returning home tomorrow,’ said attorney Matt Staver. ‘The family looks forward to putting this 16-month nightmare behind them.’ The 16-year-old girl has been a ward of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts since February 2013 following a dispute over the issue of her health between Justina's parents and medical professionals. ‘To hear the news is overwhelming,’ Lou Pelletier, the girl’s father, told FoxNews.com after learning of Tuesday’s ruling. ‘Now we can certainly begin the healing process.’ Justina's mother, who has been staying in a hotel near the medical facility where her daughter is being treated, got a call just before 4pm Tuesday letting her know that the judge had signed off on the teen's release. Lou Pelletier told Hartford Courant his wife then phoned him 'screaming with happiness' at the good news. On the Facebook page A Miracle from Justina, which the family have been using to post updates about their case and raise awareness of their daughter’s plight, an overjoyed Justina posted a brief video Tuesday evening thanking everyone who has supported her. All smiles: After the announcement, Justina Pelletier made a short video expressing her excitement and thanking her supporters . There's no place like home: A judge signed off on the teen's release after the Pelletier family showed that they had met all the conditions laid out in a reunification plan . ‘I’m so excited to be home tomorrow,’ the girl said with a broad smile on her face. ‘I can't wait. I'm just so happy to be home.’ On June 8, Justina made a tearful plea posted on the same Facebook page begging Judge Johnston and Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick to let her go home. Speaking in a halting, raspy voice, an emotional Justina Pelletier said that all she wants to do is be back home with her family and friends. ‘You can do it. You're the one that's judging this, please let me go home, Judge Johnston and Governor Patrick, please, right now,’ she said. Judge Johnston approved the transfer of custody back to the parents after attorney Matt Staver filed a motion May 30 stating that the Pelletiers had complied with the conditions for reunification outlined by the Massachusetts secretary of Health and Human Services. Lou Pelletier said Tuesday that the priority now is to get his daughter home and start the healing process. ‘Think of it like a prisoner of war who has been held captive for 16 months,’ he told Fox News. ‘There will be an adjustment period.’ Tearful plea: On June 8, Justina Pelletier made a video begging Judge Johnston and the Massachusetts governor to let her her go home to her family and friends . But once Justina is safely on the road to recovery, her parents intend to pursue legal actions against the Massachusetts officials who took the girl by force from her family. The father also plans to push for a new law that would prevent hospitals from taking custody of children using the state Department of Children and Families 'as their little wingman.' ‘This is just the beginning,’ Pelletier said. ’There's going to be a Justina law.’ Matt Staver, of Liberty Counsel, who has been working with the family for the past three months, said his team will hold the medical professionals involved in the case accountable for what he called 'absolutely total malpractice' and 'inconceivable mistake.’ The court decision returning full custody of Justina's her parents after a drawn out legal battle comes just two days after the girl was allowed to attend a barbecue Sunday with Lou and Linda Pelletier. Despite what state social workers say was 'progress' by the Connecticut parents, Mr and Mrs Pelletier said their opinion about their daughter's diagnosis - the issue that led to them losing custody - has not changed, the Boston Globe reports. Lous and Linda Pelletier said they are looking forward to the day their daughter Justina can come home (file photo) Doctors and social workers claim 16-year-old Justina suffers from psychological problems that have left her wheelchair-bound and with severe digestive problems. It was the Pelletiers' resistance to submitting their daughter to psychiatric treatment last year that led hospital authorities to contact Massachusetts Department of Children and Families. On Sunday, Mr Pelletier told the Globe the psychological diagnosis is a 'scam.' He blasted the judge who took his daughter away as 'corrupt' and promised a 'firestorm' of legal action once his daughter is returned to home for good. Justina, seen here earlier this month, has told authorities he wants to go home to her parents in Connecticut. State officials are preparing to make the transition . The Pelletiers maintain Justina suffers from mitochondrial disorder which causes muscle pain and weakness, not a psychological problem. On Sunday, Pelletier was given only her second unsupervised visit with her parents at their home in Connecticut. Mr and Mrs Pelletier took their daughter to Cirque du Soleil for Father's Day, then brought her back to their house for a cookout with friends and her three sisters. 'She’s got pretty much freedom now,' Mr Pelletier said. However, she still relies on a wheelchair and had to be carried into the house. Her speech is still slurred and had a tube in her intestines that must be flushed out periodically.","Justina Pelletier will return home Wednesday to parents, Lou and Linda Pelletier, after 16 months as a ward of Commonwealth of Massachusetts .

The entire shocking incident was caught on the surveillance camera from a nearby home. The video obtained by KIRO-TV shows 22-year-old Emanuel Andrade inexplicably lay down in the middle of a residential street in Tacoma, Washington, about 1am Sunday. A patrol car can be seen slowing creeping up to the man's body and then rolling over him. Scroll down for video (WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT) Horrific: Emanuel Andrade, 22, can be seen here in the middle of the road seconds before a squad car ran over him and left him clinging to life . The squad car bounces twice - once as the front wheels roll over the father-of-two and once, several yards later, as the rear wheels leave him behind . Andrade, an Afghanistan War veteran who is stationed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, was set to leave the military later this summer . Andrade is visible in the squad car's headlights for nearly 30 seconds before the vehicle suddenly accelerates and runs over him. The car jolts twice, once when Andrade is hit and once a few yards later when the back tires roll over him and leave him in the street. A police spokesman said the officer was doing a neighborhood patrol and was staring at his in-car computer screen when he hit Andrade. 'I just understand that the officer just didn't see him,' Tacoma police spokeswoman Loretta Cool told KIRO. The department is refusing to name the officer and said he will not be suspended because the incident was an accident. Andrade, 22, has a seven-year-old daughter and a three-year-old son. His 23rd birthday is next week . Andrade is breathing through a tube, cannot open his eyes and suffers from numerous broken bones. He is clinging to life in critical condition . Andrade's wife Susana is furious. 'He just proceeded with running him over and dragging him down the street,' she told KIRO. 'You can’t put an excuse to that.'

Four teens giggled as they recorded themselves cold-cocking a homeless man at a train station outside Philadelphia - then uploaded the video to Facebook for all the world to see. Now police are trying to track down the perpetrators of the city's latest brutal 'Knockout Game' attack. The video shows the teens laughing and joking before one suddenly punches the man in the face. Laughing more, they run off - out the train station. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Video shows this teenage (right) punching a homeless man in the face without provocation or warning last week . On the lookout: This is the suspect who punched a homeless man as part of the 'knockout game.' He showed his face in a video recorded by his friends . Police in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, a Philadelphia suburb, say the victim had significant damage to his eye. 'These are cowardly punks. There was no reason for them to do this other than pure evil,' police Superintendent Michael Chitwood told the Delaware County Daily Times. 'For no reason, they hit this guy. They could have killed him.' The victim spoke to WTFX-TV and said he feels lucky he wasn't more seriously hurt. 'It could have been worse because they did hit me with glasses on, and they could have sent my glasses right into my eyes,' he said. 'I take anxiety medicine and it was quite a setback.' The video taken by one of the teens shows the attacker approach the man, who is sitting on a bench and begin bantering with him. 'What're you trying to do?' the teen asks. 'I'm not trying to do nothing. I'm just sitting here,' the man replies. Then, the boy suddenly turns around and punches the victim in the face. The Knockout Game is a disturbing new trend in youth violence and the Philadelphia area has seen more than its fair share of indictments. The rules of the brutal 'game' include randomly picking targets in public and punching them - or beating them - for no reason, other than the amusement of the attackers. Last year at least three cases of 'knockout game' were reported in the city - including on that left a chef in the hospital with a broken jaw. It has proved fatal in some cases, including last September when three boys, age 13 and 14, killed a homeless man in Hoboken, New Jersey, after sucker-punching him.","Four teens are being sought for the attack in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, outside Philadelphia .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Fall: The number of slugs, spiders, worms and other invertebrates across the world has fallen by 45 per cent over the past 35 years, a study has revealed . The world’s population of creepy crawlies has fallen by nearly half – but that is bad news for us, experts warn. A study published in the journal Science, reveals that the number of slugs, spiders, worms and other invertebrates has fallen by 45 per cent over the past 35 years as the human population has doubled. Experts fear this will harm the planet as creepy crawlies play an important role in pollinating crops, pest control, decomposition and ensuring soil remains packed with nutrients, as well as water filtration. The fall in invertebrate numbers is thought to be linked to the loss of their habitats and climate change. In the UK the number of beetles, butterflies, bees and wasps has fallen by up to 60 per cent. Experts warn that fewer insects would have a huge effect on crop production as up to 75 per are pollinated by insects, amounting to around 10 per cent of the world's food supply. And the cost of pest control without natural predators could be more than £2.6 billion pounds in the United States alone. Scientists fear a drop in the insect population could also spark a decline in birds, which prey on pests that damage crops, and amphibians, which help keep water supplies free from algae. Decreasing invertebrate numbers are also known to compromise food production due to reduced pollination, seed dispersal and insect predation. But the impact the continuing loss of animals, including invertebrates, has on the spread of human disease needs to be better understood as a priority, experts claim. Dr Ben Collen, from University College London's Biosciences Department, said: 'We were shocked to find similar losses in invertebrates as with larger animals, as we previously thought invertebrates to be more resilient. Decline: In the UK alone, the number of beetles, butterflies, bees and wasps has fallen by up to 60 per cent . 'While we don't fully understand what the long-term impact of these declining numbers will be, we are currently in the potentially dangerous position of losing integral parts of ecosystems without knowing what roles they play within it. 'Prevention of further declines will require us to better understand what species are winning and losing in the fight for survival and from studying the winners, apply what we learn to improve conservation projects. 'We also need to develop predictive tools for modelling the impact of changes to the ecosystem so we can prioritise conservation efforts, working with governments globally to create supportive policy to reverse the worrying trends we are seeing.' Lead author Prof Rodolfo Dirzo, of Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment in the US, added: 'Where human density is high, you get high rates of defaunation, high incidence of rodents, and thus high levels of pathogens, which increases the risks of disease transmission. 'Who would have thought that just defaunation would have all these dramatic consequences, but it can be a vicious circle. 'We tend to think about extinction as loss of a species from the face of Earth, and that's very important, but there's a loss of critical ecosystem functioning in which animals play a central role that we need to pay attention to as well. 'Ironically, we have long considered that defaunation is a cryptic phenomenon, but I think we will end up with a situation that is non-cryptic because of the increasingly obvious consequences to the planet and to human well-being.'","World's population of creepy crawlies has fallen by 45% over past 35 years .

"By . Australian Associated Press . and Ryan Lipman . Brisbane man Gerard Baden-Clay wanted to 'wipe the slate clean' when he violently murdered his wife amid fears his double life would be exposed, a court has heard. Jurors are expected to retire to consider their verdict in the 43-year-old's murder trial today after prosecutors finished their closing remarks on Wednesday. Crown prosecutor Todd Fuller told the Supreme Court that, on the night Allison Baden-Clay was last seen alive, her husband faced being exposed as a serial cheat, which would have had serious consequences for his marriage and business. Scroll down for video . Brisbane man Gerard Baden-Clay wanted to 'wipe the slate clean' at the time his wife Allison Baden-Clay, pictured together, disappeared in April 2012 . His wife of 14 years and his long-term mistress were due to attend the same conference the next day, April 20, 2012, the jury was told. Alison Baden-Clay thought the affair was over but the prosecutor said Baden-Clay couldn't live without his former employee, Toni McHugh. Mr Fuller said the father of three had promised to leave his wife for Ms McHugh despite telling relationships counsellor Carmel Ritchie he wanted to work on his marriage and 'wipe it (the slate) clean'. The prosecutor said exposure of the affair would have placed Baden-Clay's marriage in jeopardy, his home life, his relationships with his friends and family, and his struggling business, which his wife and friends were involved in. 'Perhaps he felt that he had no other choice, no other choice but to take his wife's life,' Mr Fuller said. Baden-Clay has pleaded not guilty to murder and the prosecutor at his trial told jurors they might think it 'highly unusual' that Baden-Clay cut himself shaving in a way that looked like fingernail scratches or that Allison's blood was found in the couple's car . 'What would have been in this man's mind as he carried that out to bring it all to an end?' he said. 'The double life, the daily deceptions, the risk to him of it all coming crashing down? 'Like he told Carmel Ritchie, he just wanted to wipe the slate clean.' Allison Baden-Clay's body was found on a creek bank at Anstead in Brisbane's west on April 30, 2012, 10 days after her husband reported her missing from their home in nearby Brookfield. Baden-Clay has pleaded not guilty to murder. The prosecutor told jurors they might think it 'highly unusual' that Baden-Clay cut himself shaving in a way that looked like fingernail scratches or that Allison's blood was found in the couple's car. Several forensic experts have testified that marks on Baden-Clay's cheek the day he reported his wife missing were consistent with fingernail scratches. The judge is expected to finish his summary on Thursday morning before the jury retires to consider its verdict . Referring to suggestions by Baden-Clay's defence team, Mr Fuller said jurors might think it unusual that Mrs Baden-Clay fell to her death or drowned, when the autopsy had ruled out those causes. In summing up the trial, Justice John Byrne told jurors they could consider a manslaughter verdict if they found Baden-Clay not guilty of murder. He warned them that, if they thought the accused lied about the injuries on his face, they shouldn't regard a lie as indicative of guilt. The judge is expected to finish his summary on Thursday morning before the jury retires to consider its verdict.

Returning home isn’t an option, but once through airport security, Flo and Annie rush off in a panic to search for the requisite irons in the shops - apparently, only GHD (Good Hair Day) ones will do. Double-take: Shona's girls Annie, left, and Flo dress like many other teens . When they fail, the pair board the plane as if they’ve just been sentenced to ten years' hard labour - not heading for fun in the Mediterranean sunshine. While many mothers will join me in raising an eyebrow in amused exasperation, I can't help thinking my daughters' behaviour reflects something far more disturbing about teenage girls - that they have become a generation of vapid clones for whom a preoccupation with looks and appearance takes precedence over everything else. From what I have observed of my oldest daughters - Flo is nearly 15, Annie, almost 13 - it comes as absolutely no surprise that new research reveals teenage girls are under almost unbearable stress to aspire to a glossy, ideal image of beauty. Mirror images: Shona's daughters aspire to look like their celeb heroines with straight blonde hair and skimpy clothes . Clones: They look up to TOWIE stars such as Sam Faiers and Billie Faiers and TV presenter Holly Willoughby, right . This rarely exists outside the photo-shopped pages of celebrity magazines and the artificial world of scripted reality shows such as The Only Way Is Essex and Made In Chelsea. This has been backed up by the views of several experts, including U.S. lecturer and film-maker Jean Kilbourne, who, for decades, has been documenting how mass culture represents women. 'In the past 40 years, culture has stepped beyond setting an ideal image of beauty for women to aspire to; now it sets an impossible image,' she says. 'The girls consider it a crime worse than . death to leave the house without mascara. Neither will countenance . wearing a skirt longer than the middle of their thighs' As a result, a generation of copycats is emerging, all with long, straightened hair (preferably blonde), stick thin figures, caramel tans and the heavy make-up that their role models are never seen without. When Flo and Annie wander along our local High Street on a Saturday afternoon, it is impossible to spot them among the sea of identikit teens. For they and all their peers are equally desperate to ape this unachievable celebrity ideal. They gather in hordes, wearing identical Topshop outfits, hairstyles and shoes. Disturbingly, they are all so in synch it is not dissimilar to witnessing a North Korean army on parade. This Stepford-style mentality causes me constant angst. Have I failed my teenage daughters by allowing them to become so shallow and vain? They even talk the same and use all the same expressions. Last term, Flo started at boarding school. I was expecting a rocky first few days - teary phone calls and homesickness - but I heard nothing for a fortnight. Loss of individuality: Shona wishes her daughters could be more unique like they were when they were younger . Then, finally, my mobile rang. 'At last,' I thought, silently pleased. 'She's finally missing me.' But rather than the emotional conversation I was hoping for, what I got was this: 'Mum, my waterproof mascara has run out and so has my BB cream. Could you organise an overnight courier?' So, where, I wonder, has their originality and uniqueness gone? Annie is not yet even an 'official' teenager, yet her make-up bag is overflowing with more products than I possess. Flo and Annie have a uniform of outfits - tight black leggings, teeny shorts and cropped tops - that they swap between themselves, but otherwise refuse to deviate from. 'It seems as if the shallow celebrity . culture we live in is somehow sucking the very soul out of my lovely . girls and turning them into something vacuous' They have been blessed with beautiful long blonde hair, which, even though they don't have a curl in sight, they still spend an hour each morning straightening as flat as a ruler. The girls consider it a crime worse than death to leave the house without mascara. Neither will countenance wearing a skirt longer than the middle of their thighs. As sisters, they do, of course, look similar. You might think that because of this, they would want to inject some individuality into their appearance. But on the contrary, they are utterly determined to look like carbon copies of each other - and every other teenager within a five-mile radius. You might argue that teenagers have always been the same - materialistic and obsessed with themselves. Yet as I look at my two girls, staring at their images in every mirror they pass, I can't help thinking they are a world away from my Eighties' self. Back in 1985, at the age of 14, I remember being hell-bent on standing out from the crowd. For me, being a teenager was all about experimenting, revelling in my emerging personality and expressing myself to the world. Narrow-minded: Flo and Annie have set ideas on their appearances and don't like to deviate from what is 'cool' I remember perming my hair, dying it ink black and using henna to turn it red, all in the same year. But it wasn't just about my generation's different attitude towards looks. The Eighties were a fun-filled decade. Despite being at a strict all-girls' convent school, I felt that I could goof around and be myself. It didn’t matter that I wore braces, had no boobs to speak of and mousy hair. No two of my friends looked the same and, anyway, we wouldn’t have wanted to. Our idols were Madonna, Whitney Houston and Alexis off Dynasty - three women who couldn’t be more different. We weren't bombarded with the same homogenous images that my daughters are. There were no rules on what to look like and no one to sneer at us if we got it wrong. Sadly, all that is in stark contrast to the modern world. 'Short of plonking them on a desert . island away from the superficial rubbish they are bombarded with, I am . at a loss over what to do' Abigail Tazzyman, an academic at York University, who studies the grooming habits of women aged 18 to 25, says girls report a great hostility to anyone who doesn't look the same. 'The spectrum of what is acceptable is very small,' she says. 'It is not, for example, enough that girls must all have straight hair. They must use GHD straighteners.' Flo and Annie will go even further. They can be ruthlessly critical of each other. I have watched Annie put together an outfit, having carefully studied her older sister, only for Flo to cast a single damning glance because the skirt she is wearing is a millimetre too long or it's 'not cool' with her shoes. Then Flo will put on almost identical clothes and deem them acceptable because they have been bought from Topshop not Primark, or some Z-list celebrity she is following on Twitter wore something similar a week ago. I watch these blossoming girls on the brink of womanhood and I can't help despairing. It’s not just the fact that everything they want to wear is so tight, so revealing, dare I say it, slutty. It's that they appear to have lost something of the wonderful uniqueness they once had. Can it really be so long ago that Flo would dance down a pavement, oblivious to everyone around her? Or that Annie would walk to the local shop wearing a onesie and a silly hat just to see what people's reactions would be? I can remember feeling so proud of my girls and their robust sense of self. They have strong personalities and, up until recently, seemed to have refreshingly clear ideas of what they liked and didn't. Now they are infuriatingly narrow-minded. If Kim Kardashian thinks it's OK, then it's OK. If Cara Delevingne has worn it (or similar), then fine. Otherwise, forget it. Of course, teenagers all succumb to peer pressure during the turbulent crossing from child to adult. But this feels different. It seems as if the shallow celebrity culture we live in is somehow sucking the very soul out of my lovely girls and turning them into something vacuous. I have no idea how to stop the rot from setting in. Short of plonking them on a desert island away from the superficial rubbish they are bombarded with, I am at a loss over what to do. I simply have to cross my fingers and hope it’s a passing phase that will see them emerging from their bedrooms looking like the two individuals I know they are. In the meantime, along with every other mother of a teenage girl, I can only pray that someone on TOWIE deems it cool to cut their hair, cover up and lose the mascara.","Flo, nearly 15, and Annie, almost 13, are identikit teens .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . David Zolkwer - who has worked on scores of huge events around the world - was the creative mind behind last night's opening ceremony in Glasgow . This is the man behind the Glasgow 2014 opening ceremony - who can also claim credit for some of the world's biggest events including the Royal Wedding. David Zolkwer, 50, has been the creative director, producer and consultant behind scores of huge shows across the world. His sporting credits alone include both ceremonies of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games, the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games, the 2008 Beijing ceremonies and the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. He also directed the 2002 Commonwealth Games ceremonies in his native Manchester. Although British film maker Danny Boyle was famously drafted in to direct the London 2012 shows, Mr Zolkwer was asked to organise the Team GB homecoming parade through central London. Mr Zolkwer, who now lives in London, has also organised numerous other events throughout his career - including the much anticipated wedding of Prince William and the then Catherine Middleton in 2011. Mr Zolkwer's was the creative director for the celebration sites in London's Hyde Park and Trafalgar Square for the wedding - which saw millions of people descend on to the streets of the capital to celebrate the royal nuptials. He was also creative director for the annual New Year's Eve celebrations in London from 2007-2012, which were regularly attended by 350,000 people per year. His huge body of work has been noted with an Honorary Doctorate by Middlesex University for his 'outstanding contribution to his profession and his community'. Speaking before the Glasgow Opening Ceremony - which was watched by 9.4million people at its peak - Mr Zolkwer said he hoped it would 'speak directly to the rest of the world.' He added that his ceremony would celebrate the diversity of Scotland and what it had in common with the rest of the 70 competing nations. Scroll down for video . In 2007/08, Mr Zolkwer was a creative consultant behind the ceremonies for the Beijing Olympics - one spectacular firework display from the opening of the games pictured . The 50-year-old was also behind the celebration sites for the Royal Wedding of Prince William and the now Duchess of Cambridge in 2011 . He told The Daily Record: 'We have a mass cast but we have set out to represent lots and lots of individuals. 'You will see lots of individuals encouraged to do their own thing in a rehearsed and considered way. 'It's not about homogenising the city or asking them to pretend to be anything other than who they are.' He added: 'It's got humour, warmth, celebrating what we have in common. 'Having said all that, it will always feel like it was created in Glasgow. 'So, although we are telling a universal story, we are telling it with a distinctly Glaswegian accent, which means we are going to be irreverent, funny, principled, sincere, inclusive, personal, direct.' In 2002, Mr Zolkwer returned to his hometown to direct the ceremonies for the Manchester Commonwealth Games (closing ceremony pictured) Fireworks light up the night sky as the games are declared open during yesterday's celebrations in Glasgow. Before the show, Mr Zolkwer said he wanted the event to celebrate what Scotland had in common with the rest of the world . The opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games - with its dancing Tunnock's Teacakes and show-stealing Scottie dogs - was watched by more than nine million viewers on BBC1. The Glasgow spectacle, which featured musical performances by Rod Stewart and Nicola Benedetti, had a peak audience of 9.4 million - exceeding the number who watched the last time the Games were staged in the UK in 2002, when 8.9 million tuned in at the height of the Manchester opening. An average of 7.6 million watched for the duration of the programme, which lasted more than three hours, down from the 8.2 million who stuck with the whole ceremony 12 years ago. But the audience was up hugely on the levels for 2010 stage in Delhi, which drew an average of 3 million, and 2006 for Melbourne, which pulled in 1.3 million. Last night's coverage accounted for more than two-fifths of the viewers watching TV at that time.","David Zolkwer, 50, has created some of the world's biggest shows .

"By . Aap . Former swimming coach Scott Volkers (pictured in 2004) was allowed to work with children despite Queensland's Civil and Administrative Tribunal identifying seven potential 'risk factors' in May 2010 . Swimmer Susie O'Neill's former coach was still allowed to supervise children despite being rejected for a working with children card, a royal commission has heard. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse has heard Queensland's Civil and Administrative Tribunal identified seven potential risk factors in allowing Scott Volkers to work with children in May 2010. A month later Queensland's Commission for Children and Young People received complaints Volkers was coaching girls aged 14 - 17 for Swimming Queensland on a trip to China, and at Sleeman Aquatic Centre. 'If Mr Volkers has been or continues to engage in regulated child related employment activities under the commission's legislation, both he and his employer can be held liable for prosecution action,' the Commission for Children and Young People warned Swimming Queensland in July. Four women have accused Volkers of sexually abusing them while he was a swimming instructor in the 1980s and 1990s. Charges were laid in 2002, but subsequently dropped. The commission heard that after the allegations Volkers made two applications for a 'blue card' - essentially a working with children's check - and received a negative assessment both times. He appealed against the decision in April 2010. On September 27 that year, Queensland's Commission for Children and Young People said Mr Volkers would have to step back his duties to comply with the law. Scroll down for video . Mr Volkers (pictured left, in 2002) coached Susie O'Neill (pictured right, in 2006) in the 1990s . Mr Volkers subsequently ceased employment with Swimming Queensland and started working as a swimming coach in Brazil. Queensland's Civil and Administrative Tribunal noted the charges against Volkers were discontinued not because it was found the conduct didn't occur, but because there was difficulty in prosecuting matters alleged to have happened years before. But it highlighted as one of its relevant factors in its decision a recorded statement of Volkers talking to a complainant, in which he admitted he touched a girl's leg 'on both sides'. 'I remember rubbing your leg,' he is recorded as saying to one of his complainants. 'I remember - I do remember it as very - it was high, right up in the groin area and it may have been - or something. 'I don't know, but I am not saying you're a liar but I am telling you that I didn't try to finger you.' In her opening statement on Monday, council assisting the commission Gail Furness said the hearings will examine the actions taken by the Queensland Director of Public Prosecutions, the Queensland Academy of Sport, Swimming Australia and Swimming Queensland to accusations against Volkers. The hearings will also examine Swimming Australia's response to allegations against former national head coach Terry Buck.","Susie O'Neill's former coach allowed to supervise children despite being rejected for a working with children card .

"By . Aap . Jacqui Lambie has taken another swipe at Tony Abbott, declaring the prime minister needs 'a bucket of cement' to toughen up if he can't cop her criticism and telling him that she will be prime minister one day. The Palmer United Party senator's comments come after she said yesterday that Tony Abbott was a 'political psychopath' who put the lives of his daughters at risk by 'parading' them around on the campaign trail last year. Her comments caused a stir, but the rookie senator has remained unfazed and has offered Mr Abbott some free advice about how to handle critics. Scroll down for video .

'If you're not used to attacks by now then you probably shouldn't be in that position,' she told the Nine Network. 'You've got one of two choices. You can run and hide or you can say to yourself ""here's a bucket of cement - toughen up"".' She also rejected suggestions she'd crossed the line by dragging families into the political fray, rehashing her belief that Mr Abbott put his daughters at risk during the election campaign. The former military police officer said there was a fine line between enlisting your family's support and 'parading' them for political gain. 'That really bothers me that you've got those pretty young girls running around in front of a camera, and I just thought, ""is your political career more important than your own daughters' security?""' she told ABC radio on Thursday.

'Let's face it, they are really three gorgeous looking girls,' she said of Mr Abbott's daughters. 'I can only hope that they can stay safe but I guess we'll see what happens in the future.' The outspoken former military officer made headlines last month when she called the prime minister a 'bare-faced, uncaring liar'.

"By . Aap . Rolf Harris has spent his first night in a London jail as child advocates in Australia criticised the sex offender's sentence as too lenient. The 84-year-old was immediately sent to Wandsworth prison in south-west London after being sentenced to five years and nine months' jail for a string of indecent assaults against four girls in the UK. He will only have to serve half that sentence, however, meaning he will be released in less than three years. Scroll down for video . Rolf Harris as he arrived at Southwark Crown Court without his wife Alwen for his sentence . Former Hey Dad! star and Bravehearts ambassador Sarah Monahan criticised the sentence as 'way too light' on social media. 'It saddens me you get more time for money offences than you do for crimes against children,' she wrote on her Facebook page. Ms Monahan said the parallels between the Harris sentencing and that of Australian actor Robert Hughes - her on-screen father who assaulted her and three other young girls during the 1980s and 1990s - 'astound me'. Hughes was sentenced in May to 10 years and nine months' jail but could be released in six years. In sentencing Harris at Southwark Crown Court on Friday, Justice Nigel Sweeney said: 'You have shown no remorse for your crimes at all.' Sexual abuse victim Sarah Monahan (left) and children's rights activist Hetty Johnson (right) have condemned Harris's actions . Support: Harris was flanked by his wife Alwen and daughter Bindi when the jury found him guilty of all counts earlier this week . Bravehearts founder Hetty Johnston said that was to be expected. 'The remorse would be a lie anyway,' Ms Johnston told AAP. 'It's a very, very selfish act to hurt a child. You can't do it unless you have a lack of empathy. 'He's ignorant, self-absorbed and an egomaniac. 'I think his victims feel vindicated anyway. I don't think they expected remorse from a man like him.' After Harris was sentenced, one of the four victims in the case said she felt 'very sad' that the former star continued to deny his crimes. The woman, now 52, was groped at Cambridge in 1978 when she was working as a waitress at a celebrity sporting event. Count 1: Assaulting autograph-hunter, aged seven or eight, in the 1960s - Nine months . Count 2: Assaulting a teenage waitress in the 1970s - Six months . Count 3: Assaulting a childhood friend of Harris's daughter between the ages of 13 and 19 - 15 months . Count 4: Same victim as count 3 - 15 months . Count 5: Same victim as count 3 - 15 months . Count 6: Same victim as count 3 - 12 months . Count 7: Same victim as count 3 - 15 months . Count 8: Same victim as count 3 - 12 months . Count 9: Same victim as count 3 - 12 months . Count 10: Assaulting Australian woman Tonya Lee, who was 15, in 1986 - Nine months . Count 11: Same victim as count 10 - Nine months . Count 12: Same victim as count 10 - 12 months . 'He knows in his heart of hearts that he did these things,' she told ITV News. 'I would have liked him to hold up his hand and say ""fair cop, I have done these things"". 'It would have been a lot braver but he's a nasty man who took advantage of his position, exploited that to the very utmost, so perhaps we shouldn't be surprised.' The man leading the child sex abuse royal commission in Australia says Harris's conviction in London is likely to encourage more victims to come forward. Justice Peter McClellan, who chairs the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse, believes victims who have suffered in silence for years are finally opening up thanks to high-profile court cases, inquiries and public condemnation of historical abuse. 'It is becoming apparent as we do our work that, as the issue of abuse is raised and talked about, survivors increasingly feel able to bring their own story to the authorities,' Justice McClellan said. 'That which may have been kept secret for years may now be told. The burden of guilt and shame which many have felt is lifted by knowing that others who have suffered have overcome their reticence.' Before sentencing, Harris's barrister pleaded for leniency due to the fact he was 84. 'He is already on borrowed time,' Sonia Woodley QC told the court. 'Every day, every month in prison is going to shorten his life.' But Justice McClellan said survivors who suffered at Harris's hands would want him punished notwithstanding his age. 'They have suffered and, in their minds, so must he.' Harris's sentence on Friday was immediately referred to UK Attorney-General Dominic Grieve under the 'unduly lenient sentence scheme'. The attorney-general now has a month to decide whether to send the case to the Court of Appeal which could increase the length of the Australian's imprisonment.","Sexual assault victim Sarah Monahan - of Hey Dad! fame - hit out at the sentence .

"By . Emily Crane . and Aap . A young mother-of-four was brutally tortured before she was murdered and left to rot in a shallow bushland grave north of Brisbane. Police say 28-year-old Tia Maria Landers - dubbed one half of a Bonnie and Clyde couple -  suffered a violent death, but have not revealed exactly what killed her. She had been missing for a month. A post-mortem examination is being carried out after her body was found in a state forest at Beerburrum, north of Brisbane, on Thursday. Brisbane couple John Edward Harris, 42, and Linda Eileen Appleton, 40, who were known to Ms Landers, have been charged with torturing and murdering her and will spend at least the next six months behind bars after they were remanded in custody during a court mention on Friday. Ms Landers' 19-year-old sister is desperate for answers after police alleged the couple tortured her sister at their home north of Brisbane before killing her. Scroll down for video . The body of Tia Landers was found following a search of state forest at Beerburrum, south of the Sunshine Coast, after she was reported missing on June 19 . The couple did not appear in the Redcliffe Magistrates Court, where the matter was adjourned until January 12. Police say Ms Landers went willingly to the couple's home at Brighton, north of Brisbane. Officers who've combed the property say there are signs she was brutally tortured there, but they have not revealed the nature of her injuries or the cause of her death. 'There's evidence that there has been violence at Newport Street,' Detective Acting Superintendent Damien Hansen told reporters. 'The offenders have been charged with torture.' Jamie Landers, 19, was at the court on Friday and said her family want to find out why Ms Landers was killed. 'We want to know why. Tia's done a lot of bad stuff in her life, we all know that (but) it's not to be held against her,' she told reporters outside the court. 'She is a mother of four children, her youngest daughter is three years old, her oldest son is 10. They are struggling.' The mother of four had been missing for a month before her body was found . Ms Landers' boyfriend Wade Bartz was a gang member who is currently in jail . Writing on Facebook on Thursday, she also said: 'How can someone take someone else's life? Like seriously you don't realise you don't just take the life of one person but you take a part of each of their family members! 'I promise Tia Jayne Landers to take care of your 4 beautiful children and make sure they have the best of everything! No one will ever hurt them!' A friend of the slain woman has told ABC radio she was a loving mother. 'I've known her for eight years, she was there for me always, ups, downs,' Angela Dicker said. 'Loving mother, loving daughter, loves her parents, loves her family.' Ms Landers was in a relationship with Wade Bartz, a notorious prison gangster and member of the jailhouse 'Angry Gang', the Courier Mail reports. She was last seen at midday on June 16 in the Redcliffe and Deception Bay area when CCTV cameras recorded her walking into a petrol station. Police held grave fears for her safety after it was revealed she suffered from a medical condition, believed to be schizophrenia. They spent almost three weeks looking for her before they made the grisly discovery. After her body was found, Ms Landers' sister wrote on Facebook: 'Rest in peace my beautiful sister' Ms Landers was previously accused of being involved in a violent home robbery . A month before Ms Landers was last seen, she failed to appear in court as Mr Bartz's co-accused in a violent home robbery. The case was heard in the Supreme Court but charges against Mr Bartz were dropped after a witness identified his photo on Ms Landers’ Facebook page. In May, Mr Bartz posted a photo of Tia on his Facebook profile with the caption: 'My world stops spinning when your not around.' But on her own profile she listed herself as in a 'complicated relationship'. Her family had set up a Facebook campaign to appeal for public help in finding Ms Landers and her disappearance is believed to be unrelated to Mr Bartz, who is currently behind bars. 'Rest in peace my beautiful sister,' Ms Landers' sister wrote on the Facebook page on Thursday. 'I promise Tia Jayne Landers to take care of your 4 beautiful children and make sure they have the best of everything! No one will ever hurt them.' Supt Hansen said Ms Landers was no stranger to the couple charged with her murder. 'She's an associate of theirs. They're known to each other, have been known to each other for some time,' he said. He said police had put Ms Landers in the high risk category after she went missing.

"By . Louise Cheer . and Aap . The Victorian Government will be forced to hand over $451 million in compensation to gambling giant Tatts for lost poker machine revenue. Tatts Group Limited took court action against the government in 2012 - seeking at least $490 million - after it and Tabcorp were stripped of their duopoly of the operation of poker machines outside Melbourne's Crown Casino. Individual clubs and pubs now operate poker machines in the state. But Tabcorp's bid for an even heftier payout - $686 million - was rejected by the Victorian Supreme Court on Thursday. Tatts Group Limited and Tabcorp took court action against the Victorian Government after they lost their duopoly of operating poker machines outside of Melbourne's Crown Casino (pictured) The ABC reported the lawyers for Tabcorp said some of the money it had paid for its gambling licence should have been refunded after the John Brumby-led government introduced the reforms in 2008. Tabcorp argued it had a right to compensation as a law introduced by the government - after the privatisation of the Victorian TAB and listed Tabcorp on the share market in 1994 - guaranteed it a payment when its 18-year licence expired. But lawyers for the government said awarding new licences in 2008 and 2009 did not trigger a terminal payment provision in the contract with Tabcorp. On the other hand, Tatts' claim was seeking compensation after the expiration of its gaming operator's licence under an agreement made in 1995. Legislation introduced by the Victorian Government in 2008 meant individual pubs and clubs now run poker machines . Tatts were the only ones to walk away triumphant and will get $451 million in compensation from the government . 'In the context of the clear purpose of the terminal payment provision, the court noted the unfairness of this result, but concluded that the statutory language was too strict to allow the alternative interpretation contended for by Tabcorp,' Justice Hargrave said. In a statement, Victorian Treasurer Michael O'Brien said the government would appear the Supreme Court ruling . Justice Hargrave said changes to the Gambling Regulation Act made in 2009 did not override Tatts' entitlement to a payout. He ordered the government to pay the gambling giant $451 million plus interest. Premier Napthine said today the government would appeal the Tatts decision. With the state election just five months away, Dr Napthine said the government would not cut spending or raise taxes to cover the cost of the payout. 'We have a budget surplus this year of over $1 billion, so we can absorb this loss and we will not be increasing taxes. 'We will not be cutting services as a result of this. Tatts and rival Tabcorp lost their duopoly over the operation of poker machines outside of Melbourne's Crown casino in August 2012, following a decision in 2009 by the previous Labor government, with poker machines in Victoria now operated by clubs and pubs. 'The Labor Party ought to apologise to the people of Victoria for their mismanagement of this process,"" he told Fairfax radio on Friday.","Tatts and Tapcorp took court action on the government in 2012 .

"By . Freya Noble . and Aap . Northern Territory politician Larisa Lee has avoided jail after pleading guilty to assaulting her niece for having an affair with her partner. Lee, 31, faced the Katherine Magistrates Court on Tuesday, having told reporters as she arrived that she felt 'It will all come to an end, finally... it will be a good outcome'. She pleaded guilty to common assault and disorderly conduct charges. Scroll down for video . Palmer United Part member for the Northern Territory Larisa Lee has been found guilty of common assault after she attacked her niece . The court heard that on April 24, the Palmer United Party MLA found out her niece Sherese Dooley, 18, was having an affair with her partner, Benjamin Ulamari, after finding photos on his phone. She tracked her niece to the Katherine Centrelink and called her outside to discuss the affair, before assaulting her. 'Instead of talking through the issues, you responded in a different way,' Magistrate Elisabeth Armitage said. 'You got out of the car when you saw her, you went up to her, grabbed her by the hair and dragged her across a concrete driveway. 'You didn't stop there, but then proceeded to punch her a number of times to the head with a closed fist. You swore at her and threatened her.' Ms Dooley escaped the assault with a cut to her knee and many people witnessed the incident. Lee's lawyer Ron Hope said her 'emotions boiled over' and that she had been 'totally humiliated' by the events leading up to the assault, known of by all in the small Katherine community. The MP faced the Katherine Magistrate's Court on Tuesday and was fined $300 and given a good behaviour bond of $1000 . But Lee was not seeking special treatment due to her role in public life, he said. Ms Armitage said Ms Dooley was also humiliated by the attack, and had filed a domestic violence order against Lee. 'Jealousy is not an extenuating circumstance,' she said, but noted Lee was unlikely to ever commit such an offence again, had no prior criminal history and had contributed significantly to the community. Lee was convicted of common assault and received a $1000 good behaviour bond, with no jail time to be served. She received no conviction for the charge of disorderly conduct, but received a $300 fine along with $300 to be paid as a victims' levy. Lee will retain her seat of Arnhem, which she won in 2012, she told reporters outside court. 'As individuals we all go through experiences that we have to overcome, it's either going to make us or break us. This situation actually made me,' she said. Lee will retain her seat of Arnhem as a member of Clive Palmer's party despite the incident . 'I'm a person, at the end of the day. Betrayal is something nobody wants to face; nobody wants to go home and find their niece in bed with their partner. 'I'm going to move forward from this and I look forward to my job, I look forward to representing my electorate and doing the best I can.' She apologised to the public for her actions, saying domestic violence was never acceptable. 'People need to control their emotions better; I shouldn't have done what I've done. I'm very sorry to the public and the people of Katherine for that matter, and it will never happen again.' The controversial politician made headlines in March and April when she and fellow Aboriginal backbenchers Alison Anderson and Francis Xavier Kurrupuwu resigned from the Country Liberals government amid claims of racism and broken promises to the bush. Clive Palmer announced the three had joined his party just days after Ms Lee's arrest.","Larisa Lee pleaded guilty to assaulting her 18-year-old niece .

One man was killed after being ejected from the vehicle and police saw two men fleeing into dense bush, Nine News reports. Police arrested a 27-year-old Sunbury woman at the scene and she is under police guard at Royal Melbourne Hospital. 'The fact they left their friends, one dead and one injured, and fled off into the bush probably speaks volumes about their character,' Assistant Commissioner Jack Blayney said of the two men who fled.

The four people took off in a sedan and police gave chase but a short time later, officers found the car had rolled on a nearby bend . A Sunbury man, 30, was later arrested on a roadside at nearby Gisborne about 9.45am on Saturday. He had minor injuries and remains in police custody. But police were still looking for the second man until Saturday evening when a 32-year-old from Diggers Rest showed up at Gisborne Police Station. He was being held for questioning. Investigators believe the car lost control in wet conditions and clipped a tree. 'If the police are indicating to people that they should pull over, they should pull over. It's not worth risking your life, the life of your friends, the life of innocent members of the public and also the lives of police officers for such trivial matters,' Blayney said.

"By . Louise Cheer . and Aap . Peter Zervas, pictured in 2009, had half of his nose bitten off in an attack at his Leichhardt home on Tuesday . The man accused of biting off the nose of a former Hells Angel bikie was refused bail because he might return to 'finish the job' and is at risk of a revenge attack. Nicholas Harafias, 28, appeared in Burwood Local Court on Friday charged with affray and causing grievous bodily harm with intent. It is alleged the Hurlstone Park man savagely assaulted Peter Zervas outside his Leichhardt unit building in Sydney's inner west on Tuesday. The attack took place after Mr Zervas answered an intercom call. The 37-year-old then had to pick the tip of his nose off the ground, drive to the hospital and have it surgically reattached. Harafias was arrested by police near his Hurlstone Park home on Thursday. His application for bail was refused, with the prosecution arguing the 28-year-old would return to Mr Zervas's home or work place to 'finish the assault'. But in court documents, police also said Harafias himself would be at risk if he was released because Mr Zervas may still have strong connections with the Hells Angels. 'The prosecution have serious fears of a reprisal attack on the accused due to the recent and possibly current active senior involvement of the victim with the outlaw motorcycle gang Hells Angels,' the papers said. Prosecutors did not reveal why the violent confrontation had occurred, but the court heard Harafias told police 'he [Zervas] deserved it'. Scroll down for video . Mr Zervas (pictured, centre, arriving at court in 2010) is the brother of Hells Angels bikie Anthony Zervas who was killed at Sydney Airport in 2009 . Harafis donned a black T-shirt and sat expressionless in the prisoner's dock, while his lawyers said if he was released on bail he would live with his mother in Hurlstone Park, obey curfew conditions and would not approach Mr Zervas. It comes just days after the man accused of killing Mr Zervas' brother, Mahmoud Hawi (pictured) was granted bail. There is no suggestion the two incidents are connected . But Magistrate Margaret Quinn sided with the prosecution, agreeing the measures would not be enough to reduce the risk Harafias posed to both the community and Mr Zervas. 'They would not be sufficient, in my view, to mitigate those risks,' she said. Ms Quinn noted even though Mr Zervas had not co-operated with police, the evidence against Harafias was strong. The court heard the self-employed gym instructor had been captured on CCTV arriving at the Leichhardt residence and leaving covered in blood. A search of Harafias's home found bloodied clothing and mobile phone data that allegedly incriminated him. The attack on Mr Zervas came just days after his brother's alleged killer, Mahmoud 'Mick' Hawi, was granted bail. There is no suggestion the two incidents are connected. Mr Zervas' brother, Anthony Zervas, was bashed to death when the Hells Angels and Comancheros clashed at Sydney's domestic airport in 2009. Days after the killing, Peter Zervas was shot six times outside his mother's home in Sydney's west but survived. Harafias will return to court on Monday.

"By . Sara Nathan . They have made no secret of their growing love after spending the past few months jet setting around the world together. And one of Michelle Rodriguez's closest confidants has revealed she is so in love with British supermodel Cara Delevingne that she believes she is 'the one' - and wants to start a family with her. In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, the friend of the Fast and Furious . star - who has asked to remain unnamed - reveals how Michelle, 35, is so besotted by Cara, 21, that she . has already told pals she would love a baby with her. But while the actress is planning her future with Cara - who is 14 years younger than her - we can reveal the Mulberry model’s family is terrified of the influence the wayward star is having on the top model who has become the toast of the fashion industry. Scroll down for videos . Inseparable: Before jetting to Italy Cara, 21, and 35-year-old Michelle were seen out on the town in London . The start of something: Model Cara Delevingne shared a kiss . with openly bisexual actress Michelle Rodriguez as they sat courtside at the . New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden in January. Baring all: Michelle Rodriguez shared a photo on Instagram on Tuesday which showed her stark naked while meditating . The . source, who Michelle regularly confides in, said: 'Michelle comes from . a broken home and it has a lot to do with why she has found herself in . trouble again and again throughout her life. 'Constantly, . she pushes boundaries and has been in trouble with the law, but really . all of it is because she is desperate to be loved. 'Her mom and dad separated when she was a child and ever since Michelle has been yearning for some stability in her life. 'Sadly after years of dating older women and men like Olivier Martinez, nothing seemed to work out for her. 'But now Cara has come along, who is so much younger than the women she normally dates, but suddenly Michelle is happy again.' In . recent years, former Lost star Michelle, who openly admits she is bisexual, has endured a string of broken relationships after dating French heartthrob and S.W.A.T co-star Olivier Martinez, Fast and Furious co-star Vin Diesel as well as model Claudette Lali, director Francesca De Sola and . model Aleksandra Rastovic. The source claims Michelle had a 'great thing' going with Terminator 3 actress Kristanna Loken - who strongly hinted to Advocate magazine that she was in a relationship with her in 2006, yet Michelle has never confirmed their relationship. 'Kristanna wanted to come out as a couple. She's proud to be bisexual, but Michelle wasn't ready to go public,' said the friend: 'So instead of working it out, Michelle ended it. Smitten: Michelle was linked with Terminator 3 actress Kristanna Loken, who hinted the couple were in a relationship in 2006 . Ex-lovers: Michelle Rodriguez iis said to have dated flimmaker Francesca de Sola. The pair are pictured at the screening of Francesca's film 1%ers in New York in April 2013 . 'Then she was left heartbroken a year later when she fell for another model/actress only to find out she had slept with someone else while she was away filming the movie Avatar.' The actress has also found herself behind bars after being in trouble repeatedly with the . law. In March 2002, she was . charged with assault and harassment when her girlfriend, Louise Ward, . claimed the tough girl had attacked her in their New Jersey apartment. Ward was left battered and bruised, but later dropped all charges against Michelle. The friend said: 'Michelle can be intense and dive head first into . romances. This can land her in hot water as she found out with Louise. 'Over the last 15-years there have been countless other examples of her disastrous love life.' Just one year later Michelle found herself in trouble again when she . appeared in court to face eight misdemeanor charges relating to two . driving incidents, including a DUI and a hit and run. In . 2004, she pleaded no contest to three of the charges, hit and run, . drunken driving and driving with a suspended license and went to jail . for 48 hours and was placed on probation for three years. And in 2005, while filming ABC hit Lost in Hawaii, the stunning brunette was fined multiple times for speeding. Later . that year on December 1st she was arrested for drunk driving, to which . she pleaded guilty and paid a $500 fine and spent five days in jail. Due . to this being a clear violation of her earlier drunk driving crimes, . she was also sentenced to 60 days in jail, but due to overcrowding was . released on the same day she entered. And it's precisely this behavior that has left Cara's family a little fearful. Michelle's close friend admitted: 'She's a very free spirit and before this relationship she has always been terrified of commitment. “And because of her troubled past, many of them have essentially had to be her babysitter or a mother figure to her. 'So now Cara might be younger than her, but she honestly thinks this is 'the one'. Just before she met Cara she was talking about wanting a family within the next couple of years. Lovers? Michelle Rodriguez reportedly dated Vin Diesel, her Fast and Furious co-star. The pair pose at the premiere of Fast and Furious 6 in Seoul, South Korea, in May 2013 . Ex-love: Michelle Rodriguez was also said to have dated her S.W.A.T co-star Olivier Martinez. The actor is now married to Halle Berry . 'She . really wants a baby and wants one soon and now she has found Cara she . thinks this could finally be the time to chase that dream. 'Sadly due to Michelle’s troubled past, Cara’s family are not so sure.They are not 100 per cent pro this relationship and are in some ways willing it to end. 'The 14-year age gap between the girls concerns them as does Michelle's wayward reputation. 'They . know Cara has been swept off her feet by Michelle, who has dropped . everything to be with her young love, but the family fear the . relationship will end in nothing but disaster. 'I highly doubt at 21-years-old Cara is ready to start a family. She is no doubt currently smitten with Michelle, who dropped everything, including her girlfriend and friends, to be with her. 'But . if anyone is going to get their heart broken in this relationship it's . going to be Michelle. She will smother Cara, and wants to be around her . 24 hours a day.' The couple, who apparently met in . January, were also seen attending Prince's secret gig at Ronnie Scott's . club on Monday, February 17, and the Elle Style Awards the following . evening before heading to Milan to . close the autumn/winter fashion season. They then hired a private jet last week to head to Milan Fashion Week, where Cara had a busy schedule. The pair were spotted in coordinating black outfits while carrying bags as they made their way to their airplane - while the Brit beauty's parents were also along for the trip. After landing in Milan, Michelle sat with her love as she sat in hair and makeup backstage at the Fendi autumn/winter 2014 fashion show. They then flew back to London and are now believed to be on vacation. Supportive: The Fast And Furious star hung out with her model squeeze backstage at Milan Fashion Week . Romantic getaway: It seems Michelle's girlfriend Cara Delevingne might be on the Thailand holiday too as that same day she shared a photo of herself wearing scuba diving gear while in a tropical location . Sexy couple: Michelle's post came days after Cara shared this snapshot . Michelle spoke openly about her sexuality in October after years of speculation, telling Entertainment Weekly, 'I've never walked the carpet with anyone, so they wonder: What does she do with her vagina?"" Plus, I play a butchy girl all the time, so they assume I'm a lesbo.' Asked about the assumptions, she admitted: 'Eh, they're not too far off. I've gone both ways. I do as I please. I am too f--king curious to sit here and not try when I can. Men are intriguing. So are chicks.' This week, Michelle posted a picture of herself naked, revealing her bare derriere to the world as she appeared to be meditating. She was seen lapping up the sunshine in Thailand, where she is . currently enjoying a getaway, and the snapshot also showed a stunning . ocean view. And it is likely that the photo was taken by Cara, as that same day the model shared a picture of herself clad . in scuba diving gear in an equally tropical location. Michelle’s snap comes just days after her model squeeze shared her own extremely sexy picture on the social networking site. The source added: 'You can see from the photos of them out together in London that they are clearly having fun. 'They . don't seem to have a care in the world and I know Michelle will pay for . everything, go everywhere with her and has unlimited funds to do as . they please. 'To begin with . this will be nice and she will be flattered. But when she has to go . away to shoot a film, it will end and Michelle does fall hard. 'And maybe it will all be a little too much for someone as young as Cara.' Turning heads: Michelle attended the BAFTAs in London earlier this month in a silk and leather plunging gown .

She's always insisted, however, that it was David Jones she fell in love with, not Bowie - the stage name he later adopted. Supermodel: Iman, now 58, at a premier in New York in 2013. The model and philanthropist says she will never stop working or forget her Somalian roots . So in love: David Bowie, left, and Iman, right at a charity dinner in New York, 2011 . The two met in New York at the peak of Iman's modelling career, which kicked off with a Vogue assignment in 1976, just one year after she was spotted on a street in Nairobi in Africa. She was 20-years-old, studying political science and living as a Somali refugee in Kenya, when American photographer Peter Beard approached her. According to The Observer magazine, he asked to photograph her and she said the . privilege would cost him $8,000 - the entire amount of her university . fees. 'My mother said if you didn't know exactly what you wanted you weren't worth it, so ask for everything,' Iman tells Carole Cadwalladr of the magazine. True love: Iman and David Bowie, pictured here at t he MET Ball in 2005, have been married for 22 years, a lifetime in the showbiz world . Stunning: Iman in her modelling days. She was spotted at 20-years-old in Kenya and landed her first assignment, for Vogue, in 1976 just a year later . Iman soon moved to New York where her career took off. Over the next 14 years she modelled for  Halston, Gianni Versace, Calvin Klein, Issey Miyake, Donna Karan, Thierry Mulger and Yves Saint-Laurent, whom she became a muse for. She also worked with notable photographers including Helmut Newton, Richard Avedon and Annie Leibovitz and was the first black woman to front U.S. cosmetic giant Revlon. The race card, she says, was never an issue until people in America made it one. An editor famously thought she was complimenting Iman when telling her she looked like a, 'white woman dipped in chocolate.' Says Iman: 'I wasn't a major in political science for nothing, so I understood the politics of beauty and race when it comes to the fashion industry.' It was during her modelling high in New York where she met David, though at the time he was living in Switzerland. The couple moved there briefly before heading back to the States and marrying in 1992. Calwalk: Iman walks for Thierry Mugler in 1990. The Somalia-born model was known as the first black supermodel and had a remarkable 14-year career before she focused her attentions on other projects . 'I did not want to get involved with a rock star, no way,' she told the Express in 2011. 'It is not a sane thing to do but David changed my mind. He wooed me.' The couple have a daughter, Alexandria, or 'Lexi,' who is 13, though Iman had her first daughter, Zulekha, when she was 23, with her then-husband, American basketball player Spencer Haywood. She may have retried from modelling 24 years ago, but Iman isn't about to slow down just yet. Her ethnic cosmetics company, Iman Cosmetics, is worth $25m (£15m) and her charitable endeavours are seemingly endless: she's currently working with Nobel Peace Prize nominee Dr Hawa Abdi on a foundation that supports and helps people in Somalia. And she's been a keen supporter for Save The Children, Children's Defense Fund and Keep a Child Alive. 'I like working,' Iman tells the Observer. 'What's the other option, sitting at home eating bonbons?'","Iman Mohmaed Hussei, 58, was the first black model to front Revlon .

"By . Scarlett Russell . Much like Katherine Heigl's character in the film 27 dresses, Sherry Kettner, 31, from Arkansas, U.S. is the serial bridesmaid who is still waiting to find a husband of her own. Sherry has experienced a total of 13 hen dos, sets of wedding pictures and rounds of speeches and  still gets excited every time she gets an invite. Her serial role has seen her walk up the aisle on the arm of people aged eight to 80 in churches, fields and town halls for the big days of her closest friends. Big day: Sherry Kettner (L) at her friends Heathers wedding (R). Sherry has been bridesmaid at 13 weddings but is still looking for a love of her own . Party gal: Sherry attends a party wearing the bridesmaid dress she wore to her sister Kayla's wedding . Film star: Katherine Heigl as Jane in the 2008 film 27 Dresses, where she, like real life Sherry, was always the bridesmaid but never the bride . Sherry was first called upon for bridesmaid duty when she was 18 and did the honours for three high school friends; Camille, Bekah and Amanda. After . she graduated university in 2007 she was asked to walk down the aisle . ahead of two friends Emily and Arlene and her two sisters Ericka and . Kayla. And . since 2008 she’s been a bridesmaid six more times in as many years for . friends, her college roommate, and a fellow blogger for a lifestyle . website she contributes to. While Sherry, who works with adults with special needs for the Barnabas . Foundation,  has never been a bride herself, she’s still hoping her big day will come. Happy: Sherry, top right, as a bridesmaid at her friend Emily's wedding. Sherry has been to 13 hen dos, been in 13 sets of pictures and sat through 13 sets of speeches . Never the bride: Sherry, left, walks down the aisle at the wedding of her friend Lauren. Katherine Heigl played a fictional character Jane, right, in 27 Dresses who was a bridesmaid numerous times but remained single . She was engaged four and a half years ago and since the relationship ended she has remained single, but she says she’ll never get bored of supporting people on their . big day, as well as the rest of their marriage. 'I’ve been a bridesmaid so many times but the buzz is still the same when I’m asked,' she says. 'It’s such an honour to be invited to be part of someone’s wedding that I can’t help but say yes. 'Although it’s common for people to get married quite young where I live, I haven’t lost hope. 'I definitely want to get married and have children one day. 'Until then I just feel so blessed to have been part of so many special days!' Congratulations! Sherry (2nd L) at her friend Heather's wedding. 'I've been a bridesmaid so many times but the buzz is still the same when I'm asked,' she says . Sitting pretty: Sherry (Back R) at her friend Jules' wedding. Since she was 18 Sherry, now 31, has been a bridesmaid 13 times . Amongst . the traditional white dress church weddings, Sherry as worn a black . gown, carried a parasol instead of flowers and boogied the night away at . a 1980s themed rehearsal dinner. At one wedding the bridal party even pulled James Bond poses at the altar. Unsurprisingly, the odd dress-disaster inevitably cropped up during two of the 13 nuptials. One . bride tried to be kind by picking a value-for-money dress that suited . four bridesmaids, but with its grey-green tinge and high necked . Victorian-style collar that reached Sherry’s ears, it ended up far from flattering. At her own sister’s wedding, a suspect seamstress in charge of alterations did such a bad job, the perfect dresses that had been handmade for each bridesmaid ended up sticking out in all the wrong places. These aside, Sherry has lovingly hung onto six of the dresses - and even wears them for parties now. Sister love: Sherry (L) at her sister Kayla's wedding. Hopeful Sherry says: 'I feel so blessed to have been part of so many special days' Rock n roll: Sherry (Back L) at her friend Alicia's wedding. Since 2008 she's been a bridesmaid six times for friends, her college roommate, and a fellow blogger for a lifestyle website she contributes to . Blushing bridesmaid: Sherry (2nd R) at Gracie's wedding. In the 13 weddings she has been bridesmaid for, Sherry has worn a black gown, carried a parasol instead of flowers and boogied the night away at a 1980s themed rehearsal dinne . Jumping for joy: Sherry (2nd L) at Gracie's wedding. 'It's such an honour to be invited to be part of someone's wedding that I can't help but say yes,' she says . But unlike Katherine Heigl in the 2008 film, she’s never had to dash between two weddings in one evening - or been forced to plan the wedding of her crush to someone else. 'As much as I love that film I’m not sure about all the things [Katherine's character Jane] does,' says Sherry. 'Unlike Jane I’ve been really good friends of all the people I’ve been a bridesmaid for. They’ve wanted me to support them in their marriage, not just organise their big day! 'All the weddings I’ve been in have been about the people not just a big white dress and a cake. 'I love weddings, they’re great to meet people and bring people together, but if it’s just about the party then it loses the attraction for me. 'It has to be about celebrating lasting love.' She adds: 'I really have been very fortunate with the dresses - there’s only been one that was a bit of a shocker. And in hindsight even that wasn’t so bad. 'I’ve even managed to get some wear out of them again.'","Sherry Kettner, 31, from Arkansas has been a bridesmaid 13 times .

"By . Scarlett Russell . When pictures emerged of Helen Mirren on holiday in Italy sporting a red bikini, the reaction was sensational. At 63, she had a healthy toned figure many 30 year-old women could only dream of. And it would seem the impact is still going strong six years later, as JD Williams has seen a massive surge in the swimming style in their over-50s customers. Influential: Dame Helen Mirren was 63 when this photo was taken in Pelugia, Italy in 2008. It's impact is still going strong: JD Williams have reported an 230 per cent surge in bikini sales from their over 50s customers . The women’s retailers has announced a . growth of +227 per cent year on year in bikini sets, driven by their . costumer base who, ironically, were born around the time of the . two-piece’s invention in 1946. Separates are selling especially . well, in particular the high-waist brief. So strong is the trend that . swimwear buyers have dubbed the skimpy beachwear the ‘Grankini’. And it’s not just Mirren who can rock a two-piece over the age of 50. Gorgeous: Demi Moore, 51, rocks a black bikini and looks sensational. No wonder more and more women over the age of 50 are embracing the bikini . Never looked better! Sharon Stone, left, and Kathy Griffin, right, both look incredible in their bikinis . Celebrities such as Demi Moore, Kathy . Griffin, Sharon Stone, Jerry Hall, Sheryl Crow and Denise Welch have all . given their younger counterparts a run for their money over recent years , looking fabulous in bikinis. Rachael Antal, Swimwear Buyer at JD Williams says: ‘Historically, when British women hit fifty there is a noticeable shift in their body confidence which generally means sales of one-pieces soar and bikini sales deplete. Swimwear: The Magisculpt body-sculpting bikini top, £25, left and Cleo Plunge Bikini top, £31, by JD Williams . ‘Now, celebrities around the world are embracing their shape and looking fabulous in the two-piece. 'Wearing . a supportive, well-proportioned bikini is less aging and accentuates . rather than hides natural shape. 'Advances in swimwear design mean . that we can now create bikinis that flatter a mature shape.

Women . over 50 are responsible for £6.7 billion of British fashion spend and . much of this is apportioned to the summer wardrobe, according to JD Williams research. Psychologist Rachel . MacLynn comments: 'By 2050 the . over 50s will account for two billion of the population. Amazing figure: Singer Sheryl Crow shows off her incredible bikini body in 2010 on holiday at Atlantis Paradise Island in the Bahamas . 50s ladies: Bikini-clad Denise Welch in, left, looks great whilst Jerry Hall, right, is toned and trim . 'The term ‘flat age society’ has been applied to this constantly expanding market who manage the ageing process in a way our predecessors did not. 'There are no rules to say when a woman should retire her bikini. Women over fifty are as interested in looking glamorous as their younger counterparts; and the beach is no exception. 'Traditional age barriers no longer exist - meaning that customers of all ages are confident about fashion.' With over 140 year’s expertise in fit and fashion, JD Williams, part of the N Brown Group, caters for three million customers.

"By . Scarlett Russell . They say opposites attract, but that doesn’t seem to be the case for beauty pageant winners Ruby Bowater and Jordan Williams, who are arguably the best-looking couple in Britain. Ruby, 19, from Dudley, is Miss West Midlands and has been dating Mr England Jordan, 26, from Nuneaton, Warks, for five months. The genetically-blessed pair now hope to develop their modelling careers as a 'power couple'. Hey good looking! Couple Ruby Bowater, right, and Jordan Williams, left, are both winners of beauty pageants . Is this the UK's best-looking couple? Stunning Miss West Midlands Ruby Bowater, 19, from Dudley, has been dating Mr England, Jordan Williams, 26, from Nuneaton, Warks, for five months . Size six Ruby, who works for MAC Cosmetics, is vying for a place in the Miss England competition so she can stand alongside her man. However Ruby says she was wary of dating the hunk at first. ‘When I first met Jordan last year it was on the pageant circuit and he was always trying to have banter and chat to me, but I was wary because I thought he might have been a bit of player,’ she says. 'There are always lots of stunning girls around the Miss England events and I thought he might have had a wandering eye. ‘But I kept bumping into him and he asked me go for dinner, so I decided to take a chance on him and we went out for food and got on really well. Beauty brand: 'It would be so nice to be the first Miss and Mr England that are a couple,' says Ruby, right, of her boyfriend Jordan, left. It would make us the ultimate power couple' Sweet couple: Jordan, left, who works as a Michael Buble tribute act, said of his girlfriend Ruby: 'I have never been much of a relationship man, but with Ruby it is different' 'It’s so nice that he understands what it is like to be in the paegent world. ‘I was a bit worried what some of the other contestants would think when they heard me and Jordan were a couple, but everyone has been really supportive.’ Their love affair blossomed from their first date and a week later Ruby agreed to accompany Jordan on a trip to London where, like the doting girlfriend that she is, held his hand while he had his teeth whitened. Jordan, who works as a Michael Buble tribute act, said: ‘I have never been much of a relationship man, but with Ruby it is different. ‘We just get on so well and she completely understands what I have to do. ‘We support each other and would love to work together in the future - it would be great to be as big as Posh and Becks.’ Ruby adds: ‘I don’t get jealous and he is really good too because he understands exactly what it’s like. ‘It would be so nice to be the first Miss and Mr England that are a couple. It would make us the ultimate power couple.’","Ruby Bowater, 19, from Dudley is Miss West Midlands .

Modelling agencies Bizzykidz, Adora Models and Talent Management all couldn’t wait to sign her up. Jasmine will also be appearing in the Grand Final of Miss Junior Teen Great Britain competition in August. Her mother Rachel, 43, said: ‘Jasmine used to get called all sorts of names such as anorexic because she is tiny, due to exercising five times a week because of her commitment to sport. ‘She was bullied a lot last year and she ended up having to change schools.

She added: ‘I don't want her to get too involved with fake tanning and overdoing the make-up as I don't think any girl needs at that age needs to wear it. ‘She is such a natural beauty, a very pretty girl, and is really good at modelling. I can’t wait to see her up on that stage. ‘She's just really excited for the final now. And I couldn't be more proud.

"By . Scarlett Russell . Are you on your third diet of the year? Are your kitchen cupboards filled with low calorie, low taste foods? Is your sexy gym kit gathering dust in the corner? If so then you are not alone. Britain's yo-yo dieters will not only try 15 different weight loss plans over 30 years but, they'll spend £105,000 trying and failing to shape up as well. A new survey has revealed that 60 per cent of yo-yo dieters will try 10-20 diets in a lifetime. The 30-year sum of £105,000 breaks down to £3,500 a year or £30 a week on trying to lose weight. Yo-yo dieters will spend £105,000 trying to lose weight over a lifetime . These dieters will spend £1,500 a year on fitness classes, . gym gear and memberships to try and slim down. The remaining £2,000 will be spent on branded diet plans, including programme fees, fad foods and diet supplements. The poll was published by the team behind new book The IntoTrim Plan: How to Keep the Weight . off Forever. Author . and dieting expert Natasha Hurst said: 'We all know that yo-yo dieting is bad for . your health, but it appears from this study that it can and does have a . disastrous effect on your wallet, too. The IntoTrim Plan by nutritionist Natasha Hurst . 'The . reality is that diets can be hit and miss, but when they do work, . slimmers often lack the knowledge to succeed at maintaining their weight . loss. 'Once . you’ve achieved your target weight there’s usually little support and . advice for maintaining that slimmer figure and it’s no wonder many women . get trapped in an endless cycle of yo-yo dieting. 'For . most people, however, maintaining that weight loss once they do reach . their goal weight can actually be achieved from a balanced diet alone . and needn’t cost the earth.' Dieters admitted to feeling trapped in an 'endless cycle' of yo-yo dieting, in search of the perfect way to lose weight. The annual spend was aimed at losing an average target of 24lbs. The women polled were also found to buy . new clothes and pamper themselves with beauty regimes to, 'showcase my . new, fitter body.' Ms Hurst, added: 'It is clear from the cross-section of women we surveyed that dieting plays an integral role to many women’s lives. '95 per cent of the women we questioned conceded that they would spend 30 years on some sort of weight loss scheme or another. 'Given the sacrifices they make throughout their lives continually dieting, along with the money they spent repeatedly losing weight, I think it’s safe to say that this is not good value for money. 'It’s far, far cheaper - and much more effective - to take a little time to address bad habits and learn how to eat not just for a diet, but for a lifetime.'","British yo-yo dieters will try 15 different weight-loss plans in their lives .

"By . Scarlett Russell . A breast cancer sufferer who has decided to devote the remainder of her life to making wedding dreams come true for others who, like her, are terminally ill, has released her autobiography on the day of her second wedding anniversary. Naomi Thomas, 31, from Somerset, who suffers from secondary breast cancer, won the Daily Mail’s Inspirational Woman of the Year Award last November in recognition of the charity she set up, The Wedding Wishing Well Foundation. She was then approached by Harper Collins to write an electronic book about her incredible life. No Ordinary Wedding Planner was published on Friday June 6, as she and husband Graham renewed their vows. So in love: Naomi, left, and her husband Graham, right, renewed their wedding vows, two years after getting married, on their second anniversary last Friday. Naomi has terminal cancer and says she, 'doesn't know how much time I have left' Graham, left, and wife Naomi, right, with their three-year-old son Devon, centre, pictured on their second wedding anniversary on Friday, when Graham and Naomi renewed their vows . The couple went to the Deer Park Hotel in Devon for the intimate occasion, with . only their three-year-old son Devon, a celebrant, photographer and vigil . present. It was exactly two years after they married at St Audries Park, Somerset, where they renewed their vows last year. ‘I don’t know how long I am going to be here, so we always renew our vows on our anniversary,’ Naomi tells MailOnline. ‘Graham . and I always write our own vows, we update them every year and say what . we’re thankful for and how we feel about each other. ‘Devon walked me down the aisle this time carrying balloons and at the end we lit candles together.’ Naomi was 26 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Graham had proposed just two days earlier. Stronger than ever: Graham proposed to Naomi in 2009 just two days before she found out she had secondary breast cancer. The couple are pictured here renewing their vows last Friday . Happy anniversary! Happy couple Graham and Naomi, pictured here, have been married since 2012 and each year renew their vows. Naomi says she wants to make the most of her short life, as she suffers from incurable breast cancer . After . seven months of treatment Naomi was declared free of cancer, only to be . told just a few months later that the disease had returned and was incurable. Devon was just six days old. Thoughts . of their wedding were the one thing that kept Naomi and Graham going, . but the financial burden of terminal illness meant their big day was . just a pipe dream. However, dozens of donations from friends, family, local supporters and . businesses – not to mention a £500 donation from a woman who wanted only . to be known as Mary Poppins - allowed them to marry in Naomi’s dream setting on June 6 2012. So . inspired was Naomi by these well-wishers, that she ultimately set up . her own charity with the mission of spreading the joy she had . experienced on her big day. What a face! Adorable Devon, three, gold his mother Naomi's hand as he gets ready to walk her down the aisle on her second wedding anniversary.

My rock: Naomi set up The Wedding Wishing Well Foundation in 2012, with the help of husband Graham who is a trustee. The couple are pictured here on Friday, renewing their wedding vows . The . Wedding Wishing Well Foundation was formed in December 2012. Since . then, Naomi has helped bring together eight weddings and several additions to smaller weddings. ‘Because either the bride or groom is on limited time, we often have very little time ourselves,’ explains Naomi. ‘They may have found out about the illness halfway through planning the . wedding, when they have little funds, time or energy left, . so we’ll come in and sort out the cake or photographer, or organise to have . the wedding take place by their hospital bed if need be. Whatever . people need.' Naomi continues: ‘The full weddings we’ve had about nine months to plan are worth £25,000 but we manage to do for £5,000-6,000. ‘It’s . all from donations. Every single day I am overwhelmed and amazed by how . incredibly supportive and generous people have been.’ On . the back of the Daily Mail Inspirational Woman of the Year Award 2013, . publishing house Harper Collins approached Naomi to write her story for them. Lovebirds: Graham, left and Naomi, right on their second wedding anniversary on Friday, renewing their vows. Naomi has written an autobiography, No Ordinary Wedding Planner, also released on Friday . All smiles: 'Graham and I always write our own vows,' says Naomi, pictured right before renewing her wedding vows to Graham, pictured left, on Friday. The couple renew their vows every year . ‘I’d always fancied writing a book but never had time,’ she says. ‘It . was the phone call of a lifetime. Harper Collins wanted me to write an . ebook as part of their new e-book series, HarperTrue. ‘They . gave me advice on how to write it and it’s all my own words. I found . once I started I couldn’t stop. They asked me for 18,000-20,000 words . and my first draft was 38,000! ‘I requested that it be published on June 6, my wedding anniversary, when I knew I would renew my vows.’ 'Graham is my rock,' says Naomi, pictured her with husband Graham on their second wedding anniversary on Friday. 'My marriage is stronger than it has ever been' Now, with book deadline met and summer approaching, it's time for a break. ‘It’s . pretty impossible for us to arrange weddings at short notice during . summer anyway, because everything is booked up, plus I have a limit to . how much I can do,’ says Naomi. Good read: No Ordinary Wedding Planner is published by HarperTrue in eBook at 99p . ‘I can’t even stand . up for very  long and get incredibly tired, so want to spend as much . time making memories with Devon and Graham as I can,’ she says. Naomi takes 30 tablets a day, has scans . and check-ups every six months and regular injections to bring on early . menopause, which prevents cancer-spreading oestrogen from developing. ‘I . don’t know how long I have left,' she says. 'Despite all the medicine, cancer will . do what it wants when it wants. I can’t plan further than six months . ahead.’ While Naomi is open about her illness, she admits that writing the book was, ‘much harder than I thought. ‘We talk about cancer at home.

"By . Scarlett Russell . Good news for sleepyheads: naps at work could save the British economy billions, say experts. Fifteen million sick days a year are specifically attributed to tiredness, depression or anxiety - and they are costing the UK an estimated £29 billion. Sleep experts have said that office snoozes can actually improve alertness and performance and even reduce stress. Dozing off: One in five UK adults have a power-nap during office hours and with 55 per cent say they feel significantly more productive and less tired after they do . According to a report published by the Office of National Statistics in February, designated dozes could help avoid 131 million sick days a year. Furthermore, the research, carried out by PriceWaterhouse Coopers and One Poll, found that one in five UK adults enjoy a catnap at work anyway, with 55 per cent saying they feel significantly more productive and less tired afterwards. The poll questioned 2,000 Brits on their nap habits, and found that the average length of a desk doze was 15 minutes. Men are twice as likely to fall asleep during office hours, and one in four take a work time nap at least once a week. Got to love beauty sleep! Lydia Bright has tweeted her support for napping, with this picture of herself posted with the hashtag #BringBackTheNap . Nap time: TOWIE's Chloe Sims is a fan of the daytime doze, tweeting this picture of herself and encouraging her followers to 'bring back the nap' Interestingly, . the research found that the younger you are, the more likely you are to . nap at work - perhaps having something to do with this age bracket . favouring mid-week nights out. One in three 18-24 year olds nap at work, compared to only 22 per cent of those aged 55+. London is the sleepiest region in the UK, with locals getting an average six hours sleep per night and with 85 per cent admitting to being ‘desperate’ for a nap during the working day. Those in Yorkshire and Humber get the most sleep in the country – over seven hours each night. 1.    In the car (33%)2.    At one’s desk (30%)3.    In the canteen (22%)4.    In a sunny spot outside (16%)5.    In a private office (17%) The survey, conducted to celebrate the release of Disney’s Sleeping Beauty on Blu-ray and DVD, also looked into the most common places to take a nap. It found that 33 per cent go to their car, 30 per cent actually sleep on their desk and 17 per cent find a private office. An estimated 38 million of us sneak off to the toilets to grab 40 winks. TOWIE stars Lydia Bright and Chloe Simms are backing the campaign and have submitted pics of themselves napping. Sleep Expert Sammy Margo commented: ‘Biologically we are programmed to fall asleep mid-afternoon as is the case with toddlers, the elderly and siesta cultures. Physiologically there is a slight drop in body temperature mid-afternoon. ‘This afternoon dip in mood and alertness associated with poorer performance especially after a night of sleep loss. Research shows that you can improve alertness, reduce stress and improve performance with a nap. The challenge is the conflict with our current work schedules and the fact that stimulus to nap is suppressed by caffeine.’Sleeping Beauty is on Blue-Ray, DVD and Digital Download now .","Sick days taken because of tiredness cost UK economy £29 million a year .

"By . Scarlett Russell . We spend between eight and nine hours at work a day, amounting to a third of our entire lifetime taken up by our job. So, it's nice to love what you do and make your job work for you, according to motivational speaker, former soldier and best-selling author Chris Barez-Brown. Barez-Brown has spent 15 years helping businesses such as Nike, HSBC, Sony and Coca-Cola develop and founded his own leadership programme, Upping Your Elvis. Sleeping at work could boost your career and make you better at work, says Chris Barez-Brown, whose new book promises to help you love your job and make it work for you . In short, if anyone knows about making your job work for you, it's him - and he's got some controversial ideas about how your job should be the happiest part of your day, not something to dread. You hate your job, now what?Whilst it’s easy to confuse a ‘bad work week’ with ‘I hate my job,’ you can make it work for you. ‘People may think getting a new job is the answer but often what we’ve got is good, we haven’t just shaped it,' Barez-Brown tells MailOnline. 'What you can do to make that job perfect for you? Applying and taking interviews for other jobs  helps you get noticed, hone in your brand and clarify what you’re good at. You might find your dream job, you might realize how good your current job is. There are always opportunities.’ Take a break (a proper one) Whilst dozing off under your desk might seem lazy – or downright peculiar – Barez-Brown says lunchtime naps could be the key to productivity. ‘Hundreds of years ago, we had two proper sleeps, generally one on late afternoon and one at night as we do now,’ he explains. ‘There’s so much research that says our bodies work better like this. Naps are very restorative.’ It might seem extreme, but forward-thinking companies are cottoning on to the lunchtime snooze. ‘Semco have a hammock-garden, Google have nap pods and I used to work in an agency which had beds in the office,’ says Barez-Brown. 'It's absolutely the way forward.' Read a book at your deskYour desk should be a place you look forward to turning up to. Consider getting in a little early to read at your desk before starting the working day. ‘We can become so factory-like we lose humanity,’ says Barez-Brown. ‘Switch your attention off work. It’s important to leave your desk regularly for breaks, but equally important to make your work space not just about work, but recreation as well. Reading a novel is a great way to do this.’ Read now for inspiration: Ex army solider turned motivational speaker and best-selling author Chris Barez-Brown, right, says there are no excuses not to love your job. His latest book, Free! Love your Work, Love Your Life, is out now . Work on your feetThink the biggest threat in your workplace is the questionable canteen milk? Think again. ‘Being sedentary causes more diseases than smoking, according to a study last year,’ says Barez-Brown, whose own ‘standing desk’ -  that’s a raised computer on a shelf, head piece for a phone and plenty of leg room – might be the next big thing in offices. ‘It’s so much healthier and more stimulating,’ he says. ‘Offices used to be about function and necessity, but now are about making the office fit around the job and work for what we need, which is tapping into our creative genius and communicating constantly. Help your boss help you'A good boss is emotive, humble, takes risks and celebrates individuality,’ says Barez-Brown. If your boss still isn’t stepping up? ‘Call a meeting with them where you identify the problem you have, work on what is impacting the negativity and discuss what can be done about it. Their job is to make you feel brilliant. Be brave enough to take a risk and have a grown-up conversations with your boss. That's the only way you'll engage with them.' And when you REALLY need to rantDon’t do it at work or with colleagues. ‘Find a safe buddy,’ says Barez-Brown. A friend who has nothing to do with your job who will listen and let you vent. Most of the time we just need to get stuff off our chest and in this case venting can be healthy and useful.’ But to do so in the work environment isn’t just negative, it’s potentially career-damaging, too. ‘People will associate you with complaining, it doesn’t bode well,’ says Barez-Brown.

"By . Scarlett Russell . When Sophie Dahl broke into modelling in 1997, she was the hottest face - and body - of the time. Under the guidance of Storm, the agency that discovered Kate Moss, Sophie appeared in campaigns for Versace, Alexander McQueen and Patrick Cox. But two daughters and nearly two decades later, she admits that her life now is worlds away from that scene – and she never really knew what all the fuss was about. Sophie Dahl, pictured here in 2007, at the height of her modeling career. The 36-year-old has said those years now feel like a lifetime away . Ask me when I'm 50! Sophie Dahl, pictured here at the BRIT Awards in February, has opened up about her attitude to aging in a new interview . In a refreshingly honest interview with Style magazine, Sophie, who was first discovered by fashion stylist icon Isabella Blow, also discusses her relaxed attitude to beauty and aging. ‘At the moment I don’t feel too traumatised by aging and ultimately would much rather be in my mid-thirties than my twenties, but ask me again when I’m 50,’ she says. ‘I am in slight mourning about the hollows under my eyes but that’s it. I have nothing against a good facelift.’ Sophie, the daughter of writer Tessa Dahl and granddaughter of the late children’s author Roald Dahl, became the face of Yves Saint Laurent’s perfume, Opium, in 2000. It featured the then 22-year old naked, lying provocatively on black satin sheets with her blonde hair dyed deep red. Controversial: Sophie Dahl appears in one of the most complained-about adverts of all time in 2000, aged 22 . Stylish couple: Jamie Cullum and Sophie Dahl married in 2010. She said in an interview today that she feels most beautiful when she's on a date night with him . Fresh-faced beauty: Sophie Dahl in October 2013, left, and 2007, right. Despite the six year gap, the stunning model looks like she has barely aged . Directed by Tom Ford and  shot by Steven Meisel, it became one of the most controversial and complained-about adverts of all time, criticised for it’s apparently overtly sexualisation and objectification of women. ‘It feels like such a long time ago, another life,’ Dahl told Style. ‘I think it’s something I will look back on and get a kick out of. I never really understood all the fuss.’ The model, who described her beauty routine as low maintenance also said her makeup regime was minimal these days, too, applying just mascara and eyeliner to brighten up her face if she felt that she looked tired. She also said she was cautious about putting on too much makeup in front of her daughters – Lyra, three and Margot, 14 months. ‘I think with girls you have a real responsibility in terms of how you discuss the physical,’ she says. ‘Talking about your looks or body in a derogatory way doesn’t do them any favours.’ Sophie Dahl and Jamie Cullum at the premiere of Fantastic Mr Fox in London, 2009. 'He's a really, really great man,' Sophie said of her husband earlier this year . It’s not the first time Sophie has spoken of her comfort with getting older – an attitude she credits largely to having children and having a supportive husband: She and the jazz musician Jamie Cullum wed in a secret winter wonderland ceremony in 2010. She told Style that she felt most beautiful when they were on a rare date night together and, earlier this year, gushed that he helps bring out the best in her. ‘I'm married to a really, really good guy,’ Sophie told Red magazine in January. ‘He's intensely curious and engaged with life. When you meet someone who really sees you, it gives you the emotional freedom to pursue your dreams.' She also said that, after the birth of first daughter Lyra, she stopped fussing about the small things. ‘Having children was very liberating,’ she said. 'They were suddenly the reason, much more important than any petty, navel-gazing feelings I'd indulged in before.' Despite her runway success as a model, Dahl has a huge passion for writing and cooking. She regularly writes for newspapers and magazines, has written two cook books and presented a cooking series and documentaries on TV. Running a website is Sophie’s latest venture: www.sophiedahl.com, or At the Kitchen Table as it is called, is a collection of recipes, columns, blogs and magazine-style features. She told Red that not only is it the perfect home for all her own writing, she gets her family and friends to contribute as well, and it’s the perfect place for everything she wants to read.","The model and writer, 36, says her modelling days feel like another life .

"By . Scarlett Russell . Iconic design company Habitat celebrates its golden anniversary this month - and these charming pictures show just how far the furniture giant has come since it’s launch in 1964. The brainchild of interiors designer Terence Conran, Habitat was an instant hit as it arrived on London's Fulham Road in the midst of the Swinging Sixties. Hip, young Londoners flocked to the store for its cool interiors and fashionable furniture, and the concept of contemporary lifestyle shopping in Britain was born. Happy birthday Habitat! The design company is celebrating fifty years in the furniture business this month . Before launching Habitat with the . help of his wife Caroline, the editor of Queen Magazine, businessman . Philip Pollock and model Pagan Taylor, Conran had been frustrated . by the distinctly old-fashioned approach to furniture stores in the UK, . ‘We . see ourselves as the Mary Quant of the furnishing world,’ Conran told . The Times in 1964, a nod to the iconic fashion designer who is . credited for inventing the mini-skirt. Conran wanted to replicate the forward-thinking approach to retailing that had emerged in Europe. As . part of his home furnishings shakeup, Conran introduced the humble duvet . to the UK in the same year, after coming across one on his travels in Sweden. Before then British people slept under blankets with hospital corners. Unsurprisingly the duvet - or . 'continental quilt' as it was called - became a sensation. Two years later, in 1966, the second Habitat store opened in Tottenham . Court Road. The same year, the company started to print magazine-style brochures . featuring photography rather than hand-drawn images of products. Prior to that all catalogues, including the original 1966 Habitat one, were hand-drawn. Habitat was one of the first British stores to introduce editorial-style . features in their brochures, such as recipe extracts and how-tos on decorating your home . Vintage: Habitat's first by-post catalogue inthe 1960s, left, and a bedroom shot from a later catalogue in the 1970s, right. Brits flocked to the home furnishings store when it opened in 1964 . The Habitat brand went international in 1973 with a store opening in Paris, and by 1980 there were 47 stores open around the globe . In 1969 Conran . launched Habitat's first mail order catalogue - Habitat Creative Living by . Post - a first for a furniture retailer delivering nationwide to those . who could not reach its London stores. And, long before Ikea, Conran and his team were the first mainstream brand to commercialise the idea of taking away flat-packed furniture and building it yourself at home . Conran . was in fact doing this in 1952, but Habitat was the champion of . flat-packing in the 1970s. Their Campus range was key to this, . being wildly popular with students. The original Fulham store moved to King’s Road in 1973, the same year that the . brand went international, with a store opening in Paris. By . 1980, there were 47 stores open around the globe. Forward-thinking: Habitat were one of the first stores to utilise the concept of taking away flat-packed furniture and building it yourself at home. Their Campus range was wildly popular with students . Controversial: The controversial duvet cover advert that received hundreds of complaints because it featured a scantily-clad mixed race couple, left, and another 1970s catalogue shot, right . Back in the habit: Habitat's winter catalogue from 1971, left, and it's catalogue from 1975, right. By 1973, when the flagship store moved from Fulham Road to the larger and more prominent King's Road, it also opened it's first international store in Paris . In the 1970s Habitat became known as a brand that liked to push the boundaries, causing a stir in 1973 when it featured a mixed-race couple in bed for a duvet advert. Criticised for representing ‘un-British sex,’ Habitat were flooded with complaints. But . they had the last laugh as the duvet cover collection from this photo . went on to become one of their best sellers. To this day, duvets are still one . of Habitats best-selling products. Conran withdrew from the business in 1990, but the brand continued to grow and create the latest home decor trends. As . Britain’s obsession with celebrity grew by the noughties, Habitat – . true to form – wasn’t far behind. In 2004 it launched VIP collections . with the likes of Daft Punk, Carla Bruni, Helena Christensen and Manalo . Blahnik. However, . the noughties also saw the rise of high street retailers offering their . own furniture and homewear - often at a much lower price. For the first time, . Habitat saw a dramatic fall in sales. Home comforts: As part of it's home furnishings shakeup, Habitat changed the way we sleep forever, after bringing the duvet to the UK from Sweden . In 1969, Habitat launched its first mail order catalogue - Habitat Creative Living by Post - a first for a furniture retailer delivering nationwide to those who could not reach its London stores . The extent of its financial failings meant the closure of all it's stores except the three London flagships ones in Kings Road, Tottenham Court Road and Finchley Road in the summer of 2011. In . 2012, Polly Dickens, formerly of The Conran Shop, was appointed . Creative Director of the brand and set the task of bringing Habitat's . success back. A spokesperson told Mail Online: 'It's taken a few years, but now our . collections are back on form and we are launching new mini stores around . the UK. 'These are proving hugely popular so we are on track to have 50 by the end of the year. We've refocused on original mantra that . useful can be beautiful and beautiful can be affordable and people are . discovering the brand again.' Now Habitat is celebrating its 50th birthday and plans to open . 50 new mini Habitat stores across the UK by end of year, including one on in Bishops Stortford, Hertfordshire on Friday. Do it yourself: A guide to 'quick assembly' furniture from a Habitat brochure in the 1980s . Bright ideas! A Habitat catalogue from the 1980s depicts furnishings in colourful block colours, synoymous with the trends of that era. By now, Habitat had 47 stores around the world .

"By . Scarlett Russell . She the London-born beauty who’s wowed Hollywood and can call George Clooney and Jennifer Aniston close friends. In fact, it was at George’s estate in Lake Como where she married actor John Krasinski. But ever-modest Emily Blunt, 31, maintains that her life is just as chaotic and unglamorous as any other new mother's. Back to business: Three months after giving birth Emily Blunt is on the promotion trail for her new action-film Edge of Tomorrow, with Tom Crusie . Praise indeed: Apparently Tom Cruise initiated a meeting with Emily Blunt after being impressed by her performance in another film . And, despite a recent holiday in Mexico with Jennifer Aniston and her fiancé Justin Theroux, Emily says her life is, actually, really quite normal. In an interview with Helena de Bertodano for Stella magazine, the actress, who is currently promoting her new film Edge of Tomorrow with Tom Cruise, says: ‘I don’t feel I lead a glamorous life. Most of the people we’re friends with are people you can just hang out with.’ Emily, who gave birth to first daughter Hazel in February, also maintains that the glitzy Hollywood lifestyle is never going to go to her head. ‘Everybody was asking, “What’s your birth plan?”’ she says. ‘And I was like, “I don’t really have one, to be honest.” The nurses were like, “Thank God” - they’re used to women who come in and say, “I want this music playing when the baby comes out, I want this candle, these flowers…”’ Just like us: Emily Blunt and husband John Krasinski leave London hotspot, The Chiltern Firehouse, on Friday night, left. Right, Emily pregnant before the birth of daughter Hazel in February . Edge of . Tomorrow is Emily’s first film since the birth of Hazel, and one which . required a gruelling three-month training regime to get her into shape. Fortunately, she says, all the filming was done before she became pregnant as she got injured and fell over so often. Since . Emily’s been back in the spotlight, and just three months after the . birth of Hazel, she has noticeably whipped back into shape quickly, . though has credited breast-feeding for her slim physique. ‘I found that because I managed to produce a lot of milk, I don't know why, it helped me lose the weight,’ she told Ellen DeGeneres recently. ‘My boobs thought I had 12 children!’ Prior to Edge of Tomorrow, Emily is most famous for playing the bitchy and ruthlessly-ambitious assistant in The Devil Wears Prada, and Queen Victoria in The Young Victoria, to name but a few staring roles. Whether it’s action, comedy or drama, Emily’s career has gone from strength-to-strength, and it was apparently her performance in The Adjustment Bureau with Matt Damon in 2011 that made Tom Cruise sit up, take notice, and asked his team to arrange an interview. Hard to believe, then, that Emily nearly changed her name when her career started. She hated her surname: ‘Because we all know what it rhymes with. But my English agent at the time said, “Don’t, it’s so memorable.” Now, every male actor I work with ends up just calling me “Blunt.”’","Actress says she shunned LA-style birthing plans .

The pair have instead been placed on good behaviour bonds. Sarah Louise Roan, 21, and Lauren Jackson, 22, appealed against the severity of their sentences after they were handed at least six months in prison for hurling Harpic White and Shine from a moving car in northwest Sydney. Scroll down for video . Sarah Louise Roan, 21, (right) and Lauren Jackson, 22, (left) avoided their original six-month jail sentences for throwing bleach at a toddler at Kellyville Ridge last year . The bleach hit a mother and her four-year-old girl, who dropped to the ground and screamed: 'It's stinging! It's stinging!'. After the girl's eyes swelled up, her mother took her to hospital for treatment. She suffered no permanent injuries. On appeal, both women said they did not know they had hit the girl when Jackson threw the bleach out the window at Kellyville Ridge in May last year. Parramatta District Court heard that Roan was driving when she began throwing a series of items, including a pair of socks and a ball out the window, hitting an oncoming vehicle. The Parramatta District Court placed the pregnant women on good behaviour bonds after their appeal . Soon after, Jackson joined her in throwing things from the car, before yelling 'skanks' at two children, believed to be about eight years old. Jackson then threw the bottle of bleach. On appeal Jackson said she was 'upset' when she discovered the toilet cleaner gel had struck the four-year-old girl. The next day Roan handed herself into police. Jackson's lawyer Greg West argued that some of the facts of the case may have been 'misunderstood' by the magistrate on sentence and argued that neither woman deserved full-time custodial sentences. The four-year-old girl was splashed in the eyes when the bleach was thrown out of the car's windows. She was taken to hospital for treatment . He pointed out it could mean both being separated from their soon-to-be born children. Judge Norman Delaney quashed their sentences on Monday and placed Roan on a six-month good behaviour bond. Jackson was placed on a two-year bond for one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and a six-month bond for one count of assault.","Sarah Roan, 21, and Lauren Jackson, 22, received good behaviour bonds .

Coldplay serenaded thousands of fans on the set of their new music video shoot for the song for A Sky Full Of Stars in Sydney's Newtown on Tuesday . Donning their jazzed-up instruments, the band marched through the streets while they performed, stopping in front of the Martin Luther King 'I Have A Dream' mural . Look at those arms: Coldplay's lead vocalist Chris Martin shows off his bulging biceps during the band's shoot . The video involved the band members - Chris Martin, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland and Will Champion - walking from Kelly's Bar on King Street, carrying their one-man-band kits as they marched through the streets, followed by the extras like modern-day Pied Pipers. They stopped in front of the Martin Luther King 'I Have A Dream' mural, before ending up in a park beside the Black Star pastry cafe. The extras had responded to the tweet sent out by the band's manager, Phil Harvey, on Monday night asking for fans to turn up at the Courthouse Hotel in Newtown. Thousands of people turned up to watch the band. Three shots of the song were taken according to an onlooker . That's different! The four band members had components of a massive drum set strapped to their backs to add a quirky twist for the video clip . Celebration: Since the song is called A Sky Full Of Stars, an array of confetti was used to enhance the atmosphere on set . A bartender from the Courthouse, Poe Darby, 23, told the Mail Online that the band kept all the details quiet right up until the last minute. 'We got a call last week and it was kind of anonymous call and it almost sounded like prank. They said it was a kind of known band and it might be up to 100 people and they wanted to check our availability,' Mr Darby said. 'Only the night before filming their clip, they actually came in and said it was Coldplay and it was going to be a bit of a bigger crowd than originally expected.' Bulking up: The Coldplay frontman reportedly pays £110 (AU$200) an hour to build definition in his arms . Poe Darby, a barman from the Courthouse who saw the band perform, said 'The atmosphere was amazing... even the people who didn't know what was going on just joined straight in' 'We did three takes down there, they played it in full then we did it in a wider shot and the second one with the glitter cannons and everything,' Mr Darby said . Mr Darby said the Courthouse is expecting the band to return sometime on Tuesday night for a possible low-key performance . He also took part in the band’s street performance during the day however, which he described as 'awesome'. 'The atmosphere was amazing. It was like a general Newtown vibe but a lot more people – and the people who didn’t know what was going on just joined straight in,' Mr Darby said. 'We did three takes down there, they played it in full then we did it in a wider shot and the second one with the glitter cannons and everything. 'Then they  played a couple of songs afterwards, just for the crowd.' iphones out: Martin told the crowd 'This is the strangest recording session we've ever done' Raving crowd: Coldplay's manager Phil Harvey invited fans to turn up at the Courthouse Hotel in Newtown the next morning and needless to say, hundreds made an appearance . Cornered in: Fans surrounded Chris as he strummed a guitar outside a store on Newtown's famous King Street . The hundreds of fans waited to hear Martin speak to them from the podium. The frontman, looking tanned and happy, thanked the fans and the paparazzi ""for being nice"". 'This is going to be on YouTube in three hours,' Martin said as everyone held their phones aloft. 'This is the strangest recording session we've ever done. We actually are recording this song,' he said. He loves a crowd: The blonde musician enjoyed the enthusiastic fans who turned up for the music video shoot . Calling the shots: The charismatic musician wasn't afraid to give his input during the production and also happily greeted fans . Let's get a glimpse: Hundreds of Coldplay fans surrounded the band to see how they would create a music video in Sydney . Say cheese: Chris happily stopped for a fan photo as he clutched onto the guitar embellished with red tulips . After they had been serenaded, the crowd cheered. Most of them admitted they turned up for the shoot because they hadn't been able to get tickets to see the band's promotional gig in the Enmore Theatre on Thursday. The gig at Sydney’s iconic venue sold out in just three minutes. In the initial tweet, Harvey said the first 250 people who turned up before 11.30am would appear in the video. By 11am, they had reached that number with many fans queuing up since 6am. In between takes: A crew member checked over the instruments to make sure all was in check . Lining up: After the band's manager asked fans to come down and see them shoot the video, the queue of eager fans began to grow . Strumming a tune: Guitarist Jonny Buckland walked along the street and did his thing . 'When I sent out the tweet last night I thought maybe 20 or 30 people would turn up,' Harvey told the crowded beer garden of the Sydney pub. 'I'm relieved we got the 250 we need,' Harvey said. 'The only thing that worries me is that I just hope not too many other people turn up because I don't want them to be disappointed'. Feeling the love: Chris sported a white badge clipped to his singlet that had the word 'love' written across it . Just casually walking down the steeet: Chris was more covered up earlier on before shooting began as he was swarmed by crew members . Rockstar mode: Chris kept a low profile in a black cap and matching dark shades before he eventually stripped down to a singlet for the shoot . Harvey said it was an easy decision to film the band's video in Sydney. 'We love Sydney, we love Australia. I used to live in Melbourne,' he said. 'When we knew that Sydney was on our little routes in our promo tour we said that's the spot where we want to do our shoot,' he said. 'It's kind of based on a one man band because the track itself is quite dancey and electronic,' he said of the shoot, with members of the band each wearing a one man band's kit. 'We wanted to bring it back to the human element of it' All clear: While a red scratch was spotted on the musician's nose on Monday, there was not a mark in sight on Tuesday . Taking a step back: At one stage lead vocalist Chris followed guitarist Jonny's lead as they made their way to the set . In uniform? Guy Berryman and Jonny Buckland from the band looked almost matching in navy jackets and charcoal trousers . The shoot finished up at 3.30pm and every extra who turned up will be able to see their name in the video's credits. The band's visit, from June 16 to 21, will also include making an appearance on The Voice Australia, which will air on June 23. And the musicians are said to have already recorded a generic television special, which will air on Channel 7. Shades of blue: It seems that Jonny kept the navy sweater underneath his jacket on when he later filmed the video clip with his guitar on hand .","Coldplay chose Newtown to film a clip for their  song A Sky Full Of Stars .

"By . Lillian Radulova . A man accused of murdering his teenage wife almost 17 years ago has been granted bail in the New South Wales Supreme Court after the introduction of more lenient bail laws. Steven Frank Fesus, 42, is alleged to have murdered his then 18-year-old wife Jodie Fesus in the NSW Illawarra region in August 1997. Five weeks after the mother-of-two's disappearance, her remains were discovered in a shallow grave at a popular camping site at Seven Mile Beach after a tip-off from an anonymous caller. Steven Frank Fesus, 42, was granted bail at the New South Wales Supreme Court despite being charged with murdering his former wife, Jodie . Fesus wasn't charged with her killing until last year, when police decided to renew their investigations with newly developed and improved forensic technologies. Since his arrest in July, the former security guard has made a number of unsuccessful bail applications. However on Monday he was granted bail at the NSW Supreme Court. The decision comes following the overhaul of the Bail Act in NSW. Jodie Fesus (left) was only 18 when she was killed. The mother-of-two was found in a shallow grave at Seven Mile Beach 17 years ago . Under the changes, which came into effect two weeks ago, the court now determines whether bail should be granted on the basis of whether the applicant poses an unacceptable risk to the community if released. Previously, the decision on whether someone was granted bail was based on the type of offence and the presumption for or against their release. Fesus, who appeared in court via audio-visual link from Goulburn prison, said nothing during the application. He is set to appear at the Wollongong Local Court on Wednesday. Despite being denied bail numerous times, Mr Fesus was finally granted bail following the overhaul of the Bail Act in New South Wales. It used to be given based on the type of offence but now only is refused if the applicant poses an unacceptable risk to the community if released . When announcing that police would be re-opening the case, Detective Chief Inspector Lehmann said investigators were re-examining key evidence collected back in 1997. 'Jodie Fesus was the mother of two young children who were aged just one and two years old at the time she was murdered,' he said in a statement. 'Those children are now teenagers who have grown up without ever getting to know their mother. 'In short, we will do everything we can to solve this murder so that Jodie’s family can finally have some closure.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Steven Frank Fesus, 42, was charged with murdering his former wife, Jodie .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An image of a smiling young San Diego police officer taken with a man whose phone she had helped to recover may be the last image ever taken of her. Officer Laura Perez, 25, came to the aid of Marshal Crawford after his wife's phone was stolen, and after she'd retrieved it for him, he asked the young woman to pose for a selfie with him so that he could show his wife the cop who got her phone back. Five days later, Riverside County homicide investigators found the body of the mother-of-one in a storage locker in Moreno. Shining example: Marshal Crawford (left) took this picture of himself and Officer Laura Perez on the stolen cell phone she helped to recover and says she 'handled herself with grace and finesse' Authorities in Murietta have arrested Perez's own husband, Freddy Perez-Rodas, 27, and charged him with the killing. 'She was a gentle person in a rough and tumble business and she handled herself with grace and finesse,' Crawford told NBC of his impressions of Perez. 'It’s just so painful to see someone that young, that vibrant not be with us and I ache for her daughter and family,' he said. Perez-Rodas was arrested Wednesday and also faces arson and child endangerment charges. An investigation was underway after police and fire department personnel responded to a house fire Wednesday night on Grand Oaks Court. Domestic dispute: Police say Perez's husband Freddy Perez-Rodas, 27, shot her in the chest and hid her body in a storage locker . Police say Perez-Rodas admitted to killing Laura Perez during a domestic dispute and dumping her body in a Moreno Valley storage lot. Authorities believe he shot 25-year-old Laura Perez in the chest during a dispute at their Murrieta home. She graduated from the police academy in December, according to the Escondido Police Officer’s Association. Investigators ruled the fire an arson and accuse Perez-Rodas of setting the blaze to cover up the crime. Bright future: Laura Perez was described as 'a wonderful officer who had a bright future' by colleagues at the Escondido Police Department . The couple’s four-year-old daughter was not hurt and is staying with other family members. Perez-Rodas remained jailed Thursday, and it’s unclear whether he has an attorney. The Escondido Police Officer’s Association said Perez graduated from the police academy in December. 'She was a shining example of how a police officer should conduct themselves and more importantly, how a human being should conduct themselves. Law enforcement and humanity is less today because of her passing,' Crawford posted after sharing the image on the Escondido Police Department's wall.","Officer Laura Perez of the Escondido Police Department helped Marshal Crawford recover a stolen phone .

The Liverpool manager was pictured arm-in-arm with Charlotte Hind, Liverpool's former travel manager on the day England faced Uruguay in Sao Paulo. That game saw Luis Suarez line up for Uruguay against club-mates including Steven Gerrard, Daniel Sturridge, Jordan Henderson and Raheem Sterling. Getaway: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has been on holiday in New York with Charlotte Hind . Out and about: The Reds boss was spotted hours before England faced Uruguay in the World Cup . Tussle: Rodgers could face a fight to keep hold of star striker Luis Suarez upon his return to Liverpool . Suarez scored twice to lead Uruguay to a 2-1 win over England, a result which ended the Three Lions' participation in the tournament. Meanwhile, Rodgers was photographed with Ms. Hind escaping about the potential transfer saga regarding Suarez which could await him on his return to Liverpool. The striker has been linked with a move to La Liga giants Barcelona and Real Madrid and could spark a £100million tug-of-war for his services.

Rivalry: Liverpool team-mates Steven Gerrard and Luis Suarez faced off at the 2014 World Cup . Last summer Rodgers stood firm as Arsenal and Real Madrid tested Liverpool's resolve over the striker, but was handsomely rewarded as Suarez scored 31 goals, helped the club finish second in the Premier League and scooped the PFA Player of the Year award. There is uncertainty if Liverpool can hold on to their prized asset for a second summer in a row though, despite qualifying for the Champions League. Liverpool begin their pre-season preparations with a trip to Brondby on July 16, three days after the World Cup final. They then face Preston at Anfield on July 19, before embarking on a tour of the United States which will include games against Roma, Manchester City and AC Milan.

"By . Graeme Yorke . Alexis Sanchez could be the man to dump defending champions Spain out of the World Cup after putting Australia to the sword. The Chilean may play in the Spanish league for Barcelona but he will have no qualms if he can inspire his team to victory over the 2010 winners on Wednesday. Sanchez scored one and created another as Chile justified their ‘dark horses’ tag with an impressive 3-1 win over Australia in Cuiaba. Hot stuff: Alexis Sanchez and Chile got their World Cup campaign off to a winning start . And after Spain were thrashed 5-1 by Holland earlier in the evening, Chile have the chance to end their title defence in midweek. Coach Jorge Sampaoli said: ‘We started well and put Australia under a lot of pressure,’ he said. ‘We had a good understanding in attack, especially with Alexis Sanchez as the focal point, and we created several chances. ‘After Australia scored, we lost a little bit of momentum and we got frustrated. With the calibre of our next two opponents, we will have to give a more complete performance. The prospect of playing Spain at the Maracana is electrifying.’ Man of the Match Sanchez drilled home from close range in the 12th minute to give Chile the lead then ran from midfield to set up  Jorge Valdivia to score two minutes later. Gloomy outlook: The Spain bench watch their side being annihilated by Holland in their World Cup opener . But former Millwall and Everton striker Tim Cahill halved the deficit with a trademark header before half-time and it needed a late third from Wigan’s Jean Beausejour to seal victory for the South Americans. Cahill was frustrated afterwards with some of Chile’s underhand tactics and described one exchange with Eugenio Mena. ‘There was an incident where the left-back elbowed me and kicked out at me when I was trying to run past him for a cross, and I’ve got a yellow card,’ Cahill said. ‘I called him a cheat and he said, ‘Yeah, I’m a cheat, so what?’’ ’ Australia must beat Holland on Wednesday to keep their hopes alive.","Alexis Sanchez and Chile got their World Cup off to a fine start .

'We know it's going to be a difficult game. 'We have to avoid being surprised by their counter-attacks and try to make life difficult for them in midfield.

Luis Suarez appears to be on the brink of trading in Merseyside for the glamour of Catalonia after Liverpool and Barcelona engaged in formal discussions this week over a proposed £72million move. However, he may proceed with caution as a Sportsmail study can reveal that those strikers who shine brightest at Anfield often fail to hit the same heights after exciting one of England’s most famous football clubs. Fernando Torres and Michael Owen both departed Liverpool at the peak of their career – the Spaniard for Chelsea and Owen for Real Madrid – but neither forward was able to replicate their striking process at their new homes. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Barcelona fans discuss the possible signing of Luis Suarez . Curse-breaker: Can Luis Suarez avoid the struggles other strikers have faced if he leaves Anfield? Struggles: Neither Fernando Torres or Michael Owen could quite reach their Anfield highs at other clubs . Torres boasted a stunning goalscoring record at Liverpool, netting 65 goals in 102 Premier League games but his form has deserted since, with his strike rate dropping from 0.64 goals per game to 0.18 since he joined Chelsea in a £50m move in January 2011. Michael Owen, similarly, struggled for form and fitness after his Anfield departure, with his goalscoring ration diminishing from 0.55 goals per game to 0.31 taking into account his spells with Real Madrid, Newcastle United, Manchester United and Stoke City. Sportsmail’s research into the record of Liverpool’s strikers in the Premier League era has uncovered a discernible pattern that suggests that the club’s sharpest shooters fall into decline after leaving, with other Anfield legends such as Ian Rush and Robbie Fowler also reducing their goal output once they advanced their career elsewhere. Indeed, the only forwards whose records improved after leaving the club were their more maligned names, including Titi Camara, Andriy Voronin, Andy Carroll and El-Hadji Diouf, who have all been filed away in the ‘Do Not Mention’ file at Melwood. Former glories: Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler is another who never quite emulate his form elsewhere . Turntables: But former flops Andy Carroll and Andriy Voronin are two who improved elsewhere . Diouf, a £10m signing by Gerard Houiller following an impressive showing at the 2002 World Cup, is more memorable for his phlegm than his football, scoring just three goals in 55 games for Liverpool before leaving for Bolton, where his record improved considerably. Other Liverpool cast-offs such as Florent Sinama-Pongolle and Andy Carroll improved after exiting. England forward Carroll has bettered his record – but only slightly – increasing his goal return from 6 goals in 44 games for Liverpool (0.14 goals per game) to 9 in 39 games for West Ham United (0.23 goals per game). It remains to be seen whether Suarez will fall the same way as those who believed the grass would be greener in pastures new but it would certainly represent a shift in the narrative of Liverpool forwards in recent times.

The footage showed people walking or cycling past her for the next seven . minutes before a second vehicle runs her over. Van driver Hu Jun has been jailed for three-and-a-half years for 'involuntary homicide', following her death - but those who walked by have gone unpunished. Scroll down for the video... Warning: Graphic content . Ignored: Yue Yue was left with horrific brain injuries and never recovered . Unaware: Video footage shows the youngster crossing the road at Guangfo Hardware Market, without realising the van is approaching her . At the time, the injured toddler was eventually taken to . hospital and survived for more than a week before eventually dying of . brain failure. Both drivers who ran over her over were arrested. The footage of the incident quickly spread via the internet causing shock around the world and triggered a bout of bitter soul searching in China about the nation’s apparent moral decay in the midst of an economic boom. Xinhua news agency said Hu was convicted of 'involuntary homicide' by a court in Foshan. He told the court he was aware he had hit something, but did not realise it was a child. Hu is reported to have paid part of the toddler's medical expenses. The good samaritan who came to Wang Yue's aid, rubbish collector Chen Xianmei, has been praised as a 'national role model,' reports the Huffington Post.Yue Yue's family reporteldy received nearly £30,000 to help pay for her medical treatment.

Key moments: James Rodriguez's goal against Uruguay has been made into a print, as has the controversial moment that saw Luis Suarez bite Italy's Giorgio Chiellini . It clearly demonstrates the moment that Cahill met an angled ball from the right-hand side with a stunning left-footed volley that crashed in off the underside of the crossbar. It is one of nine prints currently on sale charting Hincks’ most memorable moments from this World Cup but this is just one of several collections that he has produced, including all-time great World Cup goals such as Diego Maradona’s individual goal against England and Sir Geoff Hurst’s World Cup final goal for England against West Germany in 1966. Pick of the best: Robin van Persie's header against Spain and Tim Cahill's volley against Holland make the cut . Hincks, a Manchester City supporter, has also created prints inspired by the Premier League, with his involvement in these designs spurred on by Sergio Aguero’s last-gasp title winning strike against QPR in 2012. Hincks said: ‘The idea to document football moments was just natural and I wanted each print to have consistency, but also have its own unique trait. I just think it’s fascinating that you can re-create it in such a simplistic way and it still re-ignites the emotion from that day.’ Classic strikes: Diego Maradona's goal against England in 1986 is turned into a print as is Geoff Hurst's hat-trick goal against West Germany in 1966 . ‘The World Cup is now in full flow and presents an irresistible opportunity to relive some old moments and capture new stand out moments as they happen. ‘It’s been a fantastic World Cup so far despite England’s poor showing. It’s proving hard to pick a winner with many of the highly rated teams such as Brazil, Netherlands, Germany and Argentina all struggling to convince - it could go anyway. But with the Manchester City connection, it has to be Argentina.’ Leaving it late: Alessandro del Piero struck for Italy in extra-time in 2006, as did Andres Iniesta for Spain in 2010 .

The Ghana Football Association have offered their ‘unqualified apologies’ to their nation after crashing out of the World Cup at the group stage of the competition. Ghana finished bottom of a difficult group featuring Germany, the USA and Portugal, picking up only one point in three games and the governing body’s president Kwesi Nyantakyi has now apologised for the team’s showing. ‘Admittedly, the performance of the team fell below the expectation of many Ghanaians,’ the GFA president said. Failed: Ghana coach Kwesi Appiah wasn't able to guide his side out of Group G at the 2014 World Cup . Sorry: The Ghanaian FA offered apologies to their fans following their dismal showing at the 2014 World Cup . ‘Our inability to qualify to the 2nd Round broke many Ghanaian hearts. We wish to offer our unqualified apologies for the disappointment.’ The sombre tone adopted by Ghana is in stark contrast to the apathetic response of the English FA following the country’s group stage exit in Brazil. England scored just two goals in a hugely disappointing performance at the World Cup, with England’s only point coming in a mind-numbing 0-0 draw against Costa Rica in the dead-rubber third group game.

Suspended: Kevin-Prince Boateng was dismissed from the Black Stars' squad on the same grounds as Muntari . Yet rather than apologising to the country’s supporters, FA chairman Greg Dyke came out in the immediate aftermath of England’s exit and simply declared that manager Roy Hodgson would remain in his job for at least another two years, stating that England ‘were not humiliated’. When asked if Hodgson — whose earnings of £3.5million a year make him the second highest-paid manager at the World Cup — would remain in his job until the end of his contract in 2016, Dyke said: ‘That is the view of myself, of everybody else here in Brazil and of others in the FA. ‘We’re supportive of Roy Hodgson, we’ve asked him to stay as manager. Roy has done a good job and it was always an approach for four years and we hope to do better in the European Championship. We do not see any value in changing.’ ‘Everybody thought we played really well in the first game against Italy and narrowly lost. In the second game it could have gone either way. We were not humiliated. They were narrow defeats, but it is for the football people, not for me, to identify why we did not win.’ Content: FA chairman Greg Dyke assured Roy Hodgson his future as England manager is secure .

"By . Adam Crafton . Follow @@AdamCrafton_ . ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley has explained his pronunciation of Colombia talisman James Rodriguez’s first name after coming under fire on social media. Rather than adopting the Spanish pronunciation ‘Ha-mez’ of the name that adorns the back of the 23-year-old’s shirt, Tyldesley instead used the English take on James during Colombia’s 2-0 victory over Uruguay on Saturday evening. Writing in a guest blog for Kick It Out, Tyldesley justified his decision: ‘I am in the identification business, I am not a linguist. Believe it or believe it not, I do try to get pronunciations correct. And, yes, in his native Spanish language James Rodriguez becomes ‘Hamez Rod-reeg-ez’. 'The complications and dilemmas come when – like me – you are not a native Spanish speaker, or any other ‘speaker’ but plain English. Clarification: ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley, pictured here with Andy Townsend at Wembley, has explained his reasons for pronouncing Colombia star James Rodriguez in an English manner . Star of the show: Colombia's James Rodriguez has lit up the World Cup, scoring five goals on his team's march to the quarter-finals . ‘If some of the most famous of the household names at this World Cup were to be pronounced totally correctly, familiar players like van Persie, Ronaldo and Luiz would suddenly sound rather unfamiliar. 'So, at the risk of upsetting the multi-linguists, I admit that I do lean towards ‘Anglicising’ names for popular consumption. I believe it is far more important not to misuse words such as ‘tragedy’ and ‘disaster’ in football commentary. ‘But pronunciations will continue to divide and infuriate. I remember Ruud Gullit working with ITV as a World Cup panellist and saying that the guttural sound of his surname is simply not one that English speakers make. 'I have steered clear of trying to refer to Belo Horizonte as ‘Bello Horry-zontsscchhh’ because my clumsy attempt at speaking Portuguese would probably still be wrong, so why pretend? Stunner: Rodriguez's volley against Uruguay ranks as the best goal of the tournament so far . Tongue twister: Holland legend Ruud Gullit said the guttural sound of his surname is not one that English speakers can easily make . ‘So I will not be intentionally trying to wind anyone up when I shout ‘Jaimz Rod-reeg-ez’ on Friday. Quite the opposite. 'Personally, I think it would be a little perverse to refer to a man with ‘J-A-M-E-S’ on his back as anything other than ‘Jaimz’ on British television unless a different pronunciation of his name had been long established – particularly as he was happily scoring goals for Porto in Europe two years ago as ‘Jaimz Rod-reeg-ez’ on our channels.’ Tyldesley, who has been ITV’s lead commentator since the retirement of Brian Moore after the World Cup 1998, also vowed to continue with his Anglicised pronunciation in the upcoming games at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.","ITV commentator was criticised for pronouncing Rodriguez's first name in English way rather than Spanish 'Ha-mez'

Jonathan Trott held Warwickshire's top order together with an unbeaten 62 as his side reached 163-3 in response to Sussex's 413 on the second day of the LV= County Championship Division One match at Horsham. Trott has so far batted for just over three hours and despite one or two alarms looked in the mood to continue his outstanding record against Sussex. He has now scored a double hundred, four centuries and five fifties in 26 innings against them. Trott and opener Varun Chopra led a steady response for Warwickshire with a third-wicket stand of 125 after they had lost Ian Westwood and William Porterfield by the 12th over. Form: England batsman Jonathan Trott scored an unbeaten 62 for Warwickshire against Sussex . Steve Magoffin, who demolished Somerset at Horsham last year with 12 for 31, struck in his third over when Westwood gloved a lifter to Chris Jordan at slip. Left-armer Lewis Hatchett then strangled Porterfield down the leg side with the total on 30. It was hard work initially for Chopra and Trott, especially against Magoffin and Jordan, who was getting some valuable overs under his belt ahead of the third Test at Southampton. Trott's first two scoring shots were outside edges to the third man boundary and he survived an lbw appeal from Jordan on 21. Chopra would have been run out on 23 had Luke Wells' throw at the stumps from point been on target but he reached his first Championship 50 for 15 innings with a boundary through vacant third slip and thereafter began to play with more freedom. Fitness: Trott has twice made himself unavailable for selection due to a stress-related illness . However, on 81 and having hit 13 fours from 155 balls faced, he drove loosely away from his body and was caught behind to give Hatchett his second wicket. Trott, too, found the going tough for long stages but he reached only his second Championship half-century of the season with the shot of the day - a straight-driven boundary off Magoffin. He had a let-off on 58 when Ben Brown missed a straightforward edge off off-spinner James Tredwell and it could prove to be a costly reprieve for Sussex. Tredwell was unlucky again in the penultimate over when Sam Hain was dropped at leg slip by Sussex captain Ed Joyce on three. Throw: Trott is trying to find his form again for Warwickshire and he is trying to salvage this match . Earlier, Sussex had been bowled out for 413 after their last four wickets added 99 runs. Brown and Tredwell extended their eighth-wicket stand to 71 with Tredwell striking three successive boundaries off Boyd Rankin in his 33 before he was caught behind cutting at Jeetan Patel. Brown fell two short of a half-century when he was leg before to Rankin after lunch and the England bowler wrapped up the innings two balls later when he knocked Hatchett's off stump out of the ground.

"By . Sportsmail . Early retirement: sources say Daley could quit after Glasgow . Olympic bronze medalist Tom Daley will retire after the Glasgow Commonwealth games, according to a source close to the diver. A combination of factors, including a 'phobia' of his back-twist dive and the supposed inability to win a medal at Rio 2016, will cause the diver to call time on his career in the sport. As well as his Olympic bronze, Daley has won gold in the 10m competition at the World and European Championships and Commonwealth games. The source reportedly said: 'Sadly Tom has decided he’ll retire after the Commonwealth Games to avoid Rio. 'He’s . pretty much got no chance of medalling at the Olympics. If he can . retain gold at the Commonwealth Games then he’ll out on a high. 'His . struggle with his back twist has been well documented and he knows the . time will be right. 'He’s had a great career in diving and has so many . other opportunities.' Earlier this year, the two-time Commonwealth champion revealed he was having therapy to try to eradicate the issue with the 'terrifying' back twist dive. The source says his self-confessed 'phobia' of the dive means he will find it hard to win bronze, silver or gold at Rio. This, coupled with the long training regime needed to qualify for an Olympic Games, means he has decided to retire following the Glasgow event, it is claimed. Problems: Daley's form, as well as a 'phobia' of a back twist dive has led to the decision . However, a spokesman for the athlete denied the claims of early retirement, adding: 'Tom’s goal remains to compete at Rio 2016.' After roaring success in junior championships, the diver won his place in Team GB at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. He later won a bronze medal at the London Olympics in 2012. After finishing sixth in last summer's World Championships, Daley left his long-term base in Plymouth and his coach Andy Banks to train at the London Aquatics Centre through to the Rio Olympics. In April this year, Daley missed out on a medal at the Diving World Series after finishing fifth in the final of the 10-metre platform. Olympics: Daley won bronze at the London Olympics in 2012 . Despite an otherwise successful performance, the back twist dive - a two-and-a-half somersault with a two-and-a-half twist - proved difficult for the diver. It is the same one which he had to repeat at the 2012 Olympics after an unexpected camera flash from the crowd. After that, the diver admitted he was desperately seeking help over his fear of the dive and that the scale of the issue was 'massive'. He said: 'It is almost trauma therapy - to get myself to process the things that have gone wrong on it to get it to a stage where I can forget about it and feel positive about it. 'I am literally terrified of it. I suppose you could call it a phobia and I don't know what my heart rate is when I go up there and do it but it's definitely above 180, something ridiculous, because it is so terrifying.'

"By . Caroline Graham . and Joanne Clements . Gordon Ramsay was last night embroiled in an extraordinary race row after allegedly calling a top chef a ‘f****** black b******’. The stunning claim was made by Ethiopian-born Marcus Samuelsson in his new memoir Yes, Chef, published in America. In his book Samuelsson, who has cooked for President Obama at the White House, alleged Ramsay rang him shortly after he arrived as a guest chef at London’s five-star Lanesborough Hotel in 2000. Accusation: Swedish-born chef Marcus Samuelsson, left, claims Gordon Ramsay, right, called him a 'f****** black b******' during a telephone call while the pair were at the Lanesborough Hotel in 2000 . Accused: Gordon Ramsay last night became embroiled in an extraordinary race row after allegedly calling a top chef a ‘f****** black b******’ He claims Ramsay was angry that Samuelsson had not named him when he was asked which chefs he admired. ‘On my second day I was cooking when a phone call came into the kitchen. The executive chef answered and with a puzzled look handed me the receiver.’ Samuelsson, 42, said he thought it was a call from a friend in New York, but added: ‘Instead, there was screaming. “How the f*** can you come to my f****** city and think you are going to be able to cook without even f****** referring to me?” ‘This went on for what seemed like five minutes. “I’m going to make sure you have a f****** miserable time here. This is my city, you hear? Good luck, you f****** black b******.” Then he hung up. ‘To be honest, though, only one phrase in his juvenile tirade unsettled me: When he called me a black b******. Actually, I didn’t give a f*** about the b****** part. But the black part p***** me off.’ The uncorroborated claim was strenuously denied by a furious Ramsay, who called it ‘a complete fabrication’, although Samuelsson – whose book was vetted by  lawyers for publisher Random House – stuck by his story. Reputation: Gordon Ramsay has a reputation for displaying an aggressive style in the kitchen, but he vehemently denies the claims made by Samuelsson in his new book Yes, Chef . Ramsay’s spokesman said: ‘We’re shocked by these completely false and extremely offensive accusations. Gordon has always had an amicable relationship with Mr Samuelsson, even suggesting him as a fellow judge when MasterChef started in the US two years ago. This was an offer Mr Samuelsson readily entertained, travelling to LA twice to audition alongside  Gordon, hours of which are captured on video, so we are understandably baffled as to why he would make these statements as well as publicly claim in a recent interview that their paths “haven’t crossed” since the alleged call. ‘We can only think this bizarre denial and these malicious comments have been made in order to garner publicity for Mr Samuelsson’s book and therefore we will pursue such actions as we deem appropriate against Mr Samuelsson and his publishers.’ Samuelsson refused to comment last week but a spokesman, who said they worked on behalf of publisher Random House, said: ‘Mr Samuelsson stands by his statement regarding Mr Ramsay and has no further comment.’ Meeting: Ramsay says he paid to fly Samuelsson to Los Angeles in . February 2010 so he could audition for the U.S. version of Masterchef, pictured . A source familiar with the case said: ‘Gordon is boiling mad. You can accuse him of many things but not of being a racist. He has worked with, and created hundreds of jobs for people of all races, creeds and colours. He will fight all the way to clear his name.’ Samuelsson’s book explains why he failed to acknowledge Ramsay when asked which British chefs he admired. He writes: ‘I had cooked with Gordon Ramsay once, a couple of years earlier, when we did a promotion in Chicago. There were a handful of chefs there . . . and Gordon was rude and obnoxious to all of them. ‘So when I was giving interviews in the lead-up to the Lanesborough event and was asked who inspired me, I thought the best way to  handle it was to say nothing about him at all. I guess he was offended at being left out.’ He claims to have snubbed Ramsay since the alleged phone call. But Ramsay, 45, says that in February 2010 Samuelsson was happy to fly from his New York home to Los Angeles – at Ramsay’s expense – to audition for US MasterChef. Footage of those auditions shows a relaxed Samuelsson chatting happily with Ramsay and joking for the cameras, although he failed to win the judging spot. And Samuelsson’s claims about the phone call were disputed by the person he says handed him the Lanesborough phone, the hotel’s executive chef Paul Gayler. Asked if he recalled Ramsay’s call or if Samuelsson complained about racist comments, Mr Gayler said: ‘I don’t remember that at all. I remember Samuelsson but I don’t remember him speaking to Ramsay. I don’t remember handing the phone to Marcus and saying, “This is Gordon,” no.’","Marcus Samuelsson claims Ramsay made the remark in 2000 at London's Lanesborough Hotel .

In a ruling announced in April, the International Cycling Union accepted that meat Rogers ate in China last year likely caused his positive doping test at the Japan Cup shortly afterward. Rogers, a crucial teammate of two-time Tour champion Alberto Contador, convinced the UCI he wasn't intending to cheat, and said the episode was 'a very difficult time' for his family. He raced last October in China, where clenbuterol is widely administered to livestock to build muscle and reduce fat. The UCI said it disqualified Rogers from the Japanese race but consulted the World Anti-Doping Agency before deciding 'he should not be sanctioned any further.'
