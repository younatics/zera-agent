"Even while recovering from the removal of a cyst from his foot last month, Kei Nishikori was so desperate to be on a tennis court that his joint coach, Dante Bottini, had to improvise. ‘He was sitting on a collapsible chair on the court because he couldn’t run and I was feeding him balls to hit for an hour,’ recalled Bottini after his charge had beaten Novak Djokovic to make tonight’s US Open final. Such dedication is why 24-year-old Japanese Nishikori is poised to become a superstar of Asian sport, and why he has long gone by the not entirely original nickname of Special Kei. Something special: Kei Nishikori, 24, has long gone by the not entirely original nickname of Special Kei . Preparation: Nishikori, the Japanese No 10 seed, practices in New York ahead of the US Open final . Ten years after arriving as a homesick boy at the renowned Nick Bollettieri/IMG Academy in Florida, he is in his first Grand Slam final and will start as favourite against the comparatively towering Marin Cilic. It is the first Grand Slam men’s final in nearly nine years not to feature one of the so-called ‘Big Four’ of Djokovic, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray. But neither of the two surprise finalists would have been top of the list to depose the established order. Cilic, 25, has spent most of his career on the periphery of the top 10, while the fear around Nishikori, the son of an engineer and a piano teacher, is that he is not physically equipped to make the very top. At 5ft 10in and weighing less than 11 stone his body has often failed to cope with the physical aspect of the modern game, although his natural talent has never been in question. He has always possessed an outstanding backhand and won his first ATP Tour title at Delray Beach as an 18-year-old. Subsequently the questions have not just surrounded his physique but his mentality, particularly when it came to facing the best players. Over the past week he has answered all of that with consecutive five-set wins over Milos Raonic and Stan Wawrinka, followed by Saturday’s semi-final against Djokovic, who he outlasted over four sets in brutal heat and humidity. Coming of age: Nishikori's beaten Milos Raonic, Stan Wawrinka and Novak Djokovic en route to the final . Brad Gilbert, who formed part of his coaching set-up in 2011, describes him as ‘very quiet and shy’. His faltering mastery of English may have been a part of that, and Gilbert would email him tactical instructions for matches, rather than talk to him. The missing ingredient appears to have been the addition of French Open winner Michael Chang to his team, part of the trend set by Murray when he hired Ivan Lendl. Like Lendl, Chang has managed to get through to his charge in a way that did not happen before. ‘We get on great,’ said Chang. ‘With myself being Chinese and Kei Japanese there are cultural differences but also similarities because we are both Asian. If we are going out to eat we don’t have to say “Do you want Asian food?” It has been easy for us to adapt to one another.’ Nishikori missed several tournaments last month due to the cyst, but Chang believes that this has proved to be a blessing in disguise. ‘It wasn’t the best preparation but after three weeks off he arrived fresh and hungry. Some guys have a great summer but by the time the Open comes around they are tired. Support network: Nishikori has shone since Michael Chang took over as his coach . ‘I told him if he could get past the first two rounds anything could happen. I keep reminding him he has beaten everyone here, and not to be satisfied with what he has achieved already.’ Chang was a terrific fighter with lightning foot speed. Nishikori is also quick but his natural timing gives him more potent weapons than his coach ever had, despite his relative lack of size. It has led him to become easily the best player ever from Japan, which has always produced good female players but struggled much more on the men’s side. Their previous best of the modern era was Shuzo Matsuoka in the nineties, who is perhaps best remembered for suffering a spectacular bout of cramp that led to the rules being changed about on-court treatment. Nishikori would become the first Japanese man to win a tennis Major, and the commercial possibilities of that would be almost limitless. Either way, tennis is going to get its least predictable men’s Grand Slam champion since Juan Martin del Potro upset Federer at Flushing Meadows five years ago. Federer was phlegmatic after his straight-sets defeat by the hugely impressive Cilic, but this was a golden opportunity missed for him to add to his 17 Grand Slams. Nishikori has a 5-2 record over Cilic and has beaten him twice this year. Yet the Croatian has improved significantly and is an outstanding mover for his height, meaning that the Japanese can only be considered a marginal favourite.

"When Kei Nishikori and Marin Cilic step into the Arthur Ashe stadium for Monday night's US Open final they will know a place in the history books awaits. Not only will the pair be battling to win their maiden Grand Slam, they will also cap a remarkable year for tennis as it will be the first time since 1998 that eight different players – four men and four women - have won the major tournaments. 2014 started with shock wins for Stanislas Wawrinka and Li Na at the Australian Open and on Sunday saw Serena Williams become the fourth female Grand Slam winner this year after Na (Aus Open), Maria Sharapova (French Open) and Petra Kivitova (Wimbledon). Impressive: Marin Cilic swept aside five-time champion Roger Federer to reach the US Open final . Talented: Kei Nishikori, No 8 seed on the ATP World Tour, goes into Monday's showdown as slight favourite . And 24-year-old Nishikori - who stunned world No 1 Novak Djokovic in four sets - and Cilic - who overpowered Roger Federer – will be aiming to follow in the footsteps of Warwrinka (Aus Open), Rafael Nadal (French Open) and Djokovic (Wimbledon). For Nishikori, it will be an even more momentous occasion as he becomes the first Japanese player to play in a Grand Slam singles final, a victory would see him become the first male Asian winner of the 'big four'. It will also be the first Grand Slam final since the Australian Open in 2005 that none of Nadal, Federer or Djokovic will appear. Emulate: Cilic says Wawrinka's success at the Australian Open has given him renewed belief he can succeed . Speaking before Monday night's final Cilic told BBC Sport that Wawrinka's success at the beginning of the year had given other players a greater hope this season saying: 'Wawrinka opened the doors for us from the second group. 'Most of the guys have now bigger belief they can do it at the Grand Slams. It's a bit of a change-up year.' Cilic's coach, Croatian Wimbledon 2001 winner Goran Ivanisevic, added on the match-up: 'It's going to be the first final for both of the guys,' added Ivanisevic. 'They're going to be nervous but whoever wins is going to be on top of the world - Mount Everest!' Australian Open: Men's winner: Wawrinka, Women's winner: Li Na .

"Inking: Helen Mirren's tattoo, which she has revealed is a symbol of tolerance . She first described it as nothing more than a drunken act of rebellion from her youth. But Dame Helen Mirren has now revealed the significance of the tattoo etched on her left hand. The pattern of interlocking Vs denotes ‘love thy neighbour’ among tattoo artists – and for the Oscar-winning actress it is a daily reminder of the importance of tolerance. The star will next be seen in the film The Hundred Foot Journey in which she plays icy French chef Madame Mallory. Produced by Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey, it is based on the best-selling novel by Richard C Morais and is set in the countryside around Toulouse in France. It tells the story of the friction that follows when a culinary genius opens an Indian restaurant - Maison Mumbai - 100 feet from a Michelin-starred classical French establishment run by Madame Mallory. The 68-year-old actress said: ‘I have a tattoo that means ""love they neighbour"" – even if your neighbour is as different from you as you can possibly imagine. The story of this film is in my tattoo. ‘But ""love they neighbour"" is by far the hardest of the commandments. ‘That’s where real hatred is bred. It’s the guy living next door who cuts the tree down, or the one whose kids scream the whole night. ‘Your neighbours are as important as your house. When you have great ones it’s incredible – they’re someone you can leave the key with when you travel.’ Dancer: Helen Mirren also spoke of her love of twerking, and how she is a fan of Beyoncé . Although born and raised in England, Dame Helen said she has never felt English – only British. Speaking in an interview with Hello! she said: ‘Although I was brought up in Britain [Dame Helen was born in Hammersmith, London] I’m half-Russian as my father was born in Russia. When I’m in Russia, I feel that very strongly. 'Mad': Dame Helen said that 'only prisoners, sailors and Hell's Angels' got tattooed when she got hers . ‘To be honest I never felt very English. Maybe British, but not just English.’ And Dame Helen’s tattoo is not her only nod at a liberal mind set, the star is also a huge fan of R’n’B singer Beyoncé and she loves to twerk: ‘It’s true, I’m a huge fan of Beyoncé and I do love to twerk. I love dance. I am mesmerised by it. 'It's unbelievable how they do it. I always like it when a new dance arrives on the scene.’ Asked if she had practised twerking in secret in front of the mirror, she replied: ‘I actually might have done that.’ In recent years Dame Helen has become best-known for her portrayal of The Queen both on the big screen and on stage prompting Prince William to joke earlier this year that he should probably call her ‘Granny’ when he presented her with a Bafta Academy Fellowship award. Commenting on her tattoo in the past, Dame Helen said she acquired the tattoo when she ‘got very drunk’ while acting with an American Indian theatre group on a reservation in Minnesota. ‘About six of us got them at the same time,’ she added. ‘It’s a kind of mad bonding thing that you do from time to time in your life. ‘It was my little act of rebellion. It was done with a safety pin and was very painful. ‘I’ve never regretted it. But back then, only prisoners, sailors and Hell’s Angels got tattooed. Now it’s gone madly out of control.’ And despite now being married to director Taylor Hackford for 15 years, Dame Helen said she still did not believe in the union: ‘Not at all. I couldn’t see the point until a financial adviser told me how much money we would be saving. I was on board immediately. ‘As you get older, you start thinking about wills and planning for your estate. We realised it was going to be so much clearer if we got married.’","Helen Mirren, 68, spoke of how the tattoo reminds her to be tolerant .

It was unexpected.' The discovery was made in the ruins of a Byzantine public structure located in the Ophel region - between the city of David and around 50 metres from the southern wall of the First Temple. Temple Mount is considered one of the most religious sites in Jerusalem and is where two biblical Jewish temples once stood. It is also a site of Muslim interest site known as the Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary. This area is thought to be part of an ancient city wall in Jerusalem dating back to the 10th century BC, possibly built by King Solomon.

Ophel, marked here by A, is an area of Jerusalem between the City of David and the southern wall of the First Temple . The inscription is written in an ancient language called Canaanite - originally spoken by a group of Biblical people before they were conquered by the Israelites in 1000BC. The language was later revived among certain groups living in the region. It consists of a letters that appear to translate to m, q, p, h, and n. Although the meaning and full translation has not been carried out yet, Mazar believes the inscription could be the name of the jar's owner. Mazar told the Times of Israel she believed the artefacts formed part of a 'communal treasure meant to help the sparse Jewish community survive hard times or rebuild what the Jews hoped would be a free community under Persian rule.'","Discovery made in an area called Ophel at the base of Temple Mount .

"The Kremlin was accused yesterday of faking video footage of an alleged Ukrainian missile attack on pro-Russian separatists. The apparent deception was seen as an attempt by Moscow to discredit the government in Kiev and provide a pretext for further Russian military action in Ukraine. A sequence of images released by Russian military chiefs appeared to show a blazing rocket landing on a rebel-occupied block of flats in the Ukrainian city of Makiyivka, 15 miles from the regional capital Donetsk. Original: The video of a failed launch of a Russian satellite-carrying rocket from the Baikonur space centre in Kazakhstan in July last year . Fake? TV footage, released by Russian military chiefs, with apparently superimposed buildings being 'bombed' The dramatic footage was broadcast by a TV channel controlled by the Russian Defence Ministry with a commentary accusing Kiev of indiscriminately attacking civilians. According to Ukrainian authorities, however, the film was of the bungled launch of a Russian satellite-carrying rocket from the Baikonur space centre in Kazakhstan in July last year. A photograph of the Proton-M rocket – which crashed during the failed launch – appears to have been superimposed on photographs of the block of flats in Makayivka to give the impression the building was under attack from a Tochka short-range ballistic missile. The Ukrainian National Security Council said: ‘The trajectory and cloud of smoke of the rocket match the botched Baikonur launch. Original: Ukrainian authorities say the photograph of this rocket crash was used to fake the bombing, so that Russian chiefscould discredit the government in Kiev . Fake? They said the image had been superimposed onto photographs of the block of flats in Makayivka, Ukraine to give the impression the building was under attack from a Tochka short-range ballistic missile . 'This video clearly demonstrates how the Russian propaganda factory... does not hesitate to distort the facts.’ There was no response from the Russians and the footage was later withdrawn from the TV station’s website. In a further heightening of tension, the Kremlin was accused of looting military equipment from Ukraine and taking it to Russia in lorries that Moscow had claimed were delivering humanitarian aid to the war-torn eastern region. Ukrainian border guards were not allowed to inspect the 227 trucks as they rolled back into Russia yesterday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel flew to Kiev yesterday for talks with President Poroshenko and called for an immediate ceasefire.","Kremlin accused of faking video of alleged attack on pro-Russian separatists .

Ahead of meeting Ukraine's president Petro Poroshenko, Merkel said she would advise him 'that the conflict can only be resolved politically and that a cease-fire must be reached as soon as possible.'

"Draped in Malaysian flags and carried by soldiers, the bodies of three of the MH17 victims, including the doomed plane's chief steward, were brought back to Kuala Lumpur this morning. Malaysia Airlines crew members, dressed smartly in their uniforms, wept as the coffin containing the remains of Mohd Ghafar Abu Bakar, 54, was unloaded and carried to a waiting hearse by nine soldiers. An urn containing the ashes of Universiti Malaysia Sabah lecturer Ng Shi Ing, 32, also arrived in Malaysia today, along with the body of a third victim - who has not been identified following a request by family members. Unhappy homecoming: Soldiers from the Royal Malay Regiment prepare for the repatriation of three victims of the MH17 plane crash in Kuala Lumpur today . Military honours: A coffin containing the remains of MH17's chief steward, Mohd Ghafar Abu Bakar, is carried by soldiers after it was brought back to Kuala Lumpur International Airport this morning . All three were given full military honours for the repatriation ceremony, as were the 20 passengers and crew members brought back two days ago. Airline pilots and cabin crew joined family members for a minute's silence in honour of the three victims, before the hearses were driven past the assembled crown en route to their final resting places. Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin and Transport Minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai also attended the solemn procession after the bodies were flown home on a commerical jet from Amsterdam, arriving at around 6.30am, local time. Tears: Malaysian Airlines crew members, many of them colleagues of Mr Bakar cry during this morning's handover ceremony . In mourning: Father-of-four Mr Bakar had been a popular steward, and many of his colleagues attended the repatriation ceremony today . Time to remember: Malaysia Airlines pilots take part in a minute's silence in honour of the victims . Mr Bakar's coffin was then taken to Ampang for burial, while Ms Ng's ashes were taken to the Xiao En Bereavement Centre in Cheras. The body of Ms Ng's sister Elisabeth Ng Lyeti, 33, was brought back on Friday, and the ashes of both sisters will kept at the centre until the remains of the English language lecturer's one-year-old baby son Benjamin Lee Jian Han can be repatriated. The sisters had been planning their trip to Belgium, where Ms Ng attended a research conference for almost a year, while her husband, Lieutenant Commander Lee Vee Weng - who carried his wife's flag-draped urn into the centre this morning - stayed in Malaysia due to his work commitments with the Royal Malaysian Navy. Lost love: Mr Bakar's wife, Normi Abdullah (second left ), cries during the ceremony at  Kuala Lumpur International Airport as her husband's body was finally brought home . All 298 people onboard flight MH17 died when the jet was shot down over an area of Ukraine controlled by pro-Russia separatists on a flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. The victims included 43 Malaysians and 195 Dutch nationals. An international investigation is ongoing, but no one has been arrested. The return of the bodies  has represented a political triumph for Prime Minister Najib Razak, whose already shaky popularity ratings were hit by his handling of the still unsolved disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and its 239 passengers and crew in March. Najib has claimed personal credit for negotiating a deal with pro-Russian separatists for the return of all the bodies. Few details have been released over what the separatists were given in return, and some critics have said that the negotiations with people many regard as terrorists set a dangerous precedent.

"Thankful: Jeff Bauman, 28, has thanked his rescuers and the city of Boston for their support . Boston bombing survivor Jeff Bauman has penned a moving letter to the city, thanking its residents, volunteers and emergency responders for saving his life. 'Thank you for being there for me,' he wrote. 'Thank you for kicking ass. Thank you for proving that nothing will ever stop us from being who we are.' The letter appeared on the commemorative fold out cover of the Boston Herald on Tuesday - marking the one-year anniversary of the bombings that killed three, injured 270 and cost Bauman, 28, both of his legs. In the note, he revealed that he will not be attending the Boston Marathon next Monday, even though he had initially planned to walk and show the crowd how far he had come. Instead, he will be spending the day with his family, a decision he believes is best for his health. 'In . the end, this city doesn't need me to prove anything,' he wrote. 'You . prove every day what kind of city you are: The best in the world.'

"A college football player who was convicted of rape and expelled from the Air Force Academy is finding his way into the public spotlight again - this time as a college football star in Mississippi. Jamil Cooks, 23, is a defensive end for the Alcorn State University Braves and has been one of the team's standout players this year. In 2013, he was convicted of sexual assault and expelled from the US Air Force Academy as part of a crackdown on sexual violence.

His registered address is a dorm on the Alcorn State campus . He must register as a sex offender in the state of Mississippi. His address is listed as a dorm on campus. Alcorn State, a historically black university with 3,900 students, has seemingly welcomed him with open arms. A spokesman for the college told ABC News that the university has 'no problem' with his enrollment there. Cooks has been celebrated as 'player of the week' by Alcorn State . Incredibly, the NCAA has no rules barring convicted sex offenders from competing in college sports. Cooks had been a standout players on the Air Force Academy football team before he was arrested in 2012 on allegations that he raped a woman in her dorm room on the Colorado Springs campus in 2011, the Colorado Spring Gazette reports. Cooks' lawyer says the player was falsely accused and that the woman came forward because she was angry he didn't want a relationship. Cooks was also charged with unlawfully entering the dorms of two other female cadets. In 2013, he was convicted of sexual assault by a court martial and sentenced to time served, about a year. He was expelled from the school and kicked out of the Air Force. Alcorn State has refused to comment on why officials allowed Cooks to join the team. The fifth-year senior was named the university's athlete of the week earlier this season after recording six tackles, three of them for a loss, and one sack. Two weeks ago against Texas Southern University he recorded six tackles and three and a half sacks, for a total loss of 11 yards.","Jamil Cooks was convicted of rape at the US Air Force Academy in 2013 and kicked out of the military .

"The father of Martin Richard, the eight-year-old boy who was killed in the Boston Marathon bombings, has revealed that he accidentally still sets the table for five. In a moving article in the Boston Globe, Bill Richard said that he and his wife Denise notice the hole where Martin should be every day - from family trips to sports games to an empty seat in the back of the car. And after setting one plate too many at the dinner table, Bill quietly puts the extra away. Tuesday will mark one year since Martin was killed near the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon. His then-seven-year-old sister Jane's lost her left leg in the tragedy, while Bill's ear drums were ruptured and Denise was struck with shrapnel, leaving her blind in one eye. Their eldest son Henry could do nothing but watch in horror and call out for his brother as smoke swirled around them, and is now working through his emotional wounds. As Jane told doctors: 'My brother Henry only got some cuts, but was hurt in his heart.' Strong: Bill Richard shares a playful moment with his daughter, Jane, as the two wait for a doctor at a Boston Hospital in February. The family have spoken out about their grief and their endurance a year after son Martin was killed in the bombings . Fighter: Jane, who lost a leg in the bombings, strides down the hallway of United Prosthetics in Dorchester last month after learning she would be getting a special prosthesis that would help her run. Her father Bill is pictured left . Joy: Jane, 8, grins as she gets her first look at the running blade that she will be fitted with at United Prosthetics in Dorchester . Thankful: Jane, who has remained active since the tragedy, hugs Gary Martino of United Prosthetics who had helped fit her new running blade . Now the family - who have stayed largely out of the public eye all year - are sharing how they have battled their grief, and how they have been touched by the unwavering support of friends, strangers and even celebrities - including Taylor Swift, who has sent the family a signed guitar and clothes for Jane. They have also been welcomed to the White House, where they met President Obama and his wife Michelle just ahead of Christmas. The First Lady complimented Jane on her dress and Jane complimented the first family on their decorations. 'I was up all night setting them up,' President Obama jokingly told them. As Bill and Denise pushed through Martin's favorite events, such as Halloween, and worried about the grief hitting them, they were stunned by the determination of their children. Jane, now 8, was put in a medically-induced coma after the bombings and underwent 14 surgeries, before learning how to walk again at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. She returned to school after the summer and has been fitted with different prosthetics, including a curved leg that will help her run. Loss: Martin Richard, left, was just 8 when he was killed by the Boston Marathon bombers. He is pictured right with (from L-R) his sister Jane, father Bill, mother Denise and older brother Henry ahead of the bombings. His parents and sister suffered life-changing injuries while his brother Henry witnessed the tragedy . Well wishers: Bill Richard reads a letter from a school in Oregon at his family's home - just one of thousands of kind letters that the family has received . Gifts: Among the presents that the family have received is this sketch of Martin for a calendar by artist Dianne Nyitray-Kaericher . Missed: A Phoenix Coyotes jersey emblazoned with Martin Richard's name, worn by defenseman Keith Yandle, hangs in the window of the family's living room . Jane has been matter-of-fact about her . injury, even using her leg for Show and Tell and answering questions . from inquisitive classmates, the Globe reported. Henry . also returned to school after the bombings and the Richards declined . special services offered by the school, insisting that their son should . not be singled out because of the tragedy. He . quickly fell back into his routine, taking part in sports events and . remaining on the honor roll. Then earlier this year, the family received . the fantastic news that he had been accepted to Boston Latin School, an . elite school that only accepted 500 students from across the city. But . Henry has also shown moments of sadness, including when he learned a . text message his brother had sent him ahead of the marathon had . disappeared. He would sometimes look at his parents and say: 'I miss Martin.' The family decided to take their love for Martin and set up a foundation, Team MR8, in his memory. The charity will focus on bringing his world view to others, explaining that he was a school peacemaker and recognized at a young age that while we are all different, we are all the same'. Celebration: Jane covers her ears as organizers, runners, and members of her family - including her parents and big brother Henry, center - cheer during a group photo at a kick-off for Team MR8, the Richard family's marathon team to honor Martin . Fears: Denise Richard comforts her daughter Jane as a video showing images of the 2013 Boston Marathon before the bombing play during a meeting for the family's 2014 marathon team set up in Martin's honor . Powering through: Jane runs down the stairs at her family home as she gets ready to leave for an appointment at Spaulding in February . Battle: Jane's mother Denise (center) looks on as the little girl uses a treadmill during a session with physical therapist Jean Murby in February . Together: Denise, pictured in February with Jane after her check up, is blind in her right eye after she was hit with shrapnel in the bombings . More than 100 runners are raising money for MR8 - which supports sports and academics - in the marathon next Monday, and have so far raised more than $880,000, far surpassing the aim of $750,000. When Bill appeared at the foundation's launch in February he told guests that the family knew they had to do it for Martin. 'It became clear to us over the last few months that we would not run from the [Marathon] but embrace it to help us heal, to honor my son and his message, and to pay it forward,' he said. He told the runners that his son had been determined to run a marathon as soon as he was old enough. He encouraged them to shout for joy for Martin as they crossed the finish line. 'His first marathon is yours,' he told them. The moving Boston Glove article comes after another interview this weekend, in which Bill described the terrifying moments following the bombings. Contemplation: Bill, who suffered two perforated ear drums in the explosion, has taken to meditation to help deal with the pain and grief . Quiet: Henry Richard flips through his homework at home before leaving for school in February. Earlier this year, the family learned that Henry, who has persevered quietly through his grief, had been accepted into one of the top schools in the area . Close watch: Denise Richard watches as her 12-year-old son, Henry, walks to his school bus stop in Dorchester in February . By his side: Pictured last month, Denise puts her arm around her son, Henry, as they leave track practice, one of the many activities that keep him busy . He recounted how he had urged his family to leave after they heard the first bomb - but the second detonated beside them moments later. Jane screamed when she saw her left leg had gone and called out for her brother Martin, who was already dead. Henry was covered in nails which had been packed into the pressure cooker and had burns on his legs. Bill could barely hear and had a ball . bearing buried deep in his left shin. His jeans and trainers had been . torn and he kept repeating to himself: 'It happened. It happened.' In the chaos afterwards doctors tried to calm him down but he told them: 'Relax? My son is dead. How can I relax?' As . they arrived at hospital he took a call on his mobile phone from Denise . who was at a different hospital and she confirmed what he suspected . already, that Martin was dead. Jane was distraught and asked from her stretcher: 'Where's Martin? Where's Martin?' Bill tried to calm Henry down and stop him crying by telling him: 'Jane and Mom are OK, and we're going to be OK.' Staying busy: Jane, who underwent 14 surgeries following the bombings, makes a braid out of pipe cleaners as she gets ready for school in February . Joy: Her parents look on as Jane reacts to a magician after he performed a card trick during her eighth birthday party earlier this year . Standing tall: Jane is pictured walking on her new leg last October with her choir before they sang the national anthem at a Red Sox game . The interview with the family also reveals how things could so easily have been different. Ahead of the marathon, Bill had been busy with the environmental company he ran and the rest of the family were a 'whirlwind of pickups and drop-offs, sleepovers and birthday parties, homework, community projects, coaching, and church'. They . nearly went away for the weekend of the marathon but Bill had too much . work on and could not get the time off, he explained.

"Out of control: Professor Dame Sally Davies said the willingness of GPs to give out drugs was causing the spread of superbugs . Family doctors are fuelling the spread of superbugs by needlessly ‘dishing out’ antibiotics, the country’s top medical adviser has said. Professor Dame Sally Davies accused GPs of prescribing powerful drugs to patients who are reluctant to take time off work with minor illnesses. She also called for sick animals to be slaughtered rather than treated to prevent a looming crisis in antibiotic resistance. Dame Sally, the Chief Medical Officer for England, warned of a growing postcode lottery in which it is twice as easy to get an antibiotics prescription from a GP in Newcastle than in parts of London. And she called for a 24-hour delay in prescriptions to stop people taking the drugs if they don’t need them. Speaking at the Cambridge Science Festival, she said: ‘There is evidence that some GPs are dishing out more than they need to for medical clinical disease. ‘We’ve clearly got it wrong, and I would argue that GPs do need more training. If we don’t take action, deaths will go up and up and modern medicine as we know it will be lost.’ Antibiotics are designed to fight bacteria, but are routinely given for viral infections. Experts are worried that high usage of antibiotics increases the chances of bacteria becoming resistant to them – fuelling a breed of superbugs such as MRSA and making illness more difficult to treat in the long term. Last year Dame Sally asked the Government to put antibiotic resistance on the national risk register – ranking it alongside a large-scale terrorist attack or flu pandemic. She warned that without action we may return to a ‘19th-century environment’ within 20 years, in which routine operations such as transplants carry a deadly risk because of the risk of untreatable infections. About 35million antibiotic prescriptions are given out by doctors in England every year. The biggest prescribers are in western Newcastle, where one in 12 patients were given the medication in 2012. That is twice as many as the lowest, in Camden, north London, where one in 25 received a prescription the same year. Dame Sally said: ‘You can’t tell me that in Newcastle West they’ve got more sick people, more than double, than in Camden. 'So there’s something about prescribing practice.’ Statistics reveal a pronounced north-south divide in prescribing rates, with 69 per cent of northern areas prescribing more than the national average, compared with 39 per cent of those in the south. Over the counter: Experts are worried that high usage of antibiotics increases the chances of bacteria becoming resistant to them (file picture) 'Dame Sally said patients often pressure GPs to dish out prescriptions, and called for more training.Doctors’ guidelines have advised against giving antibiotics for coughs and colds since 1998. ]# . 'But the Government’s own research has shown antibiotics are prescribed for up to 80 per cent of such minor ailments – despite being more likely to be caused by a virus than a bacteria. Dame Sally said: ‘It is very difficult for GPs. They get patients coming and saying, “I’ve got an ear infection”, or more often “my child has an infection”. They say, “Give me an antibiotic so I can go to work”. Mass: Around one in 16 people in Britain are prescribed antibiotics each year . ‘I don’t beat GPs up because I think it’s very difficult when you’re faced with a mother who is very anxious with a sick child with a high temperature.’ She also called for a cut in the use of antibiotics in farm animals, one of the biggest causes of resistance to the drugs. Controversially, she urged vets to slaughter sick animals rather than give them antibiotics to help them recover. She said: ‘I had a bit of a problem with some vets recently because I said, “Why don’t you just slaughter animals when they’re badly infected?” It seems to me much better because then they can’t transmit them [antibiotics]. ‘At the moment, if you eat a farmed salmon in America it has probably eaten its own weight in antibiotics.’ Dame Sally called for the adoption of a delayed prescription system for patients, to drive down use of drugs. She said: ‘The doctor writes the prescription and hands it to the parents and says, “If your child is still sick in 24 hours and hasn’t improved, go and get your prescription.” ’ She also accused drugs companies of failing to invest in developing new antibiotics, because ‘they don’t make a profit’. No new class of antibiotic has been discovered since 1987. In contrast, a new infection emerges on an almost yearly basis. She added: ‘I’m really worried about this. This is like climate change. We are doing it to ourselves and we could die of it if we don’t do something now.’ Around one in 16 people in Britain are prescribed antibiotics each year. Doctors . have been advised not to give patients antibiotics for minor illnesses . since 1998, but Government research suggests the drugs are prescribed . for up to 80 per cent of coughs, colds and sore throats.Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria adapt to survive the medicines intended to destroy them. Standard treatments become ineffective and infections persist, increasing  risk of spreading to others. High . doses of the drugs – whether for humans or animals – increase the . problem by accelerating the speed at which bacteria adapt. Resistance . to the drugs has led to the rise of superbugs against which there is no . treatment, such as MRSA and clostridium difficile. Dame Sally warns that within 20 years it may be impossible to fight common infections, making routine operations dangerous. But . critics claim that so-called ‘antibiotic  prohibitionists’ such as Dame .

"Wonder drug: A new heart drug has shown to cut deaths by a fifth and reduce hospital admissions . Thousands of lives could be saved by a new drug for heart failure that researchers claim outperforms the current best treatments. Clinical trials for the new drug – currently called LCZ696 – were halted early because of the ‘emphatic’ results delivered by the treatment. Research on more than 8,000 patients found that it saved 20 per cent more lives than the current ‘gold standard’ treatment – the ACE inhibitor enalapril. A co-leader of the trial, Professor John McMurray of the University of Glasgow, said: ‘We have what we believe is a much more effective replacement for one of the gold standard drugs for the treatment of heart failure. This is a major advance in the treatment of this terrible problem.’ Heart failure affects almost 900,000 Britons, most of them elderly, and claims 140,000 lives a year. It causes symptoms of fatigue, breathlessness, increased heart rate and swollen ankles, and can lead to serious complications. It occurs when the heart cannot pump blood around the body effectively, possibly following a heart attack. The body responds to the low flow of blood by producing hormones such as angiotensin II and noradrenaline. But these hormones constrict blood vessels and actually make it harder for the failing heart to squeeze blood into them. Over time, the constant production of these hormones further damages the heart, blood vessels and kidneys. Enalapril, the current treatment, works by blocking them, which slows or halts the progressive worsening of the condition. Professor McMurray said LCZ696 has a similar impact but the twice-a-day tablet has additional benefits. ‘What this new drug does is simultaneously inhibit the bad hormones – like enalapril – but in addition boosts the production of beneficial hormones,’ he told a meeting of the European Society of Cardiology in Barcelona. ‘Several of these stimulate the kidneys to produce more urine – to excrete sodium and water – and act to relax blood vessels. All of these actions unload the failing heart. By having this dual effect LCZ696 had extra beneficial actions compared with enalapril and in this way improved patient outcomes.’ In the trial 8,400 patients with heart failure were given either 200mg of LCZ696 twice daily or 10mg of enalapril twice daily – in addition to recommended therapy – in a bid to compare mortality and hospitalisation rates. Early results published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that 914 (21.8 per cent) of patients in the LCZ696 group died of cardiovascular causes, compared with 1,117 (26.5 per cent) in the enalapril group. A further 711 (17 per cent) of patients receiving LCZ696 and 835 (19.8 per cent) of those receiving enalapril died of other causes. This represented a 20 per cent reduction in death from cardiovascular causes and a 16 per cent reduction in death from any cause for those in the LCZ696 group. Improvement? Sicentists claim it will prevent more deaths than the current heart treatment Enalapril does . The new compound also reduced hospitalisation for heart failure by a fifth, experts said. The ‘emphatic’ results prompted researchers to bring the trial to an early close after 27 months. Another study leader, Professor Milton Packer of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Centre, described the findings as ‘highly statistically significant and clinically important’. The drug’s manufacturer, Novartis, plans to apply for a licence early next year, meaning LCZ696 could be available in 2015. Professor McMurray said: ‘Compared with our current gold-standard bedrock treatment enalapril, LCZ696 made patients live longer, stay out of hospital and feel better, fulfilling all our goals of treatment. ‘This is a remarkable finding.’ Nick Hartshorne-Evans, CEO of the heart failure charity The Pumping Marvellous Foundation, said: ‘Heart failure is a major and growing public health problem in the UK. Almost one million people in the UK live with the syndrome but awareness of it is low. We welcome the results of large-scale clinical trials, especially those that might advance the medical treatment of such an under-invested area.’","LCZ696 described as a 'major advance' in the treatment of heart failure .

"Pomegranates may help stop the spread of Alzheimer’s disease, claim scientists. An ingredient called punicalagin helps prevent the inflammation that destroys brain cells known as micrologia, according to a team at the University of Huddersfield. It is hoped the findings may also potentially benefit sufferers from rheumatoid arthritis and Parkinson’s disease by reducing painful inflammation from these conditions. Scroll down for video . Researchers have found that a chemical in pomegranates could help stop the spread of Alzheimer's disease . Alzheimer’s affects 800,000 people in the UK, with 163,000 new cases a year being diagnosed. The key breakthrough in laboratory experiments is showing that punicalagin - which is a form of chemical compound known as a polyphenol – found in pomegranate fruit, can inhibit inflammation in specialised brain cells known as micrologia. This inflammation leads to the destruction of more and more brain cells, making the condition of Alzheimer’s sufferers progressively worse. There is still no cure for the disease, but the punicalagin in pomegranate could prevent it or slow down its development. A new study was headed by Dr Olumayokun Olajide, who worked with co-researchers at the University of Huddersfield’s Department of Pharmacy and scientists at the University of Freiburg in Germany. The team used brain cells isolated from rats to test their findings, which have been published in the journal Molecular Nutrition & Food Research. Dr Olajide is still working on the amounts of pomegranate that are required, in order to be effective in the form of a drug. However, he pointed out that juice products which are 100 per cent pomegranate contain approximately 3.4 per cent punicalagin. He said ‘But we do know that regular intake and regular consumption of pomegranate has a lot of health benefits – including prevention of neuro-inflammation related to dementia.’ Dr Olajide says most of the anti-oxidant compounds are found in the outer skin of the pomegranate, not in the soft part of the fruit. Although this has yet to be scientifically proven, pomegranate may be useful in any condition for which inflammation – not just neuro-inflammation of the brain – is a factor, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson’s and cancer. The Middle Eastern fruit used for centuries as a folk medicine is claimed to be effective against heart disease, high blood pressure, inflammation and some cancers, including prostate cancer. The researchers identified a chemical compound punicalagin which can combat neuro-inflammation, file pic . Dr Olajide is collaborating with organic chemist Dr Karl Hemming, of The University of Huddersfield, in order to produce compound derivatives of punicalagin that could the basis of new, orally administered drugs that would treat neuro-inflammation. Meanwhile, a separate study has suggested that stimulating the brain using an electric current could improve memory – opening the way for treatment of related problems such as early-stage Alzheimer’s disease and stroke. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) activates a particular region in the brain via non-invasive delivery of electrical current using magnetic pulses. It has been used in a limited way to temporarily change brain function to improve performance during a test, for example, making someone push a button slightly faster while the brain is being stimulated. The latest US study shows TMS can be used to improve memory for events at least 24 hours after the stimulation is given. Scientists recruited 16 healthy adults aged 21 to 40 who had a detailed anatomical image taken of his or her brain as well as 10 minutes of recording brain activity while lying inside an MRI scanner. Each participant underwent a memory test, consisting of associations between faces and words that they were asked to learn and remember, followed by brain stimulation 20 minutes a day for five consecutive days. Both groups performed better on memory tests as a result of the brain stimulation. It took three days of stimulation before they improved, says a report in the journal Science. Researcher Joel Voss, at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said ‘We show for the first time that you can specifically change memory functions of the brain in adults without surgery or drugs, which have not proven effective. ‘This noninvasive stimulation improves the ability to learn new things. It has tremendous potential for treating memory disorders.’ Dr Simon Ridley, Head of Research at Alzheimer’s Research UK charity, said The results of this study shows some potential in the use of a non-invasive technique which may help to improve memory. ‘This was a very small trial with only 16 people and did not look specifically at people with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia. ‘Much more large-scale, long-term research is needed to determine whether this technique would be beneficial to people with dementia.’","Alzheimer's affects 800,000 people in the UK with 163,000 new cases a year .

"Cancer patients can cut their risk of dying by up to half - by walking just one mile a day, experts claim . Cancer patients can cut their risk of dying by up to half – simply by walking just one mile a day, according to experts. A study revealed physical activity as a ‘wonder drug’, with those diagnosed with breast and prostate cancers able to cut their risk of death by up to 40 per cent. And for bowel cancer patients, doubling the walking distance was found to halve the risk of dying. The calculations are based on walking one mile at a moderate pace of 3mph, which would take just 20 minutes a day. The research by Walking for Health, a network of walking groups run by Macmillan Cancer Support and the Ramblers, found physical activity can also reduce the impact of some debilitating side effects of cancer treatment, such as swelling around the arm, anxiety, depression, fatigue, impaired mobility and weight changes. The charity estimates that 1.6million of the two million people living with cancer in the UK are not active at recommended levels. Ciarán Devane, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘Today’s research highlights the very simple reality – walking can save lives. ‘We cannot continue to turn a blind eye to what is a very simple and obvious solution. Physical activity is a wonder drug and health care professionals must prescribe physical activity, such as walking, as a standard part of cancer recovery.’ Sandra Sayce, 51, who is married and lives in Middlesex, joined her local Walking for Health group in 2011 following years of treatment for melanoma. She said ‘I had been ill with cancer for several years, which at its worst had left me unable to walk more than 50 metres. ‘When I joined my local Walking for Health group it gave me the push I needed to make those vital first steps back into physical activity; despite the cold January weather, I was able to take part in the simple, easy-going walk which was crucial to beginning my recovery. Scroll down for video . A study revealed breast cancer patients can cut their risk of death by up to 40 per cent through physical activity . ‘Since then I’ve gone from strength, and I’ve started to feel more happy and less tired. I really do think that making the decision to go on that first walk was crucial to getting myself to the position I’m in now.’ It is unclear how activity helps, but the effect goes further than simply weight control, which cuts down on the amount of cancer-promoting hormones produced by body fat. The latest thinking is exercise may break down oestrogen to produce ‘good’ metabolites that lower the risk of some cancers. The reduction in risk of death from cancer is based on research review evidence in Macmillan Cancer Support’s Move More report. Ciarán Devane (pictured), CEO of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: 'Today’s research highlights the very simple reality – walking can save lives' It says breast cancer patients cut the risk by 40 per cent if they do recommended levels of activity, compared with those doing less than an hour a week. The risk is reduced by 30 per cent for men with prostate cancer. Bowel cancer sufferers who walk 18 miles a week – 2.5 miles or around 50 minutes a day – can cut their risk of dying by 50 per cent. Walking for 150 minutes a week at 3mph results in total walking of 7.5 miles in a week – just over a mile, or 20 minutes a day. Government guidelines advise all adults to do 150 minutes of moderate activity such as gardening, dancing or brisk walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise including playing sport, running or aerobics every week. Just 36 per cent of British women meet the moderate activity target. Benedict Southworth, chief executive of the Ramblers, said: ‘The benefits of walking are numerous. It is increasingly clear that walking even short distances regularly can make the world of difference for those recovering from and managing cancer or other serious health conditions. ‘Walking for Health offers free, short group walks across England, which are the perfect way to build confidence and fitness in a friendly, supportive space. ‘All walks are led by friendly, knowledgeable people, specially trained for the job. Many of our walkers have long term conditions such as cancer themselves and find the companionship and fresh air a wonderful therapy. ‘We want to put walking at the centre of efforts to tackle physical inactivity and echo Macmillan’s call for health professionals to prescribe walking to those who are recovering from cancer or other health conditions.’","Patients can cut risk of dying by half by walking one mile a day, study finds .

"Children at risk of asthma attacks are to have access to emergency inhalers at their schools for the first time. Regulations banning schools from holding inhalers as they contain the prescription drug salbutamol are to be updated. Around 20 school age children die from asthma every year in England and Wales. Children will have access to emergency inhalers at school for the first time under the change in law (posed by model) Campaigners say two thirds of children with asthma have had an asthma attack whilst they’ve been at school. Surveys show almost nine out of 10 children say they have been without their own inhaler because they have forgotten, lost, broken or it has run out. If a child with symptoms of out-of-control asthma does not have access to a blue ‘reliever’ inhaler, teachers may have to urgently contact a doctor or call 999. But from next month schools will be allowed to hold an asthma inhaler in their first aid kit for emergencies. The UK has one of the highest rates of childhood asthma symptoms in the world. Kay Boycott, Chief Executive of Asthma UK, said the charity has been campaigning for a change in regulations. She said ‘One in 11 children in the UK has asthma, the most common long term condition in childhood and more than two thirds of children with asthma have told us they have had an asthma attack whilst they’ve been at school. Jeremy Hunt welcomed the change as a 'common sense step forward' ‘Tragically the equivalent of a classroom of children still die from asthma every year, this simply has to stop. ‘Following a long fought campaign by Asthma UK, schools will be able to legally keep spare emergency inhalers to keep children with asthma safe at school from 1 October. ‘This will not only give reassurance to millions of parents across the UK but it is also vital for the two children in every classroom with asthma to reduce their risk of having a potentially life threatening asthma attack at school.’ The charity’s advice to teachers and other school staff helping a child or young person having an asthma attack is to let them take two puffs of reliever inhaler immediately. In future, schools will be able to get a supply of a small amount of inhalers and a spacer – for ease of use in emergencies – from a local pharmacy using a signed form from the Head Teacher. If a school has more than one site they can get inhalers to cover them all. Any change in the legislation would not make the holding of an inhaler mandatory but give schools the option. Secretary of State for Health Jeremy Hunt said ‘Children with asthma, and their parents, should not have to worry about suffering an asthma attack without having the necessary medication - and this common-sense change is an important step forward.’","Schoolchildren to have access to inhalers for the first time in classroom .

"Potent: This drink contains an even more potent concentration of two of the strongest antioxidants ever discovered, scientists claim . Forget the health benefits of olives and olive oil – the latest boost to wellbeing is the humble olive leaf. It was once a folk remedy revered by the Greeks, while ancient Egyptians used it for mummifying royalty. But a drink made from olive leaf extract – taken from freshly picked Italian organic olive leaves - is the first health supplement of its kind to be launched in Britain. A new scientific review in the journal Complete Nutrition shows it contains two antioxidant compounds known to support heart health that are among the most potent yet discovered. Oleuropein, a polyphenol produced by the olive tree, makes it particularly robust and resistant against insect and bacterial damage. The other compound hydroxytyrosol, is thought to be a major ingredient of virgin olive oil - one of the cornerstones of the heart-healthy Mediterranean diet. Although it is found in olives and olive oil, the highest concentrations occur in the leaf. The 5mg dose contained in a serving of Ovivo Organic Leaf Infusion with Calendula has been approved by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) as having antioxidant activity. Dr Pamela Mason, chair of the Government’s Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances, suggests the combination of hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein may hold the key to many of the health benefits associated with olives and the Mediterranean diet. Both have powerful antioxidant activity and have been shown to reduce the oxidation of ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol – the process that makes it hazardous to health. A study found a twice-a-day 500mg dose of olive extract was as effective as an ACE inhibitor at reducing both diastolic and systolic blood pressure. Unlike the prescription-only blood pressure pill, the extract also significantly lowered levels of triglycerides, blood fats linked to heart problems. Another trial investigating the impact of olive leaf extract on blood sugar control reported a significant improvement in insulin sensitivity after just 12 weeks. The review also included a study in patients with type 2 diabetes which showed improved insulin levels and lower levels of a marker linked to a greater risk of diabetes-related complications. The review concludes: ‘This extremely promising ingredient, olive leaf, is worthy of considerable further research.’ The EFSA approval says the scientific evidence supports the consumption of olive oil because its ‘polyphenols contributes to the protection of blood lipids from oxidative damage’. EFSA says in order to get the protective effect, 5mg of hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives including oleuropein complex should be consumed daily. Although these amounts can be easily consumed in a balanced diet, EFSA says ‘the concentrations in some olive oils may be too low’ to reach the target. Also worthwhile: Olive oil and olives also contain the antioxidants but the new drink is touted as preferable . Nutritionist Dr Emma Derbyshire said ‘The mass of evidence demonstrates these olive polyphenols have a powerful antioxidant effect. ‘We’ve known about the health benefits of olive oil for a long time, and there is evidence of traditional use of olive leaf for healing, but this review confirms the importance of hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein.’ ‘I think this is definitely a case of watch this space.’ she added. ‘These antioxidants appear to have a very broad activity so it’s likely that further research will confirm even more health benefits.’ She said the new product could provide twice the daily dose backed by EFSA in a form that was easily digestible. ‘Ovivo Organic Olive Leaf Infusion is virtually fat free, has no added sugar and is created as an infusion of spring water, which means it mixes easily with juices, smoothies and herbal tea and is suitable for those who avoid alcohol’ she said.","New drink derives from folk remedy revered by Greeks and ancient Egypt .

"Thousands of patients are having to wait too long to start vital treatment for cancer (file picture) Thousands of patients are having to wait too long to start vital treatment for cancer. The NHS recommends that no one should wait longer than 62 days after being referred urgently by their GP for suspected cancer. The target requires 85 per cent of patients to be seen, but this fell to 84.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2014-15, resulting in 10,000 patients waiting too long, say campaigners. The target was also breached for the first time since 2009 in the preceding quarter – the last quarter of 2013-14. The number of people waiting more than 62 days in the first six months of 2014 was 9,906. Figures from NHS England also show that the two-week wait target for women with breast symptoms, not initially thought to be cancer, was breached. The target says 93 per cent of women should be seen quickly by a specialist, but in the last quarter for which figures are available this year it was 90.3 per cent. Mike Hobday, director of policy and research at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘It’s simply not good enough that the cancer waiting time target for patients to begin treatment following an urgent GP referral has been breached in England for the second quarter in a row. ‘Around 10,000 people have already had to wait longer than the recommended 62 days to start their treatment this year. ‘Furthermore, there has been a ten-fold increase over the last year in the number of hospital trusts where patients with suspected cancer are waiting longer than two weeks to be seen by a specialist. ‘This shows that the current system simply isn’t working and people with cancer are being badly let down. Mr Hobday added: ‘We have some of the poorest survival rates for cancer in Europe and Macmillan is calling on all the political parties to prioritise cancer ahead of the next general election.’ Luciana Berger, Labour’s public health spokesman, said: ‘These figures are yet another warning sign the NHS is heading in the wrong direction. Over 9,900 patients had to wait more than 62 days for treatment in the first six months of 2014. The two-week wait target for women with breast symptoms (file image), not initially thought to be cancer, was also breached . ‘David Cameron claimed his NHS re-organisation would improve cancer care. The reality is that he has in fact made it worse.’ NHS England said the number of patients being referred urgently for cancer investigations had gone up by 18 per cent in the last year. In 2013-14 there were 1.3million people referred urgently compared with just over 1million in 2010-11. Criticised: Luciana Berger, Labour’s public health spokesman, said David Cameron's (pictured) NHS re-organisation has worsened cancer care . NHS England said it was setting up a taskforce, with Monitor and the NHS Trust Development Authority, to help the NHS maintain waiting time standards and tackle under-performance where necessary. Sean Duffy, NHS England’s Clinical Director for Cancer, said it was performing well under pressure. He added: ‘It is really good news the number of patients being diagnosed and treated for cancer early is on the rise. We have been encouraging patients to step forward early and they are. ‘We are now treating more people than ever before and as a result the NHS is helping more people than ever survive. 'Over the last five years we have seen a 51 per cent increase in the number of patients referred within two weeks for suspected cancer symptoms, which is good news for improving early diagnosis and survival. ‘We continue to treat the vast majority of patients within a month of deciding treatment is needed and it is imperative that we focus on maintaining waiting times standards as demand for care increases.’ Last night the Department of Health announced that an extra £250million was being given to hospitals and GP-led organisations to keep waiting times down. It follows figures showing that an extra 250,000 patients are waiting for planned surgery or treatment compared to this time last year. A spokesman said the increase was partly due to the ageing population, which means more patients are being referred by GPs.","NHS recommends no one should wait over 62 days after an urgent referral .

"The old saying healthy body, healthy mind has been proved true in physically fit children. U.S. researchers have shown for the first time that youngsters who are more aerobically fit have more ‘white matter’ in their brains, which is a marker for better memory and attention. A new study used brain imaging to explore the link between body and mental fitness in nine and 10-year-olds. Those rated at a higher level of fitness also had brains with more fibrous and compact white matter, the network of nerve fibres important for sending signals between different brain regions. Physically fit children have more 'white matter' in their brains, associated with memory, learning and attention, a team of researchers at Illinois University found . Joint study author Laura Chaddock-Heyman, of Illinois University, said: ‘Previous studies suggest that children with higher levels of aerobic fitness show greater brain volumes in gray-matter brain regions important for memory and learning. ‘Now for the first time we explored how aerobic fitness relates to white matter in children's brains.’ She said the study found significant fitness-related differences in the strength of several white matter tracts in the brain connecting different regions. Dr Chaddock-Heyman said: ‘All of these tracts have been found to play a role in attention and memory.’ It suggests that white matter structure ‘may be one additional mechanism by which higher-fit children outperform their lower-fit peers on cognitive tasks and in the classroom,’ she added. Although the study did not test for cognitive differences in children with different fitness levels, previous research has found fit adults perform better on white matter-related tasks. Psychology professor Doctor Arthur Kramer said: ‘Previous studies in our lab have reported a relationship between fitness and white-matter integrity in older adults. ‘Therefore, it appears that fitness may have beneficial effects on white matter throughout the lifespan.’ The researchers looked at 24 children given scans using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI, also called diffusion MRI) to investigate five white matter tracts. White matter describes the bundles of nerve fibres carrying signals from one brain region to another, with more compact white matter linked with faster and more efficient nerve activity. The scientists found children with a higher level of fitness, had 'greater brain volume' in gray-matter regions . The scans analyse water diffusion into tissues, with less water diffusion denoting more fibrous and compact material with ‘desirable traits’, says a report in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience. Researchers took into account factors such as social and economic status, the timing of puberty, IQ, or a diagnosis of ADHD or other learning disabilities that might have affected the reported fitness differences in the brain. The analysis revealed significant fitness-related differences in the integrity of several white-matter tracts in the brain. To take the findings further, the team is now two years into a five-year trial to determine whether white-matter tract integrity improves in children who begin a new physical fitness routine and maintain it over time. C-researcher Professor Charles Hillman said: ‘Prior work from our laboratories has demonstrated both short and long-term differences in the relation of aerobic fitness to brain health and cognition. ‘However, our current trial should provide the most comprehensive assessment of this relationship to date.’","U.S. researchers have shown for the first time that youngsters who are physically active have more 'white matter' in their brains .

"New mothers who choose not to breastfeed are at double the risk of suffering depression, warn researchers . New mothers who choose not to breastfeed are at double the risk of suffering depression, warn researchers. It is thought they are missing out on vital hormones released during breastfeeding that improve the mother’s mood. Around one in seven new mothers suffer postnatal depression that is more serious than the ‘baby blues’ within 14 weeks of giving birth. Currently one in four women in the UK does not attempt to breastfeed – one of the worst rates in the world – despite evidence showing breast milk protects babies against health problems and confers health advantages in later life. A new study shows new mothers who gain the best protection against depression are those who always planned to breastfeed their babies and are able to do so. They are half as likely to be depressed than those who decide against it during pregnancy – who carry a twofold higher risk as a result. However, the study shows those most at risk are women who planned to breastfeed but are unable to. They are four times more likely to be depressed than women who intended to breastfeed and succeeded. Researchers in the UK and Spain believe more psychological and practical support is needed for women who have difficulties breastfeeding, and fail to do so. Dr Maria Iacovou, one of the authors from the University of Cambridge’s Department of Sociology, said: ‘Breastfeeding has well-established benefits to babies, in terms of their physical health and cognitive development; our study shows that it also benefits the mental health of mothers. ‘Lots of mothers and babies take to breastfeeding pretty easily. But for many others, it doesn’t come naturally at all. For these mothers, having someone with the training, the skills, and perhaps most importantly the time to help them get it right, can make all the difference. ‘However good the level of support that’s provided, there will be some mothers who wanted to breastfeed and who don’t manage to. ‘It’s clear that these mothers need a great deal of understanding and support; there is currently hardly any skilled specialist help for these mothers, and this is something else that health providers should be thinking about.’ The study shows those most at risk are women who planned to breastfeed but are unable to. They are four times more likely to be depressed than women who intended to breastfeed and succeeded . The study published in the journal Maternal and Child Health (must credit) surveyed women who had almost 14,000 babies in the Bristol area during the 1990s when their children were two, eight, 21 and 32 months old. They also examined whether or not the women suffered depression during their pregnancy so they could take into account previous mental health conditions. Their study found that mothers who planned to breastfeed and who actually went on to breastfeed were around 50 per cent less likely to become depressed than mothers who had not planned to, and who did not, breastfeed. Those who planned to breastfeed, but who did not go on to breastfeed, were more than twice as likely to become depressed as women who didn’t want to and four times more at risk than those who succeeded in breastfeeding. This link was found to be most pronounced when the babies were two months old but much smaller by the time they were eight months or older. Dr Iacovou said it was likely that breastfeeding mothers were less depressed because of the beneficial effects of certain hormones released during the process, which are known to have an antidepressant action. ‘This is a biological effect’ she said. ‘But it seems likely to be a psychological thing also affecting women who want to breastfeed and find they can’t. ‘The public health message urging women to breastfeed is strong so if women choosing to do so find they can’t, the feeling of failure could be very depressing. ‘We should be sympathetic towards these women and understanding about their higher risk of depression, so their friends and family can support them,’ she added. The researchers were from Cambridge University, Queen Mary University of London and the University of Seville in Spain.","One in seven new mothers suffer postnatal depression within 14 weeks .

"A new drug could bring relief for the 250,000 Britons who have the serious bowel disorder Crohn’s disease. Vedolizumab is the first to work directly in the gut lining, targeting the inflammation that causes chronic symptoms such as diarrhoea, bleeding and fatigue. In trials, 40 per cent of patients were free of symptoms for at least a year – with healing of the gut lining in some cases. Scroll down to video . A new drug could bring hope to Crohn's disease patient's after the treatment is the first to work in the gut . Vedolizumab is the biggest advance since drugs known as anti-TNFs were developed in the 1990s. Researchers at Barts Health NHS Trust say the new treatment, a course of which costs about £12,000 a year, brings ‘additional options’. The disease may be diagnosed at any age, but it tends to strike early in life. Sufferers have periods of good health as well as times when symptoms are more active, known as relapses or flare-ups. Trial data shows that 40 per cent of patients taking the new treatment are free of symptoms for at least one year, with healing of the gut lining in some sufferers. Twice as many Crohn’s patients were symptom-free as those being treated with a dummy drug, according to trial data on 2,700 patients from centres including London, Cambridge and Cardiff. The drug made by Japan–based Takeda UK is the first of its kind, given by infusion every eight weeks, and a major advance since biologic drugs known as anti-TNFs were developed in the late 1990s. In trials 40 per cent of patients were free of symptoms for at least a year and gut was healed in some cases . Dr James Lindsay, Consultant Gastroenterologist and UK Principal Clinical Trial Investigator, Barts and the London NHS Trust said ‘Over a decade ago, the introduction of anti-TNFs improved the management of UC and CD in patients with moderate to severe disease. ‘Now, for these patients who can face a lifetime of chronic symptoms, vedolizumab offers an additional treatment option with a completely new mode of action that specifically targets inflammation in the gut lining.’ Many Crohn’s patients do not respond to current treatments, or the effects rapidly wear off, and they face major surgery at a very young age. A lifetime of treatment is estimated to cost the NHS up to £720 million per year, which puts the financial burden on par with other chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Researchers at Barts Health NHS Trust say a course of the new treatment costs about £12,000 a year .","Vedolizumab is first to work directly in gut lining targeting inflammation .

"Experts are warning of a huge rise in the number of children with diabetes because their mothers developed the condition during pregnancy . Experts are warning of a huge rise in the number of children with diabetes because their mothers developed the condition during pregnancy. They claim the ‘future will be filled’ with affected children, after a study showed babies exposed to the condition in the womb are six times more likely to develop diabetes or prediabetes than those not exposed. Experts say gestational diabetes is on the increase, driven partly by obesity as well as the rise in older mothers who are more prone to developing the condition while pregnant. The warning comes after a charity report earlier this year found one in seven UK hospital beds are currently occupied by someone with diabetes, pushing the NHS bill for treating it to a record £10billion a year. It is known babies whose mothers develop gestational diabetes may have problems balancing blood sugar levels in early life, but US research has quantified the risk. It looked at 255 obese children with a normal glucose tolerance, who were selected for the study at around the age of 12. All were investigated for exposure to gestational diabetes in the womb and underwent a glucose tolerance test – used to diagnose diabetes – which was repeated three years later. Scientists found 210 children (82 per cent) had not been exposed to gestational diabetes, while 45 (18 per cent) had. Just 9 per cent of those whose mothers did not have the condition developed type 2 diabetes themselves, or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), a prediabetic condition. However, 31 per cent of children whose mothers had gestational diabetes went on to develop either prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, indicating an increased risk of 5.75-fold. Study leader Dr Sonia Caprio, from the Yale School of Medicine, said: ‘Exposure to gestational diabetes was the most significant predictor of developing IGT or type 2 diabetes, with an increased risk of almost six times for those children exposed in the womb.’ A report published in Diabetologia, the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, called the results ‘alarming’. It said the affected group of children showed a reduction in beta cell function – the cells that produce insulin. They also displayed a lower insulin sensitivity, which is linked with type 2 diabetes. The study says: ‘Obese normal glucose-tolerant children of gestational diabetes mothers have pre-existing defects in beta cell function. This is a strong risk factor for these children to develop prediabetes or diabetes. ‘The ever growing number of women with gestational diabetes suggests that the future will be filled with children with early diabetes at a rate that far exceeds the current prevalence.’ Around 15 per cent of British mothers are obese when expecting a child, up from 7 per cent 20 years ago. Doctors have previously warned the obesity epidemic amongst women could jeopardise the health of the next generation.","Experts say gestational diabetes is on increase, driven partly by obesity .

"Working hours cut: A report shows businesses will lose more and more staff who need to care for relatives with Alzheimer's . Thousands of people with dementia and their carers will be forced to give up their jobs, costing employers more than £3billion, warn campaigners. There will be a mounting toll on business from all forms of dementia including Alzheimer’s as the number affected is set to rise to over one million in England by 2030. A new report shows the cost of staff hours that will be lost due to caring for someone suffering from dementia, as well as the loss of skills and experience from the workforce. It says there will be a huge impact on businesses as increasing numbers of workers are obliged to reduce hours, change work patterns or even quit their jobs due to the demands of caring. The number of people leaving paid employment to care for people with dementia will rise from 50,000 in 2014 to 83,100 in 2030, says the report from the Centre for Economics and Business Research. The cost of lost hours of workers with dementia forced to retire will go up from £628 million to reach £1.2 billion by 2030, it says. This will be dwarfed by the £2.2billion cost of carers forced to quit, while £763 million will be lost by carers’ curtailing their hours. Companies must adapt the working environment to help sufferers and their carers in order to minimise the financial burden, and provide support to their workforce, says the report. For example, if companies used flexible working to increase their employment rate of dementia carers by just over two per cent   the retention of these skilled and experienced staff would deliver a saving of £415 million by 2030. The report was released by Public Health England and Alzheimer’s Society, who recently joined forces to launch the Dementia Friends campaign which aims to support people with dementia and their carers. It says businesses have started to recognise this issue, with one in 12 of 1,000 companies surveyed having made attempts to accommodate the needs of a member of staff with dementia. More than half are considering taking such action in the future. So far more than 20 major businesses are committed to supporting staff and customers with dementia. Over 100,000 employees from businesses including LloydsPharmacy and M&S are now Dementia Friends, while other companies such as Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, Argos, BT and Bourne Leisure (Butlins, Haven and Warner Leisure Hotels) have also pledged for their staff to become Dementia Friends. The report says businesses that are not ‘dementia friendly’ will lose out because the spending power of households affected by dementia, is set to double to £22.7 billion by 2030, from £11 billion in 2014. Growing problem: With an ageing population, the number of workers leaving to help family members with dementia will rise from the current 50,000 to 83,100 in 2030, the report reveals . Jeremy Hughes, Chief Executive of Alzheimer’s Society, said ‘Thousands of people affected by dementia are forced to give up work and are denied a lifeline because of the failure of organisations to change the way they do business. ‘From the shop floor to boardrooms, dementia affects every workplace; from people struggling with the early symptoms of memory loss at work, to those juggling a job whilst caring for a loved one. ‘As the condition touches the lives of more people, businesses must gear up to support all people with dementia; staff and customers alike. ‘With dementia affecting millions of people, businesses who ignore the dementia pound do so at their own peril.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said ‘Dementia is one of the biggest challenges we face, and our ambition is to become one of the best countries in the world for dementia care. ‘We can only do this with the help and support of every part of society. ‘It’s great that businesses, communities and individuals are showing such willingness to help and support those living with dementia – demonstrated by nearly 350,000 people who have already signed up to become Dementia Friends.’ Matt Hammerstein, Managing Director for Barclays, said ‘Barclays is committed to supporting vulnerable customers and we have the ambition to be the most accessible and inclusive bank for all customers and clients. ‘Becoming a dementia friendly company is something that we feel is important to support our colleagues, customers and wider society. It is also crucial to us as a business to help us make all our customers’ lives easier. ‘We urge other businesses to sign up and help make all those affected by dementia continue to feel valued.’","Study shows cost of staff hours lost due to caring for Alzheimer's sufferers .

"A study found that just over 30 minutes of walking a day can cut the chances of breast cancer in over 50s . Older women who exercise can slash 10 per cent off their risk of breast cancer – and it’s never too late to start, according to a study. It shows just over 30 minutes of walking a day can cut the chances of breast cancer in women over 50. Importantly, researchers found the reduced risk only in women who had undertaken exercise in the last four years. Exercising when younger, or more than four years earlier, doesn’t count, according to the team from France. They analysed data from questionnaires completed by 59,308 postmenopausal women enrolled on the French arm of an ongoing European investigation into cancer and nutrition. Agnes Fournier, a researcher at the Institut Gustave Roussy in Villejuif, led the study which addressed when women should start regular physical activity and how long the effect lasts. She said: ‘We found that recreational physical activity – even of modest intensity – seemed to have a rapid impact on breast cancer risk. ‘However, the decreased breast cancer risk we found associated with physical activity was attenuated when activity stopped. ‘As a result, postmenopausal women who exercise should be encouraged to continue and those who do not exercise should consider starting because their risk of breast cancer may decrease rapidly.’ In the study, researchers converted the total amount of recreational physical activity carried out by the women into a measurement called metabolic task hours (MET-h). Postmenopausal women who in the previous four years had undertaken 12 or more MET-h of physical activity each week had a 10 per cent cut in the risk of invasive breast cancer compared with women who were less active. Women who undertook this level of physical activity between five and nine years earlier, but were less active in the four years prior to the final data collection, did not have a lower risk for invasive breast cancer. The breast cancer risk-reducing effects of 12 or more MET-h per week of recreational physical activity were independent of body mass index, weight gain and waist circumference. Dr Fournier, whose study is reported in journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, said: ‘Twelve MET-h per week corresponds to walking four hours per week or cycling or engaging in other sports two hours per week and it is consistent with the World Cancer Research Fund recommendations of walking at least 30 minutes daily. It is unclear how activity helps but the latest thinking is that aerobic exercise could break down cancer-promoting oestrogen hormones to produce ‘good’ metabolite molecules that lower breast cancer risk . ‘So, our study shows that it is not necessary to engage in vigorous or very frequent activities; even walking 30 minutes per day is beneficial.’ It is unclear how activity helps but the latest thinking is that aerobic exercise could break down cancer-promoting oestrogen hormones to produce ‘good’ metabolite molecules that lower breast cancer risk. Sally Greenbrook, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘Breast cancer is most common in postmenopausal women so it is great to see evidence like this which supports the message that physical activity in this age group is beneficial.’","Women over 50 who exercise slash 10 per cent off their breast cancer risk .

"Older people at risk of going blind are being treated by a new X-ray procedure for the first time on the NHS. The one-off treatment combats a form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a disease affecting around 250,000 Britons. It targets the ‘wet’ variation of the condition in particular – which develops when abnormal blood vessels form under a tiny part of the retina called the macula. Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has become the first NHS hospital in the UK to start offering appropriate patients a new non-invasive treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration . Monthly eye injections are the usual course of treatment, but the X-ray – called Oraya Therapy – has been found to almost halve the number needed. And at £700 per injection, it means that costs for the NHS can be cut considerably while reducing the inconvenience for patients. Some have not needed an injection for three years following the therapy, which delivers painless, highly- targeted low-level radiation similar to that used in dental X-rays. ‘Wet AMD is an aggressive form of one of the most common eye diseases,’ said Christopher Brand, consultant ophthalmologist at Sheffield’s Royal Hallamshire Hospital. ‘Treatment can often be uncomfortable, with patients needing injections on a monthly or two-monthly basis, or in perpetuity. ‘Current treatments can cost the NHS upwards of £700 per injection, so not only should Oraya Therapy benefit patients but it will also be more cost effective. Just two fewer injections per patient makes the treatment cost-effective.’ AMD normally affects people over the age of 60, with the wet form progressing particularly quickly. Around 26,000 people a year are diagnosed with wet AMD. There is no way of preventing the condition, however laser surgery and drugs can limit the damage it causes. But doctors at the Sheffield hospital have started using Oraya Therapy to deliver a dose of radiation to the back of affected patients’ eyes. It is a non-invasive procedure that is over in just a few minutes. The procedure works by drying up any leakage caused by the uncontrolled production of new blood vessels. By focusing the beams on the back of the eye, scarring is reduced . It works by drying up any leakage caused by the uncontrolled production of new blood vessels. By focusing the beams on the back of the eye, scarring is reduced. Mr Brand said a European clinical trial found treatment cut the need for monthly injections by 45 per cent on average – however patients still needed regular check-ups and some did better than others at avoiding top-up injections. He added: ‘The ideal scenario is a patient needing no additional injections after once-only treatment with Oraya Therapy, and their condition becomes stable. ‘But injections are still a valuable option for many patients as the new treatment will not be appropriate for everyone.’ Sheila Brooks, an 83-year-old retired sewing machine operator from Sheffield, was one of the first to be treated with Oraya Therapy. She said: ‘I was diagnosed with wet AMD in my left eye three years ago and since then I have had nine injections in the eye. ‘I don’t like the injections, nor the regular 28-mile round trip to the hospital, so the X-ray therapy was very appealing to me.’ The therapy is due to be used at NHS clinics in Birmingham, Manchester and other cities in England.","One-off treatment combats a form of age-related macular degeneration .

"Patients use different inhalers to combat an attack or keep the airways open . Three out of four people with asthma are unaware they are at risk of a fatal attack because they wrongly believe their condition is under control, says a new survey. Alarming findings show 15 per cent of mild or moderate asthma sufferers have attended A&E in the last year for symptoms, but still don’t class their condition as uncontrolled. More than three-quarters of these patients use up to one ‘reliever’ asthma inhaler a week - when they shouldn’t need to get through one a month if their disease is well controlled. The survey of 464 asthma patients was carried out by Allergy UK and funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK. Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways, causing them to constrict and resulting in attacks of breathlessness and wheezing that can be fatal. Patients use different inhalers to combat an attack or keep the airways open. At least 200 people are hospitalised because of their asthma every day in the UK, a total of 73,000, with more than 1,000 dying. Around four million Britons need asthma medication, but Allergy UK estimates 2.7 million of those who consider their asthma to be mild or moderate, are at risk of life-threatening attacks. Half of this group still suffer from breathlessness and 45 per cent from wheezing, despite regular medication. Around four million Britons need asthma medication, but Allergy UK estimates 2.7 million of those who consider their asthma to be mild or moderate, are at risk of life-threatening attacks . In addition, nearly half of those who class their asthma as ‘mild or moderate’ have been prescribed oral steroids in the past 12 months. Using this level of medication means the condition isn’t under control, as it should only be necessary in an emergency, or in the most severe asthma cases. Lindsey McManus, the Deputy CEO of Allergy UK, said ‘Asthma is a killer, with three people dying of it every day in the UK. More than three-quarters of these patients use up to one asthma inhaler a week - when they shouldn’t need one a month if their disease is well controlled . ‘These shocking survey results reflect what we hear time and time again from the people that call our helpline. ‘People ‘put up with’ their asthma symptoms and continue to use medication that isn’t treating the inflammation, rather than seeking help to get their asthma under control. ‘They just don’t realise they are putting themselves in danger and could soon find themselves in A&E.’ One in six of those who wrongly think their asthma is under control have taken six or more days off work or school in the past 12 months because of their asthma. At least 60 per cent of asthma is triggered by allergens, including house dust mite, pollen, animal dander, mould and foods, yet only a third of those surveyed had been allergy tested. Dr Monica Nordstrom, Respiratory Physician at Ashford and St. Peter’s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said ‘Doctors, nurses and patients themselves often fail to recognise whether asthma is moderate or severe, leading to life-threatening attacks that could have been avoided with appropriate diagnosis and management.’ She said ‘There are three warning signs for patients to look out for; if you use more than one reliever inhaler a month; if you’ve been prescribed one or more courses of oral corticosteroids in the past 12 months or if you are consistently missing work or school because of your asthma – these can all be signs that your asthma may be more severe than you think and you should seek more help from your doctor or specialist nurse.’ Over one in five asthma sufferers surveyed had not had an asthma review for over a year. Lindsey McManus, Allergy UK said ‘Our biggest piece of advice is to talk to your doctor or asthma nurse. ‘They will conduct a thorough asthma review and may refer you to a specialist who may conduct an allergy assessment and review your asthma management. ‘This is the only way to ensure that the asthma crisis doesn’t worsen.’ The NHS spends around £1billion a year treating and caring for people with asthma.","Asthma is an inflammatory disease of airways causing them to constrict .

"A drug widely prescribed to treat type 2 diabetes could help us all live longer, a study says. Research suggests metformin, which controls glucose levels, may also stave off cardiovascular disease and cancer – whether someone has diabetes or not. Scientists who studied more than 180,000 people found a ‘small but statistically significant improvement in survival’ in those taking metformin, compared with those given older anti-diabetic drugs and a group without diabetes. Scroll down for video . Scientists who studied more than 180,000 people found a ‘small but statistically significant improvement in survival’ in those taking metformin - a drug (above) used to control glucose levels and treat type 2 diabetes . However, experts said the five-and-a-half year follow-up period was relatively short, considering the complications of diabetes get worse over time and are linked with a shorter lifespan. Lead author Professor Craig Currie, from Cardiff University’s School of Medicine, said further research into the effects of metformin on healthy people was merited, particularly as it had negligible side effects. The drug costs a little over 10p a day for the highest prescribed dose. He said: ‘Patients treated with metformin had a small but statistically significant improvement in survival compared with non-diabetics, whereas those treated with sulphonylureas had a consistently reduced survival compared with non-diabetic patients. 'Surprisingly, the findings indicate that this cheap and widely prescribed diabetic drug may have beneficial effects not only on patients with diabetes but also for people without. ‘Metformin has been shown to have anti-cancer and anti-cardiovascular disease benefits. It can also reduce pre-diabetics’ chances of developing the disease by a third.’ But he said patients with type 2 diabetes would eventually see their health deteriorate, regardless of what drug they took. ‘People lose on average around eight years from their life expectancy after developing diabetes. The best way to avoid the condition altogether is by keeping moderately lean and taking some regular light exercise,’ he added. Data used in the study came from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, from which researchers identified 78,241 patients prescribed metformin as a first-line therapy and 12,222 patients prescribed a sulphonylurea as a first-line therapy. These were then each matched against a non-diabetic patient using criteria that included age, gender, smoking status and clinical status, and their life expectancy compared. Effective glucose control in diabetics is important in reducing the risk of complications such as strokes or coronary artery disease, and metformin is recommended as the first line of therapy for type 2 diabetes . The findings were published in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism. They show that average survival time was 15 per cent lower in healthy people compared with diabetics on metformin, and 38 per cent lower in diabetic patients on older drugs. Effective glucose control in diabetics is important in reducing the risk of complications such as stroke or coronary artery disease, and metformin is recommended as first line therapy for type 2 diabetes. Sulphonylureas are prescribed if metformin is not suitable, but can have side effects. Kevin McConway, professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said the apparent difference in survival between diabetics on metformin and healthy people in the study was relatively small and might be due to other factors – such as diabetics being likely to get better monitoring and treatment for heart-related problems, with potentially better outcomes in the short-term. Previous US research found changing to a healthier lifestyle was twice as effective as metformin in staving off diabetes.","Drug used to treat type 2 diabetes could ward off cancer and heart problems .

"New drug: Kadcyla can extend life by more than six months, but has been turned down by Nice . Women are to be denied a revolutionary new drug for breast cancer on the NHS – the eighth such treatment to be turned down in three years. The rationing watchdog will confirm today that it will block routine use of the drug – which can extend life by more than six months – for those with the most aggressive form of the disease. Experts reacted with dismay to the decision, which means that eight consecutive therapies for advanced breast cancer have now been turned down since 2011 because of the cost. Kadcyla is the first medicine designed to attack cancer cells while dramatically reducing side-effects such as hair loss. The treatment costs almost £6,000 a month, totalling £90,000 for 15 months treatment, which the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) insists is too expensive. The NHS was offered a discount scheme by manufacturers Roche, but Nice wanted the price cut by 60 per cent. Roche said yesterday it would appeal the decision, which it said showed the system was ‘not fit for purpose’ and would put British breast cancer treatment behind that of other countries in Europe. Dr Jayson Dallas from the firm said: ‘Despite Roche offering a significant discount we are once again disappointed that Nice has not shown any flexibility on access to Kadcyla, a drug with qualities that Nice chief executive Sir Andrew Dillon described on live television as “impressive”.’ Scroll down for video . He said more than 15 years of research and development had gone into Kadcyla, backed by 30 years’ work on the underpinning technology. NICE’s decision to block the routine use of Kadcyla has been condemned by Paul Ellis, professor of cancer medicine at King’s College, London. He led trials for the drug in the UK which were funded by drug manufacturer Roche. Professor Ellis said the drug’s special mode of action – which seeks out and destroys cancerous cells while sparing healthy tissue from unnecessary damage – made it a ‘truly revolutionary drug’. He added that Nice’s rejection was ‘a real blow’ to women with advanced breast cancer. Professor Ellis said: ‘For the first time in 20 years as a consultant I’m seeing people with advanced disease taking an effective drug with little toxicity. The two don’t usually go together. ‘Kadcyla tackles the disease in a different way to any other breast cancer medicine and provides women with valuable extra time with their families and loved ones – time that you cannot put a price on. ‘Kadcyla is able to deliver significantly increased efficacy to patients without the toxic side-effects associated with potent chemotherapy drugs – ultimately meaning that patients can live for longer with a better quality of life. This is achieved through the innovative way that Kadcyla works. Because its action is so precise, a normally toxic form of chemotherapy can be used but healthy tissue is spared from unnecessary damage. ‘It represents a significant step forward in the fight against a particularly aggressive and notoriously difficult-to-treat form of the disease. Nice’s decision not to fund the drug for routine NHS use serves as a real blow for all those involved. ‘While patients in England can access the drug via the Cancer Drugs Fund, we need to work towards a solution to ensure long-term access to this truly revolutionary drug.’ ‘Refusing patients access to this drug is an incredible injustice and tantamount to turning the clock back in cancer research and development. We plan to appeal this decision,’ Dr Dallas added. Kadcyla – also called T-DM1 –combines the original ‘wonder’ drug Herceptin with a potent chemotherapy agent which acts only when it reaches cancer cells. It attaches to tumour cells and blocks signals that encourage the cancer to grow and spread. It then breaches the outer defences of the cell and releases a payload of chemotherapy to destroy it from within. Because its action is so precise, healthy tissue is spared from unnecessary damage. At the same time the cancer is delayed from returning and side-effects from chemotherapy such as diarrhoea and hair loss are significantly reduced. Trial results show it provides six months’ extra life on average, but some women having once-monthly infusions are living far longer. Up to 1,500 women a year in Britain with HER2 positive breast cancer that has spread could benefit. The decision by Nice means the drug will not be transferred to the NHS budget. Patients in England can still apply to get it from the Cancer Drugs Fund set up to fund medicines not routinely available on the NHS. But the CDF does not work elsewhere in the UK, and is due to be wound up in 2016. Dr Emma Pennery, clinical director of charity Breast Cancer Care, said: ‘Kadcyla being rejected from routine NHS access will come as another devastating blow to women with HER2 positive advanced breast cancer, denying them the chance of a longer and much better quality of life. ‘Nice, the Department of Health and the pharmaceutical industry must work together to identify a new way forward that takes into account both human and economic impact.’ Nice chief executive Sir Andrew Dillon said: ‘Although Roche proposed a discount, it made little difference to its value for money, leaving it well above the top of our specially extended range of cost effectiveness for cancer drugs. ‘We are really disappointed that Roche were not able to demonstrate more flexibility to help us make a positive recommendation. The company is well aware that we could not have recommend Kadcyla at the price it proposed.’ Hayley Kalinins has been granted precious extra time with her four children thanks to Kadcyla. Mrs Kalinins, 33, was told she had advanced breast cancer in July 2011, after months of being misdiagnosed. By this time the cancer had spread to her liver and she was told she had just eight months to live. At first she was given two courses of chemotherapy, but she said the brutal treatment ‘stripped her out’. She lost her hair and suffered many side-effects. Minimal side-effects: Mother Hayley Kalinins was given eight months to live in July 2011, but has now survived long enough to complete six cycles of Kadcyla . She was moved on to different chemotherapy but again suffered severe side-effects, developing cracks in her feet that prevented her from walking. Mrs Kalinins, who lives in Derby with husband Andrew and her children aged 13 to three years, then heard about Kadcyla and insisted on a second opinion at a Sheffield cancer centre. It was approved through the Cancer Drugs Fund in February. She is on her sixth cycle of the drug and the tumours on her liver and lungs are now stable. She said: ‘I’ve had minimal side-effects. We’ve had a really nice summer with the kids and been to Disneyland Florida. I couldn’t have done that on the other drugs. ‘I don’t know how long I’ve got, it’s incurable but I feel well and every month is a bonus.’ She said she is devastated by the Nice decision to deny women like her the chance to have the drug. ‘These decisions seem to be made without emotion, but that’s what’s important,’ she added.","Drugs rationing watchdog will today block another new breast cancer drug .

"Healthy middle-aged people should be encouraged to take low-dose aspirin every day to ward off cancer, a leading scientist has said. A major review of trials and studies has shown long-term use of the drug cuts the risk of developing major cancers and dying from them by around a third. And those with heart problems already taking a low dose to prevent recurrence of their condition would also gain from its anti-cancer properties. Scroll for down for video . A major review of trials and studies has shown long-term use of aspirin cuts the risk of developing major cancers and dying from them by around a third (file picture) If everyone in the UK aged 50 to 64 took aspirin for ten years it would save 6,000 lives a year – 4,000 men and 2,000 women. An estimated 130,357 cancer deaths could be avoided over two decades plus 9,473 fatal heart attacks in those who had not previously suffered heart problems. The downside is that widespread use of aspirin would be expected to cause just under 18,000 deaths over 20 years, mainly due to internal bleeding and strokes, some of the potentially fatal side-effects of taking the drug. However, scientists calculated that many more Britons would benefit than suffer side-effects. For every 1,000 people taking aspirin for a decade to ward off cancer, there would be 17 lives saved and two deaths caused. The team led by Professor Jack Cuzick, head of the Centre for Cancer Prevention at Queen Mary, University of London, said a daily dose of 75mg – a quarter of the size of a standard 300mg pill – is enough to help ward off a string of cancers. Professor Jack Cuzick (above) led the study which found a daily dose of aspirin could be beneficial . Professor Cuzick said further research was needed but he believed the time had come for GPs to talk to their patients about it. ‘I think they should recommend it,’ he said.Professor Cuzick’s team found the biggest impact of taking the drug for ten years was in cutting rates and deaths from digestive tract cancers, with rates of bowel cancer down by 35 per cent and deaths by 40 per cent. Similarly, rates of stomach and oesophageal cancer were cut by 30 per cent and deaths by 35 per cent and 50 per cent respectively. Aspirin has less effect on other cancers, but lowered lung and prostate cancer rates by 5 per cent and 10 per cent, and deaths from both by 15 per cent. It also reduced breast cancer rates by 10 per cent and deaths by 5 per cent. Aspirin use also cut heart attack risk by 18 per cent, resulting in 5 per cent fewer heart attack deaths. Overall, rates of serious or fatal bleeding in the gut due to the blood-thinning effects of aspirin were very low under the age of 70, but increased sharply after that age. The drug also raised the risk of a peptic ulcer by 30 per cent to 60 per cent, and the chances of dying from a haemorrhagic stroke by a fifth. Professor Cuzick, whose study is published in the Annals of Oncology journal, said: ‘Whilst there are some serious side effects that can’t be ignored, taking aspirin daily looks to be the most important thing we can do to reduce cancer after stopping smoking and reducing obesity.’ He also stressed that no one should take aspirin every day without speaking first to their GP.","Major review of studies found long-term use of aspirin can cut risk of cancer .

"Strains of highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been found in river water downstream of a sewage treatment plant, scientists have warned. The contamination of the River Sowe, near Coventry, has sparked concern over the growing threat caused by superbugs that are resistant to ‘last resort’ antibiotics. The drug-resistant bugs were detected in samples taken by specialists from Warwick University near the Finham sewage treatment works. The resistant bacteria, which is carried in faecal matter, were strains of E.coli that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) - enzymes that can destroy many antibiotics including all penicillins. These microscopic images show a strain of antibiotic resistant bacteria found in the River Sowe near Coventry . ESBL infections are particularly dangerous because treatment options are limited and drugs need to be given by injection in serious cases. Study leader Professor Elizabeth Wellington, a lecturer in Environmental Microbiology at Warwick University, along with colleagues from Birmingham universities and the Health Protection Agency (now Public Health England), analysed sediment samples from upstream and downstream. They found bacteria resistant to important antibiotics used to treat a range of problems, including meningitis, septicaemia, and so-called hospital-acquired infections. They also found resistant E.coli were seven times more common downstream of a UK sewage plant than upstream. Their findings suggest resistance is spreading because of a gene called blaCTX-M-15 which bacteria collect to adapt to their environment. The researchers say stricter regulations and higher levels of treatment are needed to halt the rise in antibiotic resistance in the environment. Prof Wellington said: ‘If you disturb the sediment and then consume just 5ml of the water then you run the risk of getting gastroenteritis, which can make you extremely ill. ‘It would be like getting MRSA up your nose and could be untreatable. ‘If . the resistant bacteria colonised in your gut and through, say a urinary . infection, was able to leave the body, then the bacteria would be out . in the open, no longer just in the river sediment’ she added. The findings were published in the . Journal Of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy this month after the tests took . place between 2009 and 2011. Professor Neil Woodford, head of . Public Health England’s Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare . Associated Infections Reference Unit, said the extent of the health risk . caused by ESBL-positive bacteria was unclear. Professor Elizabeth Wellington, a lecturer in Environmental Microbiology at the University of Warwick said the bacteria could pose a threat . He said the agency was undertaking a three-year study to establish the variety of different strains in circulation. This is not the first time that antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been found in river water, he added. He said: ‘This finding causes concern although we have to keep it in perspective. ‘Just having had skin contact with the river water is not sufficient to cause illness. ‘For it to become a problem would require a particular chain of events to occur and the likelihood of these all happening needs to be borne in mind. ‘Our advice is that if anyone does become ill after swimming in rivers or streams then they should always advise their GP of their recent activities.’ A spokesman for Severn Trent Water, which runs the sewage plant at Finham, said: 'Severn Trent Water takes its environmental responsibilities extremely seriously. 'Earlier this month we received confirmation from our environmental regulator, The Environment Agency, that we have achieved a four star rating and leading company status for our environmental performance (we were the only company in the UK Water Industry to reach this standard). ‘The development of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria is without question an internationally important issue, and we are already engaged in increasing our knowledge to determine whether waste water treatment has role to play in this area. ‘In conjunction with all the other UK water and sewerage companies, we are actively involved in a multi-million pound national research project to look at the levels of pharmaceuticals in the sewage entering our treatment works.’ Antibiotic resistance is a growing worldwide problem, where common bacteria that cause infections are becoming resistant to drugs used to treat them. Antimicrobial resistance is a broader term, suggesting resistance to drugs to treat infections caused by other microbes as well, such as parasites, viruses and fungi. Many hospital-acquired infections including pneumonia and bloodstream infections are caused by highly resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Patients with infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria are generally at increased risk of worse health and death - people with MRSA are estimated to be 64 per cent more likely to die than people with a non-resistant form of the infection. Many hospital-acquired infections caused by highly resistant bacteria . As standard treatments become ineffective, infections persist which increases the risk of spread to others. Resistance to the treatment of last resort for life-threatening infections caused by common intestinal bacteria – carbapenem antibiotics – has spread globally and many countries lack basic systems to track and monitor the problem. The evolution of resistant strains is a natural phenomenon that occurs when microorganisms replicate themselves erroneously or when resistant traits are exchanged between them. But experts say the use and misuse of antimicrobial drugs accelerates the emergence of drug-resistant strains. This includes over-prescribing of such drugs – for example to treat viruses that do not respond to antibiotics – and easy over-the-counter availability in some other countries. Poor infection control practices, inadequate sanitary conditions and inappropriate food-handling encourages further spread. The use of antibiotics as growth promoters in cattle has also come under scrutiny. A 2014 report from the World Health Organisation says antibiotic resistance is no longer a prediction for the future; it is happening right now, across the world, and is putting at risk the ability to treat common infections in the community and hospitals. ‘Without urgent, coordinated action, the world is heading towards a post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries, which have been treatable for decades, can once again kill’, it says.","Strains of highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria found near Coventry .

"Drugs that target cancer without harming healthy cells and triggering distressing side effects could be a reality in 20 years, claim British scientists. A landmark project to map 100,000 complete DNA code sequences is set to transform treatment of cancer and rare diseases, meaning chemotherapy could be obsolete within a generation. David Cameron said it will make Britain the world leader in genetic research as he announced a package of deals worth £300million to carry out the work, expected to be completed by 2017. A landmark project to map 100,000 complete DNA code sequences is set to transform treatment of cancer and rare diseases, meaning chemotherapy could be obsolete within a generation (file picture) Over the next four years, about 75,000 patients with cancer and rare diseases, plus their close relatives, will have their whole genetic codes, or genomes, sequenced. Cancer patients will have the DNA of both healthy and tumour cells mapped, making up the 100,000 total. Scientists expect the project to be pivotal to the development of personalised treatments based on genetics, with the potential to revolutionise medicine. The researchers are looking for tiny changes in the genetic code that can trigger disease or affect its progress. Professor Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, which is part of the project, said genome sequencing will help drug companies design medicines that can successfully target the tumour. It means healthy tissue will be unharmed, side effects such as hair loss will be banished, and many patients will be spared the ordeal of treatment that doesn’t work. He said: ‘It’s actually happening now, in small ways. If you go into a hospital with lung cancer, for instance, that cancer will be sequenced. ‘Twenty years from now academics and industry will have developed therapies which will be targeted at you and specific forms of cancer. 'We will look back in 20 years’ time and the blockbuster chemotherapy drugs that gave you all those nasty side effects will be a thing of the past.’ David Cameron (above) said the project and treatment will make Britain the world leader in genetic research . Nothing on the scale of the 100,000 Genomes Project has been attempted anywhere before and other countries are watching the UK’s progress, say academics behind the project. A £78million partnership between Genomics England, the body set up by the Department of Health to oversee the project, and the Californian DNA sequencing technology company Illumina is being unveiled by the Prime Minister today. Mr Cameron said: ‘This agreement will see the UK lead the world in genetic research within years. ‘I am determined to do all I can to support the health and scientific sector to unlock the power of DNA, turning an important scientific breakthrough into something that will help deliver better tests, better drugs and above all better care for patients.’ The genomes to be sequenced will be split evenly between cancer and rare diseases. Included on the cancer list so far are breast, bowel, ovarian, lung, prostate and leukaemia.","Landmark project to study about 75,000 cancer patients over next four years .

"Eat well: Researchers reviewed 16 studies involving more than 830,000 people and confirmed that five portions appeared best . Eating more than five portions of fruit and vegetables a day won’t help you live any longer, claim researchers. A major study shows that five a day is the optimum for reducing the chances of dying at any age – especially from heart problems – but that eating additional fruit and veg is unlikely to make a difference. It comes after a call by some experts in March for the five-a-day message to be revised upwards to seven-a-day because of British research by University College London suggesting that it led to the lowest risk of premature death. In the latest study, researchers from China and Harvard School of Public Health in the US reviewed 16 studies involving more than 830,000 people and confirmed that five portions appeared best. The review, published on thebmj.com, found that higher consumption of fruit and vegetables was significantly associated with a lower risk of death from all causes, particularly cardiovascular problems. The average risk of death from all causes was reduced by about five per cent for each additional daily serving of fruit and vegetables compared with eating none. But once a person had consumed five portions, eating more did not enhance survival chances. The maximum achievable cut in premature death risk was around 25 per cent. The standard portion was defined as 77g for vegetables and 80g for fruit. Just one in four Britons manages to eat five portions a day, with the proportion plummeting to one in ten among teenagers. The review says: ‘This analysis provides further evidence that a higher consumption of fruit and vegetables is associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality, particularly cardiovascular mortality. ‘There was a threshold around five servings of fruit and vegetables a day, after which the risk of all cause mortality did not reduce further.’ The researchers speculate that eating more does not produce greater benefits because the body cannot absorb any more nutrients, and there’s a limit on the digestibility of fruit and vegetables. Professor Tom Sanders, of the School of Medicine, Kings College London, said the finding should not put people off eating plenty of fruit and vegetables. The researchers speculate that eating more does not produce greater benefits because the body cannot absorb any more nutrients, and there’s a limit on the digestibility of fruit and vegetables . ■ Women who eat healthily and exercise while going through a divorce or other stressful periods, are more likely to avoid premature ageing, says a study. The key, say scientists, lies in our telomeres – biological caps at the ends of chromosomes that protect the DNA in them from damage. As we get older, our telomeres get shorter. US scientists took blood samples from 250 women aged 50 to 65 to measure their telomeres and investigated their lifestyles. ‘Those who exercised, slept well and ate well had less telomere shortening than the ones who didn’t maintain healthy lifestyles, even when they had similar levels of stress,’ researcher Eli Puterman, of the University of California, told the journal Molecular Psychiatry.","In March experts asked for guidelines to be revised upwards to seven-a-day .

"As she walked down the aisle to marry Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie carried her beloved mother Marcheline Bertrand close to her heart. Wearing a locket featuring a picture of Marcheline, who died in January 2007 aged 56 after an eight-year battle with ovarian cancer, there was no way, friends say, Angelina could have not remembered her mom on this occasion. A source today told MailOnline how Angelina, 39, and Brad, 50, decided to marry at Château Mirava, the stunning French estate they bought in 2011, after Angelina made a promise to Marcheline to wed in France before her death. Scroll down for video . Adoring: Angelina Jolie - seen with her late mother Marcheline Bertrand in July 2001 - wore a locket with Marcheline's picture as she walked down the aisle to marry Brad Pitt last Saturday . By her side: Friends have told how Angelina promised her mother she would marry in France. The pair are pictured together at Los Angeles airport in 1998 . The source said: 'Angelina promised her mother before she died that she'd get married in France. They were so extremely close and this is Angie's way of honoring her.' Marcheline's father was of French Canadian descent, and her mother was of Dutch and German ancestry, with ancestors who had immigrated to the US in the mid-19th century. Despite her French roots, Marcheline was often wrongly labelled as a French actress, however,  as Angelina once said: 'My mom is as far from French Parisian as you can get. She grew up in a bowling alley that my grandparents owned.' Left devastated by her mother's death, Angelina said Marcheline was robbed her of the chance of being a grandmother which 'she was born to be'. It was Marcheline's passing that is believed to have prompted Angelina to make the courageous decision to have a preventive double mastectomy in February 2013, later revealing that her chances of developing breast cancer have now decreased from 87 percent to 5 percent. Marcheline,a fierce campaigner for cancer awareness, founded a charity called Give Love Give Life which spread awareness of the condition. She and her colleagues at the charity also successfully campaigned for Johanna’s Law to fund education into gynecological illnesses and got it signed into statute in the US. And mother-of-six Angelina credits Marcheline for having an 'elegance and strength for knowing what was right' that she has always tried to live up to. The dazzling brunette said: 'My mother was a full-time mother. She didn't have much of her own career, her own life, her own experiences. Everything was for her children.' While the designer of Angelina's gown is still unknown, E! News claims the star 'definitely wore something that once belonged' to Marcheline. 'It was a small locket with a photo of her mother inside it. She had a veil and Brad gasped when he lifted it because she looked so stunning', the site reported. Angelina and Marcheline were so close that the star has said that when she got older she considered her mom more like a ‘sister’ than a parent. Loving: Angelina Jolie, left, said her mother, center, didn't have the chances in life that she has had because she devoted her life to her and her brother, James, right . Nice find: The superstar couple leased the 35-bedroom property in 2008, before buying it for a reported $60 million in 2012. They married at the chapel on the property, pictured . The memory of Marcheline still can reduce Angelina to tears, as she said told CBS show 60 Minutes: 'I will never be as good a mother as she was. I will try my best, but I don't think I ever will be.' Choking back tears she added, 'She was the most generous, loving woman.' Marcheline married Angelina's father, the actor Jon Voight, in 1971 and had they had two children, Angelina and her brother James Haven, 40, an actor and film producer. The relationship was strained and they divorced in 1980 because he had an affair with an acting student which led to icy relations with Angelina that have only thawed in recent years. When Angelina's first biological child, Shiloh was born in Namibia May 2006 Angelina flew with her to see her mother in California as she was too sick to be there in person. It would be the last new arrival to the family that Marcheline would see before she died. Despite being a full-time mother, Marcheline was a producer and actress in her own right and had small roles in the movies ‘Lookin' to Get Out’ in 1982 and ‘The Man Who Loved Women’ in 1983. Even though Brad and Angelina's top-secret wedding last Saturday seemed to come out of the blue, a source told MailOnline that the timing of the wedding was 'not some happy accident', adding: 'It was deliberately chosen to commemorate milestone of 10th anniversary of filming of Mr and Mrs Smith. 'Brad and Angie also wanted to do it before frenetic pre-production and filming began for their new film.' And the source added that their son Maddox was 'particularly excited' and had been a 'powerful driver' for the two to marry. Man and wife: The Hollywood couple tied the knot in France on Saturday, August 23,  in the presence of their six children, a spokeswoman confirmed . There it glows: Angelina Jolie displays her wedding ring for the first time since marrying Brad Pitt . Back to work: The actress and director is on location in Malta ahead of production on By The Sea, in which she and new husband Brad Pitt will play a couple who become sexually obsessed with their neighbors . Done deal: Brad Pitt was more than happy to put his new wedding band on display as he attended a photocall in London on Thursday for his new film, Fury . The source claimed that Brad's ex-wife Jennifer Aniston had 'no idea' and was 'completely blindsided', neither did Angelina's first husband, actor Johnny Lee Miller, who is said to be 'relaxed' as they remain friends and he has re-married. Angelina walked down the aisle with her eldest sons Maddox, 13, and Pax, 10, on each arm. Her daughters Zahara, nine, and Vivienne, six, threw petals, and Shiloh, eight, and Knox, six, served as ring bearers. The boys all wore cream linen suits, just like Brad's, while the girls each wore a different dress of their choice. Brad's parents, Bill and Jane Pitt, were in attendance, along with the groom's younger brother, Doug Pitt, sister Julie Pitt and her two children. While Angelina's father was not invited and only found out about the wedding yesterday - along with the rest of the world. The whole family: Brad and Angelina's six children travelled with their parents to France on a private jet before the couple tied the knot on Saturday . Arrivals: The couple landed in Nice on Saturday for their wedding on the same day . The Californian judge who married the couple was also at the civil ceremony, which reportedly had in total 22 guests, the majority made up of Brad's family. Brad, who showed off his wedding ring in London yesterday as he promoted his upcoming World War II drama, Fury, is expected to join his new wife in Malta, where she is prepping for their first onscreen reunion since 2005's Mr. & Mrs. Smith. According to People, the film, By the Sea, which has been described as 'an intimate, character-driven' drama and was written by Angelina herself, is far from family-friendly. The Pitts will play a married couple in the south of France who become sexually obsessed with their neighbors. (One of the neighbors is played by French actress Mélanie Laurent, who costarred with Pitt in 2009's Inglourious Basterds.) 'I wrote something a few years ago for Brad and me,' Angelina said in May: 'Just for fun. Just an independent little art piece. Because we don't get to do those as much as we'd like. But it's something really small and experimental.'","Jolie was devastated by the death of her beloved mom Marcheline Bertrand in 2007 .

"Imported blue cheese (above), Feta and halloumi have all been found to have excess levels of salt . Some popular foreign cheeses contain more salt than sea water, say campaigners. New research found halloumi, a Cypriot cheese, imported blue cheese and Greek Feta had salt levels exceeding seawater, while cottage cheese had the lowest. A study also shows large variations in salt content among the same types of cheese. Some types of cheddar - the most popular choice among Britons - had much higher levels of salt than others, with supermarket own brands having lower levels than branded counterparts. An investigation into more than 600 cheeses sold in the top seven UK supermarkets found the average salt content was 1.7g per 100g of cheese. Halloumi and imported blue cheese contained 2.7g, and Feta 2.5g - Atlantic seawater is equivalent to 2.5g per 100g of table salt. Cheese spread, often given to children, contained 1.88g/per 100g of cheese, while cottage cheese had the least salt at 0.55g/per 100g . Campaigners said the new study, published in the journal BMJ Open, shows some cheese makers are not going far enough to reduce salt levels, putting their customers’ health at risk. Despite many cheese makers meeting the recommended Department of Health salt targets, four out of five cheeses were high in salt. Cheese is one of the 10 biggest contributors of salt to the UK diet - cheddar and cheddar-style cheese being most popular – and the average person consumes 9kg (20 pounds in weight) of cheese every year. On average, salt content tended to be higher in branded (1.78g/100g) than in the supermarket own label (1.72g/100g) cheddar and cheddar-style cheeses – 3.5 per cent higher. The difference in salt content between supermarket and branded products means it is technically possible to produce cheese with less salt, say campaigners. Excess salt is a major contributor to high blood pressure, leading to heart disease and stroke. Although UK intake has fallen in recent years, the average daily intake of 8.6g remains above the target level of 6g. New targets commit the UK to working towards a maximum 5g a day by 2025. Study co-author Dr Kawther Hashem, from Queen Mary University of London, who is also nutritionist for the campaign group Consensus Action on Salt and Health (CASH), said: ‘These results provide evidence that the UK salt reduction strategy, based on a series of salt targets for different food groups, is working, but that the targets need to be much more stringent if we are to get salt intakes down to less than 6g a day. ‘These big brands need to stop dragging their heels and catch up with the supermarkets now, or they will be left behind. ‘It’s worth looking at the label and choosing a lower salt and fat version of your favourite cheese, or better yet, to eat very small amounts. ‘Children’s cheeses are often marketed as ‘healthy’, yet can contain at least the equivalent of 75 per cent seawater per 100g on average - these cheeses should only be given to children occasionally, or not at all.’ CASH chairman Professor Graham MacGregor said: ‘Reducing salt is one of the most cost-effective measures to reduce the number of people suffering and dying from stokes, heart attacks and heart failure. ‘Cheese is a big contributor of salt to the UK diet and it is vital that the Department of Health forces the cheese industry to implement the new targets immediately.’ Dr Judith Bryans, Chief Executive of Dairy UK, the body that represents the industry, said: 'Salt is in an integral part of the cheesemaking process for technical and safety reasons. 'In an effort to provide British consumers with nutritious, safe and wholesome cheeses, the dairy industry has made significant steps forward to reduce the salt content of dairy products over the last few years and cheese manufacturers have worked very hard to overcome technical barriers to salt reduction. 'However, lowering salt levels irresponsibly would raise a number of concerns for the cheese industry in terms of food safety and quality. 'Cheese is only one food which contributes to consumers’ salt intakes and other food groups contribute significantly more. 'Cheddar cheese in particular contributes to only 1 per cent of salt intake in the UK - less than most food groups.'","Several popular cheeses contain more salt than sea water, campaigners say .

"A doctor known as the throat specialist to the stars was in attendance during the procedure that led to Joan Rivers’ death, MailOnline has learned. Dr Gwen Korovin, 56, who counts Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Lady Gaga, pop princess Ariana Grande and Celine Dion among her celebrity patients, is an esteemed ear, nose and throat specialist based in Manhattan. It is believed that Dr Korovin was at Yorkville Endoscopy clinic on August 28 as Joan’s personal doctor  when the legendary comedienne stopped breathing while undergoing a procedure on her vocal cords. Today, a member of staff at Dr Korovin’s offices on East 77th Street told MailOnline: ‘We’re not commenting at this time due to the professional duty we have to our patients.’ Scroll down for video . In attendance: Dr Gwen Korovin, known as the throat specialist to the stars, is believed to have been in the room when Joan Rivers was having a throat procedure that saw her stop breathing and lead to cardiac arrest . Stars: Dr Korovin - pictured at her Manhattan home at the weekend - counts celebrities including Hugh Jackman - who performed at Joan Rivers' funeral,  Daniel Radcliffe, Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande among her famous patients . Pictured at the weekend, Dr Korovin arrived back at her Manhattan home after calling ahead to inquire whether any media was waiting for her, sources said. CNN reports that a source close to the investigation into Joan's death being carried out by the New York State Department of Health said the star suffered a cardiac arrest as her personal doctor performed a biopsy on her vocal cords. A staff member at Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor  even took a 'selfie' photo in the procedure room while Joan was under anesthesia, the source said. Joan, 81, arrived at the Upper East side clinic for an endoscopy with gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen, Yorkville's medical director, on the morning on August 28. The procedure was intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, and involved the insertion of a camera down her throat. An ear, nose and throat specialist - who was not certified by the clinic, as required by law - then performed a biopsy on the star's vocal cords. The doctor was described by the source as Joan's personal ENT specialist. CNN said that investigators believe that Joan's vocal chords began to swell during the  biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest. The comedienne was rushed to nearby Mount Sinai hospital from the clinic. However, she never regained consciousness and died on September 4 after being taken off life support and spending her final days with her daughter Melissa Rivers by her side and her loved ones paying their final respects. On Friday, Dr Cohen stepped down from his position at the medical center. A Yorkville spokesperson confirmed to MailOnline: 'Dr Cohen is not currently performing procedures at Yorkville Endoscopy; nor is he currently serving as medical director.’ Sources told ABC news that Dr Cohen had allowed a specialist, who was not authorized to practice at the clinic, to examine Joan. Neither Dr Cohen nor the specialist have been accused of wrongdoing. Today, the New York State Department of Health, in a statement to People, said: 'The State Department of  Health's investigation is ongoing. As this is an open investigation, DOH cannot comment on any specifics regarding the investigation.' The New York Times said that Joan went to a clinic for the procedure rather than a hospital to avoid publicity. One member of staff at the clinic actually assumed that Joan's personal doctor was actually her make-up artist, The Times said, adding: ‘When the E.N.T. arrived, she was identified as an observer, not a doctor. She carried a bag, according to one of the people briefed, and the clinic staff members who saw her entering the operating room assumed that she was a makeup artist there to help make Ms. Rivers look her best after the operation.’ Tragic: Comedienne Joan Rivers died on September 4 aged 81 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan after undergoing a throat procedure . On call: Dr Korovin told how she always totes a black bag to see her patients. She has refused to comment so far on the death of Joan Rivers . In a Wag magazine article published last year, Dr Korovin told how she rushes to see her celebrity clients with her bag in hand, saying: ‘The black bag I bring to their dressing rooms has everything I need to administer on-the-spot treatment. If needed, I will see them later in my office.' Pictures posted on her Facebook page show Dr Korovin posing by pictures of her famous patients including Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe in her Upper East side office. While not yet making any comment on the death of Joan Rivers, Dr Korovin has only ever been acclaimed by her famous patients. She has told how she does not like to resort to any rash action, saying: ‘ Patients come to me with a range of complaints and I treat them all, including performing surgery when needed – like the removal of polyps and cysts – and treating upper respiratory problems and cleaning out sinuses. 'I like to be conservative and go as far as possible with medical treatment before doing surgery.'# . Stage star Nathan Lane credits her with helping him through previews of “The Nance” last year. “I was fighting a bronchial infection. I don’t think I would have made it through opening night without her.” Dr Korovin also counts Hugh Jackman as one of her high-profile patients. The Australian star brought down the house as he performed Quiet Please, There’s a Lady on Stage, from the musical, The Boy From Oz, at Joan’s funeral in New York. Gone: Gastroenterologist Dr Lawrence Cohen, the medical director of Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic, stepped down from his position on Friday. He carried out an endoscopy on Joan Rivers on August 28. It was later reported he had allowed a specialist, who was not authorized to practice at the clinic, to examine the star . Clinic: Friends said that Joan Rivers wanted to go to Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic on Manhattan's Upper East Side, pictured, to have her throat procedure because going to a hospital would have brought more publicity . In a 2013 interview with the Daily News, Dr Korovin was hailed as ‘Broadway’s throat doc’ and the ‘keeper of high profile pipes’. Indeed, in 1998 Celine Dion even thanked the specialist when she won a Grammy. The profile says:‘The walls in the ear, nose and throat doctor’s upper East Side office are lined with pictures and thank-you notes from stars who’ve opened wide and said ahh: Hugh Jackman, Kristin Chenoweth, Julie Andrews, Barbara Cook and Brooke Shields, to name a few.’ Celebrities: Dr Gwen Korovin counts former View co-host Joy Behar among her patients . Celeb doctor: Pop princess Ariana Grande posted a picture of Dr Korovin giving her a B12 shot in her bottom before an appearance with Jimmy Fallon . She also helped singer John Mayer through his recent vocal-cord issue. 'We’re friendly,' said Dr Korovin when asked if Mayer was up to his flirty ways in her office. 'There’s a mutual respect. You get to know your patients very well.' Staying quiet: Both Dr Gwen Korovin and her husband, attorney Jack Uram, have refused to comment on the death of Joan Rivers. The couple are pictured together in New York in 2005 . That includes Lady Gaga, whose mother referred her to Dr Korovin.  And despite Gaga’s eccentric behaviour and get-up, her vocal cords ‘are just like everyone else's', says the doctor. Despite this, the profile added that not all of Dr Korovin’s patients are stars and Broadway legends, saying 'She treats upper East Side society types and more average New Yorkers.' Tribute: The incredible Hugh Jackman brought down the house at Joan Rivers' funeral at Temple Emanu-El on Sunday, September 7, as he performed a song from his show, The Boy From Oz, He's seen arriving by bike for the service in Manhattan . High-profile: Dr Korovin has treated singer John Mayer - whose vocal cords were damaged by a growth - and Lady Gaga . In Wag magazine, Dr Kerovin told how she often interrupts weekends at her country home in Westchester to help high-profile performers between matinee and evening performances. She is also pictured treating pop sensation Ariana Grande with a vitamin B12 shot before an appearance with Jimmy Fallon - a photo which Ariana posted to her Instagram account.. 'I treat patients backstage many times a year,' she said. Meanwhile, a source told MailOnline that Melissa is still 'very raw' and has not yet thought about launching legal action against Yorkville or Joan's personal doctor, saying: 'I was told that the family was not going to do anything, but that was a few days ago, so who knows what will happen.' Neither Dr Korovin or her attorney husband Jack Uram returned telephone messages.","Dr Gwen Korovin counts Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Ariana Grande and Lady Gaga as patients .

Camille alleges that Dimitri assaulted her during their stay . at The ZaZa hotel in Houston, Texas in October just days after she had surgery . for endometrial cancer and provided a court with photos of her bruised face . following the alleged altercation. In January, she was granted a three-year restraining order. However, Dimitri alleges that he immediately left the . couple's hotel room after Camille accused him of cheating on her. And he claims that Camille concocted an entire fight; . smudging her make-up and pulling hair from her hairbrush and placing it around . the room. He also stated the bruises seen on her wrists were caused by her anastasologist. Phones were also found disconnected and ripped from the wall. Dimitri further claims that the alleged incident took place . after he had nursed her back to health following her cancer surgery, during . which he even helped her with showering and 'draining her catheter bag'. The charges were put in front of a Grand Jury in Texas in May, however, the jury did not find sufficient evidence to indict Dimitri.. Dimitri insists his life has been ruined by Camille's . claims. Dimitri is now suing his ex for defamation, malicious . prosecution, fraud and more, with the lawsuit, filed by his attorney Guy . Fisher, stating that no fight occurred. Meanwhile, Camille's counter-suit also claims that shortly . after her surgery, Dimitri presented her with a 'post-surgery present', adding: . 'He made a big point of opening his hands and slipping a ring onto her finger. Camille . Grammer posted this picture in June - taken from her hospital bed as she . recovered from surgery last October. Her ex-boyfriend Dimitri . Charalambopoulos is suing her for defamation and fraud, insisting her . assault claim against him was 'fabricated' Happier . times: Camille claims that her then-boyfriend Dimitri Charalambopoulos . assaulted while she was recovering at The ZaZa hotel in Houston, Texas . following her surgery . 'For a day or two, he seemed amused that Grammer was wearing . his ring. As Grammer became more lucid, she looked down and realized, to great . embarrassment, that Counter-Defendant's ring had a plastic penis on it and that . she had been wearing it in front of her family and the hospital staff.' For his version of events, Dimitri says he gave Camille the . ring to cheer her up following her surgery 'because it was consistent with an . inside joke they had during their relationship. 'However, no other person was in the room when the ring was . given to Defendant and Defendant took it off her finger very soon after the . joke was made. No family member or doctor was in the room when Defendant wore . the ring on her finger unless Defendant intentionally put the ring back on her . finger when Dimitri was not in the room.' Camille is now recovering from her cancer treatment and in . June posted a hospital photo taken during her recovery from radical . hysterectomy surgery last October. 'Me the night after my to 5hr radical hysterectomy. My dad . took the pic & said I looked like a nun. #awereness #Cancer,' she captioned . the photo, in which she is bundled up in bed sheets with a hair net over her . blonde locks and an oxygen tube in her nose. Recovering: Camille Grammer and daughter Greer Grammer seen in Malibu in May. Camille was forced to undergo treatment for endometrial  cancer last year . On August 8, Camille's legal team, led by top Los Angeles attorney Larry . Stein, filed a Slapp motion to dismiss Dimitri's defamation case. However, a source told MailOnline today: 'We hope that the . court agrees there is no merit to Dimitri's claims.' A judge has already granted a restraining order which found . that Dimitri committed this assault - despite the fact Dimitri filed against it, the judge found in Camille's favor. The source added: ''She is more than happy to turn her medical records in and . the pictures - that proves the assault, But she just doesn't want to have every . medical record regarding her cancer become a matter of public record. 'It is difficult enough that she found herself in this . situation.' It has been reported that Camille has hired bodyguards and increased . security in the wake of the alleged incident. And the source told MailOnline: 'Camille wants nothing to do . with Dimitri, if he hadn't brought a suit against her, she would never have . bothered with a civil suit against him. 'She is doing this because he sued her and she's not just . going to sit back.' Asked how Camille, a mother-of-three and the ex-wife of . Cheers star Kelsey Grammer, was faring, the source said: 'She's doing quite . well, she went through quite an ordeal, this has been a very difficult . time for her.' A spokesman for Camille declined to comment, while a representative for Dimitri was unavailable.

And . a source again insisted today that Lauren tried to 'max out her return . by stringing things along past the 10 year mark to increase what she . would be eligible to receive. He’s . then expected to head to St. Tropez and vacation with friends on a . yacht - as pregnant Lauren continues her uncomfortable holiday . in the Hamptons with her son Adam, seven and her estranged husband. The . couple have been holed up at her family home, trying to maintain a . semblance of normality for their son.

A settlement could come as . early as this week and she is expected to take less than the $4 million . set out in their pre-nuptial agreement - perhaps reflecting Lauren broke a 'cheating clause'. Keeping a low profile: Lauren displayed the tiniest hint of a bump in the tight dress . Day trip: Lauren headed out with her sister (left) and her seven-year-old son Adam . Bernard Clair, one of . Lauren’s lawyers, said: 'These cheap shots aimed at Lauren and her . family by people who believe they are supporting Andrew serve only to . sabotage ongoing efforts by our client and her husband to settle this . matter.

The striking brunette, wearing a sweatshirt and baseball cap, smiled as her son was picked up for summer camp. She . then headed to lunch with a friend in nearby Southampton, where she had . donned a clingy striped sun dress, with a black bikini top underneath. Lauren . is now being represented by Bernard Clair - named as one of '10 lawyers . you don't want representing your spouse in a divorce' - by Business Insider. Mr . Clair famously represented socialite Jocelyn Wildenstein in her divorce . from Alec Nathan Wildensteain, New York designer Carolyn Roehm, and . Republican fundraiser Georgette Mosbacher. While Andrew Silverman is being represented Jeffrey Cohen of Cohen Goldstein Silpe. As previously revealed, his parents Eleanora and Allen refused to attend the wedding in 2003 in the fabulously elegant old-money confines of the St Regis hotel in Manhattan’s Midtown.

Ironically, . it was on board the $458,000-a-week Slipstream that Cowell was pictured . sharing a tender embrace with Lauren last August, in images that came . to light last week. A . friend close to Andrew Silverman told the New York Post that the idea that Andrew knew about his wife's relationship with Cowell is 'ridiculous' and 'she . knows this isn't true.' Andrew's friend said that it sounds like a 'desperate attempt to smear him.' The statement was in response to an earlier TMZ report that said Andrew knew about the affair all along. Break: Cowell was spotted leaving Los Angeles on his private jet on Friday night . The . website reported that Lauren has alleged to close friends that Andrew . 'knew what was going on the whole time and he was doing the same thing.' While .

"It began with the cruel taunts of a gang of youngsters. And it ended with a trail of destruction estimated at costing £260,000. Coach driver Colin Scott, 52, ‘lost his mind’ after children in the street jeered at him, calling him a ‘fat b******’, making V-signs at him, and shouting: ‘How fat is your wife?’ He began swerving his vehicle at them to try to frighten them off. Crash: Colin Scott, 52, 'lost his mind' and slammed into cars and buildings after children on the street called him a 'fat b******', made V-signs and shouted 'how fat is your wife?' But his final swerve was too violent and he lost control of the bus, causing a six car pile-up and demolishing buildings. Scott was disqualified from driving for three years, ordered him to pay £500 costs and to do 200 hours of unpaid work . Mercifully there were no serious injuries in the crash, which happened in busy bank holiday traffic on a  narrow high street. A court heard Scott lost his temper after children on a bus in front of . his coach stuck out their tongues and made V signs at him. CCTV footage showed the group of a dozen children, aged between 11 and . 14, getting off the bus at a stop and continuing to abuse Scott, calling . him a ‘fat b******’. Initially, he reacted by returning  V-signs to the youngsters, who were . running alongside his coach, but he became angry when they shouted ‘how . fat is your wife?’. Scott aggressively swerved his coach at the children a number of times . to give them a warning, but they continued to mock him. On the final . swerve, the coach, carrying five John Lewis staff on a training day, . careered into oncoming traffic. In a statement read at Croydon Crown Court, John Lewis employee Nick .

"She is the woman who created Pamela Anderson's iconic bombshell image - and helped turn her into a phenomenon. After meeting Pamela, then a young actress and model, on the set of a Playboy cover shoot, make-up artist Alexis Vogel knew just what she had to do. 'I'd heard about her, she'd been on Home Improvement and she'd just started on Baywatch, but she didn't really have her image - she was a baby', Alexis tells MailOnline, . 'She was pretty fresh-faced, but I wanted to give her more of an image. I really, really loved Bridget Bardot, that sex kitten with perfect features, but of course, this was of course a retro version, making it my own - and her own look.' Bridget Bardot meets Coneheads: Pamela Anderson's Playboy cover in August 1993 with Dan Aykroyd as a Conehead. It marked her first meeting with make-up artist Alexis Vogel . Fresh-faced: Pamela Anderson in 1993 - before she was given her trademark 'Baby Bardot' image . Best friends: Pamela Anderson and her longtime make-up artist Alexis Vogel . That August 1993 cover was Pamela's . famous photoshoot with Dan Aykroyd in the guise of his SNL Conehead . character Beldar. But it was the only the start of a 21-year friendship . between Pamela and Alexis. Stunned by her reflection, Pamela told Alexis, then working on Playboy cover shoots and editorial: 'I have to have you do my make-up every day for the rest of my life!' By November 1994 - Pamela's next Playboy cover - she was a bleach-blonde vamp. Alexis says: 'I still have her saying that on tape, I saved it. The rest is history, she's been very loyal, we've been loyal to each other. 'We have a very, very close . friendship, we're like best friends. After all these years of working . together and in all kinds of conditions, it's been a non-stop wonderful . ride.' At the age of 47, mom-of-two Pamela still maintains her tried and tested sex-bomb image - and Alexis is still doing her make-up. 'Sometimes we go really sexy and sometimes we don’t, sometimes it's more dramatic, smoky eyes or cat eyes,' Alexis says: 'We just did a gorgeous all black and white Marilyn Monroe inspired shoot with her shorter hair. We call the main look 'Baby Bardot' and we have little names for all the other looks.' The pair are so close that Alexis feels like an aunt to Pamela's two sons, Brandon, 18, and Dylan, 16, with ex-husband, Tommy Lee. Bizarrely, Alexis reveals that Pamela is a strict mom - which seems at odds with her public persona, admitting: 'She's a really good mom, a little bit strict, but she's had to be.' And the boys are as far removed from Hollywood's grip as can be - despite having an actress and a wild rocker for parents. Alexis says: 'They turned out wonderful, independent and little businessmen. There are no drugs. They are very, very polite and I don't know which one is more beautiful and they're very smart, they got the best of both parents. Stunning: Even when she was just starting out, Pamela Anderson was a natural. She poses for a Labatt's beer commercial after being discovered in her native Canada aged 21 in 1989 at a BC Lions football game in Vancouver . Who needs bodyguards? Pamela Anderson takes her strapping sons, Brandon and Dylan and a friend out to dinner in West Hollywood, California, in March . Good boys: Make-up artist Alexis Vogel says Brandon and Dylan have got the best of their parents, rocker Tommy Lee Jones and actress and model Pamela Anderson . Back on! After Pamela Anderson filed for divorce from husband Rick Salomon in July,  by the end of the month the pair were spotted on vacation in Sardinia - and a friend says they are definitely still together . Having worked in Hollywood for decades, Alexis has more than a tale to tell, and has watched as the seedy side of the City of Angels has ruined friends. In particular, she talks softly about her good friend, Playboy centerfold Anna Nicole Smith, who died of a drug overdose in February 2007, aged 39. She even introduced the blonde to Paul Marciano, the Guess creator who put the statuesque model in his iconic adverts and made her his 'Guess Girl'. She says: 'Anna Nicole was a blast, so sweet and a really genuinely caring person. I introduced her to Paul. 'I hate to say it, but Hollywood gobbled her up, everything happened so quickly for her, all the fame. She wasn't highly educated and sometimes when people are more innocent and they come from a small town, Hollywood takes them off and they're not really prepared with tools and stability. 'Her family was not good, and sadly, she got swept away with all of it. I tried for a long time, I did the best I could to keep her here for as long as possible.' She adds: 'We had many, many good times, but once she was so messed up I tried to hang in there with her, but she wasn't taking any help that I was offering and we kind of drifted apart.' Recalling the moment she found out that Anna Nicole had died, Alexis says: 'We went to shoot in Mexico with Pamela and it was raining and raining and we were all stuck in this suite.There was nothing playing on the TV in English, CNN was the only thing and it came on the news. 'Suddenly my phone was ringing, we were in the middle of nowhere and it was a wide awakening to what can happen in Hollywood.' While Anna Nicole is a tragic tale, Pamela, Alexis says, 'has stayed true to herself,', adding: 'Her parents are there for her, her mom always helps with the boys, they're really good people, and she's very intelligent.' In the genes: Anna Nicole Smith replaced Claudia Schiffer as the face of Guess in 1992 . Having worked with some of the biggest names in Hollywood, Alexis is now launching her own make-up kit. She says: 'Most women learn from their mothers to put make-up on, they don't use professional products, but the wonderful thing about my products is that you get a manual that teaches you step by step and in a couple of months you're empowered. 'You can become your own make-up artist, you're getting my 25 years of secrets and techniques.' Asked for her secrets on just who can act like a diva, Alexis remains tight-lipped, and says: 'I've only really come across a few people who can be a little difficult at times!' There must surely be those who turn up a little too much plastic surgery that will make-up hard - but she says: 'Not that often, but it does happen. If they've had filler in the lips, there can be a little too much swelling and it throws their face off balance. So I put foundation over their lips and then use powder and use my lip stain to go under the lip line. Celebrity clients: Alexis Vogel counts singer Shakira, on let, and actress Sharon Stone, right, as a clients . Alex's other clients include Sharon . Stone, Shakira and she counts American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson among . her favourites, calling her 'amazing and genuine.' Pamela has three of Alexis's kits at home, while Shakira has four.

"On the eve of the tenth regular season game on these shores, the NFL continues to aggressively export its product. And it is an Englishman, Mark Waller, at the heart of the sport’s international growth. Waller, the NFL’s executive vice president international, says the process is nearing critical mass. ‘I always said when we started this in 2007 that I felt that this was a 15-year project to assess seriously and robustly what we could accomplish in that marketplace. And I feel we’re half way down that path.’ The NFL are set on Wembley becoming a home from home across the Atlantic Ocean by the 2022 season . 2007 - October 28, Att: 81,176 .

As the Detroit Lions prepare to tackle the Atlanta Falcons at the national stadium on Sunday, it seems no longer a question of if London gets a franchise, but when. But Los Angeles has been crying out for a team since losing the Rams to St Louis in 1995. Alongside the Oakland Raiders and the San Diego Chargers, they are one of three clubs on year-to-year leases. And then there are the Jacksonville Jaguars, owned by Fulham supremo Shahid Khan, who embark upon the second 'home' game of their four-year deal at Wembley against the Dallas Cowboys next month. The speculation and intrigue is intense. But Waller dismisses claims of a master plan. ‘One thing we’ve always tried to avoid is determining an outcome and then trying to manage to that. As long as you keep growing the fanbase and you keep showing the level of fan support, then you’ll get to the right answer, whether that’s putting a team there, playing a season of games across multiple teams or two teams. I don’t think we have a pre-conceived view. ‘I do know that the conversation of putting a team In England is much more real than it was seven years ago.’ There are no plans to make the jump from three to four games next season, with the Rugby World Cup - which sees Wembley host two games in late September - a major factor. The Detroit Lions touched down at Gatwick ahead of Sunday's game with the Atlanta Falcons . The Wembley turf following the Raiders game . ‘That impacts for us, particularly on Wembley availability and making sure that there’s a playing surface that works well for Rugby World Cup level as well for us and for England soccer. ‘So I think we will end up with a three-game schedule again. The difference I think will be that we will look to play two of those games back-to-back.’ The likes of the Seattle Seahawks, the Green Bay Packers and the Pittsburgh Steelers have enormous fan bases and the chances of them giving up a home game to travel across the pond appear slim. ‘Nothing is ever impossible, but the more passionate and loyal and strong your market is and your home field advantage is the more reluctant you are to give it up,' Waller says. ‘I’ll be honest as well, there are a whole number of teams whose leases don’t allow them to give up a home game. If you think back to the development of stadiums in this country and I think probably in the UK, a lot of those stadiums were publicly funded as well as privately funded. ‘And as part of the public funding was a commitment in the leases that the games that would be played would be played in those stadiums. ‘There are definitely a range of clubs for whom their current lease would not allow them to play a game outside of their home stadium.’ Lamar Miller scores the Dolphins' second touchdown during their 38-14 victory over the Raiders last month . With three sell-out games this season, the NFL has never been more popular across the pond. But would players find it an attractive proposition? Waller brushes off logistical concerns and the 50 per cent tax levy on foreign athletes, two often-touted stumbling blocks. ‘Every time you do something for the first time you’re going to encounter a number of issues, some of them real, some of them imaginary. Even within the US the tax rate is different in different states. We’ve crossed that a little in the US quite successfully. We don’t have any issues there – players choose to play where they play. And again as we do the thinking on the UK market and if we can put a team there, all those things need to be factored in. ‘The travel time, where their families would live, the cost of living, all of those will be part of the thinking we need to do if we’re going to get to a solution that works. We’re going to solve those issues.’ And once the London plan is in place, will the NFL explore new markets to continue its global growth? ‘We’ve been very clear that our focus is always ""let’s get the UK strategy up and running"", and when we feel good about where we are and what the next steps are we’ll look at the next market. And Germany is an obvious next market,' Waller explains. ‘I definitely want to look at Brazil. The stadium work they’ve done is obviously very impressive. The infrastructure exists. It has the logistical benefit of being on the same timezone as the US. And so it solves a lot of the practical issues if we were able to play games there. 'It’s a long flight, which will obviously be considered as well, but having seen it for the World Cup, we would be foolish not to look at it.’ Will the NFL be flying down to Rio as part its continued commitment to grow the game across the globe?","Englishman Mark Waller heads the NFL's international strategy .
The NFL aim to have a franchise on these shores by the 2022 season .
With one game a year from 2007-2012, and two in 2013, three regular season games will be played this this year - all sell-outs .
And Waller says there will be three games next season, with two of them back-to-back .
Once the London plan is finalised, there are ambitions for the NFL to expand into Germany and Brazil ."

"Salvador Perez shouted at Hunter Strickland, who shouted right back. The Kansas City Royals streamed from their dugout, the San Francisco Giants from their own. And for a tense moment in the sixth inning Wednesday night, Kauffman Stadium, Kansas City was consumed by chaos. The one thing that was clear? The World Series suddenly had some life. Perez broke open Game 2 with a two-run double in a five-run sixth, and the Royals' cast of clutch relievers kept the Giants in check for a 7-2 victory that leveled the Series and spiced things up as it shifts to San Francisco for three games.

'We showed them that we have fight in us, and I think they knew that already,' said Billy Butler, whose RBI single in the sixth inning gave the Royals a 3-2 lead. 'But we stepped up big there as a team, and that gave us some confidence.' Jeremy Guthrie will be on the mound Friday night for the Royals, who had won eight straight playoff games before a 7-1 loss in the opener. Tim Hudson will start for San Francisco.

Perez argues with San Francisco Giants pitcher Hunter Strickland during the sixth inning . Royals' Billy Butler hits an RBI single during the sixth inning as Kansas beat the Giants 7-2 . So much talk of fighting after the two teams nearly came to blows Wednesday. The Royals had surged ahead on Butler's single when Perez followed with a double off Strickland into the left-field gap. Omar Infante then scorched a pitch into the bullpen in left, the fifth homer that Strickland had allowed to 23 postseason batters. Boiling over with anger, Strickland yelled into his glove then got into a shouting match with Perez as the big, burly catcher headed for home. Players spilled out of both dugouts, and several Royals streamed in from the outfield bullpen before the umpires finally restored order. 'He started to look at me, so I asked him like, ""Hey, why you look at me?''' Perez said. 'So he was telling me, ""Get out of here, whatever."" So I don't know. You don't have to treat me like that.

With his 100 mph fastball singeing the Giants' batters, Royals flamethrower Yordano Ventura allowed two runs while pitching into the sixth inning. The 23-year-old protege of Pedro Martinez hardly looked like the first rookie to make a World Series start for the Royals, calmly handling a lineup that had ravaged staff ace James Shields.

Herrera got the final two outs of the sixth to escape a jam, his first three pitches clocking at least 100 mph. He also survived a shaky seventh before Davis breezed through the eighth. Greg Holland, who saved each game in the Royals' sweep of Baltimore in the AL Championship Series, allowed a two-out single to Brandon Crawford before fanning Gregor Blanco to end the game.

'For us to leave here with a split, you like to get greedy,' Bochy said. 'But we know it's going to be a tough series.' Early on, it looked as if the Giants could have a big lead heading back to the Bay Area. The fleet-footed Blanco silenced a rollicking sea of blue, becoming the 10th player to open a World Series game with a home run. He deposited Ventura's 98 mph fastball in the bullpen in right field, just his 17th home run in more than 2,300 at-bats. The crowd, energized from the moment that Hall of Famer George Brett delivered the ceremonial first pitch, was left waiting for something good to happen for the second straight night. Giants' Joe Panik tags out  Royals' Alcides Escobar as he is caught stealing second during the first inning . The Kansas City Royals celebrate after the game as they tied the Series . This time, the scrappy Royals gave it to them. ALCS MVP Lorenzo Cain stretched a two-out double later in the first, and Eric Hosmer walked on four pitches. Butler, Giants starter Jake Peavy's long-time nemesis, then bounced a single past the outstretched glove of Crawford at shortstop to knot the game 1-all. The Royals kept the pressure on in second. Infante doubled over the head of Travis Ishikawa in left field, and Escobar sliced a two-out double down the right-field line to give Kansas City a 2-1 lead, its first in the World Series since Game 7 in 1985. The Giants, so accustomed to October baseball, refused to back down. Belt tied it in the fourth with a double that bounced off Nori Aoki's glove in right field. The game was still knotted at 2 when the Royals got their first two batters aboard in the sixth. Bochy pulled the fiery Peavy. Butler promptly hit a go-ahead single off Jean Machi, and Strickland came in two batters later. From there, well, the Royals showed they still had plenty of fight left.","San Francisco Giants won the opening World Series game 7-1 .

"As she natters over tea and cakes with other ladies in the village, Donna Smith looks just like any other pensioner. But incredibly Donna, 74, used to be a man called Donald. And five years ago, at the age of 69, he became the oldest person in the UK to undergo a full sex change operation. Reborn: Donna, 74, is now delighted that she is a woman after spending 69 years of her life as Donald, right . 'Most people have no idea I used to be a he,' reveals Donna, in her first ever interview, 'and some people might wonder why at such a late age I bothered to go through such a major operation. 'But I’m proof it’s never too late to change your sex. Being a woman is fantastic. Just knowing I will die as a proper woman has come as a huge relief.' Now Donna, who as a woman is still a virgin, has one more goal – she would love to meet a toyboy: 'Although I’m in my seventies most people comment I don’t look a day over 50. 'I’d love to have a male companion to grow old with, a man ideally younger than me, to share the rest of my life with.' Donna’s long and torturous journey to become female began early in childhood when as Donald Edmund Bodsworth she loved nothing more than to dress up in her mum’s high-heeled shoes. 'I loved to try her make up too,' recalls Donna, the middle of three children, 'but it caused endless upset in the family. 'My parents were horrified. Both of them would tell me off and although I regularly told them I wanted to be a little girl, they would just reply, ""don’t be so stupid.""' By the time Donna reached her teens she’d experienced terrible bullying at school. 'My nickname was querie,' she says, 'girls and boys were both wary of me and I had few friends. Also at risk: Charing Cross Hospital is one of several hospitals still at risk from the Shaping A Healthier Future series of reforms which are currently out to consultation . 'A few girls did fancy me but I didn’t fancy women at all. And then although I did fancy some men, I used to fantasise about being their girlfriend, not wanting them as another man. 'Meanwhile, dad, a man’s man, who was a bricklayer before he became a prison officer, tried to toughen me up by taking me onto building sites with him. I hated it so much I used to cry myself to sleep.' Consequently, at the age of 17, and having saved up some money by working in the kitchens of a local hotel, Donna left the Bedfordshire village where they lived and moved to London. But the prejudices just continued. 'I was so unhappy at home, I’d longed to get away,' she recalls, 'but the first few nights I ended up sleeping rough on the streets. Thankfully I then found the YMCA.' Donna found another job working in kitchens. But even there she didn’t fit in. 'People didn’t warm to me,' she says, 'the problem was my feminine side just came through all the time. By now I felt sure I was a woman trapped in a man’s body. 'Yet it was the 50s and it was shocking for a man to be feminine like me and absolutely unacceptable. Once I went out and literally got a good kicking just because a bloke took said I looked like a poof.' However, she was so worried that in . her early twenties she saw her GP. 'I told him I thought I’d been born . into the wrong body,' she said. He . referred her to Charing Cross Hospital’s Gender clinic where she was . seen by Dr John Randell, a pioneering doctor in transgenderism. Happy at last: Donna Smith is now living in the Lincolnshire coastal town of Mablethorpe . She says: 'For the first time someone understood what I was going through. Until then I’d felt a freak so it was a relief to know there were others like me.' After undergoing a barrage of medical and psychological tests, Donna was put on hormones. 'The idea was that the hormones would make me feel more feminine and because of that I would feel more comfortable within my body,' she says. Within weeks breasts had started to grow, her beard was less noticeable and her penis had started to shrink. 'But while I felt better about myself and happier inside, attitudes weren’t like they are today. These days I’ve read about people having a sex change and then turning up to work dressed as the opposite sex. 'Had I turned up to work dressed as a woman it would have been a national scandal. I’d have been instantly sacked.' And so a new life developed. 'I would dress as a man to go to work,' she says, 'and then when I got home put on my wig, a dress and make up.' Amazingly she even entered a beauty pageant for women. 'I always wore a lovely long blonde wig. I was so convincing I actually came third. Even then that no-one guessed anything was unusual about me – and in fact doing that beauty pageant gave me a boost – because I knew for sure then I’d been born in the wrong body.' But most of the time life was fraught with difficulty. 'I lived in fear of meeting someone from work and them recognizing me. Or, just as bad someone realizing I wasn’t actually a woman and marching me off to the police. Then everything had to be done under cover.' For the next twenty years Donna continued living as a man by day and a woman by night. By her early thirties she had also fallen in love with a man in his twenties and they began living together. 'We . lived together as husband and wife but to the outside world he was my . lodger,' she says, 'it was sad that we had to pretend to others we . weren’t a couple but society was not accepting as it is now. 'Just coming out as gay was almost unheard of let alone as a man living as a woman. In those days that was how it had to be.' However, . when Donna reached her late 40s he broke her heart. 'He left me for . another woman,' she says, 'it was terrible as I couldn’t even confide in . anyone about why I was so devastated.' By . now Donna had read about someone having a sex change and when she asked . her doctors they agreed she could have one – but there was a long . waiting list and she would have to live and work as a woman day and . night for several years before she’d qualify. Donna says: 'It was probably the hardest time because as a woman it was impossible to get a job. I couldn’t lie – work places always needed to see things like birth certificates and yet I couldn’t afford not to work either. 'Also as a man working I earned more than if I’d worked as a woman.' Although she managed initially to gain a job as a woman working in a factory, when that job ended she found herself working on the roads and then at Vauxhall motors in Luton. 'Working as a man meant I got so much more money,' she says, 'I had bills to pay so I ended up back in the old cycle of dressing as a man in the day and a woman at night. 'By now the hormones had made my breasts grow to a 44DD – it was agony as I had to flatten them with tight vests.' However, finally when Donna retired she was able to live properly as a woman and fulfil the criteria. 'After I retired at 65 I could live full time as a woman and finally at the age of 69 I got to the top of the NHS waiting list. 'I couldn't believe it - but for me it was better late than never.' And in June 2006 at Charing Cross hospital she finally underwent the five-hour surgery she’d longed for. The penis and testicles were removed and a vagina was formed. 'I remember the nurse waking up me up. She said, ""You’re a Miss now” and immediately I put my hand between my legs. The thrill that I was so neat and flat was fantastic. 'It really felt as if I were being reborn, the start of a new life.' She moved to the seaside and today lives in a two-bed flat in Mablethorpe, Lincolnshire, bought with redundancy pay from her job at Vauxhall. She says: 'A handful of people who’ve known me a long time do obviously know I used to be a man, but most people have absolutely no idea. 'The only thing I think people find unusual is I still have quite a husky voice when I speak. It’s strange because my body is so feminine – other women often comment for example on my legs, which are one of my best features. 'But being a proper woman has changed my life. I feel so much more confident – I have lots of friends who I have cups of tea with and chat with and I’m a great carer. 'I've always been a motherly sort of person and now I look after a 96-year-old lady who lives nearby.' Now there is only one thing left to do. 'The doctors tell me everything is in working order but I’ve yet to find my Mr Right,' she says, 'and meeting someone special would make my life perfect.'","Parents used to be horrified by their young son dressing up in high-heeled shoes and make-up .

"Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich is celebrating the birth of his seventh child after his girlfriend Dasha Zhukova gave birth a daughter called Leah Lou in New York. The little girl was born in Manhattan after the Chelsea owner, 46, kept his $1.5 billion yacht moored on the West Side docks for the past two months. Stunning brunette Dasha - real name Daria - gave birth to Leah at the city's Presbyterian hospital.The couple's son Aaron Alexander, now three, was born in Los Angeles. Leah's US birth, confirmed by a source close to Abromovich to MailOnline today, means that she automatically qualifies as an American citizen. Her mother already has a US passport after growing up in Los Angeles. Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich with his girlfriend Daria Zhukova, who gave birth to their second child on Monday . Abramovich's 557-foot yacht named Eclipse, which has lost the title of world's largest private yacht to a newly-launched yacht named Azzam measuring 590-foot, has been anchored in New York harbour for the past two months . A source said Abromovich and Dasha did not plan the birth in the States with this intention, clarifying that Dasha wanted her children to be born in the US, where she lived as a child and attended university, adding: 'Dasha grew up in the US. The baby could have been born anywhere in the world and still had US citizenship.' Abramovich . already has five children with his ex-wife Irina Vyacheslavovna . Malandina. RIA Novosti broke the news and a source said that Abromovich had been by Dasha's side, reporting that Leah was born last Monday, adding:  'Mother and daughter are doing fine. Roman is, of course, delighted.' Socialite Dasha gave birth at NY Presbyterian.Dasha is now thought to have checked out of the hospital and the Eclipse is said to be leaving New York this week. Women who deliver at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia have their babies in the Sloane Hospital for Women, where 'Labor and delivery rooms are spacious, newly renovated, and flooded with natural light, many with views of the Hudson River. 'Each room includes a sleeper couch for a significant other, and plenty of room for members of the healthcare team.' Abramovich has five children - Arkadiy, Anna, Sofia, Arina and Ilya - with his second wife Irina, to whom he was married between 1991 and 2007. The eldest, Arkady, 19, is already following in his father's footsteps, having executed his first oil deal worth £30.6 million last month. Taking it easy: Dasha Zhukova has now given birth to the couple's second child, a daughter named Leah Lou . The 590-foot super-yacht, worth $1.5bn and seen here in New York, was recently robbed of the 'world's largest private yacht' title by a newly-launched yacht named Azzam measuring 590-foot . Russian billionaire Abramovich's super-yacht Eclipse has been moored in New York for the past two months, and it has just been revealed that his girlfriend Daria Zhukova gave birth to his seventh child, Leah Lou, last Monday . Speculation was rife when the . twice-married oligarch docked his 557ft private yacht Eclipse in New . York in February, much to the astonishment of New Yorkers - at a cost of . $2,000-a-day. Until recently the largest yacht in the world, Eclipse was unlikely to go unnoticed as it arrived in the Big Apple. The incredible vessel boasts two . swimming pools, two helicopter pads, a movie theater, a jacuzzi as well . as a disco, around 30 cabins, a mini-submarine, and even a missile . defence system. It also has armour-plating around . Abramovich’s master suite, bullet-proof windows and a laser system . designed to dazzle long-lens photographers. When it was ordered the initial cost . was estimated at around $500million, but by the time Abramovich took . delivery last year it was spiralling towards the $1.5billion mark . because of the extra luxury fittings and security measures . Eclipse was built by the Blohm and Voss shipyard in Hamburg, Germany, and delivered to Abramovich last December. The oligarch also owns three other mega-yachts, the Pelorus (377ft), the Ecstasea (282ft) and the Sussurro (161ft). Annual running costs for his fleet are around $25million including full tanks of petrol at around $110,000 per yacht. Until recently the Eclipse was recognised as the largest private yacht in the world. But it was robbed of its title recently by new super-yacht, commissioned by a mystery billionaire. The colossal 590ft Azzam is the length of two football fields and cost US$609m. It hit the water for the first time last week from a shipyard in Bremen, Germany,fter fours years of construction by the Lurssen Yachts company. Expensive: The yacht's initial estimated cost was around $500million, but by the time Mr Abramovich took delivery last year it was spiraling towards the $1.5billion . Best of the fleet:  Abramovich also owns three other mega-yachts, the Pelorus (377ft), the Ecstasea (282ft) and the Sussurro (161ft) Too big: Eclipse lies at anchor in Antibes' bay, southeastern France, where it was not denied space to dock in 2011 . The person who commissioned the . project is still a secret, but reports speculate that the owner is . member of the Saudi royal family. It can travel at 30 knots (34.5mph) and the interior has been decked out in the ultimate of luxury. 'She represents another milestone in yachting history,' said Lurssen Managing Partner Peter Lurssen. Cruisin': The incredible vessel boasts two swimming pools, two helicopter pads, a dedicated disco hall, around 30 cabins, a mini-submarine, and even a missile defence system . Abramovich met the daughter of Russian oligarch Alexander Zhukova at a New Year's Eve party hosted by her father in 2006. But apparently romance did not blossom between the two until he had split from second wife Irina after 16-years of marriage. Their divorce ended in a record settlement rumoured to be £1.5billion made by Abramovich to the mother of his five children, who now lives on an £18million West Sussex estate. Dasha was photographed showing off her baby bump on the Caribbean island of St Barts in January. The former model grew up in the US and she gave birth to son Aaron in Los Angeles, where she was raised. Dasha now heads the Iris Foundation, which funds a culture centre in Moscow, edits a magazine and is boss of a fashion label. Abramovich reportedly boosted his army of security staff to 40 people in 2007 – making him one of the best-protected businessmen in the world.

"Rafael Nadal returned to winning ways just a fortnight after being diagnosed with appendicitis. Despite a visit to hospital and being prescribed a course of antibiotics, world number three Nadal still played in the Shanghai Masters earlier this month, only to lose to Spanish compatriot Feliciano Lopez. Nadal, who is hoping to delay surgery until after the ATP World Tour Finals at The O2 in London next month, had expressed his fears regarding his health at entering this week's event in Basle, the Swiss Indoors. Rafael Nadal defeated Simone Bolelli in straight sets in the first round of the Swiss Indoors in Basle . The world No 3 was featuring in his first event since losing while playing with appendicitis in Shanghai . But the 28-year-old, seeded number two behind home favourite Roger Federer, was clinical in disposing of Italy's Simone Bolleli 6-2 6-2. Nadal broke twice in each set and won 81 per cent of his first-serve points to clinch victory in an hour. Nadal will now face French qualifier Pierre-Hugues Herbert in round two after the world number 120 caused an upset. Herbert beat compatriot Edouard Roger-Vasselin, ranked 56 places ahead of him, 6-3 6-7 (5/7) 7-6 (7/3) in a match lasting two hours and 20 minutes.

"US Open champion Marin Cilic won the Kremlin Cup, beating Roberto Bautista Agut 6-4, 6-4 in the final. The big-serving Croat, seeded second, broke his Spanish opponent once in each set at Moscow's Olimpiisky arena to take his 13th career title and fourth of the season. Earlier Sunday, sixth-seeded Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of Russia defeated Romania's Irina-Camelia Begu 6-4, 5-7, 6-1 to win the women's event. Croatia's Marin Cilic kisses the trophy after defeating Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut in the final . The big-serving Croat broke his Spanish opponent once in each set to claim victory . The eighth-ranked Cilic said his serve, usually his main weapon, was not at its best. 'I wasn't able to hit big bombs. I was today playing more in combinations and I was playing a bit better from the baseline,' he said. 'It was many difficult physical rallies.' Cilic secured qualification Friday for next month's ATP Finals in London and said he was in good form to face the rest of the world's top eight. 'I'm going to be motivated to do well,' he said. 'I've been winning a lot of matches in indoors which is for sure one of my favorite surfaces to play.' Bautista Agut battled bravely but was eventually overpowered by US Open champion Cilic . Cilic becomes the first Croatian man to win the Moscow ATP 250 tournament since his coach Goran Ivanisevic beat Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 1996. In Bautista Agut, Cilic faced a close friend but one he had not played competitively since an under-14 tournament 12 years ago. The 16th-ranked Spaniard is now 2-2 in career finals. In the women's final, Pavlyuchenkova seized her chance when Begu tired after two evenly-matched sets. Playing in her home city, Pavlyuchenkova skipped across the court with joy after converting her second match point to become the first Russian woman to win the Kremlin Cup since Elena Dementieva in 2007. Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova defeated Romania's Irina-Camelia Begu 6-4, 5-7, 6-1 to win the women's event . 'It's just the best possible way to end the season,' Pavlyuchenkova said. 'It was a really tough match. I just couldn't have lost at home.' The Russian is now 7-3 in career WTA finals. The Kremlin Cup is her season's second title after the Open GDF Suez in Paris. Pavlyuchenkova dropped just one set in the five matches she played on the way to the title, none of them against a seeded opponent. World No. 61 Begu is 1-3 in finals. This was her first final since 2012. Absent from the trophy presentation was Russian Tennis Federation president Shamil Tarpischev, who was banned for a year by the WTA on Friday over derogatory comments about the Williams sisters. Tarpischev did, however, attend the presentation for the men's final, which was under the auspices of the ATP.","Marin Cilic defeated Roberto Bautista Agut 6-4, 6-4 to claim title .

"Fiorentina striker Giuseppe Rossi is set to return to Italy next month to continue his recovery from a knee ligament injury which has blighted his season. The former Manchester United youngster's problems with his right knee began in October 2011 when he missed 18 months after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament. In January this year he strained ligaments in the same knee and suffered a recurrence of the injury in early September. Giuseppe Rossi (centre) is closing in on a return to fitness following his knee ligament injury . Rossi takes on Joleon Lescott during his time at Villarreal in the Champions League in 2011 . Manchester United: 14 appearances, 4 goals. Newcastle: 13 appearances, 1 goal. Villarreal: 79 apperances, 38 goals. Fiorentina: 24 appearances, 17 goals. Italy: 34 apperances, 11 goals. When fit, Rossi has been a revelation, scoring 16 goals in 19 Serie A starts for the Viola since joining from Villarreal in January last year. Rossi is currently in America receiving treatment, but is set to return to Italy in the next few weeks. 'Fiorentina announce that Giuseppe Rossi has today been assessed by Professor S. Singleton in Vail (Colorado, USA),' the club said in a statement. 'The assessment revealed the meniscus suture is healing in the correct way.

"The West Indies Cricket Board has announced that its tour of India has been cancelled due to a pay dispute with the players. The WICB held a meeting on Friday when it was informed that the players had 'taken a decision to withdraw their services for the remainder of the tour of India'. The West Indies will not play the remaining five matches which were scheduled - the fifth one day international, a Twenty20 international and three Test matches. West Indies captain Dwayne Bravo, diving in the ICC World Twenty20 in March, said the situation is 'tough' West Indies all-rounder Darren Sammy  will be part of the team heading home over the pay dispute . India led the ODI series 2-1 after their 59-run win in Dharamsala on Friday. The announcement ended a day of confusion and conflicting statements where the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced midway through the hosts' innings that the tour was to end, saying it was 'shocked and extremely disappointed at the decision taken by the WICB'. This was initially contradicted by the WICB, before a further statement was then issued by the BCCI documenting a full timeline of the WICB's withdrawal from the tour. Bravo said the team was behind him and he did not want cricket to suffer as a result of the West Indies quitting . Following a board meeting on Friday evening, the WICB confirmed the tour was over and in a statement released on the board's website, apologised 'unreservedly' for the early ending of the tour. The West Indies board offered to field a replacement team for the final five matches of the tour but said that 'was not considered acceptable' by the BCCI. The West Indies team have been in dispute with the West Indies Players Association (WIPA) over the signing of a new collective bargaining agreement and memorandum of understanding (MoU), which would see sponsorship payments reallocated to fund the wider professional game in the islands. The WICB said it warned the BCCI about possible player action and a delegation was due to arrive on Monday to meet the players and discuss their concerns. Bravo and Sammy  celebrate the 1st One Day International victory between West Indies and England . 'The WICB regrets that the delegation which was pre-scheduled to travel to India to meet with the players on a number of issues will no longer be able to conduct such a meeting,' the statement read. The board has also accused captain Dwayne Bravo of using 'inflammatory language' in a complaint which was issued to the WIPA chief Wavell Hinds, which the WICB says read: 'Please note that we are giving you the opportunity to right this wrong before things deteriorate [sic] to such an extent that West Indies cricket to the wider cricket world looks to fall to its knees again.' The WICB says it will now hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday 'to conduct a thorough assessment of all the ramifications of the premature end to the tour'. India have lined up Sri Lanka as replacement opposition and will play them in a five-match one day series.

"Brazilian striker Leandro Damiao is facing a six-game suspension for pulling his own jersey inside the penalty area. Brazil’s sports tribunal said on Thursday it had charged Damiao for attempting to dupe the referee into awarding his team a penalty kick.

"Reeva Steenkamp's cousin sobbed while testifying on Wednesday how she first heard on a car radio that Oscar Pistorius had killed his girlfriend. Kim Martin said she had 'hoped to God' that Pistorius was cheating on her cousin and that the young woman he had shot at his home was not Reeva. 'They hadn't confirmed the name, they said his girlfriend,' Martin recalled of the early-morning news broadcast. 'I was trying to phone her (Reeva) and she wasn't answering and I was screaming at my husband.' Oscar Pistorius cowers in the dock as Reeva Steenkamp's cousin testifies how she heard of the killing . A sobbing Pistorius is comforted by his defense lawyer, Barry Roux, as his sister Aimee looks on . Miss Steenkamp's father Barry is consoled by wife June during heart-wrenching testimony on Wednesday . Martin, who said she was close to Steenkamp, went to her mother's house where she learned her cousin had been killed by the Olympic athlete. 'The doors opened and my mother was hysterical and that's when I knew it was true,' Martin said. 'That was for me the end of the world. Everything was just a blur from then onwards.' The emotional testimony during Pistorius' sentencing hearing caused the judge to rule a brief adjournment when Martin began crying. Her testimony dealt in detail for the first time at the months-long trial with the life of Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model and law graduate, and the impact her Valentine's Day killing had on her family. 'We were all, ""why, why, why Reeva?""' Martin said. She said Steenkamp's killing 'ruined our whole family.' Pistorius leaves court on day three of sentencing procedures at the High Court in Pretoria . Pistorius checks his phone in the dock while  a member of his legal team looks on . Steenkamp was shot multiple times by Pistorius through a toilet cubicle door in his home in the pre-dawn hours of February 14, 2013. The runner was found guilty of culpable homicide for negligently killing her but acquitted of murder after claiming he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder. Martin was the first witness called by prosecutors during the sentencing hearing and the first relative of Steenkamp to give testimony in the case. Martin said she wanted to be 'Reeva's voice' after Steenkamp's parents, Barry and June, decided they were too emotional to testify. As Martin told of the moments she first learned Steenkamp was dead, Pistorius hunched forward in the courtroom and put his hands over his face. Steenkamps' parents, who have attended much of the trial, appeared to be crying. Judge Thokozile Masipa will decide Pistorius' punishment and has wide latitude. The judge could order the former star athlete to pay a fine and go under house arrest, or send him to prison for up to 15 years. Oscar Pistorius makes notes before the start of the third day of his sentencing hearing . The court heard Pistorius offered £21,000 to Reeva Steenkamp's parents in the weeks after the killing . Lawyers for June and Barry Steenkamp said they were 'surprised' details of secret payments were revealed . Pistorius' lawyers have argued for a correctional supervision sentence with periods of house arrest. Social workers testifying for the defense recommended he not be sent to prison, partly because of his disability as a double amputee. Prosecutors reject that and insist that Pistorius, 27, should go to jail, saying his negligent actions on the night he shot Steenkamp with his 9 mm pistol have left a 'broken family.' Steenkamp's mother June was on medication after the killing and father Barry sat in a corner of his house crying, Martin testified. Martin said that she is receiving trauma counseling and her children need therapy. The Paralympian greets a family member ahead of the hearing at the North Gauteng High Court . The sprinter greets his brother Carl Pistorius, who came to court on crutches after a car crash earlier this year . June Steenkamp and husband Barry (back), the parents of Reeva Steenkamp, arrive at court on Wednesday . Steenkamp's parents said in a statement earlier on Wednesday that the death of their daughter - who had helped them with money - had left them in financial difficulties and their lawyer resorted to approaching Pistorius for help. The athlete had paid them around £6,300 ($10,000) in monthly instalments between March 2013 and last month, but they now want to pay it back, they said. The Steenkamps also said they turned down a separate settlement offer of £21, 000 ($34,000) from Pistorius and would no longer pursue a civil claim after the criminal trial because they didn't want his money. Martin testified that Steenkamp's parents were never rich, but father Barry was particularly proud of his daughter's law degree and wanted her to concentrate on becoming a lawyer. Martin said: 'Her dad told her she must work hard because her life can end in a split second.' Oscar Pistorius stares out of the window of his car as he pulls up outside the high court in Pretoria .

"Justin Gatlin is far more interested in winning races than popularity contests. Still, the American sprinter with a doping history doesn't quite understand the backlash over his nomination for track and field athlete of the year. Gatlin went undefeated in the 100 and 200 meters this season, a year that didn't include a major meet and one in which Usain Bolt chose to give his nagging injuries time to heal. Justin Gatlin has been nominated as track and field athlete of the year despite his doping past . Justin Gatlin (left) powers ahead during the IAAF Diamond League Athletics meeting at Lausanne in July . But Gatlin's inclusion for track's annual award has angered some athletes. So much so that Olympic discus champion Robert Harting even withdrew from consideration. Gatlin insisted again and again in an interview with The Associated Press that he's served his time - four years for testing positive for excessive testosterone in 2006 - and should be at least considered, especially after going 18-0. His reaction to those showing so much displeasure is this: Why over an award? Why not after he captured a bronze medal at the 2012 London Games or silver at the 2013 world championships? 'Not a peep, then. Not a stir,' Gatlin said. 'I don't make any waves. I don't say anything bad about anybody. I don't point fingers. 'I'm sad to say that a lot of people out there feel that, ""Once a doper, always a doper."" But that makes no sense. That means you don't believe your system is working.' The 32-year-old sprinter said he's been tested often by U.S. Anti-Doping, World Anti-Doping Agency and IAAF, the governing body of track. Skepticism remains, though, as when he finished in 9.77 seconds in Brussels last month, a mark achieved only by the world-record holder Bolt, Tyson Gay, Yohan Blake and Asafa Powell. That's also the time Gatlin was running in 2006, when he tested positive. Gatlin in 2006, the year he was banned  by the US Anti-Doping Agency . Gatlin  celebrates winning the men's 100m sprint   in Rieti, Italy in September to continue his superb year . 'For some reason in an off year, when I run 9.77 with no medal of any sort, and now I get all of this backlash?' Gatlin said. 'I guess people feel like if my two feet get me across the line in first, that's good enough. But they don't want me to win a popularity contest.' There was originally a 10-man list of nominees for the award issued by IAAF, until Harting took his name out of the running, with the German telling Spiegel magazine, 'It's insulting for me and my fans.' The winner is announced next month. 'I didn't ask to get nominated,' Gatlin said. 'My choice was to run and win races and be dominant for myself. My job is not to go out and lose. My job is to win. That's what I'm supposed to do, like everyone else nominated.' In the middle year of an Olympic cycle and with no world championships this summer, Gatlin overhauled his training program. He ate healthier and slimmed down to 175 pounds. He also fine-tuned his technique in Florida. For as fast as he runs, though, his past always catches up. A number of Diamond League meets won't include him because of his history. The 2004 Olympic champion tested positive for amphetamines in 2001, but arbitrators decided Gatlin didn't take it to cheat and that doctors prescribed it to treat attention deficit disorder first diagnosed when he was 9. 'Stopped taking it cold turkey right then, once I tested positive,' said Gatlin, a former star at the University of Tennessee. Gatlin (right) attempts to chase down Usain Bolt as the American claimed bronze at London 2012 . Olympic discus champion Robert Harting has removed himself of the running for athlete of the year . Five years later, he tested positive again, this time for testosterone. USADA and the IAAF pushed for an eight-year ban. He served four years. 'I took my lumps, sat my time down, came back and worked hard to make my way back to the top,' he said. When he returned in 2010, Gatlin was running 10.26. As he lowered his time, he increased his detractors. That didn't bother him. This insinuation, however, did: At the University of Oslo, researchers gave mice testosterone - the same hormone for which Gatlin tested positive - and found the resulting super-mice developed muscle changes and performance benefits that lasted long after doping stopped. 'For the few haters out there, seems like that's what they want to do, discredit my name and label me with laboratory rats in Oslo, and say, ""Oh, steroids are in you system for decades and decades,""' Gatlin said. 'A lot of athletes that tested positive, they never came back and ran times close to the times they ran when they were positive. I think that proves hard work and dedication on my behalf. 'I'm not doing anything that's a secret to anybody. I'm just going out there and believing in myself.'","Gatlin was nominated for IAAF track and field athlete of the year .

"The internet lit up with buzz about Cleveland Cavaliers player Tristan Thompson starting Friday over claims the forward had been too forward with a female sideline reporter. At the close of a pregame sideline interview, Thompson planted an impromptu kiss on Allie Clifton then quickly walked out of camera frame. Clifton brushed it off and finished her segment, but some media outlets have since condemned Thompson's behavior as unsportsmanlike and much worse. Scroll down for video... Smile and a wink: At the close of a pregame interview on Friday, Cavaliers forward Tristan Thompson got awfully forward with the sideline reporter . The forward forward: Thompson caused a stir when he kissed sideline interviewer Allie Clifton . Thompson ended the interview by 'disgusting us as much as humanly possible,' wrote Yahoo sports writer Kelly Dwyer, 'There should be no marginalizing or rationalizing of this. That could be a mortifying thing for this reporter.' Thompson, who went on to help lead the Cavs to a 108-103 victory against the Mavericks, started out the interview innocently enough. He grinned sheepishly several times before calling Clifton by the wrong name as he answered one of her questions. 'See ball, get ball. Same approach. You know how I do it, Tina,' he said. A little rattled: Clifton finished up her segment with a red face, but managed to sign off with her dignity intact . Then came a wink and then the now-infamous smooch before Thompson left the camera frame. Clifton's face reddened noticeably as she signed off with a joke. 'He also said he goes off the feel of the game, just like he does with interviews I guess,' said the shocked reporter. But, just as soon as the backlash against Thompson began, Clifton herself put a stop it.

"David Furnish, Zachary Furnish-John, Elijah Furish-John and Sir Elton John at the Woodside End of Summer party . Say what you like about Sir Elton John, but he certainly knows how to throw a party. For years, his annual White Tie and Tiara ball — held at his opulent Woodside mansion in Old Windsor, to raise money for his Aids Foundation — has been one of the social events of the season. Now, having apparently been scrapped because of an influx of ‘riff-raff’, the event was reborn on Thursday night as the Woodside End Of Summer Party. Liz Hurley was there, along with an eclectic selection of Sir Elton and David Furnish’s chums, including comedian David Walliams, actor Sir Ian McKellen and designer Jasper Conran. So what went on in Old Windsor? Who is the millionaire who paid £50,000 to kiss Elizabeth Hurley? And why was David Furnish the big talking point of the night? HERE COME THE D-LISTERS . Not everyone who came to the £3,000-a-ticket event in the grounds of Sir Elton’s lavish home was in the superstar bracket. Male model David Gandy — who turns up at parties all over town — was there, as was socialite Tamara Beckwith, who pronounced herself knocked out by the ‘festival vibe’ of the party. Hollyoaks actor Kieron Richardson also scored an invite, as did Rosanna Davison, the daughter of crooner Chris de Burgh, who is known mainly for winning Miss World way back in 2003. Higher up the celebrity food chain, Sir Elton played host to David Walliams and his supermodel wife, Lara Stone, and also comedian Jimmy Carr and his girlfriend Karoline Copping. Lulu was in attendance, too. In previous years, Sir Elton has welcomed such luminaries as Catherine Zeta Jones, Rod Stewart, Naomi Campbell as well as former U.S. President Bill Clinton and the Duchess of York. The lack of big-hitters this year, it seems, was mainly down to timing. At this point in the calendar, the Hollywood crowd are in Venice for the film festival, while the fashionistas are in the Big Apple for New York Fashion Week. THE VENUE . Sir Elton bought Woodside in 1975 and his staff have been known to mutter that it’s bigger than nearby Windsor Castle, with eight bedrooms, a billiards room, 30 acres and a squash court. As Elton himself shrugs: ‘One queen living next door to another.’ The spectacular estate boasts a Roman terrace, Italian gardens, a secret garden and a white scented garden. Indeed, the gardens are so big that guests were offered a tour by rickshaw. There were some grumbles that there weren’t quite enough rickshaws to go around, though, and there were also long queues for the lavatories. At the start of the evening, Sir Elton and David came out to mingle with their two sons, born to a surrogate mother. Zachary, nearly four, and Elijah, 20 months, are regulars at their fathers parties . Karoline Copping, Jimmy Carr, David Furnish, Lara Stone, Sir Elton John and David Walliams at the party . THE SMALL TALK . At the start of the evening, Sir Elton and David came out to mingle with their two sons, born to a surrogate mother. Zachary, nearly four, and Elijah, 20 months, are regulars at their fathers’ parties and have also been wheeled out at Sir Elton’s Oscars bash. They were wearing matching £95 canvas shoes in the classic Burberry check and little Elijah kept a tight grasp of his Thomas The Tank Engine toy throughout. A guest says they stayed at the event for around an hour before being taken off to bed at 8.30pm. Apparently they are Sir Elton’s only topic of conversation now, and he chatted about them to all the guests all night, from potty training to his choice of schools. Very un-rock ’n’ roll. DAVID THE HUNK . David Furnish’s muscular physique was the talk of the party. He posted pictures to his Instagram account recently showing some impressive muscles, a result of serious iron pumping. He has also allowed his hair to go grey. He was very much the social powerhouse at the party and circulated with a determination to speak to every guest. Elton, known for being a little reticent on social occasions, was said to be ‘a bit quiet, but David was on fine form’, said a guest. Bow ties were banned at the event attended by Patrick Cox (next to David Furnish, left), David Gandy Elizabeth Hurley, James Blunt and Sofia Wellesley . THE BOW-TIE BAN . No more white tie — the dress code this year was ‘summer chic’. This translated as the usual red-carpet dresses for the ladies, and lounge suits for the men. David channelled the Great Gatsby look in a pink jacket. Elton donned a midnight-blue tuxedo with a long platinum chain, and — ever flamboyant — some hand-made sparkly shoes, thought to be by American husband-and-wife designers Donald J. and Lisa Pliner, and costing an eye-watering £10,000 a pair. THE CARNATION CULL . Sir Elton remained true to his favourite florist Rob Van Helden, who favours gigantic displays of spectacular and immaculate flowers. Van Helden knows Sir Elton will not tolerate chrysanthemums, carnations or lilies at any price. He has been decorating Sir Elton’s parties for decades and did the flowers for his civil partnership to Furnish in 2005. He garlanded the statues in the garden with stunning displays of roses and hydrangeas. POSH FIZZ AND NOSH . there were masses of champagne and Grey Goose vodka cocktails, while staff seemed to have been told to refill glasses after three sips. They also offered to mix any drinks that were requested. Dinner was a rather unadventurous affair of smoked salmon, followed by chicken with grilled vegetables and then fruit tart. THE COSTLY KISS . Elizabeth Hurley kisses Julian Bharti after he paid £50,000 to the Elton John AIDS Foundation in an auction during the Woodside End of Summer party to kiss the actress for 10 seconds . Julian Bharti is a 27-year-old investment banker and son of Stan Bharti, who founded the Forbes and Manhattan investment bank . After dinner, the serious business of fundraising got under way. Liz Hurley, who has attended every Elton summer party since 2001, flew in from New York, where she has been filming, to support him. She is best friends with both Elton, 67, and Furnish, 51, a film-maker — Elton gave her away at her wedding to Arun Nayar and the pair are godparents to her son, Damian. Julian Bharti, a 27-year-old investment banker, won the lot of a kiss with Liz, paying a staggering £50,000 for his ten-second grapple. Those who were there contend that the actress was very game about it, but kept her teeth firmly clenched just in case. Bharti is the son of Stan Bharti, who founded the Forbes and Manhattan investment bank. He is the MD of the Delano Capital Corporation and lives in Toronto with his wife, Christy, and their three children. To give some idea of his wealth, he bought a $5.5 million holiday home in Los Angeles, which he spent $3 million renovating, but is selling it again because it’s too much effort to visit it. He told me: ‘My father and I were kindly invited by the amazing people at Chopard, so I would extend a special thanks to them if given the opportunity. ‘And the kiss — well, I have had a crush on Elizabeth Hurley since I was about eight years old, and we noticed they were trying to get people excited to donate. I joked to my father that it would be funny if I made a big donation in exchange for a kiss with Elizabeth. ‘And, before I knew it, Dad had whisked me over to her asking if she would be cool with that, which she kindly was, and all of a sudden I was standing on the stage with Elton John who was announcing the contribution and kiss. The entire thing was a unique “once-in-a-lifetime” experience for me — and, of course, the kiss was amazing! ‘I would like to thank Elizabeth Hurley for being a good trouper. As a very happily married man, I would also add that my wife, who is back in Toronto, loved the entire story.’ SINGING FOR SUPPER . Entertainment was provided by Gary Barlow, Chrissie Hynde and James Blunt. Sir Elton also sang. Afterwards, celebrity DJ Fatboy Slim opened a pop-up nightclub with dancers and a spectacular light show until 1am. Elton is not one for dancing, but his partner was on the dance floor with Hynde until the bitter end.","Annual party previously known as White Tie and Tiara Ball made a comeback .

"Silly stunt: Judy and the rubber chicken. Her Grand Slam of public appearances and lucrative business commitments that could make her more than £150,000 in a year . Andy Murray may have cruised through the opening rounds of Wimbledon as reigning champion — but it’s his mum Judy who has taken on a Grand Slam of public appearances and lucrative business commitments that could make her more than £150,000 in a year. Her week started with an unlikely appearance on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs. Then we witnessed her ‘ambassadorship’ for Lavazza coffee  — as part of a deal thought to be worth around £25,000, 54-year-old Judy was seen helping to dispense free coffee to Wimbledon fans, and manning a coffee stall with former Wimbledon champ Goran Ivanisevic and Rafa Nadal’s uncle-coach Tony. A bigger commitment is her deal with Robinsons, the drinks brand that has had a partnership with Wimbledon for more than 100 years. Among other advertising ventures and coaching initiatives, she has filmed a series of comic skits with former British No 1 Tim Henman, debating whether part of Wimbledon should be called ‘Henman Hill’ or ‘Murray Mount’. The Robinsons deal, worth around £50,000 and brokered by the leading sports agency IMG, led her this week to take part in a stunt in which she was photographed bouncing a rubber chicken on a tennis racquet. In past years tennis fans struggled to take Judy to their hearts — all that fist-pumping and clenched aggression made her appear too pushy. But after Andy’s victory last year, and aided by a makeover that turned her into a glamorous white-blonde, Judy is being seen in a new light. At least, that is the plan. In a long junior and senior tennis career she won 64 Scottish titles but her victories were never translated into international success. Instead she launched herself into coaching, and her dream now is to launch a tennis academy in Scotland, preferably near the Murrays’ home town of Dunblane. ‘This is my big goal. I want it to be something to leave behind,’ she has said. But she needs more than £15 million in initial funding, and there will be heavy maintenance costs thereafter — hence the deals with Lavazza and Robinsons, and another as a ‘brand ambassador’ for Head, the racquet maker. It was Judy, rather than Andy, who gave a cover interview to the Radio Times pre-Wimbledon, in which she spoke about the Dunblane shooting massacre at Andy’s primary school. She has also started an online column for BT Sport — and now there are unconfirmed reports that she will be a contestant on the next series of Strictly Come Dancing. A fan of the BBC show, she would be paid £25,000 to take part, rising to £60,000 if she makes the quarter-finals and up to £75,000 for the semis. Add in newspaper interviews and shameless flirting with the young comedian Jack Whitehall on his BBC3 Backchat show, and you have what appears to be a concerted media blitz. Indeed, a glance at Judy’s Twitter (@Judmoo) reveals a media-savvy woman enjoying her moment in the sun. This week she has plugged her sponsored activities, sent out daily words of encouragement to Andy and his new coach Amelie Mauresmo, and kept followers up to date with her hectic social schedule. If she is heartbroken by her split from long-term partner Phil Reid, she is hiding it well. They were together for about five years but are thought to have parted in January. While Judy travels the world supporting Andy and his brother Jamie at tennis tournaments, Andy’s girlfriend Kim stays largely at home. Coaching is still Judy’s chief passion— and turning that Murray Tennis Academy into a reality. And if that means having to bounce a rubber chicken on a purple novelty tennis racquet for her sponsors, then so be it.","Judy Murray's business deals could make her more than £150,000 a year .

"With her creamy skin, toned legs and impressive embonpoint, it is no wonder Sophie Wessex drew admiring glances when she stepped out in a bright red swimsuit on a Spanish beach this week. As she approaches her 50th birthday next January, the Sloany frump who married a Prince has disappeared and, in her place, is a svelte and confident mother of two who has lost weight and isn’t afraid to try daring new styles. ALISON BOSHOFF reveals how the ‘Baywatch Countess’ got ready for the beach — and what prompted her amazing make-over. Scroll down for video . Still got it: Sophie dazzled on the beach in Ibiza wearing a red hot swimsuit in the summer sun . Sophie, who is 50 in January, has blitzed her upper arms with the help of Pilates and a personal trainer. The Countess of Wessex joins some of the other mums at the  private prep school attended by her children at a local Pilates class in Windsor once a week. A trainer comes every week to her home, Bagshot Park in Surrey. Working out on a cross-trainer and swimming have banished any bingo wings. ‘Sophie’s exercises are geared towards her shape and working with what she has,’ says a source. ‘Now she is toned, she looks much better in fitted dresses and suits. She doesn’t do much weightlifting because she doesn’t want veins like Angelina Jolie.’ When Prince Edward saw how well she was doing, he signed up with her personal trainer. His workout is based on Royal Marines exercises — though he dropped out of the famously tough unit after just a few months. She's lost a stone, dropping from a size 14 to a 12 through good old- fashioned cardiovascular exercise. Sophie goes for five-mile runs with Prince Edward twice a week and runs on her own most days. The result is she can wear nipped in waistlines. Gone are the boxy jackets and sensible skirts. In their place are dresses by Emilia Wickstead — a favourite of the Duchess of Cambridge — and a sensational £1,500 electric blue Roland Mouret bodycon dress with a sexy back zipper she wore at the Easter service at Windsor Castle. Blessed with a peaches and cream complexion, much like her late mother Mary, Sophie is beautifully translucent close-up. She wears very little make-up and uses a light spray tan when she wears a backless dress or before a holiday, such as her Spanish break. However, unlike the Duchess of Cambridge, she’s not afraid of tanning naturally. It’s something she can hardly avoid, given her outdoorsy lifestyle of running and riding. Indeed, she sports a tan line around her freckled neck, attesting to her love of the sun. But despite her new streamlined body, she’s eschewed Botox, accepting the fine lines around her eyes and across her forehead. Dropped a stone: Sophie's waist is looking svelte thanks to five-mile runs with Prince Edward twice a week . They've always been sturdy, but Sophie’s legs are now much more toned and muscular, thanks to running and riding horses. Most Saturday mornings, Sophie rides with the family — Edward, ten-year-old Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn, six, who have their own ponies — at Windsor Castle, 11 miles from their home. She is regularly seen on horseback alongside the Queen, to whom she is close. Her Majesty always chooses Sophie to sit next to her on the way to church at Christmas and Easter. They share a great knowledge of  and interest in military history. Sources say the Duchess has done a lot of work on her thighs and they’ve been further toned by her love of skiing — the family took their regular winter holiday in St Moritz this year. However, despite meeting Edward at a Real Tennis event in 1993, she’s not an enthusiastic player any more. Nor does she still play the golf she once loved. ‘She won’t acknowledge she isn’t any good,’ says a source. ‘Certainly not as good as Kate or Pippa in this respect.’ After being plagued by health problems — she had an ectopic pregnancy in 2001 and nearly died from a placental abruption in 2003 - Sophie is keen to safeguard her future health. A key part of this is following a nutrient-packed diet. A royal source said: ‘She’s forward-looking and grateful for what she has. ‘Sophie is focused and has very much put all her troubles behind her. She certainly takes her fitness, diet and health seriously.’ While the Countess is not on a diet, she’s health conscious about what she eats, favouring smoothies or sometimes porridge for breakfast. Otherwise, she likes chicken and fish, plus lots of fresh fruit — she loves watermelon and grapes. However, she does not eat bread, pastries, fry-ups or snacks. Desserts are sorbets and fruit rather than sugary puddings. Sophie enjoys entertaining, but a Wessex supper party is simple: fish pie and salad or the occasional risotto. Even the handmade sausages she indulges in at Prince Philip’s barbecues in Scotland are served with a healthy avocado salad. And, like Edward, she barely touches alcohol, even at official events. The children have a similarly healthy diet and are not allowed snacks, biscuits or chips. At tea parties they are allowed a slice of carrot or beetroot cake. Sophie is sporting £245 Bulgari sunglasses — the designer brand favoured by the flashy and well-heeled, such as WAG Coleen Rooney and Lauren Silverman, Simon Cowell’s girlfriend. However, on the beach Sophie wrapped herself up in a Disney-branded white towelling cover-up costing around £30 — something the likes of Coleen and Lauren would never be seen in. Designer: Like the WAGs, Sophie has a penchant for Bulgari, which she showcased with these sunglasses . Like every woman approaching middle age, Sophie appreciates the importance of good support, be it in a swimsuit or a gala dress. This red swimsuit by celebrity designer Melissa Odabash has ruching and padded cups (‘for an effortless holiday cover-up,’ claims the Selfridges website) to make the cleavage look as good as possible. While many women avoid red for fear of looking predatory, Sophie has actually picked the most flattering choice. As lips and cheeks naturally lose their pink tint as we age, due to a drop in oestrogen levels, a bright swimming costume provides a flattering injection of colour, warming up the skin. Long before Kate Middleton started going to Richard Ward’s salon in Mayfair, Sophie was a customer. But the Duchess of Cambridge apparently kick-started her make-over. ‘Sophie didn’t want to be upstaged,’ says one well-placed royal source. She is blonder than she’s ever been, having creamy highlights every six weeks. And at an age when many women opt to cut their hair short, she’s grown hers to below her shoulders, though she wears it in a ponytail or chignon for formal engagements.","'Baywatch Countess' has lost a stone doing two weekly five-mile runs .

"He emerged from his Chelsea home with a characteristic smirk and a dark glance, and girlfriend Trinny Woodall firmly on his arm. Then, with brutally sardonic humour, Charles Saatchi proceeded to make a joke of yet another disturbing set of pictures of him sitting at an outside table at Scott’s, his favourite Mayfair restaurant, and seemingly reducing a girlfriend to tears. Last summer, it was this very restaurant — and, indeed, this very table — that was the location for the ‘throttling’ lunch that spelled the end of Saatchi’s marriage to Nigella Lawson. Lunch: Charles Saatchi had a meal with girlfriend Trinny Woodall at Scott's, the Mayfair seafood restaurant, a week after she was spotted there in tears . Charles Saatchi enjoys a glass of wine during lunch on Sunday at Scott's with Trinny Woodall. The two sat outside in a public display which came as pictures of them arguing at the same spot a week earlier were published . In pictures revealed yesterday, he is seen there again. Only this time, it is Trinny, his girlfriend of almost a year, who is clearly seen in serious distress, weeping over her ginger ale. Saatchi looks on apparently unmoved, smoking cigarettes and drinking most of a bottle of red wine. At one point, Trinny removes her sunglasses to wipe away the tears. At another, she leaps to her feet, apparently shouting in fury. A witness to the incident says that Saatchi glanced around him to check if anyone had noticed what was going on. Trinny Woodall shows her boyfriend Charles Saatchi something on her mobile yesterday . Charles Saatchi rubs his nose outside Scott's, the Mayfair seafood restaurant, as he dines with girlfriend Trinny Woodall a week after she cried at the same spot . Lawyers for the couple deny there was an argument of any sort. But Trinny, 50, who friends declare is ‘the nicest woman in London’, appeared animated, even distraught at times. After the meal, the pair left together in a taxi. Saatchi, 70, got up first and stood at the taxi rank while Trinny took a few moments, seemingly to compose herself, before joining him. The parallels to the infamous Nigella incident are crashingly obvious. Those shocking pictures, in which the multi-millionaire art collector repeatedly put his hands around Nigella’s throat to her evident distress, resulted in a police caution for him. So, how did Saatchi explain this latest damaging contretemps yesterday? Standing outside his Chelsea home, the former advertising executive merely declared to the Mail that he and Trinny were ‘unconsciously coupling’. Art collector and advertising guru Charles Saatchi wipes his mouth outside Scott's in Mayfair as girlfriend Trinny Woodall gazes into the distance yesterday . In keeping with his dark sense of humour, Saatchi twisted the phrase ‘consciously uncoupling’, coined by actress Gwyneth Paltrow to describe her separation from Coldplay star Chris Martin. Saatchi then ushered Miss Woodall, 50, into a taxi, adding: ‘There, are you happy now?’ And off they went for Sunday lunch. Where? Why, to the very same table at Scott’s, of course. Someone who knows both of them intimately insisted to me yesterday: ‘There is no story. They are very happy together.’ But can this be true — or is history about to repeat itself in Saatchi’s new relationship? Certainly, it seems that Saatchi, a dictatorial bully, has replaced one vulnerable woman with another. But, until now, he and Trinny have found a certain peculiar contentment with each other. The pair started dating only eight weeks after the schism with Nigella and before the trial of the Grillo sisters, the couple’s former housekeepers. Trinny Woodall cracks a smile outside Scott's but boyfriend Charles Saatchi seems lost in thought . It was during the trial that Nigella admitted she occasionally used cocaine and Saatchi contended that his actions during their notorious lunch were merely intended to help his wife ‘focus’. It was a strange time to begin a hunt for a new love — but the extraordinary truth is that Saatchi actually selected Trinny from a shortlist drawn up by his second wife, Kay Hartenstein, to whom he is still close. She was terribly worried that he was ‘falling apart’ without a woman by his side. Others on the list included Martha Fiennes, the newly single film-maker sister of actor Ralph. I’m told that upon meeting Trinny, Saatchi murmured, horror-struck: ‘My God! Those lips!’ But despite his initial misgivings, the liaison became very serious, very quickly. Trinny, too, wasn’t bothered by Saatchi’s reputation. One friend even went so far as to ask her on her publicly accessible Instagram account last October: ‘I have a personal question. How can you date a man who tried to strangle his ex-wife? You are a smart woman, I can’t understand. You are worth so much more!’ Trinny responded: ‘My darling girl — don’t believe what you read in the Press!!!!’ Within three months, Trinny was keeping a toothbrush and clothes at the house in Chelsea that Saatchi used to share with Nigella and her children. He and Trinny dined out incessantly, often at Scott’s. Charles Saatchi and girlfriend Trinny Woodall walk along a Mayfair street (left) having arrived from his Chelsea home in a taxi (right) During the Grillo trial in December, they seemed to be in high spirits, which is more commonly seen in much younger lovers. I . am told Saatchi has spent time with Trinny’s ten-year-old daughter, . Lyla, by her former husband Johnny Elichaoff. The truth is that Trinny . enjoys Saatchi’s dictatorial bent. A few months after her 50th birthday, Woodall looks unhappy as she dines out with boyfriend Saatchi. The meal a week ago ended with the TV personality in tears . The picture that ended Charles Saatchi's marriage to Nigella Lawson - taken outside the same restaurant, Scott's of Mayfair - where he had a spat with current girlfriend Trinny Woodall . And . while Trinny, a recovering drink and drug addict, is notably more . sensitive than Nigella Lawson, she, too, seems to love the lifestyle Saatchi . provides her with. For example, over Christmas, Saatchi treated Trinny and Lyla to a Caribbean trip on a £25million yacht. In February, he took her on a romantic break to Madrid to celebrate her 50th birthday. With . her fondness for twice-yearly Botox, Victoria Beckham dresses and £180 . pots of Sisley face cream, she is not a low-maintenance partner. But neither is Saatchi. In echoes of Nigella, Trinny jokes that she is now addicted to ‘sugar and spending’. And . she, too, has something of an attraction to ‘damaged’ lovers. Her . romantic history, which includes  liaisons with a playboy who died of a . cocaine overdose and a marriage to a banker who fought an addiction to . painkillers, may mean she is able to handle someone as temperamental as . the thrice-divorced Saatchi. A . month ago came a surprising  episode. Trinny and Saatchi were guests at . the opening of superchef Alain Ducasse’s restaurant at the Bulgari . Hotel in Knightsbridge. It . was the sort of event that Trinny and her socialite friends adore — but . to observe the notoriously reclusive Saatchi enjoying blue lobster and . purple artichoke with half of London’s canape society came as a shock. All indications — until these new unsettling images — were of a very happy romance indeed. So why the tears? Yesterday, . friends of Saatchi’s were pressing the suggestion that Trinny may have . been complaining of continuing back pain, as only four weeks ago she had . a disc replaced. That relatively major surgery saw her bed-bound for a week. She is contemplating facing the school holidays with her daughter in less than perfect health. The only clue to her condition is she is wearing thick-soled trainers rather than her usual heels. Saatchi, . meanwhile, knows only too well that his romance with Trinny has been a . surprisingly effective tool in rehabilitating his image. If people . believe he has been bullying her as well, he will lose the PR war he has . fought heartily since his split from Nigella. When contacted by a Sunday newspaper about the pictures, Saatchi denied there had been an argument. In . a callous piece of humour, he emailed the reporter: ‘Why not send a . photographer to Scott’s tomorrow lunchtime and I will give Trinny a good . throttling in time for your deadline?’ Next came bluster, when he again emailed the reporter saying: ‘Please don’t do this. There was no argument. This is so stupid.’ After what appeared to be a public fight at Scott's restaurant last weekend Trinny Woodall seems to have forgiven Charles Saatchi and returns to his home with a couple of suitcases . Just before Trinny Woodall turned up at his Chelsea home with two suitcases last weekend after their public spat, Charles Saatchi and his 19-year-old daughter Phoebe arrived there and appeared to be in a playful mood . Finally, came bullying. ‘Oh just run what you like,’ he exclaimed. ‘How would you like it if someone was  looking at you [when you were eating]? It is a lie. ‘Ask Trinny. This is beyond comprehension. I don’t care what it looks like, you can ask me formally through my lawyer. How dare you. I give up.’ A letter from a lawyer acting for Woodall and Saatchi swiftly followed. For her part, Trinny has even employed the same dark humour. Musing in February about her landmark birthday, she wrote online: ‘It’s great that, at 50, life can still grab you by the throat and shake you up.’ Unfortunately for Saatchi, little has dented Nigella Lawson’s popularity. Her U.S. TV show The Taste has been given a third series and she lives happily in west London with her children. What poison this must be for him. But, in the wake of recent events, the question must be: is Saatchi’s search for a life partner on again?","Saatchi looks on unmoved, smoking cigarettes and drinking red wine .

"The red carpet is normally the place for stars to show off the most recent — and most expensive — designer dresses. So this year’s Baftas were rather unusual. Because rather than Chanel, Gucci or Valentino, most of the celebrities in attendance were wearing frocks from House of Fraser. Yes, the department store more commonly patronised by mothers-of-the-bride in search of fascinators and pastel suits has dipped a toe into the highly competitive world of celebrity dressing. Scroll down for video . Gothic: Sophie Ellis-Bextor opted for a £370 Dynasty dress and an £80 Untold clutch from the store . Amber Le Bon, daughter of Yasmin and Duran Duran's Simon, wore a £290 beaded Adriana Papell dress . And it seems to have tempted most of the Bafta attendees into its gladrags. Take Susanna Reid, who recently defected from the BBC to ITV’s Good Morning Britain. She wore a pink Clara dress by HoF brand Biba — priced at £289 to you and I, free for Susanna. But it was so clingy it left observers wondering why she couldn’t have shelled out on a decent bra to wear underneath. Susanna’s colleague, Kate Garraway, had a freebie of her own, albeit the same frock as her co-star in a different colour — a champagne version. HoF also dressed pop star and Strictly contestant Sophie Ellis-Bextor in a stunning Dynasty black sequin dress. And model Amber Le Bon, daughter of Yasmin and Duran Duran star Simon, was dressed by HoF in a £290 beaded Adriana Papell dress and pretty silver clutch, £80, by Untold. Susanna Reid wore the Biba Clara Grecian-style dress in fuschia, which costs normal shoppers £289 . Susanna's ITV colleague Kate Garraway also opted for the Biba dress but in a shimmering champagne . Far from the Street: Michelle Collins went for a lace mini by Ariella supplied by the now-glamorous store . Soap star Michelle Collins modelled a . champagne lace dress by Ariella, while Phoebe Lettice-Thompson of Made . In Chelsea chose a Biba feather cape, £65, and a green patent clutch . from the department store. Another Biba at House of Fraser fan was Kerry Howard, star of the BBC Three series Him & Her, in a £149 green draped dress. And actress Emily Atack, of The Inbetweeners and Dancing On Ice, chose a HoF Mary Portas jacket, £99, and trousers, £69. Even the men succumbed to the . temptations of House of Fraser. Hollywood star Sam Neill, Jerome Flynn . of Ripper Street and The One Show’s Matt Baker all turned up in suits . provided by the store. So . how did House of Fraser manage to take over the Baftas? Unsurprisingly, . many are muttering that it has rather more to do with its generous . freebie policy than its fashion appeal. The store made its first moves back in April, when the Bafta nominations were announced. Before, the department store was more commonly patronised by mothers-of-the-bride in search of fascinators and pastel suits . Nominees were encouraged to get in touch with House of Fraser as one of the award’s sponsors, and were told they could pop into the store to select an outfit, or request to have dresses sent to them. For the seriously disorganised, there was another option: turn up to the House of Fraser suite at the Corinthia Hotel in London on the day of the Baftas and waltz off with a freebie there and then. House of Fraser spokesman Gayle Griffith said: ‘We are the official menswear and womenswear sponsor to the Baftas. We reach out to all the nominees and the citation readers and offer them clothes. ‘Quite a lot of people went to the Corinthia Hotel to get ready, and if there was a last-minute emergency, we were happy to offer them clothes.’ Ms Griffiths added that sometimes the freebies were only loans — if something was a sample from next season’s collection, for instance — but generally the clothes were complimentary to anyone with a high enough profile. Sam Neill (left) wore one of the store's suits to present the Best Actress award, as did Matt Baker (right) Suited up: Emily Atack, of The Inbetweeners, chose a HoF Mary Portas jacket, £99, and £69-trousers . It wasn’t the end to HoF’s largesse. They also gave a couple of items for the ceremony’s goody bags: a clutch bag and Kenneth Cole bow tie. So what has made them so generous? Well, amid much gloom on the High Street, the chain reported a stellar Christmas. While their rivals Marks & Spencer and Debenhams struggled, they claimed their best ever trading period, with profits up by 4.3 per cent. The independent chain was also recently sold to the Oriental conglomerate Sanpower, which is keen to open 50 stores in China, four in Russia and two in Abu Dhabi.

"Jeremy Clarkson's ex-wife has added to claims the BBC presenter is getting divorced - and insisted his current partner deserves a large chunk of his estimated £30million fortune. Alex Hall, who was married to the Top Gear star for six months, came out in support of his current wife, Frances, from whom he is said to be getting divorced. Miss Hall said Frances had supported Clarkson throughout his lucrative TV career and so deserved a generous divorce settlement. Scroll down for video .

Miss Hall, who left Clarkson for one of his best friends less than two years after their wedding in 1989, told the paper she thought the current Mrs Clarkson had turned a blind eye to his misbehaving. She claimed 'decent and honorable' Clarkson is fully in love with Phillipa Sage, the woman said to be his new girlfriend, who has worked with him on Top Gear.

"Pressure: Nigella Lawson has been faced with a string of personal problems in recent months . An impossibly dewy and gorgeous version of Nigella Lawson still peeks out from the cover of April’s Vogue magazine on news-stands. But in pictures taken on a London street this week, she looks like a different woman altogether: grey-skinned and worn down, her neck lined and her hair sadly sparse. For once, you can easily believe she is 54 years old. Her supporters loyally insist she is ‘subdued’ but far from beaten. For her part, the best fighting talk she could manage — and this was before that embarrassing business at Heathrow airport, where she was denied permission to fly to the U.S. — was: ‘Well, I’m alive. You know, I have had better times.’ With the future of her latest TV show The Taste uncertain, a lavish lifestyle to run and continuing toxic fall-out from the court battle with her one-time aides, the Grillo sisters, these are stressful times for the Domestic Goddess. The embarrassment of being denied entry to America, on account of her self- confessed use of cocaine and cannabis, was considerable. It certainly damaged her image — reviving the drugs scandal that erupted during the trial of her former assistants just as she was hoping to put it behind her. Brian Balthazar, head of programming for AOL Entertainment in America, said: ‘This has to be devastating for her. An incident like this raises all sorts of questions of how she can continue to work and move beyond the troubles of her past.’ The timing is terrible, too. Over the next three weeks, ABC is expected to decide whether to commission a third series of The Taste. Even before the current brouhaha, it seemed unlikely. The show has been mauled by critics, and its relative lack of success is a matter of great sadness for Nigella, who was chasing her big break in America. I’m told that Anthony Bourdain, a fellow judge on The Taste and a big name on U.S. TV, has been championing Nigella among his contacts and that she still hopes to have a career on the other side of the pond. And while she may be relatively unknown in America, she is extremely well-paid there, reputedly earning a £120,000 an episode for The Taste — far more than she could hope to earn here. Torment: The celebrity chef wept as she discussed her troubles on a chat show last month . Sources close to Nigella insist she has become awkwardly aware of money since splitting from Charles Saatchi. Her former husband is worth £130 million, and in their ten years together, Nigella became accustomed to his head-spinning largesse: £7,000 on a sofa, £11,000 on Glastonbury tickets, £25,000 on flowers and so on. Yet Nigella walked out of the marital home with nothing apart from the contents of the kitchen, including her immense collection of cookbooks. It seems she values her dignity too much. (Not for nothing does an old school friend call her ‘lovely, but terribly grand’.) However, she does have a respectable fortune of somewhere between £15 million and £20 million — her career earnings so far. She is living in a £11,000-a-month mews house following stays in various hotels, but is said to have earmarked £3 million for a new London home. By any normal standards, Nigella ought surely to consider herself extremely wealthy. Yet apparently she is worried that she might be ‘broke’ by this time next year. Why? It seems that she will complain in anxious tones that she is ‘no good’ with money. Free: Nigella is said to feel liberated following her divorce from Charles Saatchi . Neither she nor Saatchi seem to have paid much attention to the  gigantic bills run up by the Grillos, hence the extraordinary court case that saw the sisters cleared of wrongdoing. Post divorce, apparently she allows household bills to mount up in a disorganised muddle, but has her redoubtable PA Anzelle Wasserman take care of them eventually. She has also run up huge legal fees after engaging expensive libel and divorce lawyers. One source claims the post-Grillos legal bill was in the ‘high six figures’. No wonder she has been heard wishing she could return to the simple life in Shepherd’s Bush, West London,  she enjoyed with her first husband, the late John Diamond. One friend described her lifestyle as a ‘mink-lined coffin’ because she will have to hang on to a high level of success to sustain it. Put simply, she cannot afford not to work. For example, she recently spent a weekend in Claridge’s hotel in London with a female friend, hanging out in pyjamas and ordering room service ‘for a laugh’. The bill seems to have run into thousands. It’s a lot of money to pay on a whim, even if you are a multi-millionaire. And she is understood to have kept ‘Team Cupcake’ — four women who help her with her website, Twitter feed, cookery app and the daily organisation of her life. She has to pay all their salaries without Saatchi’s help. Star: The Taste, starring Ludo Lefebvre and Anthony Bourdain alongside Nigella, is struggling in the U.S. television ratings . But — money aside — what is the rest of her new life like? By all accounts, Nigella, while sometimes lonely, likes the freedom of not being married. Charles was greedily possessive, demanding she join him in bed to watch TV all afternoon and evening, and insisting on sitting next to her at dinner parties so they could whisper together. She loves reading, but had to keep up with the latest novels in the back of cabs so he wasn’t made jealous by her engagement in something other than him. Now, the Oxford graduate is enjoying books again. She boasted to Vogue, for instance, that she was reading Dante — in Italian. She has also been devouring Dickens and Philip Roth. In a brave attempt to build a new life for herself, she has also reconnected with her old social circle. There have been dinners with the actor Richard E. Grant and the novelist Salman Rushdie, an old confidant. Nigella is also starting to go out to events again. Charles hated parties, but she does not. She was at producer Charles Finch’s Bafta party in February and the recent premiere of the West End production of Fatal Attraction. She was also a surprise guest at a private party to celebrate the publication of author Hanif Kureshi’s new book. The London literary crowd very much pre-dates Charles Saatchi’s influence — and they are delighted to have ‘the old, confident’ Nigella back. Her ‘coven’ of close friends includes fun-loving actress Maria McErlane, documentary producer Olivia Lichtenstein and heiress Jemima Khan. Make-up artist Tricia Woolston is another trusted presence, as is film producer Tracey Scoffield, a school friend. To these have been added male protectors who adore her. They include her smoothie agent Mark Hutchinson, greengrocer Andreas Georghiou, her lawyer Ian Burton and fishmonger Rex Goldsmith. Defiant: Nigella pictured arriving at court to give evidence in the trial of the Grillo sisters last year . There is, though, no new man — yet. Nigella seems to have no appetite for dating, though her friends expect it won’t be long before she finds a romantic partner. Instead there is a scruffy version of domestic bliss. Vogue writer Katherine Phelan found her in a messy home in Bayswater, with books all over the floor, propped up  on silk pillows and drinking builders’ tea. She declined to talk about her failed marriage, saying: ‘I never wanted to speak about my divorce. I had to in court and I hated doing that and I won’t do that again.’ Professionally, she is producing a new book and cookery app for smart phones. But far more significantly she has been re-establishing some harmony at home for her children Mimi, 20, and Bruno, 17. Saatchi found it hard to cope with the youngsters and they ended up leading separate lives — but now they are at least once more a firm family unit. There is regret on Nigella’s side over her relationship with Saatchi’s daughter Phoebe, from his marriage to Kay Hartenstein. Phoebe, 19, lived with them and regarded Nigella warmly as a stepmother. But according to sources on the Saatchi side of the fence, it was Phoebe who became alarmed about Nigella smoking cannabis and informed her father. Saatchi later brought Phoebe to the phone to lay accusations against Nigella before journalists. Nigella, to her credit, sent Phoebe a birthday present last year, but it was returned to her unopened. She has survived a spat with Saatchi’s new girlfriend, Trinny Woodall, who blogged bizarrely: ‘It’s great that at 50 life can still grab you by the throat.’ Nigella retaliated by posting a recipe for ‘slut’s spaghetti’ and later insisted it was not a dig. The romance between Woodall and Saatchi appears, after six months, to have lost its sparkle. Nigella, meanwhile, remains alone, at times stunned by the force at which her once perfect public image has been shattered. To cheer herself up, she’s planning a trip to Malaga over Easter with friends. She remains philosophical about her setbacks and desires only to preserve a little dignity. As she wrote in a newspaper a few weeks ago, she has learned a tough lesson: ‘Perhaps the truth is that everything in life that matters — in the professional arena as with affairs of the heart — cannot be planned.’","The celebrity chef, 53, was pictured looking her age after being denied entry to the U.S. over the admission she has taken cocaine .

"Elegant, seemingly resilient and as much of a perfectionist as her famous boyfriend, L’Wren Scott’s acquaintances would say she had ‘the legs of a gazelle and the hide of a rhino’. Following the shocking news of her suicide last night, we now know the latter must have been untrue. Indeed, she hinted at her terrible vulnerability in one of her final postings on Instagram, where she reproduced the saying: ‘Fashion is the armour to survive the reality of life.’ Scroll down for video . Jagger's girls: L'Wren with two of Mick's daughters Jade, left, and Georgia May . But why did she need armour? And can she have really felt so under attack? Those who knew her say she was suffering from depression and had only just recovered from an ‘incident’ a few weeks ago when she had harmed herself. From the outside, though, it seemed the 49-year-old former model was enjoying a halcyon period, professionally and personally. She had just released an eponymous perfume, on sale in the upmarket store Barneys in New York. Her cosmetics venture with make-up artist Bobbi Brown was also hitting stores, based, she said, on the colours of the roses she grew at the home in the Loire she shared with Mick. Striking: Those renowned 42-in legs - and the little girl she once was named Laura . Her spring clothing collection had been unveiled. She dressed Christina Hendricks at the Oscars and continued to win plaudits for her fashion line. However, there were thousands of miles between her and Mick, who has been performing in Macau and Singapore with the Stones and had moved on to Australia for the next leg of their tour. Last night, various theories were presented as to why she took her life: that she was distraught following failed attempts to start a family or that she was ill. However, one source close to the Stones said she had harmed herself a month ago, although it was hushed up. Fan: L'Wren and Sarah Jessica Parker in a L'Wren design . The source added: ‘L’Wren was really quite troubled and there were some issues over Mick and her standing in the family. It seems she suffered from depression.’ She wasn’t, it was noted, invited to the baby shower that Jerry Hall hosted for Jade Jagger and daughter Assisi in London at the weekend. She was also reportedly frustrated at being apparently consigned to the role of girlfriend rather than wife — not that she ever let on. L’Wren knew that, after divorcing first wife Bianca and second wife Jerry, Mick had no time for matrimony and little for monogamy. She seemed to be playing a long game. But after chalking up 12 years by his side, she could hardly be blamed for hoping for more. One who knew her said L’Wren was ‘one of those people who likes perfection,’ citing her designer glass bathroom and the impeccably furnished house she had created for Mick in Paris. His lack of commitment was far from perfect. Some thought she had fallen prey to the insecurities that are the lot of every rock ‘wife’ who waves a temporary goodbye to her man. The rock wives who stick at their marriages the longest tend to be the ones who go on the road with their men — such as Jo Wood, who gave herself a job as Ronnie’s road manager. L’Wren knew that. She usually liked to be right at Mick’s side. She was there at Glastonbury when the Rolling Stones headlined last summer, in a chic pair of wellies, and in the wings at their last Hyde Park gig. She also designed the stage outfits Mick has worn for the past two years — the snappy trilby hats, oversized coats and slinky jeans with a 28in waist. But for whatever reason, this time, she remained alone at their apartment in New York while Mick, 70, was on the road. The source connected with the Stones told the Mail: ‘She just wasn’t well enough to go on tour with them.’ Nicole Kidman and L'Wren attend The 53rd Annual GRAMMY Awards in Los Angeles, California, 2011. Right, Princess Beatrice and L'Wren at the Serpentine Summer Party, Hyde Park, London June 2013 . Front row friends: L'Wren was seated next to Victoria Beckham at the Chanel 2006 Summer show in Paris . There were other signs of strain. L’Wren cancelled her show at London Fashion Week in January at the last minute, saying her chosen fabrics had arrived too late for samples to be sewn in time. Accounts for her business, filed in the UK in October 2013, show her company, LS Fashion LTD, had a deficit of £3,546,000 with the designer owing creditors £4,592,000. There was speculation last night that she was ‘too broke’ to stage her London show. However, she had just collaborated with the High Street store Banana Republic for a collection that would have paid her around £3million, so perhaps this is an overstatement. She told an interviewer she felt the financial pressure. ‘Every cheque, every penny, I have to be responsible for because it’s my own money.’ Her life story reads like an adventure novel. The adopted daughter of a Mormon store clerk, she dreamed of the big time and made it. Famous friends: L'Wren with actress Ellen Barkin in New York, 2002 . All smiles: Jagger was by Scott's side when she launched her Banana Republic partnership last fall . Humble beginnings: Scott (seen here in 2013 with musician Brian Adams) was the adoptive daughter of Mormon parents and grew up in Utah . Nicole Kidman was one of her closest friends and regularly wore her designs. By the time she met Mick she had already divorced her first millionaire. Given up for adoption at birth, she was named plain Laura by her adoptive parents Ivan and Lula Bambrough, and known as Luann. She grew up in a bungalow in the tiny town of Roy near Salt Lake City, Utah. Her father worked in a DIY store. It was a devout household, with both parents active in the Mormon church. She later said that her upbringing had been ‘like something out of Steven Spielberg’. By the time she was 12, she was a formidable 6ft. She went on to grow a further 4in. Known at school by the nickname ‘Lady’, she excelled at sport and sang in the choir. Loss: The New York apartment building where L'Wren Scott committed suicide. Right, a medical examiner van at the apartment . But she always wanted to work in fashion, and used to make dresses for her Barbie dolls and cut up and remake vintage dresses. At 18, she met the famous photographer Bruce Weber, who encouraged her to believe in her worth as a fashion model. So she applied for a passport and, knowing not a word of French, hopped on a plane to Paris. In a recent interview, she said she had left after her adoptive parents declined to fund a course in fashion design. She said: ‘I didn’t really feel that I was going to be able to achieve my goals in life if I’d stayed there . . . I think I would have felt much more scared not to do it. ‘I wanted to be in fashion. I’ve always thought if you want to do something, just do it.’ Some thought L'Wren had fallen prey to the insecurities that are the lot of every rock 'wife' who waves a temporary goodbye to her man . She began to call herself L’Wren when she became a model, working the catwalk for eight years, and became famous for her incredible 42in legs forming the hands of a clock in a famous David Bailey advert for Pretty Polly tights. While working in London, she met Andrew Ladsky, a millionaire property developer whose mother was a member of the Boucheron jewellery family. They were together for three years, but in 1991 the relationship ended in a bizarre legal wrangle over a couple of valuable paintings and a full-length sheepskin coat. After the split from Ladsky, L’Wren moved to Los Angeles and met another property developer, Anthony Brand. They married, but it lasted just three years and they were divorced in 1996. She met Mick in 2001 on a shoot for a French magazine. He took her on holiday to St Barts, and she was soon at his side at red carpet events. He had been dating Venezualan heiress Vanessa Neumann when they met but L’Wren’s success, independence and one-liners bowled him over. He found her physically bewitching, too, exclaiming she had ‘the best body I’ve ever known’. It was never about the music for L’Wren. As she said last year: ‘I loved Motown, and blues, and classical music, but never rock ’n’ roll. I get made fun of a lot. Mick used to tell me for years that this one particular song was Gimme Shelter, and I’d say: “Oh, I love that song,” but it wasn’t that at all!’ She launched her fashion line in 2005 and quickly acquired many celebrity fans — from Madonna to Angelina Jolie, Mariah Carey to Sharon Stone. Mick would come to all her shows to support her. Their life appeared stable — and was certainly luxurious. She and Mick lived together for several years in a Claridge’s hotel suite, eventually buying a house together in Chelsea. However, due to Mick’s tax arrangements, most of their life together was spent in New York. Long-term: She met Mick Jagger in 2001 on a shoot for a French magazine .

It was said that Mick went on various diets and attempted various spiritual remedies to try to  assist conception, but L’Wren never had the baby she seemingly so wanted. Her mother Lulu observed some years ago: ‘She usually knows what she wants and she gets it.’ And to the outside world it appeared as though L’Wren had everything — the model looks, a successful fashion line and a rock star boyfriend. Yet it seems even this wasn’t enough to save her from plunging into a depression that saw her take her own charmed life.","The designer and renowned beauty appeared to be enjoying success .

"Tonight, Mick Jagger will be communicating with a rapt audience of fans while on stage with the Rolling Stones at the Marine Bay Sands arena in Singapore. Some 6,740 miles away, his former wife Jerry Hall will be sending out her own message loud and clear. For Jerry, 57, has studiously picked a moment when Mick and his new partner L’Wren are firmly out of town to host a rather extraordinary baby shower at their former marital home in Richmond, Surrey. Rock royalty babies: Jade Jagger, 42, is having a baby in May - and her daughter Assisi next month. Jerry will be celebrating the imminent arrival of a new step-granddaughter by her stepdaughter Jade, 42, whose baby is due in May, and of a step-great-granddaughter by Jade’s daughter Assisi, 21, who is expecting a baby next month. The baby shower will be impeccably A-list — lavish enough to require half a dozen cases of vintage champagne — and a very clear demonstration of her continued pivotal role in the Jagger dynasty as its undisputed matriarch. According to pals, the party will deliver a pointed message to Jade’s father Mick and to his fashion designer partner L’Wren Scott about what is seen as a lack of enthusiasm on their side for the impending little arrivals. ‘Jerry is going to such trouble because she has always been fantastic and inclusive to Jade, and they genuinely have a great relationship,’ says a friend of Jerry’s. ‘But she is also doing it to have a little pop at Mick and at L’Wren whom, to put it mildly, the children are not so keen on. They even call her the black spider.’ No stepmonster! The join baby shower for Assisi and her mother Jade will be organised by Jerry Hall, pictured with Armand Leroi earlier this week . So who is attending tonight’s extravaganza? What will they be eating, and how will they be toasting the health of the latest additions to the Jagger clan? We give a sneak preview of an impossibly glamorous — and complicated — gathering. QUEEN BEE JERRY . Jade Jagger has, of course, nothing biologically to do with Jerry Hall. She is the daughter of Nicaraguan beauty Bianca Perez-Mora Macias and Mick Jagger. When Jerry met Mick at a party in 1976, she was with fiance Bryan Ferry and Mick was still nominally the husband of Bianca. Within a year Bianca and Mick were divorced. But because Jerry has been associated with the Jagger clan for almost 40 years, she is now widely considered the matriarch of the clan. By hosting a baby shower, Jerry may indeed be sending a covert message to her replacement, but it also demonstrates that Jerry has a big maternal heart and masses of charm. She has always been surprisingly good at fostering a kind of sisterhood between the various elements of Mick’s family and always did her best by Jade. (The Rolling Stone, remember, has seven children by four women.). All the girls together: (L-R) Assisi, Jade and Amber Jagger, Jade's daughter far left is set to give birth in April . Jerry has always tried to lessen the hurt Jade felt from the break-up of her parents’ marriage. I’m . told that Jerry included Jade ‘in every single birthday, christening . and holiday’ when she was with Mick and Jade was growing up. What’s . more, Jerry’s daughter Georgia May, 22, went to the private school . Ibstock Place, in Roehampton, South-West London, at the same time as . Jade’s daughters Amba and Assisi. They were always friends, so there is . an added connection there. Jade . herself bonds the family because Mick has always idolised her. When she . was born in October 1971, he said: ‘She will be called Jade because she . is very precious and quite, quite perfect.’ He . has since remarked that she was the one good thing to come out of his . ill-fated marriage to Bianca. Jerry, curiously, went on to become . friendly with Bianca. The two women occasionally have tea together . in London. MESSAGE TO MICK . Not coming: Great-grandfather and grandfather-to-be Mick Jagger and partner L'Wren Scott . Jade . was a little reticent about announcing her own baby news, allowing . Assisi to come forward first and get a Hello! deal under her belt before . revealing on Twitter last month that she, too, was pregnant and due . just a month after her daughter. Jade said: ‘Happy to announce this Granny is going to be a Mummy. I’m six months pregnant — double whammy this year.’ The father of Jade’s baby is graphic designer Adrian Fillary whom she married in June 2012. Jerry . felt that Jade needed support from her family because, after a lifetime . of drama and partying, she had made moves to settle down. Before . Adrian, Jade dated DJ Dan Williams for six years and, before him, had a . fling with American singer-songwriter Pharrell Williams, a romance with . publishing heir Dan Macmillan and an affair with artist Euan Macdonald. Assisi and Amba were born . during her relationship with artist Piers Jackson, with Assisi arriving . in 1992 when Jade was only 20 years old. A friend of Jade’s said: ‘Jade has . been feeling like some people have been weird with her about having . another baby. 'It is more than a 20‑year gap between children, which is . unusual. She’s a bit sensitive about everyone’s reaction.’ On . hearing this, Jerry rallied round. A friend of Jade’s said: ‘Jerry felt . Mick wasn’t effusive enough and that L’Wren has barely even . congratulated Jade because she’s been working on her latest design . collection, so she wanted to do a big in-your-face party for Jade.’ Despite . not being married to the father of her unborn child, 25-year-old chef . Alex Key, Assisi is more conventional than her mother. The couple live . quietly on the Cornish coast in a converted barn on a cliff-top farm . overlooking the sea. Assisi is trying to launch a homeopathy business. The Family Stones: Rock chick Jade with Assisi, mum Bianca Jagger, and daughter Amba Jackson . LOOK WHO'S BROODY . Kate Moss, who has been friends with Jade for about 20 years, will be the guest of honour at today’s party. It is a revealing invitation and a chance to heal old wounds. Jealous Kate? Jade and supermodel Moss earlier this month at Paris Fashion Week . Although . Kate and Jade were seen socialising earlier this week in Paris at the . fashion shows, it has not always been such an easy-going friendship. They fell out in 2003 over Dan Macmillan after it was reported that Kate was seeing him behind Jade’s back. Jade dumped Dan and he started to date Kate. It took years for the two women to become reconciled. Yet there is still tension. Kate, now married to rocker Jamie Hince, is desperately envious of Jade’s good fortune in falling pregnant naturally at the age of 42. Now 40 herself, it would be surprising if Kate has not been trying to get pregnant by Jamie. She is said to be keener than ever to cement their happiness with a child. Her daughter Lila Grace, by magazine publisher Jefferson Hack, is 11. guests of honour . Designer Stella McCartney is invited, as are Keith Richards’ model daughters Theodora and Alexandra. Naturally, Jerry’s brood — Lizzie, . James, Georgia May and Gabriel — will be there. Ronnie Wood’s offspring . are also on the list, with TV presenter Fearne Cotton expected to attend . with Ronnie’s son Jesse, her fiance. Georgia . May and Kate Moss will be discreetly kept away from each other. There’s . no love lost between them since Georgia May succeeded Kate as the face . of cosmetics house Rimmel in a lucrative contract. TEA AND FIZZ . The . food will comprise vegetarian platters, roast beef for the meat-eaters . and a red velvet cake. Tea and champagne will be served. One thing is . for certain: the food won’t be cooked by Jerry, who prefers to get . outside caterers for big occasions and sometimes has a housekeeper for . the smaller ones, too. She . is domestic — she keeps chickens and will potter around the garden . collecting their eggs — but everything, it seems, has a limit, and . catering for 40 or so is well above it. Granny to mummy again: Jade Jagger has announced she is expecting a child, at the same time as she is expecting her first grandchild . Baby joy: Jade shared her 'double whammy' news on Instagram . FUN'S COMPULSORY . Guests will not be allowed to just sit around drinking and chatting. Jerry has ordered that all must have fun! Word is that she is ‘going all out’, with balloons and games based around blue and pink quizzes. Photographs of Jade as a baby and of Jade’s two girls as babies will be on display. HELLO! GOODBYE! Jerry has warned her family and guests that this is a private party and no commercial element should creep in. It will be held at her £10 million home in Richmond, which she has always regarded as a private sanctuary. It is Jerry’s bolt-hole, a house she was determined to get from Mick when they divorced. Jade and Assisi are said, however, to have signed magazine deals for after the births of their respective babies. Hello! is believed to be a strong contender having already covered Jade’s wedding at Aynhoe Park, near Banbury, Oxfordshire. And the magazine was granted an interview with Assisi, who said: ‘The women in our family just tend to have children young. It runs in the genes. ‘I grew up quite quickly and wouldn’t have considered having a child if I was doing what my friends are doing at this stage, messing around. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke and I’m very settled.’ Assisi said she phoned her Rolling Stone grandfather to tell him she was pregnant. But she picked up vibes that he had mixed feelings about being a great-grandfather. As Assisi said: ‘I’m not sure he likes the idea of getting old. I call him Mick. I wouldn’t start calling him Grandpa.’","Jade Jagger is due in May - and her daughter Assisi next month .

"Making her comeback: Cheryl Cole yesterday publicly announced her return to The X Factor . She left The X Factor behind four years ago, all dimples and optimism, believing she was about to conquer America and launch an international career. Now Cheryl Cole is – somewhat embarrassingly – right back at square one. She is returning to ITV’s Saturday night series, playing the adoring foil to mogul Simon Cowell – a man who, until fairly recently, she heartily despised. Cowell desperately hopes Cheryl will help revitalise the flagging show. Her last appearance, in 2010, was watched by 17.7million viewers, while the most recent series of The X Factor, the tenth, had a peak audience of 11.5million. However, while her return will undoubtedly give the talent contest a fillip when the next series begins later this year, whether Cheryl can effect a long-term boost is very much open to question. Professionally, she is in the doldrums. She may have a fortune of around £20million, but her pop career is fading. She hired eccentric Black Eyed Peas star Will.i.am against all advice as her manager, and then had to fire him. Her American TV experiment in 2011 was a disaster – she lasted only two days of filming on The X Factor USA. Her Geordie accent baffled viewers, who failed to warm to her. On a personal level, she remains painfully single – posting teenager-ish outpourings of angst on her Instagram account only last week. ‘Don’t believe the things you tell yourself so late at night. You are your own worst enemy!’ she wrote. She also added a picture of herself looking tearful while wearing a baseball cap. The picture was captioned ‘Not today’ and featured some sad-faced ‘emoticon’ symbols. Friends say she is anguished because her best friend, former bandmate Kimberley Walsh, is pregnant while her own dream of motherhood remains unfulfilled. And despite her often-trumpeted status as the nation’s sweetheart, she has made blunders time and again. Take her bid to be ‘gorgeous and free’ in style like her heroine Rihanna, the chart-topping Barbadian superstar with the racy reputation. It resulted in a shockingly nasty rose tattoo all over Cheryl’s previously perfect derriere. It was said that beauty giant L’Oreal . was thinking of dropping her from her big-money contract last year . because they were so annoyed by it. So what is the truth behind Cheryl’s re-emergence? Presumably rather a lot of humble pie has been eaten. After all, when she was sacked from The X . Factor USA in 2011, she sent Simon Cowell the following text message: . ‘F*** you. F*** Fox. F*** Britain’s Got Talent. F*** the orange and . purple outfit. F*** big hair. F*** the UK X Factor. F*** you all. I hate . you.’ In her 2012 autobiography Cheryl: My . Story, she painted a very unflattering picture of Cowell. In one of . their earliest conversations, she said, Cowell spent the whole time . looking over her shoulder because he could see his reflection in a . mirrored building opposite. She . claimed that, while sacking her from The X Factor USA, he offered her . the post of head judge on the UK version, even though he had already . given it to Gary Barlow. She posted this photo on Instagram yesterday to break the news, adding: 'GUESS WHAT!!..?? i'M BAAAACCCCKKKKK!!!!' Delighted: Simon Cowell gave a thumbs up to crowds at a press conference at London's Arts Club . Simon has always been a fan, despite Cheryl's unflattering portrait of him in her 2012 autobiography . He then allegedly offered to sack either Tulisa Contostavlos or Kelly Rowland to make way for her, and said she could choose which one should go. It seemed that there wasn’t much love lost between them. However, despite the success of her single Call My Name, released in June 2012 from the album A Million Lights, it has become obvious to Cheryl that her career without Cowell doesn’t amount to much. A Million Lights had just a fraction of the sales of the previous two albums, and industry insiders say the next one, due out this summer, will make or break her career. Will.i.am had promised that he would help her conquer the American market and said that there would be duets with artists such as Rihanna. These didn’t materialise, and Cheryl didn’t get a US recording contract either. Late last year, she cut the cord with him. Girls Aloud, the manufactured pop band . which took Cheryl from a council estate in Heaton, Newcastle, to . stardom, reunited for a farewell tour last spring but are decisively . apart now. In October, . Cheryl announced that she had signed with Modest Management – which also . looks after X Factor alumni such as One Direction, JLS, Little Mix and . Olly Murs. (She had been suing Blue Sky productions, the makers of The X . Factor USA, for £1.4million of lost earnings. The lawsuit was settled . to the satisfaction of both parties in November.) Simon is hoping Cheryl's return will bring the ratings back to their chart-topping high. There were 17.7m viewers when she last appeared on the panel. But the most recent series had a peak of 11.5m . The pair were known for their flirtatiousness. He would peak down her dress and she would do bunny ears . She will earn a reported £1.5m on the show, and joked that she only returned to stop Cowell's begging . It was clear that Cheryl was turning to Cowell again – and the combination of mass exposure and well-funded marketing which he offers via his TV shows. Indeed, it was Modest Management which apparently came up with a three-year plan to try to extend her life as a celebrity (she will be 31 this summer). Being a part of The X Factor – just for one year – was a key part of trying to get the public to engage with her again. Despite the falling out, Cowell has always been a fan. He once told her: ‘If I knew what made you so special, I would literally bottle it and sell it.’ He had apologised to her over and over again for the sacking, and she has finally been persuaded to come back on board. When asked why she had agreed to return, she joked: ‘I mean there’s only so much begging one can take. It’s not nice to see a grown man cry. ‘If you had asked me the previous two years I would have said “Absolutely not”. This year it just feels right. I always go for my gut instinct. We had a hit show the last time I was on it. I’m really excited to be on it again.’ Of course it will be financially worth her while – she is being paid a reported £1.5million – but Cowell also promised her it would be ‘fun’. Talking about their on-screen reunion yesterday, Cowell said: ‘It took me 2,000 calls, it’s not bad. I know it sounds corny, but it is nice to work with people I like. ‘I know we had a massive fallout but I do consider Cheryl to be a friend. I trust her and she is loyal. We can pick up where we left off.’ Viewers can expect the tight-knit duo to carry on where they left off as Simon says she is a genuine friend . Cheryl's pop career is fading, and she is still getting over her broken marriage, so this should be a boost . Cowell is returning to the show as well, and believes that the public will be intrigued to see the pair’s flirtatious best-of-‘frenemies’ relationship on screen again. That relationship was, admittedly, conducted on a puerile level. Cowell would ostentatiously peek down Cheryl’s dress and make a schoolboyish comment one day, she would make ‘bunny ears’ above his head the next – but the audience did seem to enjoy it. People who know Cheryl say that she could use some fun in her life. They suggest that she is still getting over the messy collapse of her marriage to footballer Ashley Cole, who was caught out ‘sexting’ a blonde stranger in February 2010, only four years after their wedding. A subsequent romance with American dancer Tre Holloway failed to last. Cheryl now lives in a rented flat in north London, which she shares for much of the time with her brother Gary and mother Joan. Though she has posted a series of downright miserable messages on Twitter and Instagram, there have also been signs that, after a difficult few years, she has recovered some of her pugnacity. As she recently tweeted: ‘Before you diagnose yourself with depression or low self esteem first make sure you are not in fact surrounded by ****holes.’ What she will think of her famous colleagues by the time the next series of The X Factor ends remains to be seen.","Girls Aloud star left 4 years ago to break US, blasting Cowell in her book .

"Defendant: Browne was accused of flashing her bra at an officer and 'seductively' leaned towards him . A Police Community Support Officer who developed an ‘unhealthy interest’ in a gay male colleague repeatedly slapped his bottom and spied on him getting changed, a court heard yesterday. Josephine Browne, 50, also allegedly flashed her bra at the young officer and behaved ‘seductively’ towards him in a lift while on duty. Browne is accused of spanking his bottom six times as he and another colleague were moving a filing cabinet at their central London police station in August last year. Jurors heard a colleague also caught the PCSO peering at him while he changed, in scenes reminiscent of 1960 Alfred Hitchcock film Psycho. The pair were employed as PCSOs for a safer neighbourhoods team in north London when the incident took place on August 18 last year. Leo Seelig, prosecuting, said: ‘The prosecution say that she slapped him a number of times on his buttocks and that those slaps were sexual in nature. Miss Browne took an unhealthy and, you may think, an odd interest in her colleague. 'That interest was demonstrated by a number of incidents which occurred earlier that year. The safer neighbourhoods team on which both of these people worked was, in the early part of 2013, a small group of PCSOs based at an office. Their changing room was a single room divided down the middle by a row of lockers.’ The room was split into male and female areas and Browne would peer around a locker door and stare at the complainant while he was changing, the court heard. Mr Seelig added: ‘Shortly after Miss Browne joined the team, he was getting changed in this room when he became aware of somebody watching him. ‘It was Miss Browne and she was standing a few feet away with her face half covered by another person’s locker, peering around it watching him.’ He caught her staring at him while changing four times, jurors heard . ‘On . one occasion he was again getting changed in the locker room when Miss . Browne walked around from her side of it, the female changing side, with . her shirt undone and her bra exposed. ‘When . he asked her what she was doing she replied “Oh, it’s that time of the . month, I’m not quite with it”,’ explained Mr Seelig. Cleared: PCSO Josephine Browne, 50, has been cleared of sexual assault after a colleague accused her of spanking his backside six times. Tonight jurors were still undecided on a lesser charge of common assault . ‘Male’ and ‘female’ signs were put up in the changing rooms after the officer . complained about Browne’s behaviour, it was alleged. ‘Around . March or April 2013 he was working at the team computer and he felt her . hands grip his shoulder and it was Miss Browne’s hands’, said Mr Seelig. ‘When he told her to let go of him she said he looked tense and she told him she would give him a massage. A week or so later he and Miss Browne were asked to conduct a visit to a block of flats... and they had to take the lifts. ‘As soon as the door to the lift closed and the lift started moving Miss Browne leaned provocatively against the walls of the lift, raised her arms above the buttons of the control panel, leaned towards him and said “I know why you’re taking me to the fourth floor”,’ said Mr Seelig. In June the team moved to a different . office where Browne again grasped him by the shoulders as he was working . at the computer, jurors heard. On . 18 August the alleged victim said he was spanked after being asked to . help move a large cabinet. Browne was holding the doors open while the . other PCSOs lifted the cabinet up two flights of stairs. ‘As he had hold of this . piece of furniture, he felt once again the defendant’s hands on his . shoulders and he told her to get off him and open the door’, said Mr . Seelig. ‘A . few seconds later she slapped him three or four times firmly on his . buttocks. He told her to stop and the defendant then slapped him once . more on the buttocks before stopping. ‘All . this attention was completely unwanted by him. As it happens, he is gay and it was upsetting and intimidating for him... Everyone, their . colleagues, knew about it. That attention upset and intimidated him’. Browne’s . unsolicited spanking was the ‘final straw’ and he then reported the . matter, the court heard.  But the PCSO denies spanking the officer. Trial: Browne denies sexual assault and an alternative count of assault by beating at Southwark Crown Court . Addressing . the jurors, Mr Seelig added: ‘I would ask you how you would feel about . this case if the genders were reversed - if this was a 50-year-old man . making advances towards a young woman culminating in him slapping her on . the bottom a few times.’ Later the alleged victim told jurors Browne would speak to plants and dogs while on duty. 'We would got out on patrol, we would walk a few stops forward and Josie would stop and she would be stroking a leaf and she would be talking to it,' he said. And he claimed she 'never' talked to dog owners but 'just the dog'. He said their working relationship was 'okay' but made him paranoid after he caught her watching him. 'When she first started it was okay . then there became an issue in the locker room. It was kind of weird and . made me feel a little bit paranoid I guess,' he said. He . told jurors that on one occasion he had seen her peering from behind . the locker as he changed. 'It threw me, I have never had someone watch . me like that,' he said. On another occasion Browne started to strip in front of her colleague, it was claimed. 'She . came round with her top undone revealing her bra and I said “Josie, . what are you doing” and she said “forgive me, it is the time of the . month”, and went round the other side.' Browne's . advances culminated in her allegedly slapping his backside while he was . struggling to lift a filing cabinet. He said: 'I felt three big spanks . on my bottom. 'I was really . shocked and I was like “oh my god” under my breath. I told her “stop, . can you just stop and open the doors” and she continued - and I think . there was about two or three more afterwards.' He . told the court he saw Browne poised behind his bottom with an open . palm. 'It was hard enough to leave a mark when I got changed that day . there was still a mark there which was about an hour or maybe two hours . after.' 'She came round with her top undone revealing her bra and I said “Josie, what are you doing” and she said “forgive me, it is the time of the month”, and went round the other side' Alleged victim . Fellow PCSO Danielle Figes said Browne turned red as she launched her palm at her colleague's buttocks. 'What I saw was her elbow come backwards and as it came forwards I have heard a connection, so I have heard the slaps.  I heard five occasions of that one after another. 'Her face went red, it looked like she was putting a lot of effort into it and I did think that's got to hurt.  It wasn't in a playful manner, there was exertion put into it. 'I was looking at him and his face was pure and utter shock, he didn't quite understand what had happened. 'He was looking at me, mouth slightly gaped and I was looking back at him with probably the same expression or surprise at what had happened.’ Miss Figes said her relationship with Browne was 'fractious' and admitted she thinks Browne has 'underlying issues that need addressing'. 'You think she is slow,' asked Tessa Shroff, defence counsel. 'That's correct,' replied Miss Figes. But Ms Figes denied wanting to get rid of Browne despite confessing they did not get on in the work place. Browne's boss, retired police sergeant Peter Ryan, said the alleged victim was tearful when he approached him for a chat about the spanking. 'He was quite distressed, he found it difficult to talk to me and he was a bit tearful and he was welling up and he was a bit embarrassed,' he said. 'You would clearly have understood that this was a man struggling to tell me something.  He told me that Josie had inappropriately touched his bottom on that Sunday.' Browne denies sexual assault and an alternative count of assault by beating. The trial continues.

"The Lib Dems are in court today to suppress further allegations about sexual misconduct by one of their MPs. The party is already accused of trying to hush up details of the claims against Mike Hancock, who is said to have made sexual advances toward a vulnerable constituent. Although the allegations were first made three years ago, the MP was not suspended until this week when a report into the case was leaked online. Yesterday there were accusations of a second cover-up after Lib Dem-controlled Portsmouth Council – where Mr Hancock is a councillor – said it would ask the High Court to halt the release of the independent report. Lib Dem MP Mike Hancock, pictured leaving his own in Porchester, Hampshire this morning, is accused of making unwanted advances towards a constituent . The move will cost taxpayers thousands of pounds even when a redacted version of the document is online. Written by a QC, it found ‘credible’ evidence that the 67-year-old was guilty of ‘serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour’. The 39-year-old alleged victim, known as Annie or AH, is in the midst of a civil case against the MP which she launched after police decided not to pursue the matter. Yesterday the mother-of-one told the Mail that Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg’s handling of the affair was ‘absolutely disgusting’ and she had considered taking her own life. She said she felt ‘hugely let down’, adding: ‘The Lib Dems have tried to sweep my complaints under the carpet. This should have been dealt with ages ago, in 2010, when I first came forward, rather than now. ‘The whole of their party should all be held to account and they should hang their heads in shame.’ Much of Nigel Pascoe’s report, commissioned by the council for a code-of-conduct review into Mr Hancock, was blacked out when it was leaked online – and AH has applied to see it all. The Tory and Labour groups on Portsmouth Council want the report to be published, but they were overruled by Lib Dem colleagues, who say solicitors have told them this should not happen until the civil case is over. Mr Pascoe said there was no reason it should be kept under wraps. Last night the Conservative councillor who fought for the report to be published accused the Lib Dems of a cover-up. The 39-year-old alleged victim described Nick Clegg's handling of the affair as 'absolutely disgusting' Donna Jones said the party operated as an old boys’ club interested only in protecting their own interests at the expense of women. And she said the leader of the council, Gerald Vernon-Jackson, was a personal friend of senior Lib Dem Vince Cable – meaning it was inconceivable the leadership in London did not know the seriousness of the allegations. She chaired a committee with two Lib Dem councillors that reviewed complaints against Mr Hancock and said she was ‘blocked at every turn’ and then outvoted on the issue of publishing the report. ‘Mike Hancock’s position has become completely untenable given the allegations against him, particularly against a vulnerable adult,’ Miss Jones told the Mail. ‘This smacks of the Lord Rennard case. It’s all about cover-up and protecting the party’s own interests at a cost to women.’ Mr Hancock was suspended on Wednesday night by his party’s HQ in London. However, as of last night, he had not been stripped of his role as cabinet member for planning on Portsmouth Council. Michael Lawther, solicitor for Portsmouth Council, said: ‘Disclosure of the report is not necessary for the court to deal with the [civil] case – it can hear and test the evidence from both sides. ‘The report is part of the council’s code-of-conduct process, which has been adjourned. It would be wrong for the report to be released before councillors holding a code-of-conduct hearing have been able to consider it and come to a decision. ‘The council has to deal fairly and responsibly with the information it holds. It is not the council’s practice to disclose material as part of a court case in which it is not involved.’ Conservative councillor Donna Jones said: 'This smacks of the Lord Rennard (pictured) case. It's all about cover-up and protecting the party's own interests at a cost to women' Local Lib Dems were last night standing behind Mr Hancock and spoke out to criticise the party leadership. Simon Dodd, chairman of Portsmouth Lib Dems, said: ‘Mike Hancock has loyally represented the people of Portsmouth for over 40 years and he will continue to serve as an excellent constituency MP and as a councillor.’ It emerged yesterday that Mr Clegg had known about the latest allegations since February last year – but had done nothing to discipline Mr Hancock. He recently told his radio phone-in: ‘We did receive a letter in February this year: you’re right, we did receive a fuller letter from the complainant in February this year and I asked the chief whip to look into it.’ Last night Mr Vernon-Jackson refused to respond to media enquiries about his role in the Hancock case or the MP’s future in Portsmouth. It is believed Mr Hancock’s fate as independent councillor and cabinet member for planning, regeneration and economic redevelopment will be decided at a meeting tonight. October 2009 - The woman, known as AH,  meets Mike Hancock for the first time at his surgery to ask for help over dispute with  neighbours. February 2010 - Mr Hancock first visits  AH’s house. March 2010 - The MP takes the woman and her son on a visit to Parliament. He gives her  a teddy bear as a present and starts sending her text messages. June 2010 - AH has a hysterectomy. July 2010 - She makes first complaint about his behaviour to her family support worker. This is passed to the police. September 2010 - AH asks police to open inquiries into Mr Hancock. December 2010 - AH is told that police will not take action. March 2011 - She writes to Lib Dem HQ for the first time about the allegations. No action is taken. 2012 – Lib Dems decide not to take the case further. February 2013 - Nick Clegg’s office receives a letter from AH’s solicitor detailing the case. He accepts he received this. June 2013 - Mr Hancock resigns the Lib Dem whip after AH launches a civil case.","The party are in court today to suppress further allegations about sexual misconduct by one of their MPs .

"Shoplifter Danny from Channel 4 documentary Benefits Street . Channel 4 was facing a police probe last night over a documentary featuring a thief showing how to shoplift. Detectives are considering whether to investigate the criminal activities seen in the programme on welfare claimants. The prolific shoplifter explains how to dodge security alarms and how to remove security tags from designer clothes without causing damage. More than 200 complaints were made to Channel 4 and the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom after Benefits Street aired on Monday night. Residents in a deprived Birmingham road were filmed making false welfare claims and growing cannabis in their homes. John O’Shea, a Labour councillor in the city, said: ‘Channel 4 appear to have aided and abetted shoplifting in Birmingham.’ Superintendent Danny Long, of West Midlands Police, said: ‘We have been inundated with comments from members of the public, many of whom are concerned about elements of the show which showed criminal activity. ‘We are assessing whether the content of the programme can assist  us as part of any investigations or indeed whether any new inquiries should be launched in light of the material that has been broadcast.’ The programme explores day-to-day life in James Turner Street, Winson Green, where, it is claimed, as many as 90 per cent of people claim benefits. Shoplifter ‘Danny’ is seen brandishing a cardboard shopping bag which he has lined with a Primark paper bag covered in foil to stop security alarms going off inside stores. Another resident, called ‘Fungi’, is seen going into a Premier Inn hotel where he picks up four magazines and tries to hawk them for £2.50 each, calling them ‘his Big Issue’. Patrol: Police were on James Turner Street in Birmingham today as it emerged that officers will review whether there should be arrests after what was shown on the programme . Inquiries: An officer knocks at a door on 'Benefits Street', where it is believed 90 per cent are unemployed and survive on benefits . In trouble: On last night's show a man called Danny discussed stealing jackets from a shop in the Bullring shopping centre and was later arrested . Cameras follow him making a sale to a . woman in a smart black sports car. Evidently fooled, she gives him £3 . and tells him to keep the change. He makes £12. Danny . later returns from a shopping centre having apparently stolen five . jackets which he claims he can sell for £250. On the bus home, he shows . viewers how to remove the security tags without damaging the clothes. Fungi . beams: ‘This guy is one of the best shoplifters I have ever met in my . life. This is James Turner street, this is how we’ve got to earn our . money.’ After making £200 in an afternoon, Danny then calls a drug dealer to order ‘two bags and a shot’. Another . resident, Dee Roberts, 32, says: ‘If there’s somebody around and . they’re going to sell you a £120 pair of jeans for a tenner you aren’t . going to say no are you, do you know what I mean, it’s like their way of . living.’ Accusations: People on the street say the Channel 4 show has manipulated them and made their area look like a slum . Criticism: Residents say they mistakenly believed the show was about the strength of the community on James Turner Street, but producers say they simply filmed what they saw, which appears to include criminality . Yesterday it . emerged the jobless youth worker was arrested last summer on suspicion . of possessing Class B drugs with intent to supply. She has not been . charged and protests her innocence. Her home was among four James Turner Street properties searched by police on June 14. Police . said a number of bullets were recovered from one property while a haul . of illegal substances, believed to be cocaine and cannabis, and a large . amount of cash were also seized. During . the programme, a man wearing a black tracksuit, gloves and a full face . mask is seen tending a number of cannabis plants. He says: ‘Basically . everyone does something on the side when they’re on benefits, it can be . from selling tobacco to going shoplifting.’ A . young couple who live on the street, Mark and Becky, told the . film-makers they had all their benefits stopped because of fraudulent . claims. Mark said at one point they were picking up £1,500 a month for them and their two young children. ‘Me and Becky, to tell you the truth, we were doing benefit fraud and was picking up easily £1,500 a month,’ he said. Raids: Police say they seized a number of bullets from one property while a 'substantial' haul of substances, believed to be cocaine and cannabis, and a large amount of cash were also seized from the street . ‘They . stopped everything. I can see why people go out robbing and do time . inside, it pays to be inside – there’s nothing out here.’ Upset: People who live on James Turner Street, including  Dee Roberts and friend Charlene Wilson (right), are unhappy about how they are being portrayed . Channel 4 said it had received around 100 complaints and Ofcom is thought to have received a similar number. Viewers . were concerned about how crime and benefits claimants were portrayed in . the programme, which had an audience of 4.3million. The . broadcaster said the series, filmed over more than a year, was a ‘fair . reflection of the reality of life on a street where the majority of . households receive benefits’. On . the alleged criminal activity, it said: ‘The production crew were . filming in a purely observational capacity – at no stage was criminal . behaviour encouraged or condoned. ‘All . contributors were briefed that if they carried out criminal activity on . camera this could result in criminal investigations after broadcast.’ Channel 4 insisted the programme-makers were careful not to show viewers how to commit crime. Ofcom said it would assess the complaints it received. Yesterday residents featured in the documentary claimed they had been ‘turned over’ by Channel 4. Polish-born . Anna Korzen, 28, has lived on the street for four years with her two . children. She rakes in £900 a month in tax credits, child benefit and . housing benefit. Miss Korzen said: ‘Everyone on the street is so angry, so am I. We have been made to look like tramps.’ The programme also prompted abusive messages and death threats on Twitter, aimed at the programme’s participants. One person tweeted: ‘Set fire to £Benefits Street.’ The . British Retail Consortium said in a statement: ‘Shoplifting is far from . victimless: it affects shops and staff, impacts directly on communities . and can encourage wider criminal activity.’ Not impressed: Mark Thomas, 23 and Becky Howe, 23, say producers of Channel 4's Benefits Street have made residents look like 'slums' Shoplifter Danny from Channel 4 documentary Benefits Street . 'Danny' – thought to be Danny Smith – was the catalyst for most of the complaints to the police. The qualified gym instructor was shown lining a paper shopping bag with tin foil to stop store alarms from sounding during a shoplifting spree. ‘Fill it up with a £2,000 coat or whatever you ****ing want, you’ll walk out of the shop and you’re coming out with no alarms going off’, he said. Smith, a father of three who admitted being too lazy to work, went shoplifting just days after being released from prison. Although cameras did not record him taking any goods, he was filmed afterwards boasting about  his haul of five designer jackets – which he then sold for £200. His criminal record stretches to around 200 offences. He has been convicted 80 times since the age of 12. Subject to an Asbo banning him from Birmingham city centre, he was arrested after venturing back to the shops on another thieving mission. He was also verbally abusive to the police and community support officers who picked him up. The programme ended with Danny vanishing after apparently stealing cannabis plants a neighbour was growing in a spare bedroom. Deirdre Kelly – or ‘White Dee’ – boasted of being the ‘mother of the street’ in the first episode. She was filmed advising neighbour ‘Black Dee’ not to panic when she was served with an eviction notice. And she told an alcoholic neighbour threatened with having his benefits suspended that she ignored a similar letter ‘and they were still paid’. Deirdre Kelly ¿ or 'White Dee' ¿ boasted of being the 'mother of the street¿ in the first episode' Viewers were told the 42-year-old was struggling to bring up two children on benefits and there was no sign of a partner. However, her Facebook page, which is littered with photographs of family holidays and outings to pop concerts, states she is ‘in a relationship’. Although of Irish extraction, Miss Kelly has lived in Birmingham since childhood. She revels in her ‘mother of the street’ image – even using an email address which starts ‘momma_d’. She claimed people were now growing drugs in their spare bedrooms to fund or – as she put it ‘accommodate’ – the bedroom tax. When challenged by the Daily Mail she said her remarks had been made in jest. Dee Roberts, who has not worked for six years, complained that she was duped into appearing in the programme . Dee Roberts, who has not worked for six years, complained that she was duped into appearing in the programme. The 32-year-old – known as ‘Black Dee’ – said residents thought that the show was about a close working class community, but had instead been portrayed as  ‘complete scum’. She is on bail in connection with at least two offences. Roberts was arrested on suspicion of possessing Class B drugs with intent to supply following a summer raid. Yesterday police swooped on her home after she failed to answer bail in relation to a ‘racially aggravated incident’ on the road in August. She was filmed turning to Miss Kelly for support after being threatened with eviction for non-payment of rent, addressing her namesake as ‘mother’.

"Rich tastes: Miss Paltrow . She is the Oscar winning actress turned self-proclaimed ‘lifestyle coach’ who believes that women can transform their lives by adopting healthy diets and fitness. Now Gwyneth Paltrow has released a series of specialist recipes to help her followers launch themselves into a new year with a ‘Warming Winter Detox.’ But those not on Hollywood salaries may find Paltrow’s latest creation a little too much to take – ingredients for her peppermint hot chocolate will cost £50. One of her previous culinary creations led a food critic to claim she had a ‘Marie Antoinette detachment from reality’ and true to form, the recipe, published on her much-ridiculed lifestyle blog Goop, contains a number of highly expensive ingredients. Among the baffling list are almond butter, mint flavoured liquid chlorophyl, spirulina powder and the optional addition of chocolate flavoured protein powder, that makes it sound more like the makings for a chemistry experiment than a hot drink. All this to disguise the fact that though the name may sound like an indulgent treat Paltrow’s version of the cold day classic only contains a couple of tablespoons of raw cocoa and no sugar at all. Instead, like all the recipes that feature in her detox it also avoids any dairy, gluten, shellfish, sugar, caffeine, condiments, alcohol and any other additives. Fans who want to save themselves some cash may resort to leaving out the ‘optional’ chocolate protein powder but even without it the other ingredients are unlikely to be found for less than £38. It's detox o'clock! Gwyneth Paltrow, an avid foodie, has unveiled a January detox menu, which she promises doesn't feel like a sacrifice . And that is not to mention the fact . that most the ingredients can’t be found in normal supermarkets and need . a trip to specialised health food shops. Opening . the latest post on the site Paltrow writes: ‘You know we love a good . detox here at goop and this January is no exception.’ Despite . its prescriptive demands she promises readers that her three-day detox . menu ‘won’t leave you feeling cold and hungry during the winter’ and . offers eight recession-busting detox tips including ‘take saunas’ wear . ‘organic cotton.’ Paltrow . has faced persistent criticism over the advice she posts on Goop with . many mothers accusing her of having lost her a grip on the real world. She . has spoken proudly about her daughter Apple’s choice to become a . vegetarian, a decision she came to ‘entirely on her own’ at the age of . just seven. She also . refuses to let Apple, now nine or seven-year-old son Moses eat gluten or . dairy products and once infamously told an interviewer: ‘I’d rather . smoke crack than eat cheese from a tin.’ In . December she used Goop to recommend that for Christmas, one should buy . friends a £100 Fornasetti scented candle and take a £65 set of Hermes . poker cards as a ‘hostess gift.’ Recipe: The £50 detox winter warmer that is free from gluten, sugar, caffeine, and any other additives . Hard at work: Gwyneth and her team joined forces with a nutritionist to create some healthy recipes for her Goop fans to enjoy . Last . Spring her post on ‘spring wardrobe essentials’ provoked ridicule when . it emerged that they totalled £293,878 and included a silk skirt from . Temperley London, costing £992, and Chloe trousers at £1,200, . In . 2011 she released her cookbook ‘Notes From My Kitchen Table’ which had . frustrated readers searching the aisles of their local supermarkets for . vegenaise, agave nectar and oven roasted kale crisps. But . she has defended lifestyle advice saying she is the victim on . mean-spirited critics saying: ‘Pat of the problem is people get hit of . energy when they are negative about something. ‘They don’t understand why they don’t have a happy life, I feel sorry for them.’ Paltrow became a household name in 1998 when her part in Shakespeare in Love won her the Oscar for best actress. Thanks . to her burgeoning lifestyle empire she now limits herself to just one . movie a year, for which she can command up to £15 million. And today she launched a January detox meal plan, which she promises is 'warming, filling and doesn't feel like a sacrifice'. Writing on her site Goop, she says: 'You know we love a good detox here at goop, and this January is no exception. What, no carbs? Plenty of herbal teas, salads, soups and oily fish feature on Gwyneth's menu . 'We . created detox recipes that won't leave you feeling cold and hungry . during the winter months, with guidance from Dr. Alejandro Junger, a . specialist on the subject. 'We . took to the test kitchen to create a three-day menu of detox recipes . that are warming and filling and don't feel like a sacrifice. 'We . then turned to Dr. Alejandro Junger for some info on how to best detox . during the cold winter months. Dr. Junger contributed the warm shakes - . the rest of the recipes are from the goop kitchen.' The menu advises detoxers to start the day with room temperature water and lemon, followed by a herbal tea and special shake. Lunch consists of either a balsamic miso root salad or chickpea or carrot soup (bread rolls not included, obviously). If . you're feeling peckish in the afternoon, Gwyneth suggests snacking on . walnut lentil pate or a handful of nuts before feasting on coconut . poached salmon, quinoa stuffed squash or pan-steamed chicken and . broccoli for dinner. 'Adjust the times to your schedule and the meals to your taste,' advises the actress. Wise words: Gwyneth, who last year released a cookbook with her dietary tips, writes a weekly lifestyle blog . Foodies . will be delighted to hear that this winter detox is much less strict . than ones Gwyneth and her team have created in the past. 'Our winter detox has looser . guidelines and restrictions than ones we’ve done in the past but', she . adds, 'here is what we’re avoiding: dairy, gluten, shellfish, anything . processed (including all soy products), nightshades (potatoes, tomatoes, . peppers and eggplant), condiments, sugar, alcohol, caffeine and soda,' she writes. The mother-of-two is well-known for her strict health regime and even released her own cook book, It's All Good, in 2012. According to the book's synopsis, after a . gruelling schedule and overindulgence in 2011, Gwyneth was . left feeling fatigued and faint and a trip to the doctor later revealed . that she was anaemic, vitamin D deficient, and that her stress levels . were sky high. Her doctor prescribed an elimination . diet banning coffee, alcohol, sugar, eggs, wheat, meat and processed . food to clear out her system and help her body heal. Now we can ALL look like Gwyneth: The detox eliminates dairy, gluten, shellfish, anything processed (including all soy products), nightshades (potatoes, tomatoes, peppers and eggplant), condiments, sugar, alcohol, caffeine and soda .","Recipe includes mint-flavoured liquid chlorophyl and spirulina powder .

"Bloodied and dazed, David Porter waits for urgent treatment on a bus commandeered by the emergency services. Mr Porter, 63, had been sitting directly below the fallen section of the Apollo’s ceiling and was among the most seriously injured of the 76 casualties. Yesterday he said it was ‘miraculous’ that he had survived - and that it ‘beggared belief’ that more people had not been seriously hurt. Scroll down for video . David Porter and his wife Valerie were injured as they watched the performance on Thursday . Chaos: Mr Porter inside the theatre shortly after sections of the ceiling caved in . He said: ‘If you look at the pictures of the inside of the theatre there is a pile of debris exactly where I believe we were so it seems really miraculous that we walked out of it alive. ‘My wife did say she heard some cracking from above but I didn’t hear anything, I was focused on the stage so it all came completely out of the blue. ‘I had no inclination whatsoever that anything was wrong. ‘I felt a very hard blow to the head and one to the arm, my wife says I just took her hand, stood up and walked out but I don’t remember anything. ‘The next thing I knew we were in the foyer and there were police everywhere.’ He and his wife Valerie, 61, from Needingworth, Cambridgeshire, had been given tickets to the play as a present to mark their ruby wedding anniversary and had been enjoying the ‘best seats in the house’ before their evening took a dramatic turn for the worse. Wounds: Mr and Mrs Porter were recovering at home today after the incident . When the ceiling began to collapse they were pelted with rubble and plaster from above. After being treated on the double decker bus commandeered by the London Ambulance Service to take the walking wounded to hospital, the couple were taken to Guy’s and St Thomas’ in Southwark. Mr Porter was left with a suspected broken arm and a deep gash to his head. He was eventually discharged at 4am with 12 stitches in his head and another five in his arm. He said: ‘The cut in my head was very deep and it . was full of debris so it took the doctors a really long time to clean it . all out. It was 4am by the time they said we could go home,’ he added. Mrs Porter, a former ladieswear assistant, escaped with minor injuries and, although badly shaken by the experience, did not require hospital treatment. Gash: It took doctors until 4am to remove all the debris from Mr Porter's head, leaving him with 12 stitches . The couple were collected by two of their three grown-up sons who rushed down from Cambridgeshire to drive them home. Speaking about seeing the pictures of his bandaged and bloodied head in the news Mr Porter, a retired corporate sales manager said he didn’t initially realise how bad his injuries were. Recovering at home yesterday he added: ‘I wondered why everyone was staring at me, it hurt a lot but I must have been in shock because I didn’t realise how bad it was. ‘I’m very sore today and have a terrible headache but I suppose that is to be expected. ‘It’s ironic because the tickets were given to us as a gift by my wife’s brother. If I had bought the tickets we would have got the cheap ones up in the stalls and we would have been alright, so they are feeling very guilty indeed. ‘We come down to go to the theatre once or twice a year so although this is not the sort of thing you expect when you book tickets I don’t think it will put us off. ‘The emergency services were superb and coped extraordinarily well under the circumstances. ‘It just seems to me that we were very lucky with how things went, it beggars belief how much worse it could have been.’ ‘It just seems to me that we were very lucky with how things went, it beggars belief how much worse it could have been.’ A total of 76 people were injured when a 10 square metre patch of the 112-year-old theatre’s ceiling collapsed during a packed out performance of the play The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time. In under an hour the 720-strong audience had been evacuated or rescued by emergency services.","David Porter, 63, was in the audience at the Apollo Theatre with his wife .

"A Romanian woman detained by immigration officers yesterday told police she had come to the UK looking for free medical treatment on the NHS. Daniella was one of a group of around a dozen rough sleepers who were detained when police and UK border agents raided their makeshift camp in central London. As she was led away, brandishing a plastic bag full of NHS medicines and papers, she said: 'I'm from Romania, I came for the hospital. I have asthma and angina.' Arrest: Officials from the UK Border Agency pictured rounding up Roma beggars at Marble Arch . Checks: An officer talks to a Roma woman checking her immigration status . Possessions: Large bags belonging to the immigrants were piled up nearby, suggesting that many are sleeping rough in the area . The wealthy area around Marble Arch . and Park Lane has become the frontline of the running battle between . immigration officials and Eastern European migrants who sleep on the . streets and beg or steal for a living. Last . night officials said those found to have entered the UK illegally would . be returned home and banned from re-entering for a year. The number of immigrants coming to . Britain from Romania and Bulgaria is expected to rise after restrictions . on their ability to work were lifted by the Government yesterday. However, citizens of the EU who do not have a job and cannot support themselves are not allowed to live in Britain - meaning that officials can deport those who are unemployed and sleeping rough. During . today's raid, border officials searched, fingerprinted and photographed . around a dozen beggars, before taking them away in three Home Office . vans. Checks: A border agent talks to two suspected beggars in the shadow of Marble Arch . Glum: Some of those arrested were pictured looking annoyed as they sat in Home Office vans . Interrogation: An officer talks to women believed to have been sleeping rough at Marble Arch . Smile for the camera: Officials photographed the immigrants before arresting them . As of yesterday, citizens of Romania and Bulgaria have the unrestricted right to work and study in the UK. The new rules are expected to attract tens of thousands of new immigrants to Britain, where the average wage is much higher than in the Eastern European countries. However, they are not designed to benefit the beggars and rough sleepers who have been plaguing areas such as Marble Arch. Prospective immigrants must prove they are able to support themselves and their families, meaning that the homeless or unemployed can be deported and sent home. If they are found to be living in Britain illegally, they are banned from returning to the country within the next 12 months. The immigrants, who could speak only broken English, are expected to be offered free flights home from Britain. Local businesses have long complained of homeless migrants turning one of Britain's most prestigious addresses into a form of shanty town. Luiga Rapuano, who has worked as a hairdresser in the area for 25 years, said: 'This used to be the most exclusive part of London, it's the most expensive place to buy on the Monopoly board, and now it's looking more like a third-world country. 'It's been going on for nearly two years now and we are definitely seeing less customers as a result. Whenever I come to work they are sleeping outside the shop, I have to climb over them to get in. 'During the night they urinate in the . plant pots and outside the shop. The smell is horrific, and then there . are the fag butts, loads of them. 'I wouldn't mind if they came over and tried to get jobs, but they don't, they steal and beg.' Manpower: The Border Agency deployed dozens of officers to the scene . Targets: Roma beggars have been accused of ruining the exclusive area with their behaviour . Offer: The immigrants who were rounded up are likely to be given free flights home to Romania . A local restaurateur added: 'A few months ago there would be a group of 10 of them coming in every day. Theft would go up - pick-pocketing, bag theft, you name it. 'The police and the council seem to be doing more now, we have not had any trouble for a while, but it's a constant game of cat and mouse. The police move them away, and the next day they are back.' Councillor Nickie Aiken said: . 'Residents and businesses in Westminster are all too aware of the . anti-social behaviour that comes with persistent beggars sleeping on our . streets. 'Tackling . the associated hygiene issues alone costs our council-tax payers around . £500,000 every year and, for many months, Westminster City Council has . warned that the problems we are experiencing now have the potential to . worsen and spread across the country.' Suspicion: Officers took down the Romanians' details as they conducted an immigration investigation . Leading away: Police are cracking down on Roma beggars in the wake of high-profile debates about immigration from Romania and Bulgaria . Operation: The Home Office is working with local councils to reduce the impact of begging . And earlier this week, council leader Philippa Roe accused jobless immigrants of defecating on residents' doorsteps as she called for further action against anti-social behaviour in the area. Romanian migrants detained at Marble Arch today will be banned from returning to Britain for a year if they are found to be here illegally, according to a Home Office spokesman. 'This is part of our regular enforcement activity, which takes place across the country on a daily basis,' she said. 'When those with no permission to be in the UK refuse to return home voluntarily we will take action to remove them.'","Border officials round up a dozen Roma immigrants at London landmark .

"Jailed: Royal Marine Sergeant Alexander Blackman was given a  10-year minimum life sentence . The wife of a marine jailed for executing a Taliban fighter has denied that he is a murderer. Sergeant Alexander Blackman was given a life sentence for the killing earlier this month. Video footage played at his trial showed Sgt Blackman shooting dead the captured insurgent at close range. The soldier, known throughout his trial as Marine A, must serve a minimum of ten years. The head of the Armed Forces, General Sir Nick Houghton, was extremely critical of Sgt Blackman’s conduct, insisting he had committed a ‘heinous crime’ and that ‘murder is murder’. But his wife Claire has criticised the sentence, insisting that her husband must not be compared to a common murderer. ‘He’s held his hands up,’ she said. ‘What he has not done in my eyes is commit murder. He genuinely thought, and I have absolutely no reason to disbelieve him, that that insurgent was already dead.’ She said her husband is ashamed of his actions, and that his behaviour was a moment of madness brought on by the mental strain of active service. She told the Daily Telegraph: ‘He’s been convicted of murder, but everything that defines Al points me and everyone who knows him in completely the opposite direction – he is not made that way. ‘If you ask someone what murder is in this country, they might say someone stabbing a little old lady in the high street. Death on active service in a war zone in somewhere like Afghanistan is, sadly, an everyday occurrence. I can’t really imagine the horror or the pressure those lads were under.’ The case of Marine A provoked an outpouring of public support from those who believe his sentence was unduly harsh. By last night more than 41,000 people had signed a petition to Downing Street calling for his immediate release. Shooting: Footage captured by a camera mounted on the helmet of a Royal Marine showing Sgt Alexander Blackman during a patrol in Afghanistan in which an insurgent was killed . Mrs Blackman, 42, said: ‘He should not have discharged his weapon into him – it was the madness of the moment – and he sure as hell wished he hadn’t either ... but he is not a murderer. ‘He can’t undo it, and he’s ashamed of it, but I still don’t think it should have led to where we are now.’ Sgt Blackman was convicted last week by a seven-strong military board. The killing had been inadvertently filmed on a helmet camera. The captured footage showed Sgt Blackman shooting the unnamed Taliban fighter in the chest at close range and then asking his colleagues not to tell anyone because he had ‘broken the Geneva Convention’. Since the sentencing, Sgt Blackman has been placed under special protection measures in prison amid fears he could be attacked. His lawyers have said they will appeal against his sentence.","Sergeant Alexander Blackman was given a life sentence .

"A man dressed as an elf served customers at a Christmas market while allegedly high on class A drugs. Sam Briggs filmed himself working on a charity gift-wrapping stall in Watford amid claims that he had taken cocaine, LSD and ketamine. Officials became concerned when they spotted a ten-minute video on YouTube showing him shaking, gurning, dancing and laughing hysterically as he tries to serve increasingly bewildered customers. Scroll down for video . Elf 'on drugs': Sam Briggs, shown here in costume, posted a video saying he was on drugs while running this stall . Service: Mr Briggs wrapped presents for members of the public while allegedly using cocaine, LSD and ketamine . Video: The clip, uploaded to Youtube, has been viewed more than 350,000 times . Police now say they want to visit . Briggs to give him ‘advice’. The ten-minute film, entitled ‘Drugs at . work’, shows him under the alleged influence of each of the three drugs. He brags that the cocaine makes him feel ‘good’, while the LSD appears . to put him in a trance and ketamine leaves him trembling before he tells . a customer: ‘I love you mate.’ Watford Council, which gave Briggs permission to run the stall, said it was ‘appalled’ and was carrying out an investigation. Hertfordshire . Police said there was ‘no physical evidence’ of illegal drug taking in . the video, which has now been viewed almost 357,000 times on YouTube. Briggs served dozens of people at the stall, and then posted a video entitled 'Drugs at Work 2' online four days later. The video, made up of three clips, purports to show him under the effects of cocaine, then LSD and then ketamine while he offers to wrap presents for members of the passers-by. Cocaine and LSD are Class A drugs, while ketamine is a Class C substance. At one point in the videos - filmed on December 21 and 22 - he says to the camera he ‘feels a little bit wobbly’, before laughing with customers as he wraps their presents. During another point in the video he struggles to focus, telling himself: 'Come on Briggs, hold it down.' He then adds: 'What circumstances have led me to this point in my life?'. At the start of the video, text explains that : 'The people who allowed us to run the stall had no idea about the drugs. All money raised was genuinely for charity. Don't try this yourself.' It adds: 'Sam had an elf helper on standby in case anyone under the age of 18 came to the stall.' The video has received more than 350,000 views since being uploaded to YouTube on Boxing Day. While police have been alerted to the video, they have said that it contains no 'physical evidence', and that they will only try to 'give advice' to Mr Briggs about what he has posted. Feeling the effects: At one point Mr Briggs told the camera he was feeling 'a bit wobbly' 'Appalled': Watford Council, which allowed Mr Briggs to run his stall, issued a statement condemning his actions . A spokesman for Hertfordshire Police said today: 'Police are aware of the video on You Tube and have assessed its content. 'Whilst the video contains no physical evidence of drug taking to suggest a criminal offence has been committed, officers will be seeking to identify and speak to the individual captured on camera to give advice regarding the appropriateness of his videos and supportive commentary.' A spokesman for Watford Council said: 'Sam Briggs was granted permission to wrap presents at Watford Market over the Christmas period to raise money for charity. 'The request was approved in good faith by Watford Borough Council after receiving the relevant documents required. 'Naturally we are appalled and do not condone the actions of this person and we will be conducting a full investigation into this matter.'

"A former PA was jailed yesterday for being the madam of a 'despicable' gang which trafficked more than 50 Hungarian women to  Britain to work as sex slaves. Victoria Brown, 25, was from a respectable family but became the 'logistical organiser' in the gang, which made £20,000 a week from prostitutes holed up in hotels, brothels and even a university halls of residence. Brown organised flights, booked hotel rooms, collected money and took victims' passports. Mate Puskas and Victoria Brown, a former couple in the gang that organised the trafficking of young women and forced them to work as prostitutes in brothels across the UK . Women as young as 17 were flown to . Britain on EasyJet and Wizz Air flights and forced to have sex with up . to 15 men a day. Many were recruited from deprived parts of Hungary and . told they would be working in the massage industry. They . were put up in hotels around Gatwick, in flats across the South East . and in Bristol and Norwich as well as in Manchester, Leeds, Cardiff and . Glasgow. The gang also used a room in a halls of residence at the . University of Sussex. Women . were advertised on sex websites as 'fresh meat' and threatened with . exposure at home if they fled. The gang collected £100 an hour but kept . most of the money for themselves while refusing to hand back passports . until the women had paid off their 'debts'. Defendant Zolton Mohacsi outside of Hove Court . Hove . Crown Court heard Brown acted as 'loyal lieutenant' to gang ringleader . Mate Puskas, who was also her boyfriend and the father of her . 21-month-old son. Jailing . her for three years yesterday, Judge Richard Hayward told her: 'It is . very sad to see you in the dock. 'You are intelligent, you come from a . respectable family, you had a good job, and you threw it all away for . Mate Puskas.' He described . her defence, in which she blamed her crimes on Puskas and said she acted . under duress, as 'unattractive'. Her lawyer, Nicholas Hamblin, claimed . she had performed only 'secretarial activities' and had made no personal gain from the trafficking. She had taken out loans of £21,000 . under pressure from Puskas and was bankrupt, he said. Brown . attended Felpham Community College in Bognor Regis and worked for an . engineering firm in Brighton before joining the gang. Last night her . father Stephen refused to comment from the  £150,000 family home in . Bognor Regis.

"They are probably not top of most people’s must-have list, but gifts on sale this year include empty boxes and rhinoceros dung. Waitrose is selling the empty wooden crates, priced at £10 and £15, for shoppers to fill with food, drink and other items to create a gift tailored to a friend or relative. It says the boxes come with a gift label and ‘plenty of wood wool stuffing to nestle the goodies into’, adding: ‘They make useful storage boxes after Christmas too.’ Exotic fertilizer: The Natural History Museum suggests you gift a loved one with a box of rhinoceros dung . And for the keen gardener who already has all the tools they need, the Natural History Museum has an offering that will certainly stand out on Christmas Day. Their ‘rhino poo in a box’ gift set promises to be the ‘ideal environment’ to cultivate the seeds of a banana plant (included), which you can then transfer out into your garden. It is collected from rhinos living in British zoos and specially treated to kill germs and bad odours. And at just £5 it’s the perfect treat for your not so favourite relative - even if they don’t have a garden. Guinevere Short, retail operations manager at the Natural History Museum, said many of their bestselling gifts appealed to the ‘silliness’ of British present giving. Precious gift: Waitrose offers a 'Create Your Own Gift' box for £10 or £15 - but then you have to put things in the box as well . She said: ‘I can say the rhino poo in a box is one of our most popular stocking fillers without a doubt. ‘We also do elephant poo and also reindeer poo which you can grow roses in - that is particularly popular this time of year. ‘I think gifts like that appeal to the British love of scatological humour and silliness, everyone seems to think it is funny. ‘We have definitely made a conscious decision to broaden our efforts especially with regard to adult gifts which previously were quite neglected. ‘We realised we were very lucky here to have the whole of the natural world as our mood board so we have been really capitalising on that to great effect. ‘Now we have dinosaur baubles for the Christmas tree, bone shaped Jenga sets and even an anatomically correct heart pendant.’ Other museums and galleries have widened their giftshop ranges this festive season to appeal to shoppers bored of the high street. Unusual items on offer include an Elizabeth I wine glass lampshade, £7 from the National Portrait Gallery, which transforms a wine glass into a tealight holder. While the Natural History museum is selling a felt elephant head, £75, as a friendlier alternative to the more traditional stag’s antlers. And for the person who really does have everything, the V&A has a blue crystaled spot LED lightbulb in its half-price pre-Christmas sale for £87.50.","Waitrose suggests giving away empty wooden crates for £10 a pop .

"This is the terrifying moment a trainer was mauled by a tiger at a zoo founded by the late Steve Irwin. David Styles, 30, suffered puncture wounds to the neck and shoulder after the tiger dragged him into the water after becoming 'over excited' at Australia Zoo. He was treated by paramedics before being flown to the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital by the RACQ Careflight helicopter in a serious condition. Scroll down for video . Attack: This is the terrifying moment a trainer was mauled by a tiger at Australia Zoo, the Queensland institution made famous by the late Steve Irwin . Mauled: David Styles, 30, suffered puncture wounds to the neck and shoulder after the tiger dragged him into the water after becoming 'over-excited' after a show . Injured: A colleague rushes to his aid. Mr Styles is in a serious, but stable condition at hospital following the attack . He was conscious and breathing, but was sustained two large puncture wounds from the attack. He is now in a serious, but stable condition with his family and friends at his bedside. The . zoo is famous throughout the world as it was owned by crocodile hunter . Steve Irwin who was killed by a stingray barb while swimming off the . North Queensland coast in 2006. Australia Zoo director Wes Mennon was quick to comment the actions of a group of zoo keepers  nearby who saw the attack and helped drag the trainer away from the tiger. Tragic: David Styles has worked with big cats for nine years but suffered horrifying injuries in the attack today . He said: 'At the time of the incident, our emergency response team were on the scene immediately.'They acted professionally and calmly. My hat goes off to them.' Mr Mennon said Mr Styles had nine years experience with big cats and had raised the tiger since it arrived at the zoo as a cub. He added: 'Our priority is the wellbeing of the handler, who is a valued member of our Australia Zoo family. Our full support is with the handler and family.' Rushing to the rescue: Mr Styles colleagues can be seen beating the animal with a large stick as they try to pull him to safety . Bravery: Australia Zoo director Wes Mennon commended the other zoo keepers for behaving 'professionally and calmly' Dragged to safety: The attack took place by the edge of the water, witnesses said it looked as if the animal was trying to drown his handler . The shocking attack was witnessed by as . many as 50 people, among them 14 year old Jake D'Olimpio, who told the . Courier Mail that the incident occurred during a performance with the . tiger. He said he saw the tiger jump on the front of the trainer and lunge at the man's neck with his jaws. He said: 'It was horrifying.They fell in the water and the tiger was trying to hold him under. 'The other trainers, maybe four of them, tried to fight the tiger off. One of them was hitting it with a stick.' Prior to the attack, Jake told the paper, the trainer had been patting and playing with the tiger. 'It was an accident,' he insisted. 'It was not an act of aggression. It was part of a routine and just an unfortunate mistake.' Asked what would happen to the tiger, Mr Wes Mannion, the zoo's director, said: 'Nothing.' The . zoo keeps three Bengal and eight Sumatran tigers. Visitors are offered . the chance to be photographed with the animals every afternoon. Frantic: A team of six paramedics work on Mr Styles in an attempt to stabilise him before being transferred to hospital . Emergency evacuation: Mr Styles is carefully loaded into a waiting air ambulance to be flown to hospital . In 2009 there were two attacks on . keepers at the zoo, one by a Bengal tiger and another by a Sumatran . tiger, in both cases the keepers were hospitalised but recovered from . their injuries. It remains unclear what caused this attack but it is thought to be the most serious in the zoo's history. Steve Irwin's widow, Terri, still has involvement with the zoo and the crocodile hunter's children Bindi and Bob are young TV stars in both Australia and the US. Daring displays: A handler feeds a tiger at Steve Irwin's Australia Zoo, which is home to three Bengal and eight Sumatran tigers . Family venture: The Crocodile Hunter with his wife Terri, and their four-year-old daughter Bindi pictured in 2002 . Mr Irwin, who shot to fame as the star of the hit show The Crocodile Hunter, died on September 4, 2006, aged 44. He was swimming with stingrays in the Great Barrier Reef when, it is . thought, one of the fish went into defensive mode. It flipped up its . tail and hit Steve in the chest with a barb that pierced his heart. His . daughter Bindil, then aged eight captivated the world when she strode . onto the stage at her father's funeral to give a tear-jerking eulogy in . front of 5,000 people and 300 million TV viewers. In . her address she described the conservationist as ‘my hero’, adding, ‘He . listened to me and taught me so many things, but most of all he was . fun.’ Now 15  she is a .

"The distraught family of a war veteran who died after being beaten by a dementia patient on an NHS hospital ward last night branded his death a ‘national disgrace’. Nurses found Richard Bowman in a pool of blood in the foetal position in bed with massive head, leg and arm injuries. Despite emergency surgery the 86-year-old died 12 days later. Last night his family said he should never have been left alone with his attacker, who is also thought to have bipolar disorder. Richard Bowman, 86, died 12 days after he was found by nurses at West Suffolk Hospital in a pool of blood in the foetal position after being beaten by a dementia patient . ‘It is a national disgrace to go to hospital and be beaten to death,’ said his son Charles Hawes, 63. ‘He was laying on his bed getting ready to fall asleep and this chap just came over and started laying into him with a bottle. ‘All we know is Dad put himself in the foetal position to protect himself and his arms, legs and head took the brunt of the attack. The attack was atrocious. ‘We don’t know how long it went on for or how it stopped. He was 86. He was much too weak and elderly to fight back. He couldn’t walk more than ten yards without being out of breath. He couldn’t fight back. What could he do? ‘He had paper thin skin, so when he was battered he was covered in large cuts. There were bad injuries. The police have got the photographs. There was a lot of blood. It’s the last place you’d expect something like that to happen.’ Mr Bowman, a retired businessman who served with the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was admitted to West Suffolk Hospital, in Bury St Edmunds, on November 25 with a chest infection. He had been in and out of hospital over the past few years with repeated chest infections but each time he recovered quickly and was discharged. Mr Bowman's son, Charles, said his father should never have been left alone with his attacker, who is thought to have bipolar disorder, and says the hospital 'have closed ranks' Following the attack he had a skin graft and was told he would never walk again. His family questioned the post-mortem examination finding that his death on Saturday was from natural causes. ‘We don’t know for sure if he died because of the beating,’ said Mr Hawes. ‘But I can only say what everyone else is saying – it didn’t help his situation. His body was fighting something else. He had to have surgery on his leg afterwards to repair the damage and needed a skin graft. 'He was much too weak and elderly to fight . back. He couldn’t walk more than ten yards without being out of breath. He couldn’t fight back. What could he do?' Richard Bowman's son Charles . ‘If he survived he would have been in a wheelchair. ‘The hospital were in touch with my older brother at first but now they have closed ranks.’ Mr Hawes said he had heard that his father’s attacker was bipolar and should have been under observation. ‘You’d expect staff to have been there at the hospital on the ward,’ he added. ‘Whether they were there witnessing what happened, I don’t know. We can’t get any information. ‘There will have to be an inquiry. How did it happen?’ Mr Bowman, who lived in Exning near Ely, fought for the British Army against Communists in Greece for four years and married a Greek woman, with whom he had his two sons. After two decades together they divorced and he spent most of the rest of his life with his second partner Jackie. Mr Bowman had emergency surgery and was told he would never walk again after the attack but died 12 days later (file picture) He ran a number of businesses, including an estate agency in Suffolk, and met the Queen when he was a school governor in North London. His son said: ‘Meeting the Queen was his claim to fame. She opened up his school in North London when he was on the board of governors. They shook hands. He was obviously very proud.’ Suffolk Constabulary said it was not treating Mr Bowman’s death as suspicious. A spokesman added: ‘This matter will now be dealt with by the Coroner. ‘Officers continue to investigate reports of an assault against the deceased man at the hospital on November 25, 2013.’ A spokesman for West Suffolk Hospital said: ‘We would like to take this opportunity to extend our sincere condolences to the patient’s family. ‘We are taking this incident extremely seriously and are carrying out a full internal investigation, as well as assisting the police.’ In 2002, a grandmother dying of cancer was raped in a toilet cubicle in a London hospital. The attack occurred on a ward shared with men and reignited anger over the Labour Party’s failure to deliver on its promises to get rid of mixed sex wards. The frail 71-year-old was attacked in a toilet cubicle at King’s College Hospital, South London. She told police that her assailant struck after she had got up to go to the toilet.","Richard Bowman, 86, died 12 days after being beaten by patient .

"A midwife with decades of experience told a woman in labour that she would remove her baby ‘with a knife and fork’, it has been alleged. Marion Owens, who worked as a senior midwife at Liverpool Women’s NHS Foundation Trust, is also said to have sworn repeatedly at the expectant mother, telling her: ‘I’ve been a midwife for 20 f****** years and no f***** is telling me how to f****** care for a f****** woman in labour.’ The outburst emerged in papers released prior to a hearing by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) into Mrs Owens’s fitness to practise that began last week. The case was adjourned and no new date has been set for its resumption. Sacked: Marion Owens, who worked as a senior midwife at Liverpool Women’s NHS Foundation Trust (above) was sacked for the shocking outburst . The NMC states in its code that midwives must respect ‘dignity’, ‘provide a high standard of practice and care at all times’, uphold the reputation of the profession and ‘must always be able to justify… decisions’. The victim was not named in the allegations set out by the NMC ahead of the case, but was instead referred to Patient A. Mrs Owens was sacked in December 2012 – six months after the alleged incident – after displaying ‘serious and significant failings’, according to the Trust. She began working as a nurse in 1987 before qualifying as a midwife in 1993, but has temporarily been banned from practising midwifery. It is also alleged that while caring for Patient A, Mrs Owens gave her a dose of Prostin, which helps induce labour. Reputable:  Coleen Rooney, wife of England captain Wayne Rooney, gave birth to her two sons Kai, four, and Klay, one, at the same hospital . Prostin, a brand of the medicine Dinoprostone, should be prescribed with ‘special care’, according to the NHS, but Mrs Owens gave it to the patient without a prescription. The NHS website warns that one in 100 people who take the drug experience problems with the foetus, such as foetal distress or heart-rate problems. Last night Mrs Owens’s husband, speaking from the family home in Liverpool, dismissed the alleged comments as ‘banter’. He told a reporter who asked to speak to his wife: ‘I would not have thought she would want to talk to you because she was quite upset at the way it was portrayed.’ When the reporter read the allegations put forward by the NMC, Mr Owens, who would not reveal his first name, said: ‘I don’t think that was exactly how the conversation evolved. Like I say it was banter, it was taken out of context. If she thought it was going into print I think she would be horrified.’ Coleen Rooney, wife of England captain Wayne Rooney, gave birth to her two sons Kai, four, and Klay, one, at the hospital. In May, Jeanette Matthews, a midwife from West Yorkshire, was struck off after she threatened to ‘cut’ a patient while she was in labour. Ms Matthews, who worked for Airedale NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘If you don’t hurry up and have this baby I am going to cut you.’ She then asked the patient to ‘hurry up’ because she had ordered a curry. Ms Matthews was removed from the midwifery register after a panel found that it was ‘the only sanction that would be sufficient to protect patients and to protect the public interest’. Referring to the case of Mrs Owens, a spokesman for the Liverpool Women’s NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘While no direct patient harm was found to have been caused, the midwife in question was deemed to have displayed serious and significant failings in her professional duty of care. ‘This investigation resulted in her dismissal from Liverpool Women’s in December 2012, and the Trust also referred its findings to the Nursing and Midwifery Council.’","Marion Owens worked at Liverpool Women’s NHS Foundation Trust .

"Tesco's embattled chairman is a Whitehall and City veteran who is not shy of bruising showdowns with Ministers and company executives. But in his spare time Sir Richard Broadbent runs courses with his Buddhist wife in ‘compassionate communication’. One colleague said he appeared to be a typical City boss in a sharp suit but was actually an ‘ageing hippy’. Scroll down for video . Buddhism: In his spare time, Tesco's embattled chairman Sir Richard Broadbent runs courses with his Buddhist wife in ‘compassionate communication’. One colleague has described him as an ‘ageing hippy' Rise and Fall: Tesco's half year profits for the last five years, including this autumn's revised prediction . Sir Richard, 61, is under fire over his leadership during the time when Tesco somehow over-stated its profits by an incredible £250 million. In particular questions are being asked about why the supermarket’s finance director Laurie McIlwee was allowed to leave without a replacement being ready to start work immediately. The Tesco chairman tried to strike a bullish tone when he was grilled about the accounting scandal on Monday – but admitted there would be calls for him to go. He said: ‘Shareholders I’m sure will decide… whether I’m part of the solution or part of the problem. But my intention is to continue being part of the solution.’ Sir Richard started his £625,000-a-year job at the top of Tesco in 2011, having previously worked in senior roles at the Treasury, Barclays and bus and train operator Arriva. Yet despite his reputation as a tough businessman and mandarin, he is also a devotee of the touchy-feely philosophy of ‘non-violent communication’. He and his wife Jill run an organisation called the Centre for Compassionate Communication from their stunning £2.6 million home overlooking the Regent’s Canal in Islington, north London. Share prices in Tesco plunged today despite the chain's new finance director Alan Stewart, left, being parachuted in early following talks between Tesco CEO, Dave Lewis, right, and Stewart's former boss at M&S . Under pressure: Tesco has taken a hit to profits after competition from low-cost rivals such as Aldi and Lidl . The couple put on regular workshops and courses to help people achieve a ‘more compassionate and enriching understanding both of others and ourselves’. Lady Jill, 48, who married the Tesco chairman seven years ago, has been a practising Buddhist for two decades and goes by the name Vajraghanta. Sir Richard is ‘heavily involved’ in running the counselling centre with his wife and also has a farm in Norfolk, according to a senior Tesco insider. The source said: ‘Basically, he is an ageing hippy. It certainly looks and feels like a Buddhist group. He and his wife host the groups together. He is a distinctly odd chap.’ Sir Richard was born in Cambridge in 1953 and studied at Queen Mary College in London and Manchester University. He spent 14 years at investment bank Schroders before becoming the first non-civil servant to be made a permanent secretary when he took over at HM Customs and Excise in 2000. After being knighted in 2003, he joined the board of Barclays, where he chaired the remuneration committee that set the multi-million-pound pay of the bank’s controversial former chief executive Bob Diamond. Tesco's falling market share: Big increases by rivals Aldi and Lidl have hit the retailer badly . He was also chairman of Arriva for six years before being made chairman of Tesco in November 2011. The Tesco insider was scathing about Sir Richard’s suitability for the string of high-powered positions he has held. He said: ‘I understand he was called ‘Mr Panic’ when he was in the civil service, according to his senior colleagues. It was always a case of, “What is it now, Broadbent?” as he came running into the office. ‘There are not many people who think he knows what he is doing.’ The source said Sir Richard’s biggest failure was to get rid of Mr McIlwee when his replacement, Alan Stewart of Marks and Spencer, was not due to start until December. He added: ‘They are trying to cover up the extremely poor judgement of having a gap or six months or more where they did not have a chief financial officer in place. ‘He was not strong enough to ensure that when they decided to hire a new chief financial officer from Marks & Spencer that he started with immediate effect.’","Sir Richard Broadbent runs courses in 'compassionate communication'

"British scientists are calling for anorexia sufferers to join a ground-breaking study to find the genes that may cause the condition. Researchers from King’s College London have joined forces with experts from around the world in  an effort to prove that victims are born with the illness. Anorexia affects about 1.6 million people in Britain alone. Charlotte Bevan, who died in January, and her daughter Georgie who was diagnosed with anorexia aged 12 . In the largest example of genetic research ever done into the eating disorder, King’s has already analysed the DNA of more than  300 former anorexia sufferers. Their target is 25,000 DNA samples worldwide, including 1,000 volunteers from Britain. Brooks Newmark, the Minister for Civil Society, who last year revealed that he had suffered from anorexia, has already donated his DNA. The global project, called AN25K, was launched by Cynthia Bulik,  a professor in the field of eating disorders at the University of  North Carolina. After carrying out research into anorexia in twins in 2007, she discovered that the illness can be inherited, and that more than half the risk of developing the disorder is due to genetic factors. She said: ‘We know very little about the biology of anorexia and hopefully by identifying these genes we will be able to develop new treatments. It is not just one gene – it will be hundreds of genes.’ Ground-breaking: In the largest example of genetic research ever done into the eating disorder, King's has already analysed the DNA of more than  300 former anorexia sufferers . The UK research is backed by the charity Charlotte’s Helix, set up in memory of Charlotte Bevan, a farmer’s wife who died aged 48 in January. Her daughter Georgie was diagnosed with anorexia aged 12. Charlotte rapidly became aware of the stigma associated with the illness and was frustrated by the lack of scientific research being done. She was convinced that her daughter’s eating disorder was in her DNA and that Georgie had not chosen to be anorexic. After . being diagnosed with terminal cancer, Charlotte wrote a book on . anorexia designed to help parents. She also founded the charity to . collect the DNA of anorexia sufferers and fund research into the . illness. In . her book, Throwing Starfish Across The Sea, Charlotte wrote: ‘I want . people to stop being afraid  and ashamed of something that is not their . fault. I want to educate the 99 per cent of the world that don’t know or . don’t care that the eating disorder world deserves a voice. ‘I . want people to know that my daughter is not a vain, mindless bimbo who . just wants to be thin, but a stellar, brilliant, important part of the . community who just happens to have a brain blip.’ Gerome . Breen, a senior lecturer at King’s, is leading the AN25K project. He . said: ‘What we want to discover is are genetics and biology behind the . illness, because if we can find the biology behind the illness, we can . design specific treatments. We want to help sufferers survive.’ Erica Husain, a friend of Charlotte and chairman of the charity, said: ‘We knew we were going to keep this going for her. We wanted to find a way to carry research forward, to bring this research to the UK and put Charlotte’s name on it.’ She added: ‘There are still a lot of myths and tales and this is something  that can give us some reality, some science. People will then understand that an eating disorder is not an illness of choice.’ The research has been backed by Britain’s leading centre for eating disorders, the Eating Disorders Unit at the Bethlem Royal Hospital, which is part of South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. Janet Treasure, the unit’s director, said: ‘The research looking at interactions between genes and the environment is invaluable because it does take away a bit of the guilt and confusion from families who are dealing with eating disorders.’ Charlotte’s Helix has no government funding and relies on donations to pay for DNA samples to be taken.","King's College researchers have joined experts from around the world .

"Britons are at the centre of an international animal rights protest after a dog was thrown into a hotel machine used for crushing rubbish and later died. Staff at the hotel in Cyprus had apparently tried to dispose of the stray poodle in a large recycling bin fitted with an electrically-operated crushing mechanism. The seven-month-old puppy was found by holidaymakers lying at the bottom of the bin still alive, but having suffered horrific injuries. Appalled tourists called a local vet to the scene but the dog, dubbed Billy, died within days. Scroll down for video . Anger: British expats and tourists protest at the Anastasia hotel in Cyprus where stray puppy Billy was thrown in a crusher bin before he died . Now thousands have signed an online ‘Billy’s Law’ petition calling for Cyprus to enforce animal cruelty laws and bring animal abusers to justice. Expat Britons and holidaymakers from the UK have also joined calls for a boycott of the Anastasia Beach Hotel. Thomas Cook and easyJet, which both offer holidays to the hotel in the resort of Protaras, said last night they were ‘extremely concerned’ by the allegations. Antonis Alkiviades, who works at MedVets, the surgery which cared for Billy, said: ‘When we went to the hotel, he was already in a coma. We were shocked and it was even more of a shock when we were told he was put into this bin.’ The seven-month-old puppy was found by holidaymakers lying at the bottom of the bin still alive, but having suffered horrific injuries, including a broken back and brain damage . Mr Alkiviades said Billy had a broken back and other broken bones and was unable to breathe. Vets later realised he had brain damage. Billy was visited by dozens of concerned locals and tourists. Briton Lynn Gandy, 61, said: ‘He looked terrible. He was a poor, frail, little dog. To think somebody could throw a live animal into a crusher beggars belief. It is savagery.’ Another woman said the local reaction to Billy’s death had been so fierce that she feared there would be riots. On Friday, British tourists joined expats marching outside the Anastasia, which is part of the Tsokkos group, Cyprus’s largest hotel chain. They held banners with slogans reading ‘Punish people who abuse animals’ and ‘Support Billy’s Law and stop animal cruelty now’ while also chanting ‘Justice for Billy’. Ross Breakwell, from London, who was on holiday in Cyprus, said: ‘I never imagined a country within the European Union could be so lax when it comes to something as important as animal rights. ‘I’m shocked and disgusted by this incident. It will make me think twice before coming back to Cyprus and I definitely would never stay in a Tsokkos hotel. All tourists to Cyprus should boycott the company.’ Mr Alkiviades also called for tougher laws on the island. He said: ‘You have the RSPCA in the UK. We don’t. We need people to be able to reinforce laws and punish cruelty.’ Nicos Anastasiades, the president of Cyprus, condemned Billy’s death and described the incident as ‘a disgrace for society and our country’. Thomas Cook said: ‘We take such incidents extremely seriously, and in no way condone this type of alleged behaviour. 'This is obviously a very serious allegation, given that Thomas Cook closely audits properties to ensure the very highest levels of health, safety and quality standards are maintained.’ Tsokkos Hotels said: ‘Hotel management received complaints from customers about the fact that a sick stray puppy wandered around. The hotel manager immediately gave instructions to two employees to take the puppy to a local shelter to obtain appropriate care. ‘Unfortunately, the employees did not follow the instructions and proceeded to an inhuman act, unacceptable and condemnable by Tsokkos Hotels. 'As soon as Tsokkos Hotels became aware of the incident, the puppy was transferred to a veterinary clinic to receive all necessary treatment.’","Holidaymakers found 'Billy' the poodle with horrific injuries in the bin - including a broken back and brain damage .

"To parents they are a bewildering jumble of letters – but these coded messages may be the first clue that their children are self-harming, being bullied or groomed online, or even driven to suicide. Teenagers and predators alike are using their own language and acronyms on Facebook and other social networking sites to conceal the true nature of their conversations. Among the danger signs are ‘Dirl’, meaning ‘die in real life’ and used by cyber-bullies to urge victims to kill themselves, and ‘Gnoc’ – ‘getting naked on camera’ – used to lure young people into getting undressed. Teenagers are using their own language and acronyms on Facebook and other social networking sites to conceal the true nature of their conversations . Other terms may at first seem innocuous. ‘Bio-oil’ is simply a skincare product, but on chat forums such as Ask.fm, it can indicate self-harm scars; while #cutfor is used on Twitter to promote self-harm in the name of a celebrity. Now 1,500 schools across Britain are using new software to sort out innocuous phrases from dangerous ones. And when a warning sign is detected, a pop-up alert is displayed on the teacher’s screen. If a student searched for ‘clavicle’, for example, a screen shot would be sent to the teacher with an explanation that the word is often used by anorexics seeking pictures of girls with protruding collarbones. Jonathan Valentine, of software house Impero, said: ‘You hear all these horror stories of children being bullied and then committing suicide.

All smiles: Prince Harry, the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William look out on to the crowds as they gather outside Buckingham Palace . Maybe she was suffering from  yesterday’s high pollen count. The couple stood next to Prince Harry when they appeared at the end of the parade that marks the Queen’s official birthday. The turnout of younger Royals included Lady Helen Taylor’s daughters Eloise, 11, and Estella, nine – but there was no sign of Prince George. More than 1,000 soldiers marched in unison for the ceremony, which has been an annual event since 1760.

"A social worker who helped elderly people by day and performed a lewd burlesque act dressed as a pensioner by night has been disciplined by her council employer. Amy Spilsbury-Butler, 39, used the stage names Molly Marmalade and Old Molly for her act, in which she danced wearing a hairnet, slippers and oversized coat. She was rebuked by her employers after an online video of her performing was seen by a  relative of one of her clients, who made a complaint. Amy Spilsbury-Butler, 39, used the stage names Molly Marmalade and Old Molly for her act, in which she danced wearing a hairnet, slippers and oversized coat . Ms Spilsbury-Butler then posted ‘inappropriate’ comments on her Facebook page about the relative’s concern. At a hearing of the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC), the panel said that Ms Spilsbury-Butler had breached the standard of behaviour expected of a social worker. One of the stipulations of the job is that ‘high standards of personal conduct’ must be kept. She was ordered to remove the videos of her Molly Marmalade act from the internet, told not to portray ‘vulnerable’ people in any future act, and ordered to clear new dances with bosses before performing them. The panel concluded that Ms Spilsbury-Butler’s competence  as a social worker at Bromley Council in Kent was ‘not in question’ and a three-year caution order was imposed. That means her name on the industry register will now be accompanied by a note containing details of the hearing. The Health and Care Professions Council said that Ms Spilsbury-Butler had breached the standard of behaviour expected of a social worker . Notes from the panel said: ‘According to Ms Spilsbury- Butler, the outcome and recommendations at her original hearing included to refrain from portraying vulnerable people in any burlesque acts that she did in the future. She has given her employer specific details of her current  acts and confirmed that none of them portray such people.’ Despite the rebuke, Ms Spilsbury-Butler continues to perform burlesque. She has changed her stage name to Alabama Breeze and new  internet videos show her undressing and shaking her breasts  and bottom at the audience. The care worker regularly performs at burlesque nights with names such as Infinitease, wearing corsets and wigs. Writing on her own website, Ms Spilsbury-Butler, from Bromley, describes her act as consisting of ‘sensual fan dances, balloon- popping routines and those cheeky  little routines that are only  performed after midnight’. She adds that she is an ‘accomplished actress and pin-up model’. On her Facebook page, she describes her current act as ‘a  little more dark and daring’. A Bromley Council spokesman said yesterday: ‘It would not be appropriate to comment on an individual case. The council has addressed the matter and taken appropriate action.’ Ms Spilsbury-Butler was  unavailable for comment last night, although she has previously admitted in submissions to the HCPC panel that her behaviour was ‘silly’ and ‘highly inappropriate’ and expressed her regret.","Amy Spilsbury-Butler helped elderly by day but performed lewd act at night .

"Anguish: Many computer users are receiving messages which falsely accuse them of using vile websites . Innocent internet users are  being blackmailed by hackers who are infecting their computers with  a virus that displays a fake message accusing them of watching child pornography. The virus, known as ‘Kovter’, uses imitation logos that appear to belong to authorities such as the Metropolitan Police and other forces. It then holds the bewildered computer user to ransom and says that unless payments of £100 to £300 are made, legal action will be taken. The National Crime Agency – Britain’s FBI – last night urged victims not to pay the ransom and to contact Action Fraud, the UK’s internet  misuse reporting centre. The virus, thought to have been developed by Eastern European gangs, is part of a new wave of  ‘ransomware’, in which hackers masquerade as authorities in order to extort money. A typical fake warning reads: ‘Such actions, in whole or in part, violate Protection of Children Act 1978 Possession s160 Criminal  Justice Act 1998.’ In extreme cases, the victim’s screen freezes and becomes locked on the home page of a pornographic website, or indecent images of children appear on the screen. Action Fraud said it had received 134 reports of viruses which reference child pornography in the past six months, but it is believed that many cases go unreported. Many of those targeted have never visited illegal or pornographic sites and experts believe that because victims are so embarrassed by the warning, many do not report it. One victim, targeted by hackers who used a Metropolitan Police logo, said he initially failed to report it because he was embarrassed, even though he had never downloaded any illegal material. The lorry driver from Cheshire  added: ‘It looked convincing. There was a big list of everything you could possibly do wrong on a computer and it said you have done one of these things, ranging from child porn to downloading music illegally.’ Researchers from security firm  Damballa say that the number of cases seen globally each day has risen from an average of 9,783 in April 2014 to 24,825 per day in May but could not give UK figures. Warning: Users have been receiving messages using logos from authorities such as this one pictured . Adrian Culley, a former cybercrime detective with the Met, said he had advised individuals and companies on porn ransom attacks. He added: ‘Because so many people have at some time or other seen porn on their computer, an attack from this malware can make them think they have something to worry about. But in the vast majority of cases they don’t and the cyber gangs are playing on the vulnerable psychology of the computer user.’ Mark Reckless MP, who sits on the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said: ‘This sounds a particularly nasty computer crime. I’d like to congratulate The Mail on Sunday for bringing this to the attention of your readers. It is that exposure and public education as well as police enforcement which is needed.’ A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘Anyone who is a victim of this ransomware will not be in trouble.’","Internet users blackmailed by hackers infecting computers with virus .

"London Fashion week is finally over, the style gods have spoken — and very little of it made much sense. Directives for next season include ruffles, tulle (that’s netting to you and me), cropped jackets, lots of lace, flares, anoraks, animal prints and so-called ‘sports luxe’ (over-priced plimsolls). That is nothing, however, compared with the one trend that fills me with genuine horror. Colour. There is one trend that fills Sarah with terror, colour, as seen during London Fashion Week. She feels black is far more flattering on her figure. Colour was the big hit of the week, as seen at the Burberry show last Monday, and not just any old colour. Like Tutti Fruttis, they came in pinks, purples, oranges, greens, yellows and exotic blues, a Pucci-esque mish-mash of clashing brights. For once, all those oversized sunglasses so beloved of fashionistas must genuinely have come in handy. Anna Wintour, queen of American Vogue, has only one hard and fast fashion rule: never wear top-to-toe black. Which, of course, is one of the reasons I do. All the time. Winter, spring, summer and fall: black, black, black. Not just to annoy, but also because it suits me. Remember that fad a few years back for ‘colour analysis’? None of us were wearing the shades that suited us, the experts said. Get it right and you can look younger, prettier, thinner. Like a fool, I did it. A nice lady came to my house, professed herself horrified at the tenebrous state of my wardrobe, then spent the morning draping me in various brightly coloured swatches. It was a revelation. She concluded that black was, in fact, the colour that suited me most. The only useful piece of advice was that I should never wear brown. So, my idea of colour is the occasional sequin or, perhaps, a little print. When it gets really hot, I might concede to a splash of khaki, or a white linen shirt. I own a few colourful scarves, and one or two striking handbags. but my default sartorial setting is black. Anna Wintour, queen of American Vogue, has only one hard and fast fashion rule: never wear top-to-toe black . Which is going to make next spring and summer slightly awkward. Because, by then, the garish pinks and purples we saw (together!) on catwalks of the likes of Burberry and Michelle Obama favourite Roksanda Ilincic last week will have filtered down to our shops, and there’ll be nothing that isn’t migraine-inducing on the racks. So, do I stock up on my favourite black now, while it’s still in shops, or do I — and I can feel my chest tightening as I consider this — bite the bullet and see if next season’s biggest trend suits me? ‘Of course, you can wear colour, Sarah,’ one fashionista friend told me, snootily. ‘Embrace it. Don’t be afraid. The more it clashes, the better. In six months’ time, no one will turn a hair anyway, everyone will be doing it.’ Emboldened, I took myself off to the High Street and ventured to sections I barely knew existed. What to choose? Thankfully, stores such as Marks and Spencer and New Look already have so much colour it could blind you — heaven knows what it’ll be like next year — so I grab armfuls of brights and head home. And that’s when I discover the truth. Ladies, don’t be fooled. Not everyone can wear colour. if you need any proof, just look at the photo of me above. I look like a cross between a children’s entertainer and an explosion in a paint factory. It’s no way for a respected member of the community to appear in public, is it now? The green shirt squashes my boobs, makes my arms look like sausages and clings to every bit of my muffin top. And does it go with the electric blue-and-pink skirt with its horrid little frill (two trends in one, right there)? Does it heck! M&S should be ashamed for making these clothes. However, by contrast, their coat is a triumph. At least its only sin it its orangeness. And the shoes are a revelation. from New Look, they’re extremely comfortable for a pair of spiky heels. The Russell and Bromley bag is a laugh, too, though they do say yellow is the colour of madness, which, in the context of this outfit, is most apposite. On a much smaller, much younger woman, it could just work. Carrie Bradshaw in her pomp would have, as the saying goes, ‘rocked’ it. As would a small child. Or a clown. But put it on Mrs Average, and it eloquently illustrates the abyss that exists between the catwalk and real world. In the latter, women dress for confidence and convenience. Black, it is well documented, has a minimising effect. And if, like me, you’ve never been entirely happy with your size and shape, it simplifies and shrinks the silhouette, muting rather than amplifying it, which is just the way I like it. (Granted, a big bum is still a big bum, whichever way you package it up. But black allows me to disappear a little, which, when you’re the size of a small horse, is no bad thing.) In the real world, we women don’t let our appearance dominate our existence. We choose clothes that require minimum fuss and effort, but flatter us. The garish pinks and purples seen on catwalks of the likes of Burberry and Michelle Obama favourite Roksanda Ilincic last week will have filtered down to our shops . So, a wardrobe full of black is a god-send because, when we’re trying to get dressed of a morning, the children are squabbling and our husband can’t find his car keys, we know we can throw on any old combination and look OK. That, as we all know, is the kind of thinking the world of fashion cannot abide. It absolutely relies on women to feel dissatisfied with their appearance, to crave something new and exciting. If we all just declared ourselves happy with the way we look, they’d be out of business. Hence their determination to show me, and the countless other women who go through life very happily dressed as Sicilian widows, the error of our ways. But, this time, it’s they who are wrong. Any lingering suspicion this refusal to toe the fashion line might be my fault was blown away the moment my daughter walked through the door and snorted with laughter. My son looked slightly panicked. My husband looked up and said, ‘Ooh, orange. ‘Do you think that’s wise?’ ‘No’, was the obvious answer but, without time to change, I wore the whole damn thing to dinner with friends. ‘Wow. You look . . . amazing,’ said my hostess, as she opened her front door. There followed one of the most uncomfortable evenings of my life. Far from feeling fabulous and fashion-forward, I felt horribly self-conscious. Deprived of my normal camouflage, I couldn’t get comfortable, either. I felt everyone was staring at me — and not in a good way. We left early. I couldn’t wait to kick off that skirt and change into my (dark-grey) pyjamas. Bliss. Will I ever wear top-to-toe colour again? Maybe if I lost a couple of stones and dropped a few years. But, for now, I fear, it’s back to black for me.","Colour was the big hit of the week, as seen at the Burberry show last Monday, and not just any old colour .

"As a big girl in a world which has always wanted me to be thin, I know all about fat shaming. It is a relatively new term, yet it describes an age-old attitude to those of us to whom the size-10 rail at Topshop might as well be the tip of Mount Kilimanjaro; to people who, for whatever reason, fail to keep their size in check. It stems from the belief that we are fat because we are weak-willed, slovenly and very possibly subnormal. Like naughty puppies who do their business where they ought not to, we must be punished by having our noses rubbed in it until we learn the error of our ways. There’s just one problem: it doesn’t work. Not the puppy thing (although, actually, that doesn’t work either) but the being mean to fatties in the hope they will lose weight. Scroll down for video . Pressure: Sarah Vine, pictured in her 20s, said heavy hinting about her weight as she was growing up entrenched her eating. 'The more they tried to get me to diet, the hungier I became,' she said . A team at University College London has found that people who are made to feel ashamed about their size are six times as likely to overeat as a result. Far from encouraging them to lose weight, being criticised simply drives them to comfort-eat more. Without wishing to denigrate the work of the good scientists at UCL, I could have told them that for nothing. All my life people have been telling me to lose weight. And all my life it has only made me want to eat more. It started as a teenager. I’d been a skinny child so, when I began to put on weight, there was concern. No one in my family is fat. We have many other faults — drunkenness, promiscuity, greed — but never obesity. It was most unexpected. At first, my pudge was tolerated. There was a feeling that I’d grow out of it, that it was just a phase. Then — and I can’t quite remember when — it became A Thing. It didn’t help, of course, that my mother was as thin as a whippet and a more beautiful version of Anjelica Huston. At dinner time I would reach for seconds and there would be a certain amount of throat-clearing. Did I really think another potato was wise? Wouldn’t I prefer some green beans instead? Or perhaps just a glass of water to fill me up? She said it didn't help that her mother, pictured, was as thin as a whippet and a more beautiful version of Anjelica Huston . If people offered me food, it would be refused on my behalf. At one point, a weight-loss self-hypnosis tape mysteriously appeared in my cassette player. Someone was clearly trying to communicate a message: I was overweight and I needed to do something about it. But instead of jolting me into action, all this heavy hinting just served to entrench my eating. For the first time in my life, I began to steal food. I was hungry, see. Hungry for the unconditional love that only a slice of hot buttered toast with Marmite can offer. I became an expert stealth-eater. (I still am: I can walk past a table of canapés and hoover up half of them before most people have had a chance to take off their coat.) I began to associate eating with a furtive kind of pleasure. I carried on putting on weight and, before long, I was the same dress size as my age — 14. No one could understand why: all the snacks were under lock and key, and mealtimes were closely monitored. But the reason was simple: the more they tried to get me to diet, the hungrier — and more cunning — I became. I started hanging out at friends’ houses in the hope of scoring some food. Italian houses (I grew up in Italy) are full of food. Lovely, delicious, generous quantities of guilt-free food — quite a lot of it pasta-related. While at home food was rationed; here it was freely on offer. I quickly learnt to binge. What I couldn’t eat, I hid — to be enjoyed later in the privacy of our bathroom (that being the only room in the house that had a lock on the door). Let me tell you, you haven’t lived until you’ve eaten mushroom tagliatelle out of the sink. Of course, my family were only trying to help. They wanted the best for me and, for them, the best meant looking gloriously lean and lovely on the beach. They’d say things like, ‘You’d be really pretty if you lost a couple of stone.’ And they were probably right. But that knowledge only made me feel more sad, which made me even hungrier. One Christmas — I remember it as clear as day — I ate an entire bag of mini Mars bars. When this was discovered, I was in so much trouble that I was banished to my room for Christmas dinner, like a naughty fat Labrador. Not only was I greedy, I was now also morally reprehensible. After all, what kind of person ruins Christmas? Throughout my teens, this idea became firmly entrenched. Thin people are good and virtuous, useful and productive members of society; fat people are spineless parasites. That is why, when I put on weight, I am consumed by self-loathing. When I am thin (or something approximating thin), by contrast I could conquer the world. People’s responses only served to reinforce this notion. If I dropped half a stone, friends and family would congratulate me and lionise me. Once, I was treated to a shiny new wardrobe — from Benetton, in those days the height of sophistication — purely thanks to my ability to fit into a size 12. The message was clear: being thin and being loved were, if not exactly the same thing, then very much in neighbouring ballparks. All of which is a very long-winded and rather self-centred way of saying that losing weight is not as simple as eating less. No matter what people like Katie Hopkins — the TV personality and former Apprentice star, who has deliberately piled on four stone in a bid to show fat people like me that shedding the weight is just a question of willpower and discipline — might think. Because, in the majority of cases, being overweight is not a symptom of moral lassitude, laziness or just sheer piggery; it’s a symptom of a deep-rooted psychological problem. My own theory — for what it’s worth — is that fat people are depressed. When the mind is healthy, it simply doesn’t tell the body to overeat. Essentially, fat people are people who, instead of turning to alcohol, cigarettes or drugs to cope with their troubles, self-medicate with food. Sarah Vine says fat people are usually depressed and need help, not humiliation . There are no end of lavishly funded programmes to help people who abuse alcohol or drugs. Armies of doctors and nurses and counsellors with sympathetic nods and understanding smiles and government-funded budgets. Smokers can get patches and help on the NHS. Drink and drug addicts get taxpayer-funded rehab, NA and AA. Crucially, all these highly addictive and physically destructive substances are in some way controlled, either in the form of taxation or by the law. Sugar, by contrast (which studies have found lights up the same area of the human brain as cocaine, only more so), is freely and cheaply available to everyone. So what kind of help do fat people get? Humiliation and mockery and harridans like Hopkins treating them with utter contempt and scorn and turning their condition into a reality TV show and, no doubt, a lucrative book and DVD deal. Of course Hopkins is not going to struggle to get back into her size 8 dresses. The woman has the sensitivity of Genghis Khan combined with the modesty of Emperor Napoleon. She may well have psychological problems, but they’re not because of her self-loathing. Fat people get doctors like the one who, when I was first diagnosed with an underactive thyroid, made me strip to my pants and pinched my tummy before telling me to restrict myself to 1,200 calories a day for the rest of my life. I was 28 at the time. And we get a food industry that is free to peddle the high-sugar, high-calorie, high-carbohydrate diet, which is the architect of our destruction, at rock-bottom prices. For someone who struggles with emotional eating, the corner-shop sweet counter is the equivalent to handing an alcoholic the keys to the cellar. Nine out of ten fat people don’t want to be fat. Just as most drunks would rather be sober and most drug addicts clean. They need help, not humiliation; sympathy, not aggression; and, yes, a bit of help from society to keep them on the straight and narrow. Above all, they need to reset their relationship with food. That means learning to see it once again as fuel, and not as comfort or a place of refuge from all those cruel and counterproductive jibes. All of which would be an awful lot easier if people would be a little more understanding.","Scientists say telling people they're fat makes them comfort-eat 6 times more .

"Facebook users have slammed Sportsgirl's new collection, 'Polynesian Girl', labelling their marketing campaign as 'culturally insensitive'. The Australian women's fashion chain launched their floral spring collection this month and so far it has received negative feedback from consumers online. The fashion label's use of a skinny blonde, blue-eyed  model in their campaign has been the target of criticism, as social media users insist that their representation of Polynesia is an insult to their culture and style. The Australian women's fashion chain launched their floral spring collection in October and so far have not received positive feedback from consumers . Floral and leafy patterns of bright yellows, reds, blues, pinks and greens are used to illustrate the fashion labels idea of a 'Polynesian' theme but Facebook comments insist that Sportsgirl design is a poor representation . Floral and leafy patterns of bright yellows, reds, blues, pinks and greens are used to illustrate a 'Polynesian' theme but Facebook comments insist that Sportsgirl's design is a poor representation of the culture. 'Floral patterned material does not make it Polynesian, and your blonde model shows even more lack of thought! tacky tacky tacky!,' Amanda Hoppitt wrote on Sportsgirl's page. Although many clothing companies release floral designs, this fashion chain has negatively aroused some Facebook consumers, causing them to post heated comments on their page. The fashion industry has slowly stopped using cultural appropriation in their marketing technique after Elle magazine was slammed for featuring musician Pharrell Williams in a native American headdress on their front cover in June this year,birdeemag.com reported. Another user has attacked their campaign, insisting Sportsgirl is 'taking advantage of another culture' in an 'attempt to make it a fashion statement' Consumers on Facebook have pointed out that Sportsgirl has ignored this cultural issue and instead demonstrates poor and distasteful marketing in their new collection. 'Poorest taste in fashion advertising I have ever seen, totally culturally offensive!', Tree Macleod wrote. Another user who has attacked their campaign insists Sportsgirl is 'taking advantage of another culture' in an 'attempt to make it a fashion statement'. 'Reducing a whole area of Islands with all its richness and cultural diversity down to a fashion line that is only profitable for your company. AND using a white, blonde model to represent Polynesian WoC is extremely offensive. THIS IS BLATANT CULTURAL APPROPRIATION', Ms Hoppitt wrote. Sportsgirl has also been slammed for their sizes, as Maeve Tib claimed majority of Polynesian women would be unable to fit in their clothing. 'A shop that doesn't even produce clothing at sizes a lot of Polynesian women would be able to wear makes some floral clothes, pops them on a white chick then calls it 'Polynesian Girl.' Do you have internet access, Sportsgirl? Did you research this at all? Have you managed to miss ALL the debate about cultural appropriation, racism and diversity? Ridiculous,' Ms Tib. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Sportsgirl for comment. The first Sportsgirl store was opened in 1948 in Melbourne and since then the company has established 114 stores nationally.

"Giving back: Glenn Close is auctioning off her Damages wardrobe to benefit the mental illness awareness charity she founded in 2010 . In drama TV series Damages, Glenn Close's lawyer character Patty Hewes is known for her polished pantsuits, immaculate outfits and expensive tastes. Now, the 66-year-old actress is auctioning off 380 pieces from the wardrobe for charity. The looks come from labels that are fitting for a high-powered lawyer like Patty, including Giorgio Armani, Christian Louboutin, Prada and Balenciaga. Proceeds will go towards Bring Change 2 Mind, a charity Ms Close founded in order to raise awareness of mental illness. Her ruthless lawyer character certainly had a budget for designer looks such as these, but given that they are going under the hammer on eBay, fans may be able to snag them at a discounted price. Aside from her signature power suits, Patty's iconic Oliver Peoples sunglasses are also available on the eBay auction, and have so far attracted 31 bids. Some of the pieces, such as a grey Domenico Vacca jacket, have already fetched more than $2,000. A black Giorgio Armani shift dress has so far raked in $1,250, while the price of a silk ivory Armani blouse is starting at a more modest $5.50. In a video for the auction, the actress explains that in real life, she 'doesn't dress like a grown-up'. Her fictional character, however, had a 'formidable wardrobe' thanks to 'fantastic personal shopper' Frank Fleming, the costume designer for the series. Mr Fleming has said in the past that a typical Patty outfit costs around $5,000. He told Xfinity.com that he shopped at Bergdorf's, Barney's, Saks, Akris and Tom Ford for many of Patty's powerful lawyer looks. Expensive tastes: The clothes being auctioned off by Ms Close include looks from Giorgio Armani, Christian Louboutin, Prada and Balenciaga, to name a few . The nine-day auction will run until next Friday, July 19, in conjunction with the release of the fifth season of Damages on DVD.

"A woman has made history by becoming the first quadruple amputee to walk the runway at New York Fashion Week. Karen Crespo, 31, received a standing ovation  as she made her way down the catwalk for NYC-based designer Carrie Hammer's show on Friday morning at The Fashion Law Institute in Manhattan. 'I want people to know we can still be beautiful regardless of whether we're an amputee or in a wheelchair,' Ms Crespo, who lives in Los Angeles, said to ABC News. 'We can still rock the runway.' Scroll down for video . Lady in red! Karen Crespo, who lives in Los Angeles, became the first quadruple amputee to walk the runway at New York Fashion Week . Ms Crespo lost both her arms and legs after becoming infected with bacterial meningitis in 2011. During her sickness, she had two heart attacks, was in a coma for 15 days, and spent five months in the Intensive Care Unit. She had a long and difficult recovery - and has still not been able to return to her job as a registered nurse. Ms Crespo emailed Ms Hammer earlier this year, after seeing footage from her February runway show in which one of the models was in a wheelchair. 'I was so thrilled and moved that a designer welcomed someone with a disability on the runway,' she wrote. 'Beauty comes in all shapes and sizes and there is absolutely no right or wrong. 'I have a passion for fashion, so I hope one day I will get to show the world ""Why can't people with disabilities, people like me, be beautiful and model?"" Maybe one day if I ever get to go to New York I will be able to come meet you.' Ms Hammer, who prefers to use 'role models, not runway models' in her shows, immediately responded to Ms Crespo. Working it! Ms Crespo walked in designer Carrie Hammer's runway show . Forever friends! Ms Hammer (left) called Ms Crespo (right) an 'inspiration' and helped her get new prosthetic arms after her old ones were stolen . 'You are so gorgeous,' she said. 'Your email was so lovely, kind and positive. I'm ecstatic you reached out to me.' Two days later, the pair had a Skype phone call. Ms Hammer noticed she wasn't wearing her prosthetic arms and asked why. Ms Crespo's $100,000 prosthetic arms were stolen off her front porch when they arrived in the mail. Despite pleas she made on the local news, the thieves never returned her package. 'I was just sick when she told me this,' Ms Hammer said in a short, documentary-style video the two made together. The designer reached out to Hanger Orthopedic Group, one of the nation's leaders in prosthetic limbs, who agreed to make her new arms. Ms Hammer made a trip to Ms Crespo's home in Los Angeles days before the show to surprise her with the news. 'I told her, ""We have your dress fitting, but we have a more important fitting. It's for your arms,"" Hammer said. Getting fitted! Ms Hammer stands behind Ms Crespo as she tries on new prosthetic arms from Hanger Orthopedic Group . Always a beauty! Ms Crespo (pictured) before she got bacterial meningitis in 2011 . An inspiration! Dr Danielle Sheypuk (above) modeled in Ms Hammer's first show in February 2014. When Ms Crespo saw pictures of her from the show, she felt inspired and emailed Ms Hammer . Ms Crespo, who was able to wear her new arms in time for the show, donned a past-the-knees red dress, aptly called 'The Karen,' on the catwalk. At the end of the runway, as the crowd applauded, she winked at the photographers. 'I have a totally different perspective on things,' she told Today.com after her debut. 'Maybe this is why everything happened to me. Maybe I'm supposed to inspire or make a difference in someone else's life, someone who has a disability, or maybe just someone who had a lot of self-doubt. 'I never thought in a million years I would be at New York Fashion Week, even as a spectator,' she added. 'And now I'm going to be a fashion role model. It's such a big deal for me.' Thanks to her new arms, Ms Crespo hopes to be able to return to work soon. In addition to Ms Crespo, Ms Hammer's show also featured transgender model Geena Rocero, military veteran Phoebe Gavin, and race car driver Colette Davis.","Karen Crespo, 31, lost her arms and legs during a struggle with bacterial meningitis three years ago .

"Land's End customers have voiced their anger after receiving a copy of the latest GQ as a free gift with their catalog. The men's magazine, which features a topless Emily Ratajkowski on the cover, was distributed to select Land's End's subscribers as part of a deal the retailer had with publisher Conde Nast, according to the New York Times. Angry customers have taken to the brand's Facebook page, saying they were sent 'smut,' 'pornography,' and 'filth.' Probably not the best partnership! Land's End, a catalog that sells school uniforms and other conservative clothing, send its customers a free copy of GQ featuring a topless Emily Ratajkowski . 'My 14-year-old son brought in the mail today and was quite disturbed and fascinated by a ""gift"" Lands End sent us - a copy of GQ magazine with an absolutely OBSCENE cover!' said one recipient. 'While GQ may have been a reputable magazine at one time, today it seems to have sunken to the level of smut.' Another woman said: 'I have 8 wonderful and innocent little grandchildren for whom I purchase a lot of Land's End clothing, not to mention what I buy for myself. If one of them had seen that piece of trash in my mailbox, how would I explain the labels on their clothes?' One more mother echoed the sentiment: 'What part of me buying cute, age-appropriate kids clothing and a mom swimsuit made you think I wanted a subscription to GQ? My 12-year-old daughter brought in the mail and was quite horrified to see a magazine with a naked woman on the cover.' Outraged! Sue Skindell Bauman said 'words cannot express' how angry she is with the catalog . Angry! Molly Brown said she wouldn't have been able to explain the GQ to her eight 'wonderful and innocent' grandchildren . Furious! Sally Reed Woodson said her 12-year-old daughter was 'horrified to see a magazine with a naked woman on the cover' The company's CEO, Edgar Huber, issued an apology yesterday, saying he was 'truly sorry' and that there are 'simply no excuses' for the 'mistake.' 'When we entered into a year-long partnership with Conde Nast,' he said, 'our goal was to reward our valued customers with magazine subscriptions highlighting fashion and lifestyle topics. 'As a company, we are extremely apologetic that you have received this particular magazine on our behalf.' He said that all subscribers' names were removed from the GQ mailing list, and they would instead be receiving a subscription to Conde Nast Traveler. While some customers were impressed with the letter, others called it 'canned' or 'formulaic.' 'I think I was even more appalled at the excuse in the form of an apology,' said one customer. 'That they meant it as a gift to their male customers. That is absolutely disgusting and a major disrespect to your female customers.' Said another: 'Everything these days get diluted to ""mistakes."" How about a case of just plain ""poor judgment"" on the part of its execs!' Apology accepted? CEO Edgar Huber called the action 'a mistake' and there are 'no excuses' Not forgiven! Nancy Mandil said she was 'even more appalled at the excuse in the form of an apology' that Land's End sent customers . Watch what you say! Mary Lou Gallagher said Mr Huber should've called the company's error 'poor judgment' rather than a 'mistake' Not everyone was offended, however, and many people are defending the brand's actions, saying 'it's just breasts.' 'A topless woman isn't any more pornographic than a topless man,' said one woman on Facebook's public wall, 'Calling a topless woman pornographic is another form of body-shaming, and I'm thankful I grew up in a home where I was taught that a body is just a body.' 'A topless woman isn't any more pornographic than a topless man' A man also came to Land's End's defense: 'For some strange reason, partially exposed female breasts apparently seem to have a propensity to irreversibly damage young, innocent minds. Never mind the fact that these same young minds are exposed to blood, gore, war, religious extremism, bigotry, hatred, and violence with every click past a network news channel or daily newspaper cover.' Provocative! The Emily Ratajkowski images inside the magazine are just as provocative as the cover . It's not a big deal! Krissi Smyla says people are overreacting . Who cares? Make Sanford says children are exposed to things far worse than female breasts . Land's End was founded in 1963, and is based in Dodgeville, Wisconsin. Sears purchased the company in 2002 for $1.9 billion in cash, according to CNN.","The magazine features a topless picture of model Emily Ratajkowski on its cover .

"Trying to come up with a unique baby name? Consider looking at the least popular names in the United States for inspiration. The monikers at the bottom of the Social Security Administration's 2013 U.S. popularity list have been given to just five newborns in the entire nation - and they range from creative and appealing to downright crazy. 'Down there, among the wacky inventions or truly terrible kree8tiv spelling variations, are dozens of intriguing choices that you won’t encounter coming and going,' writes Pamela Redmond Satran in a Nameberry article. What should we call you? According to naming site Nameberry, people searching for unique monikers should look at the least popular names on the Social Security Administration's popularity list . There are less popular names (given to fewer than five babies), but the SSA doesn't list them due to privacy concerns. Some of our favorite unpopular names include Letitia, Hyacinth, Calixta, and Eulalie for girls, and Baird, Inigo, Chaplin, and Christo for boys. On the crazier side are Chardonnay, Fancy, Icy, and Trejure for girls, and Furious, Danger, Albino, and Messer for boys. 'Most of these rare names are “creative” spelling variations of popular names (Izebella and Jacub), inventions like Jayly or Axtin, or international names largely unknown in the US,' says Ms Satran. In 2013, the top boys' names were Noah, Liam, Jacob, Mason, and William. The most popular names for girls were Sophia, Emma, Olivia, Isabella, and Ava.","The names that qualified as least popular were given to just five newborns in 2013 .

"David Cameron was facing an English backlash at Westminster last night over the rush to hand Scotland sweeping new powers. The Prime Minister yesterday confirmed that Scotland would get ‘major new powers over tax, spending and welfare’ if it voted No to independence next week. Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg are also pledging a major transfer of powers in a last-ditch bid to persuade Scots to keep the UK together. But the move provoked alarm among English MPs, who last night warned it would be ‘untenable’ for Scotland to be handed new powers without major reform of its voting rights at Westminster and generous funding settlement. Scroll down for video . Tory MP John Redwood said England ‘needs a voice’ in any negotiation about the future balance of the Union . Former Tory Cabinet minister John Redwood said ministers now needed to answer the question: ‘Who speaks for England?’ Speaking in the Commons, Mr Redwood said England ‘needs a voice’ in any negotiation about the future balance of the Union. He later told the Daily Mail that devolved matters such as health, education and local government would have to be reserved for English MPs as part of any new settlement – and said this could even result in the creation of an English government. He said: ‘I understand why the party leaders are making these offers, but it opens up the whole English issue in a way they have not thought through. ‘This is a very big recasting of the relationship with Scotland and many people feel that what is good enough for Scotland should be good enough for England too. Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond campaigns for a Yes vote in east Edinburgh today . ‘You cannot insult England again by giving it nothing while handing Scotland all these new powers. We cannot go on having 59 Scottish MPs still voting on English education when neither they nor we can vote on Scottish education. ‘How can they be involved in setting income tax levels which their constituents will not pay? It is completely untenable.’ Fellow Tory Christopher Chope reminded MPs that Mr Cameron had refused to allow the so-called ‘devo max’ option he now appears to favour to be put on the referendum ballot paper. Mr Chope said the UK was ‘on the edge of a precipice’ and warned against trying to rush through a new constitutional deal without consulting English voters. ‘There are a lot of people in England who already feel the Scots get a pretty good deal,’ he said. ‘You can argue that that is fair enough – under a single currency the more peripheral areas usually get a better deal as part of the arrangements for ensuring a unified country. ‘But I don’t think the English public will take kindly to the idea that devo max is being given to Scotland funded by the rest of the UK as a consolation prize for voting No. It is not tenable to simply hand over more powers to Scotland without a wider debate. ‘Of course the English feel left out – it has never been discussed with them. That cannot go on.’ William Hague told MPs that support for devo max was not yet formal government policy, but it had ‘been the policy of the Government for some time to be open to further devolution’. He said there would be ‘immediate action’ the day after the referendum to start drawing up new powers for Scotland in the event of a No vote. Formal proposals will be published next month, with draft legislation due in January. He said all three parties were committed to bringing forward the new laws shortly after the general election. Major's plea: Don't turn friends and neighbours into foreigners . Scottish independence would be disastrous for the entire UK and turn friends and neighbours into foreigners, Sir John Major warned yesterday. In an impassioned plea to Scots, the former Prime Minister said breaking up the most successful union in history would leave both England and Scotland ‘immensely weaker’. Sir John said it was extraordinary that the potential consequences for the rest of the UK had barely been debated. He said the UK could lose its Trident nuclear deterrent, which is based in Scotland, and warned there would be major international repercussions, including the loss of the UK’s seat on the United Nations Security Council. ‘I am desperately concerned,’ he said. ‘We would be immensely weaker as a nation in every respect – morally, politically, in every material aspect – if Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom were to part company. ‘The UK would be weaker in every international body it attends. It would certainly be weaker in the EU and in the forthcoming negotiations. We would almost certainly find increased demands for Welsh independence. ‘Suddenly Scots who work next to us, live next to us, are our friends, our neighbours, our workmates – suddenly become foreigners. Is that not an extraordinary proposition for a nation that had marched together? ‘This year is the 100th anniversary of the First World War. As we honour those who fought together, then would it not be extraordinary if the SNP broke up the most successful union and partnership in all history in any part of the world?’ Sir John slammed the Scottish National Party for its ‘incompetence’ in pushing for independence without even being able to say what currency Scots would use. He said Scots could find themselves living in a ‘very different country’, despite assurances from Alex Salmond that key institutions such as the pound, the BBC and the Royal Family would remain unchanged.","MIliband and Clegg have promised more control to Scots if they vote No .
But some MPs have raised questions over fairness of proposed new powers ."
"It could have all been very different for Captain Munnerlyn. Born three months premature and weighing little more than three pounds, he spent the first three months of his life in an incubator. When he arrived home in the Happy Hill area of Mobile, Alabama, he was housed in a shoebox. At the age of four, his aunt protected him and took a bullet as a drive-by shooting raged outside their car. Two years later his father was murdered by one of his cousins following a row in a bar. Captain Munnerlyn (right) says the VIkings will learn from a chastening defeat in Green Bay . Munnerlyn in action against Green Bay . In 1995, two of his brothers were charged with murder. Gregory, then 15, avoided prison. But Timothy, four years his senior, remains in jail. He watched Munnerlyn’s last game from his cell. Sadly for both parties, the Minnesota Vikings were humbled 42-10 in Green Bay. ‘It was a bad game. He’s seen me play a couple of times, man. But it wasn’t my best game. It wasn’t our best game as a team. But hopefully he’ll get a chance to come home and see me play in real life,’ says Munnerlyn. Asked to consider his formative years, the diminutive cornerback reflected: ‘Football definitely was an escape for me. In order to play sports I had to get my grades. I had to stay out of trouble. And my mom was getting calls from the teacher about me being out and being disobedient. ‘So it was kind of like an escape for me to make me behave myself and it made me do the right thing and stay on the right path because I had a goal. And the goal was to be in the NFL. ‘Sometimes I think “man I can’t believe that I made it”. And I have to pinch myself. Man, am I really here. Is this still a dream?’ Munnerlyn was picked in the seventh round of the 2009 draft by the Panthers, but left Carolina in March in free agency, signing a three-year $14.25m deal with the Vikings. He admits to proving people wrong for some time. ‘Oh yeah. I used to always have to do that being a 5ft 9in guy. Saying I could never make the NFL. Don’t have the speed. Don’t have the ability. I just try to come back and work hard each and every day. That’s all I try to do is try to prove people wrong. People was wrong about me. They was wrong about Captain Munnerlyn. I can go out there. I can play in the NFL. I can be a starter. And I can be a difference-maker.’ While he says he is struggling to recapture his best form, he is not afraid to continue to put in the hard yards as the Vikings look to get their season back on track against the Detroit Lions. ‘We watch the game back and we learn from it. We definitely don’t dwell on it. Bad days can happen. We didn’t come out there. We move on. Watch tape, learn from it and move on to Detroit.’ ‘I’m trying to take one game at a time and pick up my play. Play better football - I’m trying to pick up my game and get the defense back on the right track,’ says the 26-year-old. Head coach Mike Zimmer threatened to ‘hurt some feelings’ following the capitulation across the border and while Munnerlyn does not divulge specifics, he does say: ‘He was mad. He was mad,’ ‘We came out and we got embarrassed, man. This week he’s been on us even harder. Trying to get us back to basic football. Trying to get us to execute. And go out there and play fast and play tough. ‘He’s got a lot of respect in the locker room, so we’re just trying to go out an play hard for him.’ With Calvin Johnson and Reggie Bush both set to miss the game, Munnerlyn knows the Lions remain a threat, despite Detroit losing 15 of their last 16 games in Minnesota. ‘They bring speed. They are physical. Those guys are great. They are special athletes. Guys like Golden Tate. He’s a good switch up guy for them. They have a very explosive offense and they like making big plays. That’s something we’ve been struggling with on our defense, giving up the big plays. We’ve just got to go out there and we’ve got to execute. We’ve got to have the right mind frame that we’re going to beat guys.’ And with Munnerlyn's lifelong habit of upsetting the odds, it would foolish to back against him.","Munnerlyn was born three months premature and has upset the odds all his life .

"FA chairman Greg Dyke believes English football must adopt similar approach to NFL's Rooney Rule in an attempt to address the lack of black coaches and managers. Of the 92 teams that make up the Premier League and Football League, just two sides employ black managers - Huddersfield's Chris Powell and Keith Curle at Carlisle. The Rooney Rule, used in the NFL since 2003, says that teams must interview at least one black or ethnic minority candidate when hiring a head coach. FA chairman Greg Dyke thinks English football should adopt the Rooney Rule . Huddersfield boss Chris Powell is one of only two black managers in England's top four leagues . Of the 32 teams in the NFL, four have black head coaches in charge - Mike Tomlin at the Pittsburgh Steelers, Lovie Smith at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Jim Caldwell at the Detroit Lions and Marvin Lewis at the Cincinnati Bengals.

'This is a great honor. I will be happy if it encourages young female scientists and mathematicians,' Mirzakhani told Stanford News. 'I am sure there will be many more women winning this kind of award in coming years.' The Fields Medal has been awarded to two, three or four mathematicians every four years since its founding in 1938. In order to qualify, scholars must be under 40 years old - a requirement many consider to be the reason no females have won until this point, since it's during peak child-rearing years. Ms Mirzakhani, who lives in Stanford, California, with her husband and three-year-old daughter, initially wanted to be a writer, according to Quanta Magazine. By high school, with the help of encouraging teachers, her ambitions shifted. In 1994 and 1995 (when she was 17 and 18), she received gold medals at the International Mathematics Olympiad as part of the Iranian team. The team had never had a female member before.

"When Indianapolis raced to a big lead over the Houston Texans in the first quarter, Colts coach Chuck Pagano was worried they'd let up. They did, but that early lead was so big that they were still able to hold on for a 33-28 victory Thursday night. 'You're going up and down on the sideline screaming at everybody: 'Don't take your foot off the gas,'' Pagano said. 'Next thing you know, just like that (it's close). It's never over in this league.'

Houston Texans' Andre Johnson fumbles as he is defended by Indianapolis Colts' Vontae Davis . The Colts (4-2) led 24-0 after one quarter, but allowed Houston (3-3) to cut it to 33-28 early in the fourth quarter on J.J. Watt's fumble return for a touchdown. 'You give a team a 24-point lead right out the gate, you're going to have a difficult time,' Watt said. The Texans had two opportunities to take the lead late, but the Colts recovered fumbles by Andre Johnson and Ryan Fitzpatrick in the last five minutes. 'You can finally start to see the type of defense that we envisioned a long time ago to go out there and do that week in and week out,' Pagano said. Luck finished with 370 yards passing and three touchdowns for his fourth straight 300-yard passing game and T.Y. Hilton had a career-high 223 yards receiving with a touchdown to give Indy first place in the AFC South. 'We realized with the recent history of Thursday night games, teams who are going on the road are struggling, and we didn't want to do that,' Luck said. 'We were lucky enough to get off on that fast start. It takes focus, and you almost have to trick yourself into it.' The Texans were driving with less than five minutes remaining when Johnson — called for pass interference two plays earlier — caught a 13-yard pass and fumbled. Watt knocked down Luck's pass on third down on Indy's next drive to give Houston one last chance. But Bjoern Werner sacked Fitzpatrick and stripped the ball and D'Qwell Jackson recovered.

Fitzpatrick threw for 212 yards and a touchdown and Arian Foster had 109 yards rushing with two scores for Houston. Indianapolis led by 12 when Luck fumbled and Watt recovered it and returned it 45 yards for a touchdown. It was Watt's third touchdown this season. He also has scored on an interception return and a reception. Foster had a 34-yard run before Johnson grabbed a 26-yard reception to get Houston down to the 2 in the third quarter. Foster ran wide before cutting back inside and into the end zone untouched on the next play to get the Texans to 27-21. The Texans were within six points in the third quarter when Luck, who was under heavy pressure, threw a 33-yard touchdown pass to Hilton. The 2-point conversion failed, leaving Indianapolis up 33-21.

They took advantage of the opportunity when Fitzpatrick found Johnson in the corner of the end zone and he managed to get both feet in bounds for a 4-yard touchdown two plays later to cut the lead to 24-7. It was the first touchdown of the season for Johnson. Houston got the ball back when Jared Crick tipped a pass by Luck that was intercepted by Justin Tuggle. The Texans got to 24-14 when Foster scored on a 12-yard run. The Colts added field goal to make it 27-14. Luck found Hilton on a 40-yard pass early in the first quarter, but Indy's offense stalled after that and the Colts settled for a field goal to make it 3-0.

"On the eve of his initial appearance in a Texas court, Adrian Peterson is expected to plead not guilty to child abuse charges in a bid to hurry his return to the NFL. The Minnesota Vikings running back is due to face charges of reckless or negligent injury to his four-year-old son. The charges relate to Peterson using a switch, or a tree branch, to discipline his child in May. With 10,190 rushing yards to his name, Adrian Peterson faces an uncertain future in the NFL . The 2012 MVP will appear in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County following his indictment by a grand jury. Peterson was detained briefly and released on bond in September. Peterson is due to appear in Montgomery County . Mary Flood, spokesperson to Peterson's attorney Rusty Hardin said: 'We expect him to plead not guilty if asked by the judge tomorrow.' The 29-year-old said he was not trying to injure the child and that his actions reflected the types of discipline he received growing up. Cases of this type are normally dealt with in nine to 12 months, so it appears likely that Peterson's 2014 season is over - unless Hardin can secure a quick trial date. It is unclear whether he will be asked to enter a plea. Peterson could be sentenced to up to two years in prison and fined $10,000 if convicted of the charge. A six-time Pro Bowl running back, Peterson played in the Vikings' season-opener against the St Louis Rams before being dropped for the defeat to the New England Patriots in week two. He was reinstated briefly, drawing widespread criticism and the loss of a major sponsor, the Radisson hotel group. The Vikings then put their star player on the NFL's exempt/commissioner's permission list. While he is still earning his $11.75million salary, he is barred from all team activities until his case is resolved. Peterson was face of the franchise and poses with owner Zygi Wilf at the home of the new Vikings stadium . The incident is one of several domestic violence or abuse cases that have marred the league's reputation. Details of the charges against Peterson came just days after the release of a video showing Ray Rice knocking out his future wife in an Atlantic City casino lift. Rice had been suspended two games for the incident involving his then-fiancee, but was released by the Baltimore Ravens and suspended indefinitely by the NFL after the video circulated.","Peterson is due to appear at Montgomery County, Texas, to answer charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child .

"If Ryan Tannehill is the future for the Miami Dolphins, he may look back on his short spell in England somewhat fondly. On the back of consecutive defeats, the third-year quarterback responded to the most difficult spell of his career with a superb perfomance at Wembley to steer Miami to a 38-14 win over Oakland. Tannehill threw for 278 yards, completed 14 consecutive passes and averaged 11 yards per throw in a halycon period in the second half. And all after head coach Joe Philbin declined to name him as starter. Ryan Tannehill soaks up the atmosphere at Wembley after leading the Dolphins to a crushing win . VIDEO Dolphins heading in right direction - Tannehill . 'I think Coach Philbin was clear with me on where I stood, and I felt confident coming in,' said Tannehill after his strong display of mental resolve. 'If people were writing or talking about me in a certain way, personally, I still wanted to come out and play well. I'm a realist. 'I envision myself as a good player, and I know I wasn't playing up to those standards the first three weeks. 'I wanted to come out and personally play better, and my teammates need that from me. They expect me to play better, and to be able to come out and to finally do that, it felt good.' The 25-year-old also admitted to being about the Dolphins' trip across the pond. 'I think I've been more excited for this week, this game. As the week went on and everything, all the distractions, to finally leave the country, have a long flight, and come over here and get ready for the game. I think I was more excited for this game than I've been for a game in a long time,' said Tannehill after moving the Dolphins to 2-2. Tannehill threw a 13-yard touchdown pass to Mike Wallace and an 18-yarder to Dion Sims at Wembley . Meanwhile, Philbin was full of praise for his signal caller, saying: 'I thought he played very well. I thought he had good rhythm. He had good tempo. He had good command. He was very decisive out there. I thought he threw the ball very accurately. I thought he made some plays with his feet, as well. I thought he made good decisions in the run game whether to give, whether to keep, whether to throw the bubble screens, etc. It looked like he played a very good football game. Central to the Dolphins improvement was a functioning offensive line. 'They did a great job, like I said, keeping me clean in the pocket and giving me time to throw the ball downfield, as well as the run game,' said Tannehill. 'I think we gave them some different looks, some challenging looks for them to line up to, spread them out laterally and then created space for Lamar and the backs to get vertical in the middle.' While Tannehill enjoyed his European adventure, it was a different story for the Raiders' rookie quarterback Derek Carr. The 23-year-old was 16 for 25 with 146 yards, when he was hurt in the third quarter. Third-stringer Matt McGloin replaced him with Matt Schaub remaining in Oakland for a personal matter. 'I know the X-rays on his ankle were negative, but that's the extent of what I know,' said coach Dennis Allen.","Tannehill bounced back from the toughest week of his life to lead the 38-14 rout .

"Payton Manning closes in on Brett Favre after throwing his 500th touchdown pass during the Broncos' rout of the Cardinals . The best part of Peyton Manning's big day was getting to share the spotlight with some of his best friends. Manning joined Brett Favre in the NFL's most exclusive of clubs with his 500th touchdown toss on Sunday when the Denver Broncos handed the Arizona Cardinals their first loss, 41-20. The Broncos star has now thrown 503 touchdown passes, five short of Brett Favre's record of 508 . 'Football is the ultimate team game, and so I guess one man has to accept it and I really accept it on behalf of a lot of coaches and teammates,' Manning said. Manning threw for 479 yards and four TDs, moving him within five of Favre's record 508. After getting his milestone touchdown — a 7-yard dart to tight end Julius Thomas — out of the way early, Manning helped Demaryius Thomas and Wes Welker make history, too. Demaryius Thomas set a franchise record with 226 yards on eight catches, beating Shannon Sharpe's mark of 214 yards set against Kansas City in 2002. Welker's seven receptions moved him past Rod Smith for the most catches in NFL history by an undrafted player. He has 854, five more than Smith caught for Denver between 1995-2006. 'I still can't believe he was undrafted because that man can play some ball,' Demaryius Thomas said. Welker's record-breaker came on the last play on the first half, something Manning called 'kind of a ha-ha moment for scouting, for not drafting him. So, whoever was a general manager in 2004, those guys ought to send him an apology letter.' Demaryius Thomas caught touchdown passes of 31 and 86 yards, and his 77-yard TD was nullified on a chop block by Julius Thomas that sent defensive end Calais Campbell from the game with a right knee injury. Left tackle Ryan Clady was engaged with Campbell and was whistled for the flag. But it was the Pro Bowl tight end who crashed low into Campbell and drew the wrath of Arizona coach Bruce Arians. 'I've been coaching for 37 years, it's the dirtiest play I've seen,' Arians fumed. 'It was a flat chop block and put him out of the game. I know John Fox, great coach and great guy. Somebody has got to answer to that. A fine isn't going to do it, when he's going to miss three or four weeks, on a blatant chop block.' Campbell's strained MCL added to a miserable afternoon in which the Cardinals (3-1) surrendered 568 yards, the most they've allowed since 1973, and saw fill-in quarterback Drew Stanton leave with a concussion. The Broncos' offensive output was their best in franchise history. They had 567 yards against Atlanta in 2004. Manning's 500th TD throw came in his 244th career regular season game, 49 fewer games than it took Favre. It came against two of his mentors: Arians, who was his first QB coach in 1998, and Cardinals assistant head coach Tom Moore, who was his offensive coordinator during his 13 seasons in Indy. Patriots 43-17 Bengals . Tom Brady and the Patriots routed the Bengals and quieted the doubters. The three-time Super Bowl winner finally looked like a quarterback who has thrown for 50,000 yards in his career as New England dominated the NFL's last unbeaten team, beating Cincinnati 43-17 Sunday night. Just six days earlier, the Patriots lost to the Kansas City Chiefs 41-14, unleashing criticism that Brady had regressed and lacked talented teammates to help him. ""It's hard to be oblivious to things. We all have TVs or the internet or the questions I get and the emails that I get from people that are concerned,"" Brady said after throwing for two touchdowns and no interceptions. ""Nobody died or anything. It's just a loss and I think we've always done a great job putting losses behind us quickly."" Brady did it in 2003 when the Patriots lost the opener to Buffalo 31-0, then beat Philadelphia in the next game 31-10 and went on to their second Super Bowl win in three years. Sunday's win had special significance for Brady, as he became the sixth quarterback to pass the 50,000-yard mark. ""It's awesome,"" he said. Brady threw for a 292 yards after not passing for more than 249 in his first four games, and Stevan Ridley had 113 of the team's 220 yards rushing against a team that had allowed an NFL-low 11 points per game. The Patriots (3-2) surpassed that by scoring on their first two possessions on Ridley's 1-yard run and Brady's 17-yard pass to Tim Wright. They led 20-3 at halftime before the Bengals (3-1) cut it to 10 points on Andy Dalton's 37-yard pass to Mohamed Sanu. Bills 17-14 Lions . Bills kicker Dan Carpenter responded to an alleged laser pointer shining from the stands in Detroit with laser-point accuracy. After banking a 50-yard attempt off the left upright in the third quarter, Carpenter split the goal posts from 58 yards with 4 seconds left for a 17-14 come-from-behind victory over the Lions on Sunday. ""I hit it really good. It was one of those things I really like to not leave opportunities like that short,"" said Carpenter. ""I hit the ball really well, a lot better than I did on the 50-yarder."" And this time, there wasn't a laser shining in holder Colton Schmidt's face, as apparently happened on the earlier miss. The Bills filed a complaint with NFL security officials after both Schmidt and quarterback Kyle Orton said that someone in the stands was shining a laser pointer at them. Without going into detail, coach Doug Marrone said the issue was resolved before the game ended. In fact, Marrone said, the laser was less of a distraction than it was a motivator. ""We felt that Dan could do it,"" Marrone said. ""At that point, with the adrenaline and everything, he was fired up."" NFL spokesman Michael Signora said the league was waiting for its security representative in Detroit to file a game report. The Lions said in a statement that they were aware of the reports and contacted NFL security regarding the issue. The Bills (3-2) snapped a two-game skid in Orton's debut as Buffalo's starter after EJ Manuel was benched this week. And their defense had six sacks in delivering coordinator Jim Schwartz a win in his return to Detroit after being fired as Lions head coach last season. The Lions were undone by placekicking. Alex Henery missed all three field goals attempts, including a 50-yarder that sailed wide left with 21 seconds remaining. Coach Jim Caldwell was already hinting of being ready to make another switch at kicker two weeks after Henery was signed to replace rookie Nate Freese. ""It's a performance-based league, plain and simple, and you have to perform,"" Caldwell said. ""Anyone that doesn't, we take a look and see if we can improve that one way or another."" The Lions (3-2) squandered a 14-0 lead, dropped to 2-1 at home and also lost several key regulars to injury. Receiver Calvin Johnson did not return after aggravating a right ankle injury in the first minute of the third quarter. Starting running back Reggie Bush didn't finish the game after also hurting his ankle.","Manning threw his 500th touchdown pass during the Broncos' rout of the Cardinals .

"Noah Ritter may be just five years old, but it would seem he already has celebrity potential. A live television interview with the Pottstown, Pennsylvania, youngster has become a YouTube hit, garnering over 82,000 views. Noah was stopped by a WNEP TV crew on Friday, the opening day of the Wayne County Fair in nearby Honesdale. But while reporter Sofia Ojeda was seeking a verdict on the ride he had just been on with his grandfather, Noah had his own agenda. Exhibiting a fondness for the word 'apparently', he said: 'It was great and apparently I’ve never . been on live television but apparently sometimes I don’t watch the news . because I’m a kid and apparently every time Grandpa just gives me the . remote I have to watch the Powerball.' The red-haired preschooler was clearly excited to share his views, confidently holding the microphone and speaking in a somewhat newscaster-y voice. Still attempting to get her soundbite, Ms Ojeda asked again how Noah had enjoyed his ride, only to get more of his adorable perspective on life. Moment in the spotlight: Noah confidently held the microphone and spoke in a somewhat newscaster-y voice . Perk of the job: The clearly amused reporter, Sofia Ojeda, is just seen crouching down to speak at Noah's level, while a little girl tries to get her fifteen seconds of fame too . 'Well, it was great because apparently . you’re spinning around and apparently every time you get dizzy, that’s . all you do is get dizzy,' he said. 'I’ve never ever been . on live television. I've never been on live television.' The amused reporter, who is just seen crouching down to speak at his level asks: 'Are you excited?' To which Noah replies: 'Yeah, and apparently I only went down the super slide. . . I was scared half to death. I just freak out.' Noah used the word 'apparently' no less than eight times during the one-and-a-half-minute interview, and repeated that he had never been on live television three times. 'I'm a celebrity!': Noah's grandfather, Jack Borowski, says the youngster is enjoying his newfound fame . Star-in-the-making: Noah Ritter poses with his bicycle outside his home in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania . Apparently, he's now famous: Noah's performance has been watched over 82,000 times on YouTube . Noah's grandfather, Jack Borowski, who had accompanied him to the fair, told ABC News: 'Noah is pretty talkative. He has a large vocabulary.' He added that the youngster appears to be enjoying his newfound fame. 'We were watching it on the computer and . it replayed on the local news,' Mr Borowski said. 'He’s going, ""That’s . me. I’m a celebrity.""' But for Noah, who is spending the summer with his grandfather, TV fame comes a lowly third place in his list of favorite things. Mr Borowski says his first loves are dinosaurs and swimming. 'We go down to the history museum in Philadelphia about once a month because he loves the dinosaurs,' he said. 'And we go for swim lessons every Saturday morning because he loves to swim.'","Noah Ritter exhibits a fondness for the word 'apparently', which he uses eight times during the one-and-a-half-minute interview .

"Most women are still in recovery mode three months after the birth of a child. But mother-of-four Natalia Vodianova - who welcomed baby Maxim on May 2nd - is not most women. The Russian supermodel, 32, stripped down to nothing but a fur stole for the September cover of Vanity Fair. And in a candid accompanying interview, she speaks about her divorce from British aristocrat Justin Portman and her new life in Paris with LVMH heir Antoine Arnault. Cover girl: Supermodel mother-of-four Natalia Vodianova fronts the September issue of Vanity Fair . She said of her 2010 marriage breakdown: 'If you try really hard at something and it doesn’t work, then you have to let go because it means it is not the right thing. You . have to try really hard to make it work, but at the same time you have . to know how to let go of something when it is time.' Ms Vodianova and Viscount Portman, 45, had three children in their nine years together: Son Lucas, now nine, daughter Neva, eight and Viktor, six, who now live with their mother in Paris and spend half their holidays with their father. The model confirmed she was dating Mr Arnault, the son of LVMH founder Bernard Arnault, in August 2011 and announced they were expecting a child together in November last year. And it seems parenthood has only strengthened their relationship. Ms Vodianova said of Mr Arnault: 'He . gets up at 8am and goes to work with a big smile on his face. He . loves what he does, loves my children so much, is a great father and . stepfather and boyfriend.' New love: Ms Vodianova with Justin Portman in June 2009 (left) and at six months' pregnant with Antoine Arnault in February 2014 (right) Yummy mummy: Ms Vodianova sitting front row at the Stella McCartney fashion show in Paris in March 2011 with her children Lucas (left), Viktor (middle) and Neva (right) On a potential wedding in the future, she added: 'I guess he is still a boyfriend. I want to . call him my husband because it feels right, whether we have the papers . or not. He feels like a husband already, although it doesn’t make a . difference, does it? I feel blessed. He is everything I love and . respect.' The accompanying photo spread in Vanity Fair sees Ms Vodianova pose in decadent eveningwear for celebrated photographer Mario Testino. And while the rest of us may not be blessed with her supermodel looks, she makes posing for the camera sound easy. 'It’s really a matter of very little details,' she explains. 'Little angles, little tilts of the head. Eyebrows up to make the eyes look bigger. Mouth a little open. Shoulders down for a long neck. It’s a lot like sculpting.' The September issue of Vanity Fair will be available in New York and Los Angeles, as well as on the iPhone, iPad, Kindle, and other devices, on August 7.

"Her hands are so tiny her fingers barely span more than a few keys at a time. She uses a booster seat to get level with the keyboard and it takes all her concentration to play without looking. But even before she is three years old, Lavinia Ramirez has astounded experts – with her first public performance on piano. Scroll down to watch Lavinia playing the piano . Pint-sized pianist: Lavinia Ramirez had only been learning to . master the keys for six weeks when she stepped out to perform Mary Had a Little Lamb in front . of a 200-strong audience aged just two-years-old . True, it might have been only a note-perfect rendition of Mary Had a Little Lamb at her music school's end of term concert. But yesterday she was being hailed as a mini maestro in the making – and Britain's youngest piano playing star. Her teacher Matej Lehocky said her talent was 'remarkable' for someone so young, describing her ability as 'outstanding'. 'To play at her age is something extraordinary, something very special,' he said. 'Usually children that young are not able to control themselves or do what they are told. Normally they just run down the keys and get bored.' Lavinia, who celebrates her third birthday today, had been learning to play for only six weeks before she stepped out to perform before a 200-strong audience at a local church hall on the outskirts of Plymouth. By that stage she had been to only eight lessons. Mr Lehocky, who studied at the prestigious Prague Conservatory of Music and learned to play when he was four, agreed to tutor her after realising she was exceptionally bright and clearly interested to learn. She loves listening to classical music and occasionally asks him to play for her. Bizet's Carmen is her current favourite.' She is so mature for her age that you . forget you've got a two-year-old sitting there with you,' he said. 'It's . as if she is five or six. She's really only a baby though, so of course . there are times when she gets distracted. But what she has is something . exceptional. Her hand-eye co-ordination is remarkable. Prodigy: Lavinia's teacher Matej Lehocky (pictured practicing with her) said it was remarkable that someone of her age could play so well and said she was the best piano playing child in the UK . 'She can play Old MacDonald had a Farm using both hands at once. I think in about eight months' time she will be able to sit a Grade One exam. I can't recall anyone doing that at the age of three.' Lavinia was nicknamed Little Miss Mozart after performing at the concert (although Mozart is thought  to have been nearly four when  he first started to play a clavichord keyboard). Neither of her parents plays an instrument but she became interested in music after getting a toy piano for Christmas. Her mother Jenna Ramirez, who also has nine-month-old daughter Florelle, said: 'I don't know where Lavinia gets her brains from – she's more intelligent than me. Before she was two she could write numbers and letters and recognise them in books. She told me what a trapezium was the other day; I didn't know. She seemed to be on the toy piano all the time so we asked her if she wanted to learn, and she said she would.' Mrs Ramirez and her husband Ian, both managers at a Tesco supermarket near their home in Ivybridge, Devon, bought her an upright piano when they realised she had such a thirst to learn. Talent: Lavinia was among 21 students playing at the concert, in Derriford Church Hall in Plymouth, Devon . Mrs Ramirez told me yesterday: 'She plays that at home, using a booster seat on a dining room chair instead of a piano stool. Sometimes she'll play on and off all day, sometimes she goes a week without playing. We let her decide. As for the future, we won't push her. We just want to allow her skill to develop naturally.' Playing at the age of three is  not unique but is extremely rare –  as is Lavinia's progress and confidence. Shown video footage of Lavinia playing, John Holmes, chief examiner of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, said she showed 'exciting potential with her piano playing skills and has clearly made excellent progress in her first two months'. Nicholas Keyworth, chief examiner in music at Trinity College London, said: 'The most important thing is that she is discovering the joy of playing music and learning so many skills which are helping in her personal development. This is a lovely story and one which will encourage learners of any age.'","Lavinia Ramirez played a perfect rendition of Mary Had A Little Lamb at her school's end of term concert .

"A leather coat belonging to Adolf Hitler's architect was bought for more than $10,000 - by the man's Jewish cousin. The coat, belonging to Albert Speer,  was sold at an auction in Los Angeles last week alongside autographed copies of Hitler's hate-filled autobiography Mein Kampf. It was bought by Jason . Speer, a successful businessman who lives near Chicago who was also Albert Speer's third cousin, he said he was 'proud' to keep the jacket in the family. A label inside the coat depicts the NSDAP eagle emblem denoting the Nazi elite. Also included is the original invoice for the coat with Speer's name printed on it . Albert Speer (left) with Adolf Hitler (right) in 1943 . Speer (right with Hitler center) was well known for his leather coat. The coat came with a note from a U.S. serviceman explaining how he found it . Speer was the Fuhrer’s chief architect and Minister of Armaments and War Production who escaped the death penalty at Nuremberg by acknowledging Nazi war crimes while denying any part in them. Instead he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. 'I was amazed that Albert Speer admitted . his guilt, served time, and repented for what he did,' said Mr Speer. 'I want him to . be remembered for his amazing architecture and for what his role was in . Germany during World War II. This item is of great significance, and I . am proud to keep it in the Speer family.' Speer wore the coat when he visited Hitler (pictured) for the last time on April 23, 1945 . Jason, the son of a Jewish mother and a Christian father, said he was 'thrilled' to get the jacket adding: 'This is a fantastic piece of history. I am a great admirer of Albert Speer’s architecture, especially the Volkshalle - People’s Hall - in Berlin.' He learned of his link to the prominent Nazi when his grandfather traced his lineage back to Albert Speer when he was stationed with the U.S. Army in Germany. Speer wore the coat when he visited Hitler for the last time on April 23, 1945. Sewn inside the overcoat are labels bearing Speer’s name, the brand name of W. Fliegner and the initials of the Reichszeugmeisterei, the German regulatory office for quality control in manufacturing. The label depicts the NSDAP eagle emblem denoting the Nazi elite. Included is the original invoice for the coat with Speer's name printed on it, found stored in the coat’s pocket. Hitler killed himself in the Berlin bunker along with his new bride Eva Braun on April 30 1945. Speer ignored the orders given to him by Hitler at their last meeting to destroy all German infrastructure and industry to prevent them being used by the Russians and the Allies. After the war, the coat was seized by an Allied soldier named 'Ralph,' who wrote a letter to his mother about his adventures. Dated May 6, 1945, the letter mentions that he 'looked around today in a huge chalet of a high-ranking Nazi. 'For you, I have a gold necklace. 'And for Dad, I have a great leather jacket...I took a coat with no Nazi symbols on the outside...Unfortunately, the name of Nazi Albert Speer is stamped in the jacket...'' Two rare copies of Mein Kampf signed by Adolf Hitler were also auctioned last week in Los Angeles .

"Germany is spending just £3.5million on events to mark the start of the First World War – compared with the joint £50million Britain and France have pledged. Berlin insists history is not ‘being neglected’ and that events are planned across the country to mark the 100th anniversary of the war. However, many Germans are ashamed of their country’s role in the conflict. Divide: Britain and France combined are spending more than 10 times more than Germany on commemorating the outbreak of the First World War. Angela Merkel (left) has not confirmed any attendances . Commemoration: One of the events is an exhibition at the German Historical Museum in Berlin, pictured . Chancellor Angela Merkel has still not committed to attending any of the commemorations at home or abroad. The German Historical Museum in Berlin is planning an exhibition, while France and Germany are co-operating on a new museum in Alsace-Lorraine, where thousands of soldiers from both nations died. The German government revealed the figure following a question in parliament from an MP from the far-left party Die Linke, Sevim Dagdelen. Modern message: Chancellor Merkel wants to use the anniversary to promote European unity . She called for a ‘massive increase’ in funds, adding: ‘It is a scandal that the government is marking the commemoration of the beginning of the First World War with – mostly – inaction.’ German historian Gerd Krumeich, who is advising the French government on the centenary, said the German government is ‘fundamentally uninterested’ in it. Holfer Afflerbach, a German professor of history at Leeds University, said: ‘Both the UK and France have set aside vast funds for the commemoration and in good time, while Germany decided that their efforts would be reactive – so no wonder many feel that attitude is a bit stupid.’ The war destroyed three European empires, cost 10 million lives, wounded 20 million and paved the way in Germany for the rise of the Nazis and WW2. Germany wants to be seen using the centenary of the outbreak of war as a means to promote its agenda for today of closer European unity. The French-German museum at the site of the Hartmannsweilerkopf battlefield in French Alsace, where up to 30,000 Germans and Frenchmen died on what the troops called the 'Mountain of Death.', is one of the main projects. French President François hollande and the German Federal President, Joachim Gauck, will lay a foundation stone for a new museum chronicling the fighting there at the start of August. The message is simple; European unity, not emnity. There are exhibitions planned in Berlin, at the Army Museum in Dresden and several other sites.  Numerous websites are devoted to understanding the war and the fragile peace that followed. 'Our look is at reconciliation, to have as many former enemies together as possible and to show that we have learned from our mistakes,' said Norman Walter, a spokesman for the German Embassy in London.","Germany insists history is not being neglected, but many ashamed of past .

"Germany has swooped on three elderly former guards who served at the Nazi death camp Auschwitz in WW2 where 1.1 million Jews were exterminated. The arrests follow months of investigations by the country's central war crimes investigation unit which has zeroed in on some two dozen still surviving guards - several of them women. Those seized this week are all men aged 88, 92 and 94 and living in the southwestern state of Baden-Wurttemberg. The German office investigating Nazi war crimes last year identified 30 former Auschwitz (pictured) personnel with a recommendation to bring charges against them . The three elderly former guards who served at the Nazi death camp Auschwitz in WW2 where 1.1 million Jews were exterminated . The arrests follow months of investigations by the country's central war crimes investigation unit which has zeroed in on some two dozen surviving Auschwitz guards . 'They are suspected of having participated in murders at the Nazis' Auschwitz extermination camp in occupied Poland,' said prosecutors in a statement. The 94-year-old is understood to be Hans Koenig, who lives near Stuttgart. Koenig, an ethnic German from Bratislava, became known as a 'bruiser' in Auschwitz due to his alleged love of cruelty for its own sake. He is proud of his past. He told the Bild newspaper in Germany last year: 'At the time the German ethnic group I belonged to had to be tested and I was happy to be a part of that.' The three elderly men underwent medical tests and then faced a judge who confirmed their fitness to be detained in a prison hospital. There were three other raides in the states of Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia - again of suspected war criminals - but no further arrests. 'Various records and documents from the Nazi era were seized, and their evaluation is ongoing,' said the statement about the Baden-Wurttemberg home raids. The German office investigating Nazi war crimes last year sent files on 30 former Auschwitz personnel to state prosecutors with a recommendation to bring charges against them. The renewed drive to bring to justice the last surviving perpetrators of the Holocaust follows a 2011 landmark court ruling which established that all former camp guards can be tried irrespective of whether any eyewitnesses were left alive to testify. The renewed drive to bring to justice the last surviving perpetrators of the Holocaust follows a 2011 landmark court ruling which established that all former camp guards can be tried irrespective of whether any eyewitnesses were left alive to testify . The three former Auschwitz guards seized this week are all men aged 88, 92 and 94 and living in the southwestern state of Baden-Wurttemberg . Three women among the suspects are expected to be charged later this year, according to prosecution sources. Ever since Sobibor death camp guard John Demjanjuk was found guilty for his part in the mass murder of 28,000 Jews in 2011, the gloves have come off for German prosecutors. Before Demjanjuk it was vital to have every small detail of what they did backed up with witness statements.  After Demjanjuk it is enough to merely prove that suspects were there and helping the machinery of death to function. Gertrud Elli Schmid, now 92, is one of the female suspects still awaiting arrest.  In wartime she was sent to the camp of Majdanek on the outskirts of Lublin. The camp, with its gas chamber and vast crematorium for disposing of the corpses of inmates, is still standing in memorial to the 230,000 people murdered there. Perhaps the most notorious of all the Nazi concentration camps, 1.1million Jews were killed at Auschwitz. The camp consisted of three main parts: Auschwitz I (the base camp) Auschwitz II - Birkenau (the extermination camp) and Auschwitz III - Monowitz (the labour camp). During the war the camp was staffed by 6,500 to 7,000 members of the infamous SS - 15 per cent of whom were later convicted of war crimes. It was run by camp commandant Rudolf Höss who was tried and hanged in 1947 for his part in the extermination. The camp was liberated by the Red Army on January 27 1945, the day was subsequently declared International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Following its liberation the camp has become a symbol of the holocaust and has operated as a museum since 1947 . Germany's Nazi-hunting agency, based in the southern city of Ludwigsburg, was tipped off by the sleuths of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Israel about her past when an informant turned up her old S.S. ID card in the archive of the former Stasi secret police of East Germany in Berlin. The card, bearing the number 312, has been authenticated.  It carries the inscription: 'The holder is authorised to bear arms' - meaning she was a pay-grade above ordinary guards usually only permitted to carry a 'schlagstock' - a 'beating stick.' After service in Majdanek she was sent to Auschwitz where she was based at Birkenau - the complex where the gas chambers were situated. Before the camp fell to the Russians in January 1945 she was shipped back to Germany and escaped justice at the end of the war. But officials at the Ludwigsburg . authority have, it is understood, testimony from several prisoners now . dead that she was a 'cruel' and 'merciless' guard who beat prisoners . with rawhide whips and who was present at the infamous railway ramp . where daily 'selections' were made about who should live and who was to . be gassed immediately. Now . wheelchair bound her daughter doesn't deny her past but is hoping her . lack of memory about the time will keep her from prosecution. 'We . know that my mother had something to do with Auschwitz.  We have tried . to talk with her about it but her memory doesn't really function any . more,' she said. Female . suspect number two is Gisela Schneider, 90, who now lives in an OAP . home in northern Germany, was also in Hitler's girl's organisation and . joined the S.S. in 1940. The Federal Archive in Berlin threw up her S.S. identity card.  It shows a cold, hard-faced woman who worked in the feared S.S. under her maiden name of Demming. At Asuchwitz she was a harsh disciplinarian who beat prisoners and who was often in charge of the standing cells - small, dark rooms where up to 15 people at a time were crammed in for minor rule infractions. It was not uncommon to leave people in these rooms for days on end, causing the death of some or all of those confined. She formed a romantic relationship with S.S. Dr.Franz Bernhard Lucas but dropped him when he railed against the hideous experiments on prisoners carried out by notorious 'Angel of Death' Dr Josef Mengele on inmates. She was a true believe in the Nazi racial policies that decreed Jews, gypsies and Slavs were 'lesser races' who deserved nothing else. Female number three is identified only as  Charlotte S. who served under her maiden name beginning with A at the Ravensbrueck concentration camp for women near Berlin. A fanatical Nazi, she was a dog handler who walked around the camp with an Alsatian that was trained to bite at the privates of inmates. Female number three is identified only as  Charlotte S. who served under her maiden name beginning with A at the Ravensbrueck concentration camp for women near Berlin (pictured) Two statues look towards the incinerator building at Ravensbrueck, located around 60 miles from Berlin . In 1942 she was transferred to Auschwitz where she and her dog were rightly feared by the prisoners kept as slaves for the numerous war industry factories which dotted the countryside around the camp. One female prisoner after the war testified: 'There was a woman there with a kindly smile that masked a hideous nature.  She was ramrod straight and had a snarling dog that was indoctrinated to hate the prisoners. 'We would be forced to stand stock still for hours and if anyone moved in the cold or the heat, the dog was unleashed.  Many people did not survive the maulings.' She began an affair with an S.S. man while serving at the camp and was discharged from the service in 1943 when she fell pregnant. After the war she was sentenced to 15 months in jail for 'mistreatment of and thefts from prisoners in her charge.' Now 94, she refuses to speak about her terrible past.   .","The men, aged 88, 92 and 94, were all arrested in Baden-Wurttemberg .

"Stricken Formula One champion Michael . Schumacher has developed pneumonia as doctors try to bring him out of . the artificial coma that he has been in since December 29, German media reported today. Germany's . biggest newspaper, Bild, said that Schumacher, 45, developed the lung . infection last week at the University Hospital in Grenoble. His . spokeswoman Sabine Kehm refused to comment on the report, saying only it . was 'speculation, and I do not comment on speculation.' But . Bild, which is known to have close contacts to the inner circle of the . seven-time world Formula One champion, said he is being treated with . strong antibiotics as his doctors try to ascertain just how dangerous . the infection is. Scroll down for video . Devoted: Michael Schumacher has been at University Hospital in Grenoble since December. Above, Schumacher is pictured with his wife Corinna in Italy . Schumacher, the seven-times Formula 1 champion, is being kept under constant scrutiny to detect any movement at all . Pneumonia is among the greatest life . threatening conditions that can afflict people in Schumacher's position. The lack of a competent swallowing mechanism can make saliva run into . the lungs and trigger the potentially lethal respiratory infection. Andreas . Pingel, medical director of the Centre for Spine Surgery and . Neuro-Traumatology at the BG Hospital in Frankfurt told Germany's Focus . Magazine only last week; 'About 30 to 50 per cent of all patients who lie . in a coma as long as Michael Schumacher has, get it.' Bild . said it was not known if the 'recovery phase' - the slow decrease in . anaesthetic that has kept Schumacher comatose since his low-speed ski-accident on December 29 in a bid to bring him around - has been . interrupted as a result of the infection. Professor . Heinzpeter Moecke, Director of the Institute for Emergency Medicine at . the Asklepios Clinic in Hamburg told Bild: 'Pneumonia is generally a . serious and dangerous disease because the body is supplied with less . oxygen and is overall very weakened.' In . someone like Schumacher, who has now been comatose for 46 days since . being airlifted from the ski slopes of the French resort of Meribel . after smashing his head on to a rock, his immune system is seriously . weakened and the fear is of multiple organ failure and, ultimately, . death. Professor Moecke went . on: 'One reason may be that the patient can not cough up secretions, . which form in the neck and throat, because of a tube in the windpipe . through which he breathes. A healthy person clears his throat or . swallowing several times per minute, usually without realizing it. That . protects the lungs.' Treatment: Schumacher is currently being kept under anaesthetic at the University Hospital (above) in France . Either an X-ray or clinical signs - such as high fever - led to the discovery of the infection. His lung secretions were analysed to determine the best kind of antibiotics to prescribe to fight it. Professor Moecke added: 'Often the drug is administered over a seven to ten day period.  If it works, there is a significant improvement after three or four days and the patient is out of danger. But there are also bacteria that are resistant to many antibiotics, that extends the period of danger.' He said the comatose racing hero would feel no pain or shortness of breath because of his coma and the drugs he will be receiving. So far, there have been no facial or bodily responses to his environment, according to medical sources, as his reflexes are tested on a daily basis. He receives food through a tube to his stomach, oxygen via a hose from a machine next to his bed as he still cannot breathe independently. Three times daily his joints and muscles are massaged to prevent atrophy and bed sores. The coma suppressed his swallowing reflex, pain perception and his respiratory drive. He has to be acutely monitored around the clock during this wake-up phase to see if such things are returning naturally - if at all. His blood is also thinned to prevent thrombosis and he is regularly turned and even stood straight up at times to keep blood flowing.

"He's one of the most reviled tyrants in world history, whose perverse doctrines and atrocities revealed some of human nature's ugliest aspects. So it's fair to say Adolf Hitler is no one's idea of a brand ambassador. But in this bizarre prototype advert, the Nazi leader makes a 'blink and you'll miss it' appearance that leaves a lasting impression. Scroll down for video . Setting the scene: At the start of the advert, viewers are unaware the action takes place in Hitler's hometown, or who the boy flying the kite really is . Stopping short: The clip shows Mercedes smart breaking technology off as the car reacts quickly to a pair of schoolgirls who run into the road . Not just any boy: The film changes tone when the young Hitler chases his kite into the road and the Mercedes smart car takes a very different approach to his safety . The campaign is created around the slogan 'Mercedes: Detects dangers before they happen'. Instead of just alerting the driver when an unseen obstacle appears, the smart car is shown to preempt the damage a young Adolf Hitler will do in the future. Film students  Tobias Haase, Jan Mettler and Lydia Lohse from South Germany put the advert together to play on the Mercedes theme and apply the idea of a car's smart technology to human scenarios. Tobias Haase said: 'Mercedes sells its . cars on smart technology that prevents accidents from happening. 'We . wanted to pose the question of what might happen if technology had a . soul.' The one minute video is set in a sleepy hamlet where men are digging potatoes in a misty field and children play on rural roads. A sleek Mercedes rolls into the village and uses it's technologically advanced brakes to stop short of a pair of young girls who hopscotch across its path. Sleek: The film students wanted the commercial to ask 'what might happen if technology had a soul?' Infamous: When the camera pulls out, the names of the village is revealed. Braunau-am-Inn is the Austrian town where Adolf Hitler was born . In the next scene a young boy flying a kite runs into the road and is struck by the car, which does not brake or swerve. The boy's mother, who is hanging laundry, screams 'Adolf' and the face of Adolf Hitler is flashed onto the screen. The young boy is left sprawled on the ground, his limbs forming the outline of a swastika and the name of the village Braunau-am-Inn- Hitler's birthplace- is revealed. Germany's Spiegel Magazine praised the inventive short film for pushing the boundaries of what a viewer expects from advertising. Symbolic: After the film's credits run an image of the boy sprawled on the ground in the shape of a swastika hammers home the film's message . Controversial: the film students had to distance themselves from the brand, who are said to be displease by the spoof advert. They built the footage around Mercedes' message 'Detects dangers before they come up' They said: . 'What would the world think if machines have a soul? Where could it . lead, if technology makes decisions about life and death? 'May a powerful six-cylinder car . change the history of the world?  This is a funny video with lingering . criticism of technology - the filmakers have really earned their . diplomas.' The students were forced to put disclaimers on the video, saying: 'This is a film school's submission. There exists no past or current affiliation to Mercedes Benz or Daimler AG'.","Students Tobias Haase, Jan Mettler and Lydia Lohse's video has gone viral .

"A 20-year-old German tourist whose right arm was torn off by a shark in Hawaii is on life support. Jana Lutteropp is in a 'very critical . condition' in Maui Memorial Medical Center after the Wednesday shark attack at Palauea Beach in Makena, hospital spokeswoman Carol Clark said. California high school teacher Rick Moore, who jumped into the water to save Lutteropp, said the young tourist kept repeating that she was going to die. ‘As soon as we stand on the beach, we heard this blood-curdling scream,’  the 57-year-old of Laguna Niguel, California, said. ‘We look out and there was blood everywhere in the white water around her.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Globetrotter: German citizen Jana Lutteropp, 20, is on life support after losing her arm in a shark attack while vacationing in Hawaii . ‘About 10 feet from her, I saw her floating on her back, with no arm,’ Moore said. ‘It was completely severed from her body.’ Lutteropp is originally from Zierenberg north of Kassel in western Germany. She was a member of the town's carnival troupe called Grace Berger Dance Guard and had left Germany last summer to work as an au pair in Seattle, Washington. She was in Hawaii for a three-week vacation and was planning to return to Germany September 11, according to her personal blog as well as the HNA.de website that serves the region where her town is located. On her blog, Lutteropp wrote about her experiences working as an au pair for an American family living in Issaquah – a suburb of Seattle. Hero: Rick Moore (left), a 57-year-old gym teacher from California, jumped in the water after hearing Jana (right) screaming and brought her ashore, where he performed CPR until help arrived . The 20-year-old had spent a year caring for her host family’s three boys – 4-year-old twins and their 5-year-old brother. Her last day on the job was August 12, after which the young au pair apparently headed to Hawaii for a vacation. Lutteropp was snorkeling 50 yards off Palauea Beach in Makena when the shark bit off her arm Wednesday afternoon. With the bikini-clad woman's other arm around his neck, Moore backstroked about 100 yards through strong ocean currents. ‘It dawned on me — I was in danger now,’ he said. ‘The shark is around me and she's bleeding. I start praying out loud, “God, God protect us.” She said, “I'm dying. I know I'm going to die.""’ She was starting to lose consciousness, he said. Moore's friend, Nicholas Grisaffi, 61, of Laguna Beach, stood in neck-high water and took the woman from Moore and carried her limp body out of the water. ‘What was left of her shoulder was in my chest,’ said Grisaffi, who teaches homeless fourth- and fifth-graders. ‘I had a pure-white rash guard on’ but there was very little blood on it, an indication of how much blood she lost. The two teachers said they put the woman in a bystander's kayak, using it as a stretcher to bring her up a trail leading to the street. The woman's three friends were in shock as Moore performed CPR. Attack: The victim is understood to have lost an arm after being bitten by the shark in Hawaii . ‘Pretty much everybody was out of . control except me and Rick,’ Grisaffi said. ‘If we're not there, she's . not saved.

"The shop assistant who allegedly refused to show Oprah Winfrey a handbag said the billionaire is a liar . Oprah Winfrey says she is 'sorry' a media frenzy emerged after saying she experienced racism during a trip to Switzerland. 'I think that incident in Switzerland was just an incident in Switzerland. I'm really sorry that it got blown up. 'I purposefully did not mention the name of the store. I'm sorry that I said it was Switzerland,' Winfrey said . 'I was just referencing it as an example of being in a place where people don't expect that you would be able to be there,' she continued. In a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight, Winfrey recalled a clerk at an upscale Zurich boutique refusing to show her a handbag. Winfrey said she was told she could not afford the $38,000 purse. 'I'm in a store and the person doesn't obviously know that I carry the black card and so they make an assessment based upon the way I look and who I am,' said Winfrey, who earned $77 million in the year ending in June, according to Forbes magazine. 'I didn't have anything that said ""I have money"": I wasn't wearing a diamond stud. I didn't have a pocketbook. I didn't wear Louboutin shoes. I didn't have anything,' said Winfrey on the red carpet. 'You should be able to go in a store looking like whatever you look like and say ""I'd like to see this"". That didn't happen.' Swiss tourism officials and the boutique owner apologized for the incident last week, but Winfrey insists there's no need. 'It's not an indictment against the country or even that store,' she continued. 'It was just one person who didn't want to offer me the opportunity to see the bag. 'So no apologies necessary from the country of Switzerland. If somebody makes a mistake in the United States do we apologize in front of the whole country? No!' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Speaking anonymously, the assistant at Trois Pommes, in Zurich, Switzerland (pictured) said it is 'absolutely not true that I declined to show her the bag on racist grounds' Shop owner Trudie Goetz holds up the handbag (right) that Winfrey wanted to see . The Trois Pommes sales assistant said over the weekend that she felt 'powerless' and in the grip of a 'cyclone' after Winfrey went on TV in America to make the claim. 'I wasn't sure what I should present to her when she came in on the afternoon of Saturday, July 20, so I showed her some bags from the Jennifer Aniston collection. 'I explained to her the bags came in different sizes and materials, like I always do. 'She looked at a frame behind me. Far above there was the 35,000 Swiss franc crocodile leather bag. 'I simply told her that it was like the one I held in my hand, only much more expensive, and that I could show her similar bags. 'It is absolutely not true that I declined to show her the bag on racist grounds. I even asked her if she wanted to look at the bag. 'She looked around the store again but didn't say anything else. Then she went with her companion to the lower floor. My colleague saw them to the door. They were not even in the store for five minutes.' She emphatically denied ever saying to Winfrey: 'You don't want to see this bag. It is too expensive.  You cannot afford it.' Ms Goetz said: 'Everyone wants to sell a crocodile bag. It’s a misunderstanding' and insisted her saleswomen put customers first and try to be 'kind' The shop assistant said she only sells a £25,000 handbag a few times a year and said the racist claims are 'absurd' The saleslady went on: 'This is not true. This is absurd. I would never say something like that to a customer. Really never. Good manners and politeness are the Alpha and the Omega in this business. 'I don't know why she is making these accusations. She is so powerful and I am just a shop girl. 'I didn't hurt anyone. I don't know why someone as great as her must cannibalize me on TV. 'If it had all taken place as she claimed, why has she not complained the next day at the wedding of Tina Turner with Trudie Goetz, my boss? She was there also at the Turner wedding as a guest. I don't understand it. 'I spoke to Oprah Winfrey in English. My English is okay but not excellent, unfortunately. 'I didn't know who she was when she came into the store. That wouldn't have made any difference if I had. Miss Winfrey said of the encounter: 'I could have had the big blow-up thing and thrown down the black card and all that stuff. But why do that?' Girls' weekend: Oprah Winfrey and best friend Gayle King ahead of Tina . Turner and Erwin Bach's wedding celebrations in Zurich, Switzerland . 'We work really hard to greet all the people who come into the store with the same level of respect and treat them all equally. 'If someone asks me whether he or she can see an article, I always present these. Because that person is a potential buyer. And my job is to sell it. 'I'm glad if I can sell an article. It is a reward for me, if I can sell a nice piece. This means that I'm good at my job.' She has worked in the store for five years, says 50 per cent of the clientele come from abroad and that a bag costing nearly £25,000 is sold 'only a few times a year.' Asked what she would say to Oprah now she added: 'I would apologize and say it was all a  misunderstanding. I surely did not intentionally want to insult Ms. Winfrey.

"Discovery: Eva Braun who married Adolf Hitler just days before they committed suicide . As the Red Army smashed into the suburbs of Berlin in April 1945, the mood of Hitler’s bride-to-be Eva Braun turned from fragile hope to black despair. Letters she is said to have written from the bunker hideout she shared with the Fuhrer and his henchmen reveal her growing sense of doom. In one, dated April 19, she writes that, despite the thud of artillery and falling bombs, she is ‘happy to be close’ to Hitler and remains ‘convinced that everything will turn out all right’. But three days later, as Soviet troops overwhelm the German capital’s exhausted defence force – many of them old men and boys – her mood has changed. She says: ‘We are fighting here until the last but I’m afraid the end is threatening closer and closer.’ She also writes of preparing to die and her bewilderment at how God could let such things happen. Eight days later, 33-year-old Braun was dead, killing herself alongside her husband of only a few hours, Adolf Hitler. The letters are published this week in a book called The Women of the Nazis, by Third Reich expert Anna Maria Sigmund. The writer, whose books have been translated into more than 30 languages, insists the letters are genuine and were written by Braun to her friend Herta Schneider. ‘I have no doubt that the letters are genuine and Eva Braun has typed them, correcting her faults by hand,’ she said. She claims the descendants of Schneider, who died nearly 20 years ago, showed her the letters. She said she copied them down before they were sold on to a collector. In the second letter Braun says: ‘Greetings to all my friends, I’m dying how I’ve lived. It’s not difficult for me. You know that.’ Claims: A book published in Germany this week claims to have discovered the farewell letters of Hitler's bride Eva Braun which she wrote to her friend days before committing suicide . Final days: The bunker where Hitler spent his final days with his new wife Eva Braun . Demise: Eva Braun's sentiments change from positive to morbid in the letters . Anna Maria Sigmund explained: ‘Eva . Braun reflects the change of mood in the Fuhrerbunker over four days – . the vague hope on the 19th and the despair of April 22.’ Thirty . years ago the news magazine Stern in Germany became a laughing stock . when it published diaries which it claimed were Hitler’s. They were exposed within days as the work of a master forger. Mrs . Sigmund said she is, however, convinced of the authenticity of the . letters – and of the ‘normality’ of the relationship between Hitler and .

"Criticism: Guenther Oettinger was scathing in his summary of EU states . A leading EU mandarin said David Cameron is a 'hobbled' prime minister in a speech in which he blasted the state of the continent and declared: 'Europe is ripe for an overhaul.' Guenther Oettinger singled out Bulgaria, Romania and Italy as 'essentially ungovernable' and derided eurosceptic MPs in the British parliament as 'unspeakable backbenchers, his English Tea Party' - a reference to the right-wing protest party in the USA. Oettinger is a leading member of German chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party, his nation's EU energy commissioner and a former state premier of the wealthy state of Baden-Wuerttemberg. His comments have sent alarm through the corridors of power in both Brussels and Berlin as he is at his core a firm believer in the European project and not a man to ignore. But Oettinger pulled no punches in his Tuesday night speech to a German, Belgian and Luxembourgian Chambers of Commerce meeting in Brussels on Tuesday evening. He said: 'It worries me that too many in Europe still believe that everything will be fine. Europe is ripe for overhaul.' He added that Brussels had spent more time patting itself on the back about how Europe is civilised and a shining example to the rest of the world 'instead of fighting the financial and economic crisis'. He said many EU members had 'ceased to function' politically and said it worried him about 'essentially ungovernable' nations. He also slammed France, currently in turmoil over a gay marriage law, as being 'completely unprepared to do what’s necessary to get its economy back on track'. He slammed the fact that it has twice as many civil servants as other EU nations 'but no middle class and little in the way of innovation'. Under fire: David Cameron has recently been criticised for going on holiday to Ibiza with his wife Samantha instead of staying in Britain to focus his attention on fixing the UK's problems . Oettinger did not spare his own country in his speech, delivered at a time when 17 of the 27 nations of the EU are still in recession and the politics of austerity seem to have failed miserably. Although largely unscathed by the euro crisis because of its strong export economy, he said his nation is jeopardizing its economic success with a false political agenda. 'Germany is at the highpoint of its economic ability. Germany will not get any stronger pursuing an agenda of child-care subsidies, quotas for women, minimum wage and rejecting fracking for natural gas,' he said. He criticised Germans for worrying about the effects of fracking - the process whereby natural gas or oil deposits are retrieved through polluting high-pressure splitting of subterranean rock - but did not have the same concerns for the environment in Russia from where Germany imports much of its gas. 'That's what I call hypocrisy,' he said. 'The Germans are a pretty hypocritical lot.' He said environmentalists had to accept certain risks if the continent's energy supply needs were to be met in the future.","Guenther Oettinger is a leading member of Germany's ruling CDU party .

"Justin Bieber had his pet monkey confiscated as he flew into Germany without the necessary documentation . Justin Bieber’s abandoned monkey Mally is now officially the property of the German state and has been moved to a secret location to protect it from paparazzi photographers and fans wanting to adopt him. The Canadian teen idol let the deadline pass on Friday to collect the capuchin monkey impounded back in March when he jetted into Europe for his tour without the correct paperwork. Karl-Heinz Joachim, at the Munich animal . clinic where Mally was being cared for until the Friday deadline, said; . 'We have heard nothing more from Bieber’s management so we are moving . forward on the presumption that the animal will stay in Germany long . term. 'Friday was the deadline day and we have not heard a thing. 'Mally will undergo another medical examination next week and then decisions will have to be made about where he goes. 'I think we can safely say now that he is not returning to the states.' Germany’s famous Serengeti Park in the state of Lower Saxony is among the wild animal places offering Mally a permanent home. Managing . director Fabrizio Sepe has a good reputation in Germany and a group of . capuchin monkeys that Mally might be able to live with. He said; 'We have an intact family of capuchin monkeys. It would be great if the monkey baby Mally could grow up with them.' Dr Florian Brandes, an animal beahvioural expert, said it is imperative that Mally gets into a group of his own kind as soon as possible. He said; 'The monkey should be accommodated swiftly among his own kind. He is at grave risk of psychological problems in the future if this is not achieved.' A government conservation office in Bonn will have to ultimately decide who gets to rear Mally and how. The Canadian pop star performed in Berlin on March 31. He now owes thousands of euros for the care of his abandoned pet . Capuchin monkeys are a sociable breed. It is paramount that Mally is introduced to other monkeys after being in isolation for the last two months . The Federal Office for Nature Conservation will not divulge where Mally has been removed to. Office spokesman Franz Emde said; 'There are several zoos that want Mally. The main prerequisite is that there other capuchin monkeys that will accept him.' It is not yet clear whether Bieber will have to pay a fine of several thousands of euros plus care costs for Mally because there is no agreement with the relevant wild animal authorities in the United States, said department head Dietrich Jelden.","Mally the monkey impounded in March when pop star didn't have permit .

"Justin Bieber has allegedly decided to give away his pet monkey Mally instead of rescuing it from a Munich animal clinic. German authorities say the teen star doesn't want the Capuchin back after it was seized by customs officers from a private jet on March 28 and placed in quarantine. They say his management team in New York contacted them this week asking if they could find a 'safe and sheltered place, or a zoo' for the lonely creature. Scroll down for video . Stranger moments: Justin's monkey Mally was confiscated while on tour in Germany . Mally the monkey is now in quarantine at a German animal shelter . The capuchin monkey, taken from its mother at nine weeks, is treating a cuddly toy as its surrogate parent . The star and his entourage had no paperwork or health certificates to bring Mally - just a few weeks old - into the country. After a night spent at an airport quarantine centre, Mally was moved into the care of vets at a clinic in the city. 'We have to discuss now the way forward with customs officials and other responsible departments,' said a clinic spokesman. The statement from 19-year-old Bieber's people in New York thanked the Munich authorities for the 'caring support' offered to Mally. Franz Böhmer of the Bonn Federal Office for Nature Conservation said: 'So far no papers for the monkey of Justin Bieber have been submitted. If he submits a written disclaimer, we can accommodate Mally in a welfare family group in a zoo.' Authorities in Germany have given Bieber a deadline of May 17 to either claim Mally - and pay thousands of pounds towards his upkeep - or to send a letter saying he no longer wants him. Karl Heinz Joachim, the boss of the animal centre where Mally is living, said; 'The baby monkey needs company and to be with other monkeys at this crucial age in its life. 'There are a great many suitable places that have offered to take Mally and integrate him with their own capuchin monkeys where he would be much more happy with his own kind.' He added: 'A baby monkey was never going to be suited to be on a world tour even if he is travelling by private jet. He should be out in the wild climbing trees and learning from other monkeys if he isn't to have serious psychological problems later in life.' Bild newspaper in Germany commented; 'It sounds like the end of a monkey love.' The boss of the Munich animal shelter asked Bieber to do 'the decent thing' and let the animal be adopted . Mally spends his time repeatedly calling in the hope of finding other members of his family group, animal shelter staff said . Mally, a capuchin . monkey, was given to the singer for his 19th birthday last month from . music producer Jamal 'Mally Mal' Rashid. He had been taken away from his . mother when he was only nine weeks old. Normally capuchin monkeys remain with their mothers for at least the first year of their life. Mally is said to spend his time repeatedly calling out in the hope of finding . other members of his family group - something which animal shelter boss . Karl Heinz Joachim, 64, described as 'heartbreaking'. He . said: 'Justin Bieber has won an extension because the four week limit . on confiscated animals only applies if the owner does not get in touch. 'However . his management team had been in touch and indicated that they want the . monkey back which means they now have as much time as they need to get . the paperwork ready. 'If . that takes months then it's months that they have. But that just isn't . acceptable for the baby monkey needs company and to be with other . monkeys at this crucial age in its life. 'We'll appeal to the star to do the decent thing and let the monkey be free for adoption. 'There are a great many suitable places that have offered to take Mally and integrate him with their own capuchin monkeys where he would be much more happy with his own kind. 'A baby monkey is not something suitable to be on a world tour even if he is travelling by private jet. 'He should be out in the wild climbing trees and learning from other monkeys if he isn't to have serious psychological problems later in life.' A source familiar with the situation . has previously told MailOnline: 'There are ongoing discussions to ensure the best . conditions for the monkey.' A German customs spokesman said at the time of the confiscation that Bieber lacked documents certifying compliance with animal health and species-protection regulations.","Mally the capuchin monkey was seized by customs officials in Munich .

"A Swiss music teacher charged with infecting 16 people with HIV by injecting them with needles contaminated by the virus has been arrested after he refused to go to court. The 54-year-old man, who is not being named in accordance with Swiss law, is said to have told his patients, many of them his music students, that he could 'heal' them with acupuncture. Police stormed his flat in the Swiss capital Bern after he stopped attending his trial and instead barricaded himself at home. The Bern man told 'patients' he could heal them with acupuncture before injecting them with HIV-infected blood . The self-proclaimed healer's flat in the . capital Bern was surrounded by police marksmen after he came out . brandishing two samurai swords. He failed to appear at his trial on . Thursday citing 'acute mental and physical exhaustion'. Police who visited his home on Friday managed . to hit him with pepper spray in the garden before he ran and . barricaded himself inside, issuing repeated threats. Swiss police said they subsequently stormed the man's home and arrested him. An unidentified woman with him was also arrested. The man had been free on bail since August. His trial began on March 6, but he stopped turning up in court on Thursday. The case came to the attention of the Swiss authorities after an HIV-positive patient told a Bern hospital in 2004 he had traced his infection back to acupuncture treatments carried out by the accused. The defendant barricaded himself into his flat in Bern, pictured, after failing to turn up for his trial in the Swiss capital (stock image) After two more people were diagnosed with HIV and found to have links to the man, detectives investigated and charged the man with infecting 16 'patients' with HIV-tainted blood between 2001 and 2005. The court in Bern heard that the man conned his pupils into believing he was an acupuncture specialist and said he could 'heal' them with various problems. The court heard that all 16 people injected by the man, who is not HIV-positive, have . contracted the AIDS virus. One of them told the court he visited the . 'healer' in a bid to cure his epilepsy and migraine attacks. 'I know he gave me the virus because . there is no other way I could have contracted it - not sex, drugs or a . blood transfusion,' the victim said. Prosecutors say the blood used by the man came from another of his pupils but he denies the allegation. The man, who faces life imprisonment if found guilty, has denied the charges.","The 54-year-old man is accused of infecting victims with HIV-tainted blood .

"German Chancellor Angela Merkel is said to be furious after her office rug was found to be part of a collection of treasures looted by Hermann Goering . German Chancellor Angela Merkel is this week faced with the tricky question of what to do with her office rug after it was discovered to be part of a collection of treasures looted by Hitler's deputy Hermann Goering. The rug was discovered by journalists writing for news magazine Der Spiegel about Nazi items that should have been returned to their owners but are still scattered about government guest houses, offices and museums. Mrs Merkel is said to be furious with her aides at the embarrassing revelation, coming as it does months before her third bid for power in the general election and with the opposition snapping at her heels. The carpet is described as Persian . and comes from Arak. The 'Collection Goering' as the Reichmarshall's . loot was known, encompassed paintings, tapestries, jewellery, hunting . ornaments, altarpieces - and rugs. It is understood the rug will be removed from view by the end of the week. The magazine said it is one of more than 600 objects that were amassed by Luftwaffe commander Goering and others during the Second World War and are still used by the government. The former state minister for culture . Michael Naumann has now urged the government to force the return of Nazi looted items to their rightful owners or their . heirs. 'The legislature must concretise their return,' he said. 'More money must also be used for research in German museums.' A giant carpet said to be similar in . design to the one in the chancellor's office was part of the haul of . looted art seized by the Allies at the close of the war. This one adorned . the library at Carinhall, Goering's ostentatious hunting lodge north of . Berlin, but was taken by him - along with numerous artworks - and . shipped to his home near Hitler's at Berchtesgaden in the early days of . 1945. There it was seized by the Americans and . later returned to the state of Bavaria. Among a collection at a Munich museum was found a cigarette box belonging to Hermann Goering that had an inscription from his wife Emmy (left) and his daughter Edda . Goering, Hitler's deputy, pictured at the Nuremberg Trials, initiated economic measures against Jews before the Second World War . It lay for years in a . Bavarian government hall and was trod upon by numerous visiting foreign . dignitaries, including Erich Honecker, head of state of Communist East . Germany. It now lies wrapped in silver paper in a . Bavarian archive: no-one wants to use it, given its history, but no-one . is brave enough to sell it on. It is unclear how another Goering carpet ended up in the chancellor's office in Berlin. The West German government in 1966 declared the task of reuniting owners with their stolen property to be 'concluded.' But tapestry from the same collection as the rug in Mrs Merkel's office adorns the walls of a government guest house on the outskirts of Bonn. A stolen walnut secretary - seized by Hans Posse who was the Nazi administrator for all stolen art during the Third Reich - sits in the German president's office in Berlin. The research also featured a photograph of a platinum watch Hitler gave his mistress Eva Braun in 1939 on her 27th birthday engraved on the back: 'On the 6.2.1939. Sincerely, A. Hitler.' It was found in a Munich museum by the magazine's researchers. Other possessions of Goering were discovered in Munich's Pinakothek der Moderne museum. The collection includes platinum and gold cufflinks, a ring with diamonds as well as a golden cup for champagne. Hermann Goering, pictured right, with wife Emmy, left, and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, centre, stole or bought at knock-down prices hundreds of pieces of art for his country estate Carinhall, pictured . Spiegel reporters also came across a golden decorated cigarette box with a dedication from Goering's wife and daughter in 1940 that read: 'Full of happiness and pride, Emmy and Edda congratulate ""Reich Marshal"" in intimate love'. In 1953, Goering was sentenced to death for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials but cheated the hangman's noose by killing himself in his cell with a phial of hidden cyanide. While there were many thieves in the Third Reich, Goering was the . biggest magpie of them all and amassed about 2,000 pieces. What he did not actually steal from conquered . lands he bought at knock-down prices from Jews in pre-war German who . needed money to buy exit visas to escape. Last year, the Dutch government returned . two paintings, that were stolen by Goering's aides in 1940, to the heir . of Edouard Leon Jonas. As well as freebooters like Goering, Hitler sanctioned a special department . of thieves called 'Sondermuseum Linz' who were licensed to ransack the . museums and collections of conquered territories for treasures he . intended to display at a 'Supermuseum' in the backwater Austrian city . where he once lived and which he planned to open after the war. The Nazi's plundered thousands of pieces from the countries they invaded. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, centre, inspects paintings hidden in a salt mine at Merkers, near Gotha, Germany where the Nazi government stored art treasures and gold . Items stolen for the museum included the Amber Room of the Czars - never . found and worth around £200million today - and masterpieces by . Monet, Manet and Cezanne, sculptures and tapestries worth an estimated £500million, stolen from the collection of Baron Ferenc Hatvany, a . Hungarian-Jewish industrialist. They, too, have never been found. It is believed that Germany's 6,000 museums are full of Nazi treasures and looted objects but there are few staff to check on the provenance of the collections. In Bavaria just one specialist is on the payroll of the local government to check the origin of 4,400 paintings and 770 sculptures taken in 1933 after the Nazis came to power.","Mrs Merkel is said to be furious with her aides over the gaffe .

"Israeli scientist Yaron Svoray has been given permission and assistance from Germany to search for the gold . The German government is backing a bid by an Israeli researcher to find a billion pound fortune in looted Nazi gold in a lake near Berlin. Legend has it that 18 crates of gold and platinum were dumped by an S.S. squad in the Stolpsee lake in Brandenburg in the closing days of the Second World War and lie in less than 50 feet of water. They were allegedly dumped in a secret operation codenamed ‘Operation Nibelung’ after the vast treasure of the mythical Burgundians whose stories are told in Wagner’s opera cycle The Ring of the Nibelungen. The lake lies in what was former East Germany and was the scene of frantic dives organised by the Stasi secret police desperate for treasure to sell in order to buy much needed foreign currency. The treasure has a conservative value of around a billion pounds. But if it is there, it lies under at least six feet of lake-bottom sludge and the Israeli team which arrived on its shores this week have brought along sophisticated sonar gear in a bid to locate it. The treasure belonged to Hermann Goering - Luftwaffe chief, one-time deputy to Hitler and the greatest thief of the Third Reich - who stored it at his hunting lodge Carinhall 50 miles north of Berlin. Carinhall was bedecked with some of the most beautiful treasures of Europe, stolen to order by Goering, but emptied in early 1945 as the Red Army moved closer to Berlin and blown up on his orders. To this day it is a magnet for treasure hunters who pour into the woods and ruins in unsuccessful attempts to find what they believe is missing loot still hidden in secret bunkers. Witnesses said they saw Polish slave labourers being forced to dump up to £1billion of gold in the lake . Eighteen months ago a consortium of British businessmen expressed an interest to the German government of diving for it but nothing came of their expedition. According to eyewitness accounts from the time, Polish slave labourers assisted the S.S. in dumping the gold into the lake and were then executed, their bodies weighted and then thrown into the water after the treasure. The search has been reignited after claims by a local priest, Erich Koehler, 79, who has researched the legend of the treasure and who was a pastor near the lake during the East German communist regime. 'They didn’t have the technology in the former East Germany to properly examine the lake,' he said. 'But there are enough local people still around to know that the gold is there – and the bodies of the poor souls forced to dump it into the water.’ Erich Mielke, the chief of the Stasi, believed in the story and won politburo approval for his search back in 1986. The hunt was codenamed Operation Autumn Wind and grainy black and white photos exist of the search in the murky depths. The Israeli team has been bolstered in its confidence of finding treasure from papers found in the German Federal Archive in Koblenz. SS documents together with post-war eye witness statements to the events on the lake in March 1945, give credence to the theory that precious material was indeed dumped into the 400-feet deep lake. The treasure belonged to Hermann Goering, pictured right, with wife Emmy, left and Benito Mussolini, who stored it at his hunting lodge Carinhall . One witness, Eckhard Litz, told a . post-war allied commission: ‘I remember well the night that lorries with . slit headlights drove up to the lakeshore and I saw about 20 to 30 . skeletal figures dressed in striped concentration camp uniforms being . forced to unload heavy boxes. ‘These were put into two rowing boats which made six separate trips to the centre of the lake. ‘When the last case had been thrown overboard, the men returned to shore, were lined up and the last thing I saw were the flashes of the machine guns of the guards as they were killed.’ He said the bodies were then loaded back onto the rowing boats which were then taken out by the SS to the centre of the lake and sunk. A third boat brought back the SS men to the shore. Goering is alleged to have personally taken charge of numerous amounts of bullion from the national bank of Poland following the Nazi invasion in 1939.  It is this loot which allegedly lies in the Stolpsee. Israeli scientists Yaron Svoray, 59, received permission and assistance from Germany for the searches which begin this week. He said: 'It is not just about the treasure but also about the people who it once belonged to.  It is about putting things right.' His sonar equipment alone costs 50,000 pounds. Dr. Thomas Kersting, of the Brandenburg state office for monuments, said: 'This is an expedition of extreme historical interest.'","Israeli researcher Yaron Svoray given permission to search for the gold .

"Jeffrey Daday has admitted stealing $89,000 from meters he was being paid to empty over a five year period . A parking attendant had admitted stealing $89,000 by pocketing an estimated 356,000 quarters from meters he was being paid to empty over a five year period. Jeffrey Daday, 35, from Brewster in New York state, was tasked with collecting the proceeds of meters in the village of Mount Kisco and delivering them to the local council office. But a police surveillance team were stunned to see the burly parking attendant emptying meters before heading straight to a bank to deposit the coins in his account. Daday pleaded guilty to charges of second-degree grand larceny and first-degree offering a false instrument for filing in Westchester County Court in White Plains, N.Y.. He faces a potential jail term of 15 years. There is no minimum sentence for the crime for first time offenders in New York state. Police were called to investigate after council officials realised tens thousands of dollars had gone missing over the five-year period. Officers swooped as Daday left the bank and arrested him on suspicion of depositing the coins into his own personal bank account. District Attorney Janet DiFiore said Daday's crime spree began on January 5, 2009 and continued until his arrest in May this year. Parking metres in the Westchester County area take quarters (25 cent coins), dimes (10 cent coins) and nickels (5 cent coins). Scam: A police surveillance team watched Daday emptying meters in  the village of Mount Kisco before heading to a nearby bank to deposit coins into his account . To amass a total of $89,000, Daday would have had to have taken 356,000 quarters or 890,000 dimes or 1.78 million nickels. Daday is the second warden in the area to be caught stealing from meters in recent years. The first warden stole $30,000 (£18,000) in quarters which he stored in a camera bag which he kept inside his car.","Jeffrey Daday, 35, admitted stealing loose coins from parking meters .

"Drones are fast becoming a videographer's favourite new toy when it comes to changing our perceptions of scenery, animals and events.

"There’s nothing better than an upgrade. That frisson of excitement as you step onto a plane and turn left rather than right, knowing you haven’t paid full whack, can be better than the holiday itself. While it used to happen a lot more, being promoted to first or business class is still possible and nearly one in five of us has been offered an upgrade in the last two years, according to Moneysavingexpert.com. But you can greatly improve your chances if you know a few inside tricks and quirks of the industry. Here we show you how to break free of cattle-class and soar into First. Scroll down for video . This could all be yours: The first class interior of Emirates A380 . 1.) Loyalty . Money talks, and spending a lot of time and cash flying with one airline counts. Katherine Clark, regional business development director for TripAdvisor Flights says: ‘Join a frequent flyer club and start earning miles. When airlines are oversold they will look to upgrade their most loyal passengers first.’ Harriet Bevis, spokesperson for Virgin Atlantic agrees: ‘If our airport staff are looking to upgrade passengers on the day of departure there is a process that they follow which generally sees passengers that are frequent flyers of the airline - or those that have paid for a fully flexible ticket - benefitting.’ Flights of fancy: there's almost too much leg room in first class . 2.) Check for breakages . It’s not unusual to be upgraded if your seat or seat belt is broken. Obviously this is not a green light to start causing willful damage, but it's worth checking. On packed flights there may be nowhere else to put you other than in the lap of the Gods. This includes if  entertainment system and whether your seat can fully recline says Katherine Clark . 3.) Fly outside of commuter times . Regular business travellers tend to get preference over casual holiday-goers in the Battle For An Upgrade. They've got the air miles, they know the airport staff and they look the part. To give yourself a fighting chance book flights that laptop Larrys are less likely to be on. Think midday, midweek and on weekends, not early mornings or late afternoons. Arrive early or late for check-in, the airline might have overbooked the flight and need to move you . 4.) Sit near a baby . Not that you have much control over this, but if the worst happens and you find yourself sitting next to a bawling child ask to move. You might get a worse seat near the loo or you might strike First Class gold. At the very least you’ll probably get a complimentary drink to drown your sorrows. Sitting next to a crying baby gives you an airtight case for requesting a seat switch . 5.) Arrive early or late . The early bird catches the worm. Skyscanner's James Teideman has seen it pay to be prompt to check-in. ‘If passengers need to be moved between cabins for operational reasons, the airline will probably know this several hours before the flight. So if you’re among the first few passengers to check-in, you have a higher chance of being chosen. Likewise, closer to the end of check-in, airlines might be faced with overbooking if more passengers have turned up than they were expecting.’ 6.) Fly solo . Sometimes it pays to leave friends and family behind. Katherine Clark advises travelling by yourself. ‘It’s much easier to upgrade a single passenger up to business class than a family of four.’ Enjoy the benefits of travelling alone. You're more likely to be upgraded . 7.) Dress for success . While experts agree that looking like an investment banker or Hollywood film star doesn’t help as much as it used to, tracksuits and torn jeans certainly won’t further your cause. Airlines want first and business class to look a league above, so make sure you do too. Bob Atkinson, travel expert at TravelSupermarket.com advises sticking to the 'smart casual' code and that 'a cashmere shawl or linen jacket can make all the difference.' A queue of flights ready for takeoff at Heathrow airport. Where will you be sitting? 8.) Just ask . It’s an obvious point but asking politely at the check-in desk is often enough. Katherine Clark says: ‘If you don’t ask you don’t get and with more people checking in online there are less people asking the question, ‘Is the flight full?’ If they can’t give you a free upgrade, they might give you a heavily reduced one. Bob Atkinson adds: 'It can make all the difference if you remember your Ps and Qs with a smile on your face.' 9.) Use air miles . You’ll need to do some research as the small print differs wildly between various airlines and alliances as to when and how you can exchange points for a luxury ride, but substituting collated air miles for the smell of First Class can be points well spent. 10.) Break your leg . Nearly two thirds of airline staff in a Skyscanner survey revealed that a passenger with a broken limb was more likely to get the premium experience for free. While it's certainly not worth breaking your leg before you travel, letting cabin crew know about your injuries and ailments might just win you their sympathy. Break a leg: let flight attendants know if you have injuries better suited to business class. But don't fake it . 11.) Discount deals . Keep an eye on your email and sign up to airline groups and schemes. They often send out messages alerting members of upgrade availability. Ireland’s Aer Lingus gives you the chance to bid for an upgrade. You  request an email from them before travelling, enter an amount you’re willing to pay and then wait to hear if you've made the cut. 12.) Fly on your birthday . You can’t fake it.

"Nastya, who is only seven years old, has moved underground with her parents to escape the fierce shelling of their hometown of Ilovaysk.

Nastya shows a camera around her new home, spelling out  letters of the alphabet while reading them off a children's poster. Seven-year-old Nastya shows her doll to the camera while her family escapes the shelling in their hometown . She pulls a doll out of a plastic bag and strokes its hair. Nastya tells the camera: 'I have dolls at home, teddy bears and the book with pictures to colour.' She must now play with them all in the dark. Her parents sleep here too and the young girl gives a guided tour of their sleeping quarters. Ilovaysk is about 28 miles southeast of the rebel stronghold in Donetsk. As yet, nobody knows how many Ukrainians have died in Ilovaysk but reports suggest that the battle for the small town outside Donetsk is likely to go down as one of the defining moments of the conflict. Many residents have fled, many more have been taken prisoner and some, like Nastya and her parents, remain.

"If you can hardly bear the thought of your mother-in-law coming over for lunch, look away now. Britain's biggest family gathering was held in Buckland Brewer in Devon as 130 people celebrated their gene pool and enjoyed a bit of a catch-up. Four generations of the Heal family travelled from far and wide to be there with some flying in from New Zealand. We are family: 130 of John Heal and Mary-Anne Fry's descendants met in Devon to celebrate . Most of the clan live in Devon and Cornwall but some family emigrated to Australia and New Zealand in the 1800s sparking a geographical split from the herd. With far too many  to fit inside a house, pub or any other local venue, organisers borrowed a giant marquee to house the monster celebration. One for the album: Guests wore name stickers to identify themselves . All present were descendants of John Heal and Mary-Anne Fry, who were stalwarts of the rural farming community in the 19th century and are buried in the local cemetery. The last family gathering of the Heal brood took place in 1987 but only attracted 30 to 40 people. Originals John and Mary had nine children, who had dozens more between them, and their children went on to have scores more themselves. Their great granddaughter Emily Heal, 89, was the oldest relative in attendance and the youngest, was six week old Edith Beer - John and Mary's great, great, great granddaughter. Family matters: Luckily, the sun shone during the gathering in the village of Buckland Brewer . The jolly affair was organised by Lorna Hicks, 65, and her cousins who used genealogy records to build a family tree  before sending out invites. She said: 'We always knew we had family overseas, it was quite common for people to emigrate from here back then. Four generations of the Heal clan met in a wedding marquee because they could not fit inside a house or pub . 'In my grandfather's generation, three of five boys emigrated. Only one of the boys lived at home the whole time. 'Some of my cousins had been meaning to have this event for a long time, and it finally seemed like the right time to do it.' Despite the success of this meeting, they aren't planning another reunion any time soon. Some relatives travelled from New Zealand to ensure they were there for the big day . Lorna added: 'We had a marquee from a wedding and we did a ""bring and share"". 'It was a great fun day, lots of sitting around and chatting. Living so far apart we had lots to catch up on. 'It's not the sort of thing you want to do too often though - the logistics are a little daunting and the novelty would soon wear off. 'We might do one in another 10 years or so.'","Guests travelled from as far away as New Zealand to be there .

Michael Catania, a software development manager from Mold in North Wales, spends two hours once a month scanning the skies in his tiny plane for picturesque shots of the local countryside. The 52-year-old said, 'The photographs highlight how beautiful the countryside is in North Wales. The diversity of landscape and seascapes is breathtaking.' 'I fell in love with North Wales when I went to university in Bangor and I consider myself very lucky as I have the opportunity to fly myself around the mountains and the coast. 'Once you spot what you want, you then have to consider how best to approach the best viewpoint to capture the image safely.

"In a preview of what could be a bloody 2016 presidential contest, Sen. Rand Paul claimed Wednesday that Hillary Clinton's 'shoot first' foreign policy – if it had succeeded – would have put the terrorist Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) in control of Syria. Her aggressive advice to President Barack Obama about arming rebel groups there, the Kentucky Republican wrote in an online essay for The Wall Street Journal, represented ISIS's best chance to have a nation-state of its own. 'To interventionists like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, we would caution that arming the Islamic rebels in Syria created a haven for the Islamic State,' he wrote. 'We are lucky Mrs. Clinton didn't get her way and the Obama administration did not bring about regime change in Syria. That new regime might well be ISIS.' Senator Rand Paul is emerging as the most dovish of likely Republican 2016 presidential hopefuls, arguing in favor of relative isolationism and slamming Democrats who favored arming rebel groups in the Middle East . Paul and Clinton are both likely 2016 presidential candidates. If they should emerge as their parties' nominees, an unusual political dynamic would cast the Democrat as the war hawk and the Republican as a dovish isolationist. The rise of ISIS in Syria and Iraq, Paul claimed, shows that Clinton and others who pushed in 2013 for the U.S. to arm militants opposed to dictator Bashar al-Assad last year lack 'a reasonable degree of foresight.' 'Those who say we should have done more to arm the Syrian rebel groups have it backward,' he wrote. Mrs Clinton was also eager to shoot first in Syria before asking some important questions.' The former secretary of state sees things differently. She told The Atlantic this month that it was the West's failure to help rebels topple Assad that created 'a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled.' The quick expansion and growth of ISIS has turned the Obama administration's strategy on its head. A year ago, the White House weighed the value of airstrikes against Assad as news emerged that his regime was deploying chemical weapons in cities controlled by rebel groups. Now it's considering attacks against ISIS – which is among Assad's biggest domestic headaches – in Syria. Paul seized on the confusion Wednesday to brand Clinton as its architect. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, shown August 16 in the Hamptons with longtime aide Huma Abedin (right), pushed for President Obama to arm anti-Assad groups last year, including some that may now be part of ISIS . 'Our Middle Eastern policy is unhinged,' he wrote, 'flailing about to see who to act against next, with little thought to the consequences. This is not a foreign policy.' 'The Islamic State represents a threat that should be taken seriously. But we should also recall how recent foreign-policy decisions have helped these extremists so that we don't make the same mistake of potentially aiding our enemies again.' The Democratic National Committee responded Thursday, saying Paul was promoting 'reckless ideas' by urging U.S. 'retreat from the world.' 'Simply put, if Rand Paul had a foreign policy slogan, it would be – The Rand Paul Doctrine: Blame America. Retreat from the World,' DNC national press secretary Michael Czin said in a statement.","Kentucky GOP senator writes in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that Clinton was reckless to argue for regime change in Syria .
'That new regime might well be ISIS,' Paul claims .
Clinton has insisted that leaving Assad alone created a power vacuum among rebel groups that ISIS swooped in to fill .
If Paul and Clinton were to emerge as their parties' presidential nominees in 2016, the Democrat would be the war hawk – and the Republican the dove ."
"Serena Williams began the defense of her French Open title with a 6-2, 6-1 victory on Sunday over 138th-ranked Alize Lim, a wild-card entry from France. The top-seeded Williams won the most points and wound up with 30 more winners - but also 24 more unforced errors - than Lim. Williams is a 17-time major champion who was facing a woman making her Grand Slam debut but there was still a bit of shakiness from the 32-year-old American as she served out the final game, losing four break points and needing five match points to close things. Williams saved all seven break points she faced in the match. She improved her record in the first-round matches of majors to 54-1. The only loss came at the 2012 French Open against 111th-ranked Virginie Razzano. Ruthless: Serena Williams made light work of Alize Lim in the opening game her French Open campaign . Victory: Williams celebrates her straight sets victory over Lim . Valiant: Despite her best efforts Lim could do little to stop Williams' powerful play . Milos Raonic and Agnieszka Radwanska also eased into the second round of the French Open on the opening day. Poland's Radwanska, the third seed, won 6-3 6-0 after the first seven games against Zhang Shuai went against serve. Canadian Raonic, seeded eighth, beat the feisty Australian Nick Kyrgios 6-3 7-6 (7-1) 6-3 and then charmed the Roland Garros crowd by conducting his on-court interview in French. Radwanska set the ball rolling on the main Philippe Chatrier show court under overcast skies. Forecasters warn that intermittent rain is expected over the early days of the tournament. Wearing a floral print dress perhaps in anticipation of more springlike temperatures, Radwanska took a while to get into her rhythm against Zhang and both women struggled badly with their service. But the Pole eventually held for 5-3, after saving three break points, and then broke the Chinese to take the set. The second set however, was a completely different story. Quick: Agnieszka Radwanska breezed through her game against Zhang Shuai in straight sets . 'I think it was a very wet court. I think the courts are not always dry, it's raining every day, so it makes the courts much slower,' Radwanska said. 'Every two-set match is great in a two-week tournament. It's important that I spent only one hour on court,' added Radwanska, who played with a heavily strapped thigh. She was badly hampered by a knee injury when losing the Indian Wells final to Flavia Pennetta in March. Pain: Radwanska said that she couldn't play for too long because of the strapping on her thigh . Raonic pushed Novak Djokovic in the Rome semi-finals before losing in three sets to the eventual champion and he eased through the first set against Kyrgios. The eighth seed was broken midway through the second but recovered immediately, leaving his 19-year-old opponent to hurl his racket to the court, shaking his head. The Australian got increasingly frustrated through the second-set tiebreak, berating himself repeatedly, before Raonic took it 7-1. A finely executed forehand slice from the back of the court forced Kyrgios to hit long, giving Raonic a 2-0 lead in the third set. But it was soon Raonic's turn to berate himself as a double fault gifted back the break of serve. Another break in the sixth game put Raonic on course for a three-set victory and he served out to win on his third match point. Cool: Whilst opponent Nick Kyrgios lost his calm Canada's Milos Roanic kept his composure during his victory .","Defending championing eased into a 6-2,6-1 victory over the wild card entry .

"The British fashion expansion into the Far East is gathering pace, with Whistles opening branches in Hong Kong and China just days after Topshop and Smythson also stuck their flags in local groud. The elegant high-street label, a home-grown favourite of both the Duchess of Cambridge and Samantha Cameron that was founded in 1978, already has shops in Paris, Berlin, Munich and Moscow. Moreover, Whistles' expansion into Asia is, perhaps, a preamble to a further expansion in the opposite direction: the brand is currently in discussion with a large American department store about opening a concession in spring/summer 2014. The Duchess of Cambridge, left, in Whistles at the January unveiling of her portrait in the National Gallery, and Samantha Cameron, right, in Whistles at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester in 2011 . The expansion will see 'shop in shops' opening in August in two key Lane Crawford department stores: one in Hong Kong, the other in a newly opened Shanghai site. The brand will be situated in the contemporary area and will carry products from the catwalk show as well as best selling leather, cashmere and silk pieces. The collection will also be available at Lane Crawford online. The move sees the next phase in the brand's wholesale expansion strategy, the first phase of which saw it showcase the AW13 collection for the first time at London Fashion Week to international press and buyers. Increased demand in online sales from Asia - and a boom in buyers from the region shopping in the brand's European stores - prompted the expansion. Kate, wearing Whistles, talking with Prince Harry at the Olympic Closing Ceremong in 2012 - incidentally, the woman behind Kate is also wearing Whistles . Whistles chief executive Jane Shepherdson told Vogue.com: 'We realised that the brand appeals to the Chinese aesthetic, in that it is feminine, but with a clean, modern feel. 'China is an increasingly sophisticated market, and there seems to be a growing middle class customer, who doesn't necessarily want to only buy into the luxury labels - but also wants to shop contemporary European brands that provide well-designed quality fashion at a price that they can afford.' Founded in London in 1978, Whistles began as an independent boutique and has since evolved into a leading womenswear brand, characterised by its contemporary, intelligent sense of style and design.

The former Kate Middleton and her sister Pippa both have wardrobes full of Whistles clothes, and the Duchess is not afraid to show her thrifty side by recycling them: last summer she wore the £150 blue Bella dress to both the Diamond Jubilee Concert and the Olympic Games Closing Ceremony. Despite the clothes Kate wears selling out moments after she is photographed wearing them, Sheperdson denies the so-called 'Kate Middleton effect' has boosted sales. Speaking in 2012, she said: 'It raises profile, it’s great, we get known in countries we're not known in. But it's not going to turn us into a success overnight because she wears it. 'Fortunately, she looks great in it and it's a great advert, but no more than that.'

"A controversial 1970s experiment took a newborn chimpanzee from his mother and moved him to New York City in an attempt to learn if apes could communicate with language. It was hoped that if Nim Chimpsky was raised solely among humans, he would be able to master sign language. But after a tumultuous journey, Nim struggled when he was returned back into the company of fellow chimpanzees and died prematurely at 26. In captivity, these apes can live up to 60. Scroll down for video . Experimental: In the early 70s, a primate named Nim Chimpsky was the subject of an experiment whose purpose was to learn whether language is innate . Language classes: It was hoped that if Nim grew up around humans he would be able to communicate with sign language . Domestic: Nim took part in every aspect of family life . One of Nim's favorite playmates, Bob Ingersoll, told ABC News that he thought stress was a major factor in the animal's early death but that something else might have been to blame. 'It might actually be fair to say he died of a broken heart,' Ingersoll said. The story of Nim Chimpsky will told on December 20 when a documentary on his life called Project Nim is broadcast on HBO. Nim was taken from his mother at the Institute for Primate Studies in Oklahoma in 1973, under the control of Herb Terrace, a Columbia psychology professor. Learning: Nim made good progress with sign language . Stephanie LaFarge breastfed the chimp for a few months . Growing up: Nim grew into a strong and occasionally aggressive adult chimp . Celebrity: Nim made the cover of New York Magazine . The chimp was brought to the large family home of Stephanie LaFarge in New York City, who brings him up in exactly the same manner as each of her seven children. But Nim was a chimp, not a human, and as he grew up he created domestic chaos in the LaFarge household. Nim was breastfed by LaFarge and bonded with her, but became jealous of her husband. The chimp enjoys the spirit of the 1970s however and enjoys driving fast, drinking beer and occasionally smoking marijuana. Nim turned into a media star, appearing on the front covers of New York and High Times magazine. But a lack of routine caused Terrace to move Nim on and psychology student Laura Petitto looked after the chimp, teaching him sign language in classrooms at Columbia University. Yet while Nim learned hundreds of signs, he was also growing physically. Though playful and affectionate Nim also became increasingly violent and he attacked several trainers. Petitto suffered a bite that required 37 stitches. Nim with one of his best friends Bob Ingersoll.

But the animal was confused and distressed by meeting other members of his species for the first time since birth.

"She famously said she didn't want to follow in her mother's fashionable footsteps. But it seems that Anna Wintour's daughter is still happy to take advantage of the invites she receives to designer fashion shows. Bee Shaffer was the Vogue editor's plus one at the prestigious Yves Saint Laurent Menswear spring/summer 2014 show in Paris yesterday. Scroll down for video . Family affair: Anna Wintour and her daughter Bee Shaffer attended Yves Saint Laurent Menswear Spring/Summer 2014 show as part of Paris Fashion Week yesterday . The mother and daughter duo cut stylish figures as they graced the front row alongside the likes of Salma Hayek, Sky Ferrira, Milla Jovovich and Carrine Roitfeld. 25-year-old Bee (real name Katherine) has obviously inherited her mother's style credentials. She looked bang-on-trend in a YSL baby doll pussy bow floral dress complete with nude heels and a gold clutch. Her mother wore a monochrome dress with a pink cardigan, as well as her trademark sunglasses and coiffed bob. Anna and Bee both seemed to thoroughly enjoy the show. Charlie Potter from the Financial Times, said of the show: 'Slimane just steamrolls over the old system of editor approval and validation through coverage. 'His spring/summer Saint Laurent collection was an ever more extreme vision of a singular young man with intent. 'Consider . the skin-tight trousers, often vinyl, always belted uncommonly high: . Because they were paired with cropped jackets, the crotch was in focus. The models were young and thin, so this exposure was no power play.' Queen of fashion: Anna Wintour (L) is fashion's most famous face but her daughter (R) said she didn't want to follow in her footsteps . Bee is Anna's daughter with ex-husband, child psychiatrist Dr. David Shaffer. She was born in London, but moved to . New York after her mother landed the job that made her the most famous face in fashion. Her father divorced Wintour, after . she allegedly had an affair when Bee was just 12. Bee made a brief appearance in The September Issue, a 2009 American documentary film about the behind-the-scenes drama that followed Anna Wintour and her staff during the production of the September 2007 issue of American Vogue magazine. Bee enamoured the audience by saying she wouldn't follow in her mother's footsteps and make a foray into fashion. Front row regular: She may have told the audience on The September Issue that she wanted to go into law, but Bee certainly loves attending fashion shows with her mother . And while she said she wanted to study law, she clearly had a change of heart after landing her first job as contributing editor of Teen Vogue. She continued to pursue a job in the media during her time at Columbia . University and wrote a regular column for the Daily Telegraph. After graduating from Columbia in 2009, she scored a job at College . Humor website.

"England coach Stuart Lancaster has chosen to suppress a patriotic video shown to his players for fear of it upsetting Scottish nationalists . The England rugby team will not release a patriotic video used to inspire its players because head coach Stuart Lancaster fears it will upset the Scots. The emotionally-charged video, which brought some of England's toughest sportsmen to tears when they watched it, will not be released to the public because of 'political ramifications' from Scottish nationalists. Lancaster said he was concerned that the video could prompt claims of 'arrogance' from other Home Nations sides before they meet in the Six Nations tournaments early next year. The team's coach said the video, which features English rugby legends such as Peter Winterbottom and Bill Beaumont, would help motivate the players before the World Cup, which takes place in England next year. But England will face Scotland in February in the Six Nations, and there are fears that the video's release could provoke anger among nationalists in the wake of last month's independence referendum. The Sunday Telegraph reported that Lancaster, speaking at a business conference in Leeds on Thursday, said: 'If you start talking about Englishness you are soon seen as arrogant. We have to make sure we have our feet firmly on the ground and show we are not an arrogant team. 'I am hesitant to put the video out there because of the political ramifications. It articulates really well … English identity and some of the good aspects of being English. I think it will be really powerful in the lead-up to the World Cup.' His view was backed up by Welsh Conservative MP Glyn Davies, who said: 'We are living in an era where people are outraged by the oddest things. 'I haven’t seen the film but rugby teams have just got to be sensitive. Everybody has got to be careful because very often the message backfires. Stuart Lancaster has got to think about his team.' Lancaster has been trying to boost national affection in the lead-up to next year's World Cup. He said he admired the way the Welsh team play for a 'cause', which the whole nation rallies around. The England team, pictured celebrating after Luther Burrell's (second from right) try against Scotland in this year's Six Nations, were shown the inspirational video, with some even shedding a tear . Lancaster is hoping the patriotic video will help replicate England's success at the 2003 World Cup, which was won after this last-gasp drop goal by Jonny Wilkinson . He hopes the team can improve from England's disastrous 2011 World Cup, hosted by New Zealand, which was tarnished by a series of incidents of ill-discipline. Four players, including captain Mike Tindall - who is married to Zara Phillips - were pictured on a night out in Queenstown just hours after a narrow 13-9 victory over Argentina. Martin Johnson, England's coach at the time, also reprimanded three players for inappropriate comments made to a female worker at the team hotel. The day after being knocked out by France in the quarter finals, England centre Manu Tuilagi was fined after jumping off a ferry in Auckland. A spokesman for the Rugby Football Union said: 'Several motivational videos have been used for the players over the last couple years including one which talks about the history and heritage of the shirt. 'There are no plans for any to be released publicly because it was made for the players and something we want to keep it for the squad.'","The England rugby team were shown a patriotic video to inspire them .

"Sharp-tongued Welsh designer Julien Macdonald famously branded Cheryl Cole a 'chav' and claimed that plus-size models were a 'joke'. But it seems that the Duchess of Cambridge has won over the catty catwalk king. The fashion designer has praised Kate's maternity style and says that pregnancy has made her sexier than ever. Sexy style: Welsh designer Julien Macdonald has spoken out to rave about the Duchess of Cambridge's sexy maternity style . Speaking to Grazia Daily at the launch of his new swimwear line with Melissa Odabash, the 42-year-old said: 'Kate Middleton has an effortless style. 'I love how short her dresses are now she’s pregnant. It’s not something you normally see on pregnant women and it’s bound to start a new maternity trend. 'Those dresses are actually very short, shorter than she ever wears usually. That’s been her trick, and it’s working – pregnancy has made her sexier.' And it seems he isn't alone in his views. The Duchess of Cambridge's penchant . for smart, feminine maternity wear has sparked a nationwide trend among . Britain's other mothers-to-be. Short but sweet: 'Those dresses are actually very short, shorter than she ever wears usually. That's been her trick, and it's working - pregnancy has made her sexier', says Julien . Department . store chain Debenhams has seen sales of sophisticated dresses and smart . styles in their maternity collections increase by more than 500 per . cent compared to this time last year, and is attributing this to . pregnant women wanting to emulate the Duchess' well-documented elegant . look. With . not a pair of dungarees, leggings or a smock in sight, the Duchess of . Cambridge has continued to paint a picture of elegance throughout her . pregnancy. For her, . maternity style has meant neatly tailored coats that skim her burgeoning . bump, smart dresses with empire line or wrap styling and just a hint of . a higher hemline to emphasise her still-slender legs. Women are also emulating Kate's . off-duty look, with pretty woven tops and cropped capri trousers selling . well, with some lines up more than 500 per cent. Due to the popularity of elegant maternity wear styles and shapes, Debenhams is dubbing the trend 'The Duchess Effect'. No holding back: The designer, who previously branded Cheryl Cole a 'chav', also said Madonna's use of guns was 'insensitive' Whilst Macdonald, who has an OBE for services to fashion, gushed about the Duchess, he didn't hold back when it came to discussing Madonna. He attacked the 54-year-old for her ‘insensitive’ use of guns saying that she should be more sensitive to people's feelings. Julien also famously hit out at the nation's sweetheart, Cheryl Cole, calling her a 'chav' and telling her that her newly-coloured red hair . looked terrible at mutual friend Sarah Harding's Halloween party three years ago. Cheryl, who even attended the . designer's show before their argument, was told to sack her stylist by . the 41-year-old Britain and Ireland's Next Top Model judge. While . Julien was the one who designed the slashed military suit that Cheryl . made a fashion hit in her number one song Fight For This Love, the . pair's friendship has most certainly fizzled. The designer also made controversial comments during his time as a judge on Britain And Ireland's Next Top Model, saying that a plus-size model should not . win the competition.

"Serena Williams won the Internazionali BNL d’Italia after seeing off Sara Errani in a final ruined by injury to her opponent. Errani had recovered from a break down to bring the first set back on serve but required lengthy off-court treatment on her left hip and thigh. Upon the resumption, Williams won seven straight games to comfortably seal the title 6-3 6-0 after 72 minutes of tennis. Let it flow! Serena Williams won her third title of the year at the Italian Open in Rome . Williams started as she meant to go on, with a thumping forehand winner on the opening point, but followed up with a double fault. She held serve and broke her opponent at the first opportunity, opening up a 3-0 lead before Errani got on the board in the next game. A deft net volley demonstrated Williams’ abilities beyond mere power but she reverted to type to save a break point with her third ace as she held for a 4-1 lead. Errani broke back in the seventh game to trail only 4-3 - but Williams immediately responded in kind and, after Errani’s injury time-out, went on to serve out the set. Ruthless: Williams beat Sara Errani 6-3 6-0 after her opponent was struck with injury . Tears for fears: Italian Sara Errani cries after losing to Serena Williams at the Foro Italico . The Italian was clearly limited by the injury to her left thigh as Williams powered through the early games of the second set, breaking twice to lead 3-0. That became four and though Errani was connecting with an occasional big shot, she was having to go for too much and was unable to chase down anything placed far away from her. Williams ruthlessly did so at every opportunity, breaking to 15 to set up the chance to serve for the match and finishing the job with ease. Williams was winning her third WTA Tour title of the season and the 60th of her career. Rather than revel in the moment, though, she paid tribute to her stricken opponent. Speaking mostly in Italian at the on-court presentation, she said: 'I’m really sorry for Sara because she’s played so well all week. I wish her good luck at Roland Garros (in the French Open). 'I’m really happy about today... I’d like to say this next bit in English... I would like to say thank you to my coach Patrick, and Sasha and Esther for keeping my body together and thanks to everybody for today.' Over achiever: Sara Errani admitted she never expected to reach the final of the tournament in her homeland . Errani said: 'I really want to compliment Serena on the way she’s played during the week and she’s certainly one of the best in the world, if not the best in the world. 'It’s crazy for me that I got to the final this year. I never expected to manage to play such good tennis. Thanks to you all. 'I really want to thank my team who have always stood by me. I’m really sorry about today but hopefully next year I’ll do better.'","Serena Williams defeated Sara Errani 6-3 6-0 to win the Italian Open .

"An Indiana teenager has been killed and his father is feared dead after their plane crashed while they were trying to set a record for an around-the-world flight. Family spokeswoman Annie Hayat said Wednesday that the plane flown by 17-year-old Haris Suleman went down shortly after leaving Pago Pago in American Samoa. Suleman and his father, Babar Suleman, were on board. Hayat says the body of Haris Suleman has been recovered but crews are still looking for his father and the plane's wreckage. Scroll down for video . Tragic end: Haris Suleman's plane went down shortly after leaving Pago Pago in American Samoa. Suleman and his father, Babar, were on board, pictured together here . Flight path: The father-son duo were due to complete their journey on Sunday. Pago Pago was their last scheduled stop before Hawaii and their final journey home to Indiana . Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor in Los Angeles said the Hawker Beechcraft plane crashed into the ocean Tuesday night around 6.30pm PDT under unknown circumstances. Haris' sister, Hiba thanked supporters on Facebook and said the family were still waiting for news on her father. 'I'd like to thank everyone for their support of my father and brother throughout this trip, as well as for the support given to my mom, brother and myself as we waited for their safe return,' She wrote. 'Haris and my dad's plane went down upon take off in American Samoa. Haris has been found - he did not make it. My father has not yet been found. Please pray that my dad is found alive and well. Also, hug your siblings and parents - tell them you love them, a hundred times. A thousand times.' Haris’s uncle is an Air Vice Marshal in Pakistan. He confirmed the crash to The Express Tribune. ‘We are very sad. It was the last leg of their trip, a journey of 13-14 hours, Abid Rao said. 'But their plane crashed within two minutes after they took off.’ The two left Indiana on June 19 in the hopes of breaking a world record and raising money for a non-profit organization that builds schools for the poor in Pakistan. They planned to return home Sunday which would have put them five days behind schedule for their aimed time of 30-days but still in the running to set a Guinness World Record for the youngest pilot to complete a circumnavigation in a single engine aircraft. The pair were documenting their journey on social media and the 17-year-old posted a series of tragic tweets hours before his death. 'Pago Pago is without a doubt [in the] top 5 places I've been this summer,' Haris wrote on Tuesday after posting a photo of the island's sunset captioned: 'The beauty of Pago Pago'. The account documented the pair's journey across the globe alongside a blog which included a GPS map tracking their journey. Shared journey: Haris Suleman shared every stage of his journey online including photographs from his plane's window including a shot of his final sunset on Pago Pago, pictured left, and the view of the ocean, pictured right . Prepared: The father and son duo posed for pictures in their emergency gear and were well prepared for the journey - but it sadly wasn't enough to save them from their tragic crash . Charity mission: Haris had been flying with his father since he was eight years old. The pair were hoping to raise money for Pakistan educational charity TCF . Haris had been flying with his father since he was eight years old. The father and son duo spoke to MailOnline before setting off on their journey. 'I am really looking forward to getting going,' the junior at Plainfield High School said. 'I only just got my license but I can’t imagine a better way to spend my summer.' 'He will be the pilot in command,' added Babar. 'I will only take over the controls in an emergency situation. If all goes well, my son will be going back to school for his senior year with some tall tales to tell. 'He has been flying with me since he was 8-years-old. He couldn’t see above the windshield in those days but he would keep the three instruments in line.' Love of flying: Both father and son had a passion for planes and flying with Haris joining Babar on his many journeys . Thankful: Haris' sister took to Facebook to thank supporters for their kind words as she shared the sad news of his death. Here Haris Suleman is seen hugging his mother goodbye before taking off from Greenwood, Indiana, on June 19 . Team: Haris and Babar Suleman were dedicated to raising money for Pakistan charity TCF which helps educate the country's poorest children . The pair were leaving the American Samoa island for Hawaii which was due to be their next stop. Haris' tweets suggest the pair were re-routed as they discovered there was no fuel in their next scheduled stop of Kiritimati, also known as Christmas Island. Instead they were preparing for a long flight path from Pago Pago direct to Hawaii. Rescuers are still searching for Babar's body but fear he will have perished in the impact like his son. He is himself an experienced flyer and survived an emergency landing after his plane developed engine trouble during a flight in 2008. The pair were dedicated to raising money for Pakistan charity the Citizens Foundation. The non-profit raises much needed funds to help educate Pakistan’s poorest of the poor and build schools to teach children living in some of the world’s worst slums. Posing alongside their plane on their GoFundMe page they appealed for support. In a statement the charity said: 'It is with great sadness that we can confirm that a Beechcraft aircraft flown by Babar Suleman and his son Haris, from Plainfield, Indiana, has crashed into the ocean near American Samoa. They were on the final leg of an inspiring journey around the world in 30 days to raise funds for The Citizens Foundation. Their goal was to raise $1 million and two donors had already offered to give enough money to build two schools.' The family are originally from Pakistan but emigrated to America in the eighties, they had visited relatives in the country on their round-the-globe trip. On Sunday the teen was interviewed by the Indianapolis Star and spoke of the moving lessons he had learned from the different cultures the pair had encountered on their journey. Last days: Babar and Haris Suleman shared images of the final stops on their record-breaking attempt before tragedy struck . 'Beauty and culture': The 17-year-old shared photographs on Twitter and his blog during the round the world trip . Favorite stop: Haris wrote about Egypt and said it was his favorite stop on the journey. 'Egypt was the best because of the history', he wrote. 'There is so much beauty and culture in each country that I couldn't possibly witness all that I want to in the span of two days,' he said. 'Egypt was by far the best because of the history,' Suleman said. 'I loved the pyramids and the Sphinx.' Last September, Australian teenager Ryan Campbell, 19, became the youngest person to fly a single-engine aircraft solo around the world, pipping the Guinness World Record set by 21-year-old Jack Wiegand three months earlier. Their journeys took 70 days and 58 days respectively. Haris was in a different category as he was with his father - rather than alone. His young age would have set its own record though as well as the 30 day target the pair were aiming to hit. His school paid tribute to his ambition and 'adventurous spirit' in a statement released to Fox 59. “Plainfield Community School Corporation is deeply saddened to learn of the death of one of our students. Seventeen-year-old Haris Suleman completed his junior year in May and left Plainfield only days later in an attempt to fly around the world with his father. 'Haris’s adventurous spirit and huge heart led him to reaching for this personal goal while also seeking to raise funds and awareness for schools supported by The Citizens Foundation, a non-profit organization headquartered in Karachi, Pakistan. ' 'The loss of Haris is a sobering tragedy for our school community. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to Haris’s family.'","The body of Haris Suleman, 17, has been recovered off Pago Pago .

"Heather Watson is back playing her best tennis and trying to use the memory of Elena Baltacha as an inspiration to maximise her potential. After storming through her final qualifying round of the French Open with a 48-minute 6-1 6-1 victory over Estonia’s Anett Kontaveit yesterday morning Watson reflected on the loss of Baltacha, who was buried last Monday after losing her battle against liver cancer. 'It’s so sad. You don’t really believe it that you’ll never see her again. Her funeral was on my birthday and lots of the girls sent me messages. Laura (Robson) was there, Judy (Murray) was there,' said Watson, who was already in Paris. Focused: Heather Watson has said she is using the memory of Elena Baltacha as inspiration to improve . Sorely missed: Former British number one Baltacha died in May, aged 30, due to liver cancer . Sad day: Baltacha was buried on Monday at St Johns Church in Ipswich, attended by friends and family . 'I’m just using it as motivation that life is short, you don’t know when it’s going to be your last so just make the most of every day. 'Elena was so feisty on the court. I can picture her now saying, ""Come on"". I just can’t believe she’s not here any more.' Aside from that perspective, Watson is grateful that she is in a position to perform properly again, having endured a difficult 2013 which badly stalled her career after being diagnosed with glandular fever in March. Eyes on the prize: Watson beat Estonia¿s Anett Kontaveit to qualify for the first round of the French Open . The contrast with where she was twelve months ago is striking, as she has now won eight matches in a row after taking the Prague Open title a week ago. Her reward for making the main draw is a match against Barbora Zahlavova Strycova of the Czech Republic, the world number 66, while her fellow qualifier James Ward was given a very tough assignment, against seventeenth seed Tommy Robredo of Spain. 'Twelve months ago I really wasn’t enjoying my tennis,' said Watson. 'I wasn’t feeling great. This was my first tournament back and I wasn’t ready. 'I had practised for three weeks after not playing for two and a half months and also I couldn’t do too much fitness because I wasn’t ready for that physically, it went into a downward spiral of not winning matches and losing confidence and I learned a lot from that. On the ball: Watson will face Barbora Zahlavova Strycova in the first round at Roland Garros . 'For example I got injured again this year with my ribs and I really wanted to play Estoril, it’s one of my favourite tournaments of the year because my best friend lives there. 'I thought to myself ""You know what I’m not ready"" and I thought I’d give myself that extra week to come back the next week, because coming back too soon is not the right decision. If I lose one week it will be better than losing months. 'I wasn’t winning much at all and now I’m playing the best tennis of my career and I’m loving it. I’m not getting tired. I’ve played so many matches in a row and I’m  taking nothing for granted. 'I’m just really enjoying, I’m enjoying matches, practice, stretching after and the physio and all of it.' Revitalised: Watson (left) has praised coach Diego Veronelli (right) for her more attacking outlook on the court . Watson has changed her playing philosophy in consultation with her new coach of this year, Argentinian Diego Veronelli, taking on a far more attacking outlook. 'Before, even when I reached my highest ranking I was a kind of counter puncher on important points I’d wait for my opponent to miss or hope for them to miss, now as soon as I see a short ball I want to win the point.'","Heather Watson says she is using the memory of Elena Baltacha as inspiration to maximise her potential .

"Explorer: Harold Lasseter claimed to have found an El Dorado in Australia in 1911 . Explorers are restarting an extraordinary hunt for an Australian El Dorado that a gold-seeker first claimed to have found in 1911 - after using Google Earth to plot where they believe it stands. The men from Tamworth, New South Wales, have made five trips to an area near the border of Western Australia and the Northern Territory, where it was first claimed that a gold reef was found. Harold Bell Lasseter said in 1929 that 18 years ago he had discovered a reef buried under sand hills in the remote Gibson Desert - and received backing from Sydney financiers to find it again. He was deserted by his companions and . camels during the mission and eventually died of exhaustion and . malnutrition - but still found the reef, according to his diary which . was later found. It was . discovered in a cave in the Petermann Ranges, south-west of Alice . Springs, and a series of expeditions in the next few years failed in . their attempts to find the gold, reported The Independent. But . eight decades later there are still faint hopes that the treasure could . still be located - by a team involving friends Jeff Harris and Brendan . Elliott, who have wanted to find it since they were children. They . have been through Mr Lasseter's diary, which includes sketches and . accounts of his last journey, and traced this by matching landmarks with . features on the Google Earth maps software. Gold? Harold Bell Lasseter said in 1929 that 18 years ago he had discovered a reef buried under sand hills in the remote Gibson Desert (pictured) - and received backing from Sydney financiers to find it again . Remembered: Harold Bell Lasseter's grave at the Alice Springs Cemetery in the Northern Territory, Australia. He was deserted by his companions and camels during a mission and died of exhaustion and malnutrition . ‘Every mark he put in his diary, I followed it,’ Mr Harris told The Independent. ‘Every picture in the diary, I matched on Google Earth. I drove my missus nuts once I started working it out. One year later he found what he thought was a huge quartz outcrop. Quartz often suggests that gold is present - and he has since made five trips to the area, convinced he has found the reef. They will go out again in the next few months, and are convinced - despite the doubts of the government, local people and mining companies - that they will find the gold this time. ‘We've not found any gold yet, but we're sure there's gold there,’ he told the newspaper. ‘We've got no backers - it's just me and eight or nine mates.’ Discovery: His diary was discovered in a cave in the Petermann Ranges (pictured) in Australia and a series of expeditions in the next few years failed in their attempts to find the gold . The area where the gold is believed to stand is a four-hour helicopter flight from the Aboriginal community of Warburton, the nearest inhabited area, and is 22 miles off a rough track. Mr Lasseter's son Bob, 88, has travelled to the desert more than 10 times to search for the landmarks identified by his father - and also believes the gold exists. ‘I've found the cave where he sheltered for a month or so, and the sand hill where the camels bolted,’ he told The Independent. ‘I'd like somebody to find it before I die. To me, it's real.’","Men have been five times to area in remote Gibson Desert, Australia .

"A series of disturbing new allegations emerged today that added further weight to claims pro-Russian rebels looted the MH17 crash scene to sabotage the investigation and cash in on the disaster. In the first, desperate relatives revealed how they had called the mobile phones of their loves ones - only for them to be answered by strangers with 'eastern European-sounding voices'. After the initial shock, they immediately called the phone companies to shut down the accounts to prevent them being used, according to reports. Scroll down for video . A man looks at the debris scattered at the crash site of the downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 . The crash site of MH17 in a field near the village of Grabove, in the Donetsk region . Poignant: Belongings lay scattered at the crash site near the village of Grabove as the first bodies from flight MH17 arrived in the Netherlands for identification . New evidence has also emerged that the rebels allegedly planned to sabotage the investigation by contaminating the site with parts from other planes . The claims, made in Holland's De Telegraaf, adds fuel to reports that crucial evidence has been tampered with after the Malaysian Airlines . flight was blown out of the sky, allegedly by the same group of separatists, killing 298 people. New evidence has also emerged that the rebels allegedly planned to sabotage the investigation by contaminating the site with parts from other planes. UK intelligence chiefs claim they have uncovered evidence the insurgents also discussed removing bodies from the area and sending the black box data recorders to Moscow, according to Sky News sources in Whitehall. Alistair Bunkall, Sky's Defence Correspondent, said: 'I think this will play into the fears that many people have that not all of the bodies will be returned, that parts of the plane have been tampered with in order to try and hide any evidence.

'This is all a part of UK intelligence working with intelligence agencies around the world to try and build up a picture not only of what happened at the point of impact, but also what happened in the hours and days that followed on from that.' Meanwhile, an alleged decree by rebel commander Igor Strelkov appears to admit that the bodies of dead passengers were looted by pro-Russian rebels. Evidence of looting? The image appears to show a rebel fighter handling a gold ring amid the wreckage . Hunt for clues? A rebel fighter is filmed rifling through the bag of one of the 298 MH17 crash victims . The order says that jewellery, watches . and other valuables taken from bodies must be handed in to the 'defence . fund' of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic by 8pm on . Wednesday 23 July. Styled like other orders from Strelkov, its veracity could not be immediately established. But . if true, it will be seen as scandalous that the rebels are cashing in . on the dead victims of the Malaysian plane widely believed to have been . shot down by the same pro-Moscow separatists. Rather . than ordering any looted possessions to be returned to the families, it . demands they are taken to Strelkov's headquarters so they can be used . to fund the insurgency campaign he is conducting. Wants jewellery for 'defence fund': An alleged decree by rebel commander Igor Strelkov (centre) appears to admit that the bodies of dead passengers on MH17 were looted by pro-Russian separatists . 'Valuable items must be sent to the DPR Defence Fund': The alleged order (above) is apparently signed by rebel army commander Colonel Igor Strelkov and carries what appears to be an official stamp . The . text of order number 432, pictured here, says in Russian: 'To all . detachments of Donetsk People's Republic army, to soldiers and . commanders who from 18 to 21 July 2014 in the area where the Boeing 777 . of Malaysian airlines crashed and who possess personal belongings . related to this airplane. 'Before . 8 pm on 23 July 2014 you must give these things away to the . headquarters of DPR army. Valuable items (watches, earrings, lockets and . other jewellery) must be sent to the DPR Defence Fund.' It is signed by rebel army commander Colonel Igor Strelkov, and carries what appears to be an official stamp. The alleged order has been posted on social media websites in Ukraine and Russia. If true, it would confirm claims by Kiev officials that the bodies were looted. Children walk past a piece of wreckage from the MH17. Military analysts said the size, spread, shape and number of shrapnel impacts visible all point to a missile system like the SA-11 Buk as previously suspected . Long, sad journey home: Dutch police watch as a plane touches down carrying the bodies of crash victims from Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 at Eindhoven Airport . At least one picture has emerged which appeared to show a ring being taken by a rebel from a body at the crash site. A Ukrainian government advisor Anton Gerashchenko has claimed: 'After terrorists looters stole all the cash, jewellery, mobile phones and credit cards of passengers of ill-fated Boeing - they took up their favourite deal - gathering of scrap metal. Aluminum from which made the plane is expensive.' Two days ago, Andrei Lysenko, spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, claimed: 'The cynicism of these gangsters has no limits. 'According to our information, apart from picking up valuable personal belongings of the passengers, terrorists are using credit cards of the victims.' Contaminating the crime scene: A pro-Russian militant holds up a stuffed animal as others look on at the MH17 crash site which they have been accused of sabotaging in an attempt to hamper the investigation . However, it is unclear that relatives have complained about this, a point the Russian media has made strongly in alleging these are slurs from the Ukrainian side. 'Gerashchenko said in an interview that he had information that the rebels were cashing the victims credit cards. No complaints from relatives or bank records were produced, of course,' said a commentary from RIA Novosti news agency in Moscow. Strelkov is alleged by Kiev to be a serving colonel in Russia's GRU military intelligence. He is accused of fomenting unrest in eastern Ukraine, and was earlier based in Crimea when the Black Sea peninsula was annexed by Russia. His 'order' is revealed on the day when the first bodies are scheduled to arrive back in Holland. Russia 'bears responsibility' for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, U.S. intelligence officials said, but they offered no evidence that Vladimir Putin was directly involved. The senior intelligence officials were cautious in their assessment, noting that while the Russians have been arming separatists in eastern Ukraine, the U.S. had no direct evidence that the missile used to shoot down the passenger jet came from Russia. The plane was probably shot down by an SA-11 surface-to-air missile fired by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, the intelligence officials said. U.S. intelligence chiefs have found no evidence of Vladimir Putin's direct involvement in the shooting down of MH17 but said Russia 'bears responsibility' for the disaster . They also said that after analysing taped phone conversations between separatists obtained by U.S. intelligence it could be all but concluded that the culprits did not realise they were targeting a commercial airliner. 'Five days into it [following the crash] it does appear to be a mistake,' one official said. The officials briefed reporters over intelligence related to last week's air disaster, which killed 298 people. It comes a day after the first pictures emerged of damaged panels from MH17, which appear to show evidence of shrapnel and missile damage. They cited intercepts, satellite photos and social media postings by separatists, some of which have been authenticated by U.S. experts. Separatists previously had shot down 12 Ukrainian military airplanes, the officials said . But the officials said they did not know who fired the missile or whether any Russian operatives were present at the missile launch. They were not certain that the missile crew was trained in Russia, although they described a stepped-up campaign in recent weeks by Russia to arm and train the rebels, which they say has continued even after the downing of the commercial jetliner. In terms of who fired the missile, 'we don't know a name, we don't know a rank and we're not even 100% sure of a nationality,' one official said. White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said the US was still working to determine whether the missile launch had a 'direct link' to Russia, including whether there were Russians on the ground during the attack and the degree to which Russians may have trained the separatists to launch such a strike. 'We do think President Putin and the Russian government bears responsibility for the support they provided to these separatists, the arms they provided to these separatists, the training they provided as well and the general unstable environment in eastern Ukraine,' he said in an interview with CNN. He added that heavy weaponry continues to flow into Ukraine from Russia following the downing of the plane.","Families tell of their shock after hearing strangers' voices on mobile phones .

"A former security guard has been found guilty of killing his ex-wife by stabbing her 84 times then covering her face with a pig mask. A jury in Morris County, New Jersey found Anthony Novellino, 66, guilty of murdering his ex-wife Judith on Wednesday. He faces a minimum of 30 years in prison when he is sentenced next month. 'Now we can have some . closure,' the victim's sister, Deborah Murphy, told the Daily Record after the verdict was announced on Wednesday. 'My sister can rest in peace.' Prosecutors say Novellino attacked his 62-year-old ex-wife, a schoolteacher and librarian, in June 2010 just 11 days after their divorce. Before the split, they had been married for 37 years. Prison: Anthony Novellino (right) was found guilty of killing his ex-wife in July. He has been sentenced to sped the next 50 years in prison . Under the terms of the divorce, Novellino was to keep the home and pay Judith her share. He was also to give her $150,000 from his retirement fund, leading him to refer to her as a 'pig' to neighbors. She was back at the house and packing items to take to her apartment when she was stabbed. Novellino had claimed that his ex-wife had picked a fight with she was in the bathroom and lunged at him with a knife she happened to have in the room. He insisted that he only acted in self-defense and told investigators after he was arrested that he could only remember stabbing her twice. Sick: Prosecutor Maggie Calderwood holds the pig mask found on the face of Judith Novellino after she was stabbed to death by her ex-husband. Neighbors said he had called her a pig . However, an autopsy showed that she had been stabbed 84 times on her neck, face, shoulder, abdomen, breasts and hands. Afterwards, he grabbed a pig mask out of a closet and put it on her face before drinking orange juice and taking some aspirin. He then washed the knife and hid it in a crawlspace. He then gathered clothes, took off his shoes and dumped them as he drove to Washington to meet a woman he'd been speaking to online for several years.

"Criticism: Orson Welles looked down on many actors . Hailed as a genius for films like Citizen Kane and The Third Man, actor and director Orson Welles had a low opinion of many of the stars who were then icons of Hollywood. He branded Charlie Chaplin 'arrogant', Laurence Olivier 'stupid', Spencer Tracey 'hateful', James Stewart 'a bad actor' and 'couldn't stand' looking at Bette Davis. He snubbed the golden couple of Tinsel Town, when Richard Burton tried to introduce his wife Elizabeth Taylor as he had lunch at a restaurant, describing the actor as a 'joke with a celebrity wife.' But he was a big fan of John Wayne, lauding the cowboy legend and described Joseph Cotton, his co-star in The Third Man, as 'brilliant.' Welles' insulting criticisms were made in private conversations that were taped by a friend in 1983. The actor had planned to use them for a biography, but died of a heart attack just days after their last meeting two years later. The tapes lay undiscovered in the garage of his friend and fellow director Henry Jaglom for more almost 30 years. They will be published next month under the title My Lunches with Orson. Film historian Peter Biskind, who has had access to the tapes, told the Observer Welles let 'his hair down' in the intimate interviews in which he reflects on his career and the stars he met. Under fire: Welles described Spencer Tracey as  'hateful' and couldn't stand looking at Bette Davis . Targets: Norma Shearer was 'minimally talented' and Joan Fontaine had 'two expressions and that's it' Biskind said: 'He's not the great . director being interviewed by a starry-eyed journalist. He's speaking to . a friend, and is therefore free to gossip.' Welles had no time for a lot of actresses in the thirties and forties. Joan Fontaine who had 'two expressions, and that's it'. Norma Shearer was 'one of the most minimally talented ladies to appear on the silver screen'. 'I never could stand looking at Bette . Davis, so I don't want to see her act,' he said, also dismissing . Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Jones as 'hopeless'. Criticised: James Stewart 'overacted' in Rear Window with Grace Kelly . But he admired John Wayne who had 'some of the best manners of almost any actor I've ever met in Hollywood'. Welles recalled how he insulted . Richard Burton who approached him in the restaurant, saying: 'Elizabeth . [Taylor] is with me. She so much wants to meet you. Can I bring her . over?' Welles, reported the Observer, replied: 'No. As you can see, I'm in the middle of my lunch.' Jaglom berated Welles for rudeness, saying that Burton 'actually backed away, like a whipped puppy'. Welles responded: 'Burton had great talent. He's ruined his great gifts. He's become a joke with a celebrity wife. Now he just works for money, does the worst shit.' Snubbed: Richard Burton wanted to introduce Elizabeth Taylor to Orson Welles at a restaurant, but he said no . Insulted: Humphrey Bogart was rapped for 'picking fights' and Laurence Olivier was described as 'stupid' Cowboy fan: Orson Welles admired Hollywood legend John Wayne for his manners . He once dated Marilyn Monroe before she was a star - taking her to parties in a bid to promote her career. But he was snubbed by powerful studio boss Darryl F Zanuck. He told Welles: 'She's just another . stock player. We've got a hundred of them.' A few months later, she became Zanuck's golden girl. He criticised Casablanca star Humphrey Bogart for 'picking fights in nightclubs' and referred to Olivier's first two scenes of King Lear on the BBC as 'the worst things I ever saw in my life'. He saved his worst  insults for Spencer Tracy and loathed 'those romantic Katharine Hepburn 'things'. 'He was just a hateful, hateful man.' He said of James Stewart' in Rear Window  with Grace Kelly: 'I'll tell you what is astonishing... to discover that Jimmy Stewart can be a bad actor … even Grace Kelly is better than Jimmy, who's overacting.'","Citizen Kane director reveals what he really thought of the big screen names .

Last night's protest involved eleven . lawmakers as well as Ms Ensler and local actors performing The Vagina .

"One of Britain's oldest pubs has been dropped by a renowned pub guide over claims that it discriminates against tourists and non-regulars. The Blue Bell pub in York has will not be considered for The Good Beer Guide's 2014 edition after staging 'locals only' nights. When hen parties and visitors to the city's horse racing track threaten to take the seats of regulars, the pub has displayed a 'private party' sign on the door. The 215-year-old pub was removed from a list of nominations for the guide by the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), saying that the pub was in breach of its admissions policy. Removed: Jim Hardie, 52, the  landlord of The Blue Bell pub in York, which has been removed from The Good Beer Guide after staging locals-only nights . Having been included in the guide for more than 12 years, Camra's local branch took umbrage to the netrance policy, stating that pubs should be welcoming to all. But the decision has prompted the Edwardian pub's landlord to accuse the group of putting political correctness before the quality of its beer. Chairman of the local Camra branch Matthew Grant refused . to comment, stating that could not discuss entries ahead of . the guide being published in September. But minutes of a branch meeting, seen by local press, refer to incidents where people have been denied entry to the pub. Locals only: The 215-year-old pub was removed from a list of nominations for the guide by the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) after holding 'locals-only' nights . Landlord Jim Hardie said he would rather look after 'real regulars' and that it would prevent 'weirdy beardies' visiting the pub and 'asking to sample seven beers, then buying a half'. Mr Hardie, who has run the pub for 12 years, said: 'I only have a capacity of 60 and if I go over that I will be fined. Yet there are other businesses in the Guide who operate door staff and turn people away.' Regulars: Landlord Jim Hardie said he would rather look after 'real regulars' and that it would prevent 'weirdy beardies' visiting the pub and 'asking to sample seven beers, then buying a half' 'None of the regulars has complained . and the only people moaning are the stag and hen parties who just want . to order 20 pints of lager and throw up in my toilet.' He said that he had visited pubs across the country where 'standards of behaviour are appalling', which he says puts 'decent people off having a quiet drink'. Mr Hardie added: 'As far as I'm concerned it's a well-run pub and I serve good beer so it's up to Camra if they want to chuck me out the Guide. 'I'm still as busy as ever and at the end of the day it's the locals who are the guys who pay the wages.' He said that members of Camra had visited the pub and ripped their membership cards up over the dispute. The pub is included in Camra's national inventory of historic pubs, having remained structurally unchanged inside for more than 100 years. Built in 1798, it was last refurbished in 1903, and has been a regular fixture in the guide, which has been published by Camra for 40 years. Mr Hardie added: 'I hope York Camra is happy with their decision. I will have to take it on the chin. But we are a city centre local with a couple of hundred regulars - though obviously they can't all get in at once. 'We do get nice strangers coming in the pub but on Saturday nights and race days York city centre is a nightmare. 'I have been operating the same way for twelve and a half years and no one has complained but it seems we have a younger committee now with different more politically correct views. No entry: When hen parties and visitors to the city's horse racing track threaten to take the seats of regulars, the pub has displayed a 'private party' sign on the door . 'I thought Camra was all about beer but there has obviously been a policy change.' Following a Camra meeting it was agreed to exclude the Blue Bell and replace it with the 'next pub in the list'. York Camra campaigns officer Steve Golton said: 'That is pretty much correct. But we do not have anything to add. It is a decision we have made.'","The Blue Bell in York will be dropped from The Good Beer Guide .

"When you’re decorating your home, colour inspiration can come from the most unexpected of places. Often, and frustratingly, it comes from something you can’t take home with you, such as stranger’s bag or the colour of a particular car. But a new app for Google Glass could change all that by matching paint with colours from a picture taken using the wearable computer. Scroll down for video... The ColorSnap Glass app send Google Glass photos to a Sherwin Williams' computer server which matches each photo's primary and complementary colours with 1,500 paints . The free app, called ColorSnap Glass, combines Glass' built-in camera with Ohio-based paint group Sherwin Williams' colour recognition technology. It lets users send Google Glass photos to a computer server which matches each photo's primary and complementary colours with 1,500 paints. The swatches are sent back to the user, who can then use the app to locate the nearest Sherwin Williams shop to pick up the paint. The ColorSnap app has already been available for some time on iOS and Android devices, allowing users to take a picture on their smartphone. The swatches found by the app are sent back to the user, who can then use the app to locate the nearest Sherwin Williams shop to pick up the paint . The group is currently gauging consumer interest in ColorSnap Glass ahead of Google Glass’ launch of the technology by 2014. Around 10,000 people throughout the world are currently trying out an early version of Google Glass with most of them selected as part of a contest. Since its unveiling last year, Google Glass has been touted as the ultimate in hands-free technology, yet the device's head gestures, but reviews have been varied. Some users have found the swipe bar and voice commands haven't been as easy to master as many they expected. To solve this problem, Google has released a companion app, called MyGlass, that lets users control the device using an Android smartphone, but that ultimately does away with the hands-free functions.","The app sends Google Glass photos to a Sherwin Williams’ database .

"Manchester United starlet Tyler Blackett believes that being a local lad gives him greater incentive to do well, especially in the derby.

Hopefully, I'll continue to do my best for the club. 'Being a local lad, there's extra pressure but it's something I thrive on. As one of the more local lads, I know what this club means. Don't get me wrong, the foreign players know Manchester United as well but being a local lad gives you extra incentive to do well.

"The sight of City and United players embracing before kick-off in Sunday’s derby may make Roy Keane wince, but ask Angel Di Maria to explain his attitude and it is clear warm hellos do not translate to soft minds. Di Maria is one of five Argentines likely to start at the Etihad and having shared together a World Cup that came agonisingly close to ultimate glory, he believes a few handshakes can be forgiven. ‘When we see each other in the tunnel before games, I think it’s right to say “Hi” and greet each other - whether it’s an ex-team-mate or a good friend,’ reasons United’s record signing. ‘I think that’s normal, as long as you remember that you fight for the club and the shirt once the 90 minutes start. We must all remember there are no friendships out on the pitch.’ Manchester United pair Angel di Maria (left) and Marcos Rojo and Man City defender Pablo Zabaleta (right) The Argentine trio were taking part in an event ahead of the Manchester derby on Sunday an Di Maria insists he will embrace his fellow countrymen in the tunnel before the game but he 'has not friendships on the pitch' Argentina star Angel di Maria (left), who has reinvigorated Manchester United, tries to beat Nemanja Matic .

United: Angel di Maria, Marcos Rojo . BRAZIL (3) City: Fernandinho, Fernando . United: Rafael . ECUADOR (1) United: Antonio Valencia . That last statement is one Keane and all fans in either corner of Manchester can agree upon. ‘We know it’s a very important match for the city of Manchester,’ adds Di Maria. ‘We will be doing our absolute best to make sure the red half is happy at the end of the game.’ Di Maria, 26, should be joined by Marcos Rojo, with Pablo Zabaleta, Sergio Aguero and Martin Demichelis in opposition. They all live in the leafy outskirts of Manchester - Prestbury, Alderley Edge, Hale - but he has yet to go out for a meal with the men he reached the final in Brazil beside. ‘Sure if you do win there will be plenty of stick given out - and banter post match. But the real reason you want to give everything on the field in a game like this is so that your own fans go away happy.’ This is Di Maria’s first derby for his new team but he knows the intensity and fierce pride taken when two sides of a city collide. Rosario Central, his first club, share ferocious battles with Newell’s Old Boys situated little more than four miles away. Di Maria played in two; winning one, losing one. Di Maria puts a young Manchester United fan through his paces during the event in Manchester . And the forward watches as another attempts a few of her best flicks and tricks at the event . Pablo Zabaleta (right) will be a threat for City up and down the flank but must also deal with Di Maria . ‘Derby games can be a nightmare over there,’ he smiles. ‘If you lost it would be a case of not being able to go out - not just for two or three days but two or three games. Everyone would really suffer and didn’t want to show their faces to the fans. I know what it’s like when you have to keep your head down.’ Di Maria’s head should be up after a fine start to his United career following his £59.7million move from Real Madrid. He denies City made any direct attempts to get him. ‘There was never any contact anywhere else,’ he says. ‘The people who came with all the paperwork ready, showing real eagerness to sign me, were United. As soon as I heard of their interest, there was no question of me going anywhere else. I felt from the word go that I was going somewhere where I would be really loved.’ Di Maria is speaking before taking part in a kick-about with local kids as part of a joint initiative between the two clubs and the Premier League. Zabaleta is here also, and will probably be the defender tasked with shackling his compatriot come Sunday. ‘You need the perfect day to stop players like him,’ says Zabaleta. ‘I will try to play as good as I can. He’s quick and has a great technique. The Argentine then showed off a few of his best moves as the lucky youngsters stood back and admired . Brazilian midfielder Fernandinho is likely to partner Yaya Toure in midfield for Manchester City . ‘We’ve known each for many years. I was so happy when he signed for United because it was something good for him, he was really excited to come here and play in the Premier League. ‘He texted me when he was looking to move to Manchester to ask about the city, so I can help with some information.’ He believes had Di Maria recovered from his thigh injury in time for the World Cup final against Germany victory might have been found. ‘It would have made a big difference. They defended very solidly, very tight, and narrow. We needed quick players to play in counter-attack. Angel is one of those players who never stops running, never stops going forward, attacking the space. He’s just unbelievable.’ Zabaleta joke she may need to open an Argentine steakhouse to cater to the growing contingent but knows it is local pride as well as hard points at stake on Sunday. ‘It is the best team we can have now at the moment,’ he says. ‘It is a special game. It is the game everyone is looking at and waiting for.’ First-team players from both Manchester clubs were on hand to take part in a Premier League Kicks session between City in the Community and the Manchester United Foundation.","Manchester City host Manchester United in derby at Etihad on Sunday .

"When Sir Alex Ferguson retired last May he called for evolution rather than revolution as Manchester United moved forward under David Moyes. Louis van Gaal, however, has taken a different approach. Having succeeded Moyes, the Dutchman said he would give the players he inherited a chance to impress. Evidently, he didn't fancy what he saw and quickly began putting his own stamp on the squad. Gone are the likes of Shinji Kagawa, Danny Welbeck, Patrice Evra and Rio Ferdinand as Van Gaal showed 12 players the Old Trafford door, another seven left on loan and Ryan Giggs called time on his glittering career. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Rio Ferdinand (left) and David Moyes (right) have both left Manchester United since last season's first derby .

Wayne Rooney is yellow carded in Manchester United's 4-1 defeat at Manchester City last season . Sergio Aguero (second right) scores City's first goal in their 4-1 win last September . In their place has come a cavalry costing £150million - the Dutchman's 'Gaalacticos'. The startling change of pace at Old Trafford can be measured by the fact that only five of Moyes' players from last season's derby at the Etihad are likely to start again on Sunday. David de Gea, Chris Smalling, Michael Carrick, Marouane Fellaini and Wayne Rooney were part of the team that were humbled 4-1 in 2013 as Moyes' reign quickly unravelled. They will be hoping that the likes of Daley Blind, Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo will provide the necessary quality to bridge the gap that has developed between the two rivals in the last year. United's team may be even more unrecognisable come kick-off on Sunday if Van Gaal opts to start his other two new signings, Ander Herrera and Radamel Falcao, who are both returning to full fitness after injury. Adnan Januzaj and Juan Mata both started against Chelsea last week and could further alter United's team. Whoever starts at the Etihad, they will line up in a completely different system than under Moyes. Last season's derby team (left) and the expected line-up on Sunday (right). Only five players (in yellow) survive . Louis van Gaal let 19 players go over the summer and has transformed his United team . Analysts Bloomberg Sports predict that a Man City win is the most likely outcome against Man United . The 4-4-1-1 and 4-2-3-1 formations (and their variations) favoured by Moyes and Ferguson seem a distant memory as Van Gaal has lurched from an unsuccessful experiment with 3-5-2 to a free-flowing 4-4-2 diamond formation. Van Gaal has not been afraid to stick to his principles - even if they go against the traditions of United - and this cannot always have been said of Moyes. Part of the reason Moyes struggled was the fact he was caught between his style and United's style, which left the players unsure of their roles. Angel di Maria (left) and Marcos Rojo (right) will be two of the new faces on display for United on Sunday . Luke Shaw (right) will be another player experiencing his first Manchester derby on Sunday . As Ferdinand writes in his autobiography: 'Moyes’s innovations mostly led to negativity and confusion. Sometimes our main tactic was the long, high, diagonal cross. It was embarrassing. 'Other times Moyes wanted lots of passing. He’d say: ""Today I want us to have 600 passes in the game. Last week it was only 400"". Who cares? I’d rather score five goals from 10 passes.' What we can be sure of is that United's players will walk onto the Etihad pitch and know precisely what is expected of them. The players will be different and the style will be different, but will the end result be different, too?

"Arsenal have been handed a major boost with the news that Olivier Giroud will return to full training next month. Manager Arsene Wenger  revealed on Friday that the striker is three weeks ahead of schedule in his return from an ankle injury that has kept him sidelined since August 23. Giroud wasn't expected back until mid-December, but he may now be fit for first-team action as early as November 29, when Arsenal visit West Brom. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger discuss Giroud and Theo Walcott's injury . Olivier Giroud looks set to return to training at Arsenal after the international break . Giroud picked up an ankle injury against Everton back in August and has missed the start of the season . 'Olivier is coming along very well. He's three weeks ahead of schedule and I think he will join in normal training after the international break,' said Wenger. 'Of course, it's a big boost. He's miles ahead of schedule.' Danny Welbeck and Alexis Sanchez have carried Arsenal's goalscoring burden in Giroud's absence. The Chilean, in particular, has been in lethal form for the Gunners. And Wenger  heaped praise on his summer signing from Barcelona, saying the South American's fighting qualities have ensured he's hit the ground running during his first season in English football. He also compared the forward to one of his former transfer targets, Luis Suarez. Jack Wilshere faces a late fitness test on Saturday could be out for Arsenal's game with Burnley . Kieran Gibbs faces a late fitness test ahead of Arsenal's game with Burnley . 'There are similarities, Suarez sometimes gives the ball to the opponent but he gets it back straightaway,' said Wenger. 'Sanchez is the same, there is no time between offence and defence. They are very quick as well. 'If you look across Europe, South America is the only continent that develops strikers. We have to question ourselves, what can we add to our academies to develop strikers again? 'They both played street football with friends. In street football when you are 10, you play with 15-year-olds so you have to be shrewd. You have to show that you are good, you have to fight, win impossible balls. 'When it is all a bit more formulated then you develop less your individual skill, your fighting attitude. We have lost that a little bit in football.' Sanchez will be aiming to add to his impressive season tally of eight goals against Burnley today. Wenger is set to rest Aaron Ramsey, who still doesn't feel 100 per cent after a hamstring problem. Victory against the Clarets could cut the deficit to league leaders Chelsea to six points. But while Wenger admits chasing down Jose Mourinho's side will be an uphill challenge, he insists his side are up to the task. Theo Walcott is making progress in his return from injury but will not play against Burnley . 'I won't write us off, let other people do that,' said the Frenchman. 'It is a little bit linked with mathematics. It doesn't consider who we played, how many times we played away, what is the quality of the team we played against, which missing players we had in the big games. That is absolutely normal but I have a strong belief we will come back and we can prove that on the pitch. 'Chelsea are in a strong position at the moment. I believe it would not be realistic to think that we'll catch Chelsea very quickly. 'We have to get consistent results to get a chance to come back. Personally, I'm more focused on the quality of our games and on the consistency of our results, before we think about coming back on Chelsea.'","Olivier Giroud has been out with an ankle injury since August .

"Norwich boss Neil Adams saluted two-goal star Cameron Jerome as his side ended their long wait for a home league win. Jerome took his tally to nine since joining from Stoke soon after the start of the season as the Canaries banked all three points at Carrow Road for the first time since mid-August. But early-season leaders Norwich, who had failed to win any of their previous five games, were unable to score the third goal that would have taken them back to the top of the table. Cameron Jerome celebrates after giving Norwich City the lead against Bolton Wanderers on Friday . The striker slotted past the Bolton goalkeeper after being played clear by midfielder Jonny Howson .

Norwich City: Ruddy, Whittaker, Martin, Turner, Olsson, O'Neil (Johnson 73), Tettey, Redmond, Howson, Lafferty, Jerome (Grabban 73). Subs not used: Cuellar, Hooper, Miquel, Murphy, Rudd. Goals: Jerome (12, 61). Booking: O'Neil (38). Bolton Wanderers: Lonergan, Threlkeld, Mills, Dervite, Ream, M Davies, Dannes, Pratley (C Davies 84), Spearing (Trotter 46), Lee Chung-yong, Beckford (Clayton 65). Subs not used: Moxey, Mason, Kenny, Vela. Goal: Lee (86). Bookings: M Davies (68), Ream (82). Referee: Graham Scott. Attendance: 26,070. That they failed was down to Bolton keeper Andy Lonergan's heroic second-half display. Adams said: 'When I had the chance to sign Cameron it was a no-brainer. He ticked all the boxes. 'It's not just his pace and power. There's his hard work, his drive and his willingness. 'At half-time he was sitting on the treatment table with blood pouring out of a knee wound but there was no way he was going to come off.' Jerome opened the scoring in the 12th minute when he nodded down to Jonny Howson then raced on to the midfielder's pass to stab the ball beyond Lonergan. He leapt above Dorian Dervite just past the hour mark to head a second from a corner by experienced star Gary O'Neil, making his first league start. Norwich would be sitting in pole position in the Championship but for a trio of stunning save from Lonergan. England Under-21 winger Nathan Redmond played a one-two with Kyle Lafferty before unleashing a drive that the keeper pushed on to the far post. Then Lonergan made two tremendous saves to keep out efforts by Steven Whittaker and substitute Lewis Grabban. Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy celebrates enthusiastically after Jerome puts the home side ahead . Bolton manager Neil Lennon looks on concerned during his side's defeat at Carrow Road on Friday . South Korean star Chung-Yong Lee took advantage of Martin Olsson's mistake to pull one back for the visitors near the end. But Bolton boss Neil Lennon admitted: 'Norwich deserved to win. They were the better side and we didn't do enough. 'The players have to learn quickly. We need more from them if we are going to compete at this level.'

"Angel di Maria showed he knows where the goal is as he took part in United's training session on Friday prior to this weekend's clash against neighbours City. The club's record £60million summer signing was spotted resting against a small-sided goal during boss Louis van Gaal's session at the Red Devils' Aon Training Complex. Di Maria was joined by Robin van Persie and the  duo of Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick - who have been absent from the first-team picture through suspension and injury.

Di Maria was joined at training by Juan Mata, Michael Carrick, Wayne Rooney, Ander Herrera and Robin van Persie (left to right) Rooney is looking to win a place back in Louis van Gaal's starting XI on Sunday after serving a three-game suspension in the league . United boss Van Gaal was all smiles during the session as he embarks on his first Manchester derby on Sunday . Carrick (centre) is in contention to play his first game of the season for United after recovering from an ankle injury . Club captain Rooney looked in a particular determined mood as he aims to fire United to victory against their bitter rivals following a three-match ban for kicking out at West Ham's Stewart Downing during September's Premier League encounter. The 29-year-old has scored more Manchester derby goals than anyone else, having found the net 11 times in 22 appearances so far. The Etihad is a particularly happy hunting ground for the England striker with seven of his derby goals coming there – including his last five. Former United great Andrew Cole expects Rooney to take out his pent-up frustration on Manuel Pellegrini's side after missing the last three league matches. The return of Rooney (left) to the starting line-up is likely to mean midfielder Mata will be dropped to the bench against City . 'He has got to be raring to go,' Cole said. 'He is a professional footballer. When you miss games through injury or illness or suspension, you are going to be disappointed. 'I have no doubt he will be chomping at the bit now and ready to go having missed three games. 'It's going to be a massive boost to have a player of his quality back. Hopefully we can go to Man City and get a positive result.' Rooney's experience of Manchester derbies will be vital in helping the club's new faces know what awaits them at the Etihad. Rafael (left) will be hoping to earn the praise of Van Gaal after being criticised for his defending in their recent fixtures . Van Gaal, who is also facing City for the first time, could field up to six players who have not played in a Manchester skirmish before. But Cole is sure the likes of Di Maria, Radamel Falcao and Ander Herrera will not freeze under pressure against a City team that will be itching to take all the points following a three-match winless streak. 'They are professional footballers. They have nothing to be scared of,' added Cole, who also spent a year at City before he retired. 'They are playing in front of 70,000 every other weekend and those players have played in big games like European matches and internationals before. 'They will not be thinking, ""I am going to be worried about playing in the Manchester derby."" They will appreciate it.'

"CLICK HERE for all the stats from the Cherries' Capital One Cup win over the Baggies on Tuesday night . It's what you might term an upset, though you suspect Alan Irvine can’t have been too devastated. Not when he made 10 changes to the side he fielded in his most recent Barclays Premier League fixture. A cheer for the plucky underdog, then? Not quite. Bournemouth made the same number of changes. What a strange state of affairs, when a last-16 cup tie can’t draw full enthusiasm from either club. More so when each manager would have been entitled to believe they had a good shot at a quarter-final place. That fate ultimately belongs to Bournemouth, who have reached the last eight of the Capital One Cup for the first time in their history. Bournemouth's Eunan O'Kane celebrates scoring the opening goal against West Bromwich-Albion in the Capital One Cup . Irishman O'Kane side foots his shot into the back of the net to give his Championship side the lead against their top flight opponents . BOURNEMOUTH (4-4-2): Camp 6.5; Smith 6, Elphick 6.5, Cargill 6, Harte 6; Stanislas 6.5, O’Kane 7.5, Gosling 6, Fraser 6.5 (Francis 77min, 6); Kermorgant 6 (Macdonald 88), Rantie 7 (Wilson 70, 7). Subs not used: Flahavan, Daniels, Pitman, Richie. Booked: Harte, O’Kane. WEST BROM (4-3-1-2): Myhill 6.5; Gamboa 6.5, Dawson 5.5, McAuley 6, Davidson 6; Mulumbu 6.5, Baird 5.5, O’Neil 5.5 . (Sessegnon 63, 5.5); Blanco 6 (Berahino 75); Anichebe 5.5, Ideye 5.5 (Samaras 55, 5.5). Subs not used: Foster, Wisdom, Gardner, Roofe. Booked: Dawson, Mulumbu. Man of the match: Eunan O’Kane. Referee: Paul Tierney 6.5. The manner of the finale was suitably dramatic. Eunan O’Kane had seemingly done enough to put Bournemouth through with a strike early in the second half, only for Georgios Samaras to level with a shot that deflected heavily off Tommy Elphick. That appeared to be that for a side that has achieved so much in recent years, but then it got a little sweeter when, within seconds of the restart, substitute Callum Wilson scored the winner. What drama. It might even make this competition attractive to Bournemouth. Of course, it will need to be balanced against those priorities in the Championship, in which they are currently sitting an impressive fourth after a scarcely believable 8-0 win away at Birmingham at the weekend. Eddie Howe only retained Tommy Elphick from that team; Irvine kept Craig Dawson from the 11 who started in the draw against Crystal Palace. As it transpired, the opportunity of game time brought decent performances from players of both sides. Within two minutes, Yann Kermorgant lashed a shot from distance that Boaz Myhill saved and moments later Craig Dawson was forced to haul down Tokelo Rantie to prevent a breakaway. The fact Youssouf Mulumbu committed a similar offence later in the half said plenty about Rantie’s pace on the counter, which was evidently Bournemouth’s main ploy. At the other end, West Brom threatened without looking dangerous. Scoring hasn’ t been a problem for them in the Premier League – a tally of 12 that stands up to scrutiny against their rivals in the bottom half - but for a time here they looked ponderous. West Brom's Sebastian Blanco (right) beats  Dan Gosling during their fourth round clash at Goldsands Stadium on Tuesday . Substitute Giorgios Samaras doesn't celebrate after his cross leads to an own goal equaliser for West Brom . Tommy Elphick was unlucky to have crept Samaras's cross past Cherries keeper Lee Camp . Nothing too blatant at set-pieces. C . raig Dawson and Gareth McAuley were both happy to get close at corners for West Brom, but nothing especially untoward. When Christian Gamboa crossed from the right, Liam O’Neil slipped his marker but barely connected with his header. Victor Anichebe also played in Brown Ideye, but the £10million striker shot straight at Lee Camp. They started the second half with a shade more incision, Sebastian Blanco sidestepping a challenge and dipping a shot narrowly over the bar from the edge of the area. But by the 49th minute they were behind. Considering they came into the fixture with a single away win this season and only one draw, perhaps it should not have been a surprise. Junior Stanislas made the goal, surging at a backline that kept on retreating. He reached the edge of the area unchallenged and slipped a pass left to O’Kane, who shot across Myhill and inside the far post. Ryan Fraser then came close to making it 2-0. The winger’s pace caused West Brom problems most of the night but his finishing let him down when Adam Smith found space on the right and drilled a low cross towards the penalty spot. Fraser controlled with his back to goal, but in shooting on the turn miscued horribly. Samaras levelled after 85 minutes with a heavily deflected shot from the left, but substitute Wilson hit the winner seconds later. Howe threw his hands in the air. He has overseen a special time at Bournemouth. He took the club into the Championship in his first season at the club and consolidated their status by finishing 10th in the last campaign. At the weekend, they obliterated Birmingham and sit in the play-off places. Now they are in a hat with only seven other numbers. Not bad for a second string from the second tier. The Cherries hit back straight away though through Callum Wilson for his 11th goal of the season .

"Celtic hat-trick hero John Guidetti insists he would relish an Old Firm meeting with Rangers in the League Cup semi-finals. The on-loan Swede took his scoring streak to eight in as many games with two virtuoso free-kicks and a penalty in a 6-0 thrashing of 10-man Partick Thistle on Wednesday night. Stuart Bannigan’s red card for a reckless challenge on the Swede before half-time teed up a second half procession for the champions. Manchester City loanee John Guidetti netted three goals against fellow Premiership side Partick Thistle . Guidetti grabbed his third from the penalty spot after the Swedish striker was fouled by Abdul Osman . Hat-trick hero Guidetti is congratulated by Celtic team-mate Emilo Izaguirre during the match at Celtic Park . Celtic (4-2-3-1): Gordon; Izaguirre, van Dijk, Denayer, Lustig; Brown, Mulgrew; McGregor (Wakaso 45), Johansen, Stokes (Griffiths 58); Guidetti (Scepovic 63).

Subs: Gallacher, Doolan, Stevenson, Frans, Carroll, Wilson. Referee: Kevin Glancy . Star man: John Guidetti . Looking forward to Saturday evening’s semi-final draw, Guidetti admitted he used to get up early in Sweden to watch Glasgow derbies on television. Now he wants to sample one for himself. ‘It was fantastic watching those games,’ he said. ‘It’s very spicy. You can see it means a lot and the atmosphere is always amazing – you can even hear it through the television. ‘It is an amazing football match, we all know this. ‘But we need to stay focused because there are four teams left – not just two. ‘We know Hampden Park is going to be an amazing atmosphere whoever we play because Celtic fans always do amazing atmospheres no matter who it is.’ Asked if other players had told him what to expect of facing Rangers, Guidetti insisted: ‘No. I know. ‘As a football player, you know. It is special. I played in the game in Holland, Feyenoord against Ajax. ‘I have probably not played anything like it before because in Holland away fans are not allowed to travel for security reasons. ‘If you play away it’s only their fans and if you play home, it’s only your fans. ‘It would be a fantastic game to be a part of but come Hampden in the semi-final the 11 people standing opposite us are going down. This is how we feel every time we play. We want to win every game.’ Stuart Bannigan (left) was shown a red card after a challenge on Celtic's Guidetti (far left) Guidetti is challenged by Bannigan who later receives a red card from referee Kevin Glancy . Rangers manager Ally McCoist admitted in the wake of his side’s win over St Johnstone that he wanted to avoid his city rivals in the semi-finals, but Guidetti responded: ‘It’s up to the Rangers manager how he feels about playing us. We try to work hard every single training day and improve. We try to get better and listen to what the gaffer has to say. ‘We want to win every game and this Cup. I’m like that with everything - if I play monopoly or cards I want to win. We’ll be up for the semi-final, we’ll be hungry and want to win. ‘I am excited in every game I play for Celtic because it’s an honour to pull the shirt on. There are four good teams left in the Cup and this club deserves trophies so hopefully we can do it.’ English scouts were watching £5million-rated Guidetti although Celtic boss Ronny Deila wants to tie up a permanent deal for the player after he left the pitch to a standing ovation. Guidetti ducked questions on his future, with Celtic now under pressure to keep him from a fanbase crying out for a new hero. ‘I just try to focus on every game because if I start thinking ahead it’s easy to stop performing and maybe then they won’t want me to stay,’ he said. ‘It’s about performing, doing well. Celtic made light work of their quarter-final against Partick Thistle thanks to star striker Guidetti . Substitute Leigh Griffiths hit two second half goals after coming on in the 58th minute . ‘I try to take one game at a time and now I am thinking about Saturday. ‘The grass is not always greener so you don’t have to think about the future, only Saturday. ‘I want to give 100 per cent every game for Celtic. ‘When my agent comes to me and says: “Okay John, this is what’s going to happen” then I listen. ‘I have full trust in the people working with me and the people that help me. That leaves me to do my absolute best just to perform on the pitch. ‘I just want to focus and we’ll see what happens when it happens. ‘I don’t want to speculate. I can’t think: “Oh, in five years I’ll be Real Madrid No 10”. ‘This is not real life.

"Former Newcastle midfielder Lee Bowyer has put his infamous on-field clash with team-mate Kieron Dyer down to a 'moment of madness'. The pair were sent off for fighting each other during the Magpies' 3-0 home defeat by Aston Villa on April 2, 2005, and were later made to issue a shamefaced apology by then manager Graeme Souness.

"Only 18 months ago, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund faced each other in the Champions League Final. On Saturday, they clash again – but in very different circumstances. Bayern have lost none of their superpower aura since winning the treble in 2013. On the contrary, under Pep Guardiola, they are developing into an even more formidable force. One humiliation at the hands of Real Madrid aside, Bayern undoubtedly remain one of the dominant forces in European football. In Dortmund, nothing could be further from the truth. Jurgen Klopp's team languish in 15th place in the Bundesliga, with only seven points from their first nine games. More significantly, Dortmund's defence is in tatters: shapeless, error prone and lacking in confidence. At the moment, Klopp's side panic whenever they endure a set back. The fear of defeat appears to weigh over them. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Battle of the Giants: Bayern vs Dortmund preview . League leaders Bayern Munich host Borussia Dortmund on Saturday as they look to extend their unbeaten run . Borussia Dortmund lie 15th in Bundesliga with seven points from nine games after a poor start to the season . Arjen Robben (right) scored the winner as Bayern defeated Dortmund 2-1 in the 2013 Champions League final . Things have not been helped by the fact that the likes of Marco Reus, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Ilkay Gundogan have only just returned from injury, but the problems are as much psychological as anything. As Jurgen Klopp put it two weeks ago: 'we need to be more clinical in front of their goal, and have more concentration in front of ours'. Those two factors remain the two most important ones. Dortmund are pressing well as usual, and with Reus back in the side, are now playing with a renewed pace. Yet they still lack coherence at the back, perhaps due to the long term injuries to Neven Subotic, Lukasz Piszczek and Mats Hummels last season. The defence is a familiar one, but it lacks playing time together, and the communication still needs work. Up front, new strikers Ciro Immobile and Adrian Ramos have shown promise, but they are struggling to fill the gap left by Robert Lewandowski. Once again, communication is an issue, and many have questioned whether Immobile in particular fits the Klopp system. As a classical, penalty box striker, it is unclear how well he can keep up with the fluidity of Dortmund's attacks. Dortmund's Ciro Immobile (left) has failed to fill the void left by Robert Lewandowski (right) who joined Bayern . Dortmund wore their Champions League kit to break their Bundesliga 'hoodoo' but still lost 1-0 to Hannover . Their woes have been eased somewhat by a fine run of form in the Champions League and a solid 3-0 defeat of St. Pauli in the German Cup this week. But as local paper WAZ put it, 'Dortmund still need to improve'. They have tried almost everything. The players even decided to wear their special Champions League shirts in last weekend's game against Hannover, in a superstitious bid to produce a win. It didn't work. Dortmund lost 1-0 at home despite dominating the game, and their miserable league run continued. Bayern, on the other hand, are scoring goals for fun. They have scored 20 goals in their last four games, and one of those was a 0-0 draw. Arjen Robben is set to return from injury against Dortmund, while Franck Ribery made his first start for Bayern this season against Hamburg in midweek. Dortmund go into Saturday's clash against Bayern off the back of a 3-0 win vs St. Pauli in the German Cup . Despite their poor form, Dortmund did beat Bayern 2-0 in the German Supercup at the start of the season . The Reds, though, remain cautious in the build up to the Dortmund game. Pep Guardiola is famously a huge admirer of Dortmund's pacy, counter attacking football, while various figures in Munich have warned against complacency. 'This Dortmund team is always going to be dangerous,' said Thomas Muller this week, 'we're not going to be 5-0 up at half time. We have to be ruthless. Both teams know each other well, and we've had a lot of tight games in recent times.' Jurgen Klopp has already opined this season that his system tends to work better against more open, attacking teams. With a bit more space, Dortmund can utilise their counter attacks more effectively, as they did when they beat Bayern 2-0 in the German Supercup two months ago. Bayern will be boosted by the return of Franck Ribery (left) who made his first start of the season in midweek . Bayern winger Arjen Robben (left) is set to return from injury for Saturday's clash at the Allianz Arena too . That might go some way to explaining their differing form in the Champions League and the Bundesliga. Domestically, they have been overcome almost exclusively by inferior teams who set up to defend, while in Europe they have come up against better, more attacking sides such as Arsenal. Despite now being at opposite ends of the table, the rivalry between the two clubs remains as strong as ever – largely as a result of off field issues. Having already snapped up Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski from their rivals, Bayern are now flirting with the idea of poaching Marco Reus. Though no official move has yet been made for the player, Dortmund have been infuriated by repeated statements of interest from the Bayern board. A victory against their fierce rivals on Saturday could turn Dortmund's season around, particularly if they follow it up with a win against second place Borussia Monchengladbach the following week. Another two defeats, however, and Klopp's side could find themselves in the relegation zone.

"Roberto Martinez is planning for another season with Samuel Eto’o as the striker edges towards triggering the clause that will extend his stay with Everton. Eto’o, 33, signed a 12-month contract when he joined in August, with the option of another year included in the terms. He is, however, guaranteed that extra season if he starts 15 times and is currently on five, with four appearances from the bench. The striker, who was outstanding in last Sunday’s 3-1 win at Burnley, was considered by Liverpool and West Ham but Everton believe they were always his first choice, as he turned down Champions League football with Ajax, as well as lucrative offers from the Middle East. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roberto Martinez call Samuel Eto'o a gift from the gods . Everton manager Roberto Martinez has said the signing of Samuel Eto'o is a 'gift from the footballing gods' Samuel Eto'o's stunning curled effort ensured Everton's three points late on as the Toffees beat Burnley . Since arriving at Goodison Park, Eto’o - a three-time Champions League winner - has made a strong impression with his attitude and so Everton’s manager believes it will be a case of ‘when’ not ‘if’ he gets to 15 starts. ‘It’s just natural he will get another year,’ said Martinez. ‘The option for a second year is based on number of starts, so it will come automatically. All I want is for him to enjoy his football and convey the winning mentality he has to the rest of the team. 'I always thought his period at Everton would be a minimum of two years, because the option reflects that. ‘He could trigger the clause very soon, the way he’s playing. But the clause is not in my mind, his mind. Eto'o is a phenomenal example for Everton's youngsters, including Ross Barkley (left), according to Martinez . Samuel Eto'o worked his socks off in Everton’s win at Turf Moor. Far from his more familiar role as a target man, he played as an attacking midfielder in support of Romelu Lukaku. He moved across the width of the pitch, as the heat map of his main areas of activity shows (below). And he put in a shift in his own box for corners too. Not too shabby for a 33-year-old. ‘He could have chosen any league in the world. He chose Everton because he wants to be successful.’ Liverpool had lined up a medical for Eto’o, only to turn their attentions to Mario Balotelli. Martinez, though, insists Everton made their approach for Eto’o before then. ‘It doesn’t matter,’ said Martinez. ‘He’s here and I see him as a gift from the footballing gods, and I am happy for him to enjoy it.’ Everton, meanwhile, have posted the best financial results in the club’s history. The 2013-14 campaign saw turnover increase by 39 per cent to £120.5million, the first time Everton have gone through the £100m mark. It enabled them to achieve a record profit of £28.2m. Martinez is thrilled with his attacking options and Eto'o could retain his place for the visit of Swansea .","Samuel Eto'o scored twice in Everton's victory over Burnley on Sunday .

"The clocks went back last weekend – and how times have changed in the North East. British Summer Time was a dark place for Newcastle manager Alan Pardew. Only now, as the nights cut in, has the gloom lifted. In fact, it’s as if the sun is beating down upon the once beleaguered boss. But for opposite number Gus Poyet at Sunderland, with autumn has come the fall. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew is pleased with his side's recent revival, going unbeaten in October . Newcastle celebrate as the Magpies beat Manchester City 2-0 in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday . Earlier this month, the pre-match conferences of the two managers clashed. Just one national journalist ventured to the Academy of Light to deliver a few easy, overarm questions to Poyet. Not that the Uruguayan was complaining. Sunderland weren’t the story, they were ticking along quietly, picking up enough singles to keep them off the back pages. Meanwhile, 16 miles up the road on North Tyneside, Pardew – on a decidedly stickier wicket - was batting away bouncers, pace, swing and spin. He was the story, odds-on favourite to be the next top-flight manager headed for the pavilion. Sunderland boss Gus Poyet shows his frustrations on the touchline as his side lost 2-0 to Arsenal on Saturday . But then, against Leicester and again at Spurs, his team smashed successive boundaries. Then, at Manchester City in the League Cup, they knocked everyone for six with a shock 2-0 victory. Meanwhile, at the Stadium of Light, Poyet has been on the back foot, the 8-0 humiliation at Southampton followed by an error-ridden 2-0 defeat at home to Arsenal. The temptation to ring fence the South Coast collapse as a one-off is proving, well, less tempting. At their worst this season, Sunderland and Newcastle have borne the same harrowing hallmarks; jagged in defence – to the point of self-harm – and blunt in attack. Sunderland's Vito Mannone - who made errors in the defeats to Arsenal and Southampton - could be dropped . But it is on Wearside where those sorry symptoms look set to linger. Poyet continues to talk in riddles – is he happy with the strength and depth of his squad or isn’t he? You’d have to side with the latter. The players – as shown during the closing stages of last season – are not incapable. You have to worry, however, that it took the threat of relegation – and a drop in wages and status – to snap them from their slumber. Nine new signings have yet to shine, either. Only Patrick van Aanholt is holding down a regular starting place, but he has no competition at left back. Moussa Sissoko celebrates scoring for Newcastle as Pardew's side defeated Manchester City at the Etihad . VIDEO Pardew proud of youngsters . Yes, Jack Rodwell is putting himself about and snapping through challenges – often running the risk of red – but the £10million midfielder wasn’t bought as an enforcer - there has been precious little evidence of the silk which made him so easy on the eye as a teenager. Likewise, though, at Newcastle, where it has been those already in residence at St James’ who have earned Pardew his reprieve – Papiss Cisse, Gabriel Obertan, Sammy Ameobi, Steven Taylor, Fabricio Coloccini, Moussa Sissoko and Tim Krul the men making the difference of late. It would, of course, be folly to determine that the recent reversal in fortune will not swing again in the coming weeks. Sunderland players look dejected as they fell to a 8-0 humiliation at Southampton earlier this month . But Poyet is the story right now and the Stadium of Light feels like a cool and shaded place. On Monday night, at Crystal Palace, he faces trial by television, just like Pardew did at Stoke last month, and that 1-0 defeat made for uncomfortable viewing. It certainly promises to be a testing time for Poyet – how he wishes he could wind back the clock.","Newcastle have gone unbeaten in October with three wins and a draw .

"Dinamo Bucharest midfielder Stefan Barboianu played in his side's derby against bitter rivals Steaua despite losing his son just hours before. The 26-year-old Dinamo vice-captain was informed on Friday that his three-day old infant son, who was born more than three months premature, had died in hospital following complications. Barboianu, capped 18 times by the Romanian under-21 team, told Dinamo coach Flavius Stoican prior to the 157th Eternal Derby that he was prepared to play despite his personal tragedy. Stefan Barboianu, pictured here playing for FC Astra Giurgiu, was praised by the Romanian media . Stoican said it was an inappropriate time to discuss Barboianu's situation. 'I don't want to comment on Barboianu's family, it's not easy,' Stoican told reporters. 'I have great confidence in him.' Romanian media outlets were full of praise for the courageous Barboianu. 'A true professional and a character,' wrote digisport.ro with fans using internet forums and social media to offer their condolences. On the field, goals from Lukasz Szukala, Paul Papp and Claudiu Keseru gave the 1986 European Cup winners Steaua a well-deserved 3-0 win in a cracking atmosphere at the National Arena.

"It was a good question but it was hard to suppress a snort of derision: did Sebastian Vettel feel he had a moral obligation to take part in qualifying here for the US Grand Prix? The context is that Formula One’s endlessly arcane rules mean that taking a sixth engine of the season — one more than the rules allow — would condemn him to start at the back of the grid, rendering his qualifying session pointless before he turns a wheel in competition. So Vettel, the winner of last year’s race, who is facing that possibility, could sit out Saturday’s action or merely put in one lap to do what is necessary — it is called qualifying for a reason — to race on Sunday. Sebastian Vettel (left) says it will be a big shame if he has to miss qualifying on Saturday for the US Grand Prix . Vettel was in Texas city during previews ahead of the US Grand Prix on Wednesday . If so, fans at the undulating Circuit of the Americas here in Texas are entitled to feel short-changed when they are paying between £385 and £745 for main grandstand tickets. More so given that Caterham and Marussia, the two backmarkers who are in administration, will also be missing from the entire weekend’s action. So, the moral teaser: did Vettel not feel obliged to get out on the track as much as possible? ‘You can talk about obligations, but in the end we have to manage the situation with the engines,’ said the German, knowing that morality and Formula One are not natural bedfellows. ‘The situation is what it is. I’d love to change it, to qualify in the normal way and use every practice session to the maximum. Vettel (left) poses with team-mate Daniel Ricciardo of Australia during the preview in Texes . Vettel of Infiniti Red Bull Racing drives an Infiniti Q50 Eau Rouge along North Congress Avenue in Texas . ‘But the rules are pretty clear. Once you decide to take a sixth engine, sixth turbo, all the pieces, you have to start from the pit lane, even if you qualify on pole. ‘So you would not want to burn mileage in qualifying that you would regret later in Brazil or Abu Dhabi, where you might not see the finish line. But I see your point, and it would be a real shame.’ Instead, Vettel gave a sprinkling of fans an exhibition on Austin’s streets yesterday afternoon. In the shadow of the Texas State Capitol building, he pulled doughnuts — rubber-burning wheel-spins — in an old Red Bull, its V8 engine screeching across the city. Not that the noise level will be the same at the out-of-town circuit, the turbo engines with their low growl being a faint echo of the old banshee yell. Vettel, the current champions, is 148 points behind leader Lewis Hamilton in the F1 standings . Vettel won the 2013 US Grand Prix from pole position, before going on to win the title . Given the plight of Caterham and Marussia, both of which are based in Britain, there will be plenty of introspection in the paddock this weekend. The chief question will be whether Formula One’s prize money and spending power is too concentrated among the bigger teams. Tony Fernandes, the QPR chairman and airline magnate, believes so, having given up on Caterham after starting with all sorts of avowed ambitions. ‘People can blame whoever but the big teams are as much at fault as anyone,’ he told Sky. ‘The gap has become way too big and it is money. And so I thought, “Well, I can’t compete”. But I can compete at QPR; I can compete at Air Asia. ‘Rather than continue, you have got to be brave and say, “Look, we screwed up. You can’t compete; you thought you could and it is time to leave”. But the sport has to examine itself as well.’","Sebastian Vettel feels it will be 'a shame' if he is unable to run in qualifying .

"A trio of Formula One's old stars have criticised Bernie Ecclestone's controversial double points system for the final Grand Prix this year. With just 17 points separating Mercedes team-mates Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg going into the last three races of the season - starting with Sunday's event in the United States - it appears certain double points will have an impact in Abu Dhabi on November 23. It is precisely the scenario Ecclestone envisaged when he conjured up the idea, with the 84-year-old likely to be feeling proud of himself. Bernie Ecclestone introduced a double points system for the final race of the Formula One season . It is a far cry from the gold-medal scheme Ecclestone proposed a few years back, one which would have resulted in Hamilton being crowned champion at the last race in Russia given he has won nine races to Rosberg's four. For the likes of Sir Stirling Moss, Sir Jackie Stewart and John Surtees, however, they all feel the awarding of double points in the last race to simply prolong the entertainment is abhorrent to the sport. Moss, renowned as the greatest driver never to win a title as he was runner-up on four occasions, said: 'I have enjoyed the races this year, they have been extremely good. 'Although there is no doubt to win a race you need a Mercedes engine first, and then you need Lewis. Sir Jackie Stewart said he disagreed with the rule, saying it ruined the 'purity' of the system . 'Lewis is certainly a very fast, competent driver, and well lined up for his second title. 'But I don't really like the idea of double points at the last race. It seems to be a pretty stupid thing to do.' Hamilton faces the prospect of potentially winning 11 races, yet he could still miss out on his second championship. It is why Surtees, the only man ever to win world titles on two and four wheels, feels Rosberg still has every chance of being champion. Surtees said: 'It's not a very satisfactory situation. Lewis Hamilton currently leads the drivers' standings but the new rule means overall victory is far from certain . 'It is a gimmick I don't particularly like. I'm not sure it's fair on drivers or teams, but it is a factor. 'So I wouldn't underestimate Nico in any way as he's a very intelligent driver, although he has made the odd mistake lately.' Surtees, who celebrated the 50th anniversary of his F1 triumph at the weekend, has been thoroughly impressed with the way Hamilton has handled himself of late. 'Lewis does appear to have found some calmness in his driving,' added Surtees. 'Some of the things he has said and done off the track were once counter-productive for both the sport and for him. John Surtees was pleased with the maturity Hamilton had begun to show on and off the track . 'But it's been pleasing to see he has come to a point where he is focusing more and seems to be presenting himself in a better fashion.' Three-times world champion Stewart, meanwhile, has again voiced his dissatisfaction with the double-points scenario. 'I'm not a supporter,' said a dismissive Stewart. 'I don't think they should be there. We have to keep it pure. I don't think it's going to add anything to the season. 'I would rather the world championship was won on purity, which means one set of points.' Sir Stirling Moss described the double points system as 'a pretty stupid thing to do'","Double points will be available in the final Grand Prix of the season .

"Roy Keane has revealed that Sir Alex Ferguson took him to task over his drinking while he was playing for Manchester United. The legendary Old Trafford captain is frank about his alcohol consumption during his early years at United in his autobiography The Second Half. Keane also details his battles with former manager Sir Alex Ferguson, reacting to the iconic manager's criticism in his own book last year. Roy Keane has revealed former boss Sir Alex Ferguson took him to task over his drinking while at Old Trafford . Keane, pictured celebrating in 1995, is frank about his alcohol consumption during his early  days at United . Keane, now assistant manager at Aston Villa, says he and Ferguson often had arguments . One topic to spark disagreement between the two United legends was Keane's fondness for drink - which the Irishman admitted was his 'hobby' during his early Old Trafford career. Asked by ShortList magazine if Ferguson ever had words over his drinking, Keane said: 'Oh, of course. And quite rightly.

"A man has been charged in relation to the murder of South Africa captain Senzo Meyiwa, who was shot dead on Sunday night. The South African Police Service (SAPS) confirmed that a suspect, named as Zenokuhle Mbatha, had been charged and remanded in custody as the investigation into the fatal shooting continues. Meyiwa, 27, was shot dead at a house in Vosloorus township, near Johannesburg. A suspect has been arrested following the murder of Senzo Meyiwa at a house in Vosloorus township (above) Police revealed that seven people were in the house during the shooting, and will be regarded as witnesses . Investigators are continuing their search for more suspects after Meyiwa was shot dead by intruders . The SAPS said on Twitter earlier this week that two gunmen had entered the property, while an accomplice waited outside, before fleeing on foot. The SAPS also revealed that seven people were in the house at the time of the shooting and that they were all being regarded as witnesses. A statement on Friday from Lieutenant General Solomon Makgale on the SAPS website read: 'Yesterday, after receiving information about a number of suspects, we conducted an identity parade during which some of the witnesses positively identified one person. 'During consultation with the prosecution team, it was decided that this person should be arrested and charged on the basis of the positive identification by some of the witnesses. 'The matter was then placed on the court roll and heard this afternoon. The suspect, Zenokuhle Mbatha, a 25-year-old, has been remanded in custody and will reappear in court on November 11, 2014.

'Whilst we are pleased with the progress we are making and the overwhelming support from members of the public, there is still a lot of work to be done to finalise the investigation and ensure that we can link all suspects to the murder. We must emphasise that Mr Mbatha is regarded as a suspect at the moment and we therefore must allow due process of the law to take its course. 'Given the fact that our investigations are at a very sensitive stage, we will only be in a position to update the nation during a media briefing on Monday, November 3, 2014. There are still other suspects outstanding and we appeal to the public to continue providing information in support of the investigation.' Police admitted there is still a lot of work to be done to bring justice to all suspects linked to the murder .

"Daniel Sturridge believes his injury problems could possibly be 'hereditary' as he faces more weeks out of the Liverpool side with a calf strain. The England striker hasn't played for club or country since the beginning of September and the Reds have dropped points in the Premier League without their focal point in attack. And Sturridge, whose uncles Dean and Simon also played professional football while his father was a trainee at Birmingham, says his struggles can be put down to a Caribbean gene pool. Daniel Sturridge says his injury problems could be hereditary - he is currently out with a thigh strain . Sturridge's uncles Dean (left) and Simon (right), both played professionally (for Wolves and Shrewsbury above) Sturridge picked up his latest injury on England duty and hasn't played since the beginning of September . 'I play my game as best I can, but I've been unfortunate this season,' Sturridge told talkSPORT. 'Maybe it's my body type, maybe it's hereditary.' 'Both my uncles had injuries, and my dad had them as well. Maybe it's the Caribbean vibes, maybe I have speed but maybe it makes you more vulnerable because of the fast twitch muscles and the speed in which you're moving. 'I am vulnerable to muscle injuries. As long as I continue to work hard everything will take care of itself.' Mario Balotelli has filled in for the 25-year-old as Brendan Rodgers' side lie in seventh place in the Premier League. The £16million summer arrival from AC Milan has yet to score in the Premier League and has brought his usual controversies back to England off the pitch, most notably swapping shirts with Pepe half-way through a 3-0 defeat to Real Madrid. The England striker has backed team-mate Mario Balotelli and says they can form a partnership . Sturridge signs autographs before Liverpool's Capital One Cup game against Swansea on Tuesday . However, Sturridge insists he doesn't have a bad word to say about the Italian and that once he returns, the duo can recreate a partnership similar to his and Luis Suarez's last season. He added: 'We get on well off the field and in the changing rooms. We're always laughing and joking,' 'Once I get back fit I'm hoping we can strike up a partnership. Last season with Luis [Suarez] we had a great relationship up front and scored a lot of goals. Hopefully this season it will be the same.' 'He's a likeable person. I don't have any bad words to say about him. People don't realise what he's been through in his life to get where he is today.'","Daniel Sturridge expected to be out until mid-November with calf strain .

"Eden Hazard has heaped praise on Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, and says it is 'a pleasure to play with them'. Chelsea's two high-profile summer signings have hit the ground running as Jose Mourinho's side set the early season pace in the Premier League. And last season's star Hazard claims it took just a week of training for him to get used to playing with the two Spain internationals. Eden Hazard has been excellent so far for Chelsea, terrorizing defenders during his side's superb start . The signings of Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa have been vital in Chelsea's early-season success . 'The time it takes to develop a relationship on the pitch depends on the guy,' Hazard told the Evening Standard. 'Sometimes it's quick, sometimes not. 'But it's easy for me to play with them because they understand football and are very good players. We didn't need to train two years together, just one week was enough. They know when I move and I know when Costa and Fabregas move. It's a pleasure to play with them.' Hazard says it took just one week to adapt to the two Spain internationals, because 'they understand football' Costa is currently missing through injury, but has scored nine goals in as many games since joining . The Belgian winger, who has also been in superb form so far this season, also targeted a treble for his Chelsea side this season. 'I don't know how much better this team can get — we will see. Now we are first in the table and I hope we can stay there until the end of the season. I hope we can win a lot of trophies this season, one, two or three. Why not?'

"When Aberdeen host Celtic in the month of November, tradition dictates that fireworks are always likely. Aleksandar Tonev’s seven-match ban for racially abusing Shay Logan has the potential to make the meeting of the clubs at Pittodrie a week on Sunday downright incendiary. When the teams last met in September, Tonev clashed with Logan in the 55th minute of play. Only two men know what really happened but the Aberdeen defender accused his opponent of saying ‘get your hands off me, you black c***’. Aleksandar Tonev (centre) has been found guilty of using racist language towards Shay Logan (right) Tonev has always maintained that Logan misheard him. Indeed, speaking when on international duty with Bulgaria this month, he insisted: ‘The racism case against me is now closed. ‘Celtic had four videos of the incident which proved there was no racial slur.’ Yet there appears to be no video evidence to support Tonev’s claim. And the SFA were moved to deny the case had been settled. Hampden’s disciplinary tribunal sat for four hours yesterday hearing evidence from both sides before handing Tonev a seven-game suspension which, if upheld, will keep the player on the sidelines until the New Year. Such an absence from the game may be the least of his worries. To say the verdict, Celtic’s subsequent appeal not withstanding, places Tonev’s career on the line is hardly an exaggeration. Logan is an honest, intelligent footballer. It’s difficult to imagine him fabricating such a serious accusation, knowing the impact it would have on the reputation of an opponent. After clashing with Tonev, he was so incensed he ran towards referee Bobby Madden before relaying the accusation to his captain Mark Reynolds. Celtic have backed Tonev and deny that he is a racist, despite the outcome of the disciplinary hearning . When Aberdeen scored, late in the game, he utilised the break in play to repeat his claim to manager Derek McInnes, who gave evidence to the Hampden hearing yesterday. Bluntly, Celtic believe the evidence presented by Aberdeen was flimsy. There were no third-party corroborating witnesses. It was, in essence, one man’s word against another. Under questioning, Tonev told Celtic officials Logan had ‘misheard’ what he actually said. There was no smoking gun for the governing body to study. No microphone recording or CCTV images a lip-reader might analyse closely. Aberdeen quite simply presented the more credible witnesses and the decision was made on the ‘balance of probabilities’. Can of worms barely covers it. Last night, Celtic manager Ronny Deila maintained Tonev’s innocence. As a club, the Scottish champions have resolved to stand by their player and will appeal within five days of being formally notified of the decision. Reiterating a previous stance, the Norwegian insisted: ‘I’m sure that he (Tonev) hasn’t said that towards the player. ‘It’s important to understand that people make mistakes. ‘Everyone makes mistakes – I’m now talking generally. We have to assess it from there. ‘Of course we have no support for racism – that’s clear. We will have nothing about that. ‘But sometimes as a young player, stupid things happen all the time with smaller issues. ‘This is something we will need to assess but I really believe in him.’ Within Celtic, he is not alone. The Parkhead club carried out their own internal investigation, interviewing Tonev and, privately, senior figures at the club express astonishment at the SFA’s decision. Tonev’s parent club Aston Villa have been reported as being ready to use the verdict to rip up the winger’s contract. Yet when Celtic contacted Villa figures, including manager Paul Lambert for background statements on Tonev, there was consensus that the allegations were far out of character. Celtic assistant manager John Collins accompanied the Bulgarian midfielder to his hearing on Thursday . Last night all Villa would say was that they ‘will make no further comment while an ongoing process remains in place’. As Celtic begin their appeal, the search for a precedent leads obviously to the Luis Suarez-Patrice Evra incident back in 2011. As a Manchester United player, Evra accused the former Liverpool striker of racist abuse. Suarez was charged with ‘abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour contrary to FA rules’. The comparisons between that case and this are obvious. Like Tonev, there was no substantial, irrefutable evidence the Uruguayan had, as suggested, branded the Frenchman a ‘negro’ five times. When the FA issued a 115-page verdict, they conceded Evra had simply been the more believable witness, with the testimony of Suarez considered dodgy and inconsistent with video pictures. Like Celtic, Liverpool were irate. At the time they said: ‘We find it extraordinary that Luis can be found guilty on the word of Patrice Evra alone when no one else on the field of play – including Evra’s own Manchester United team-mates and match officials – heard the alleged conversation.’ That argument held little weight. Suarez was handed an eight-match ban and a £40,000 fine. Case closed. At the moment we are operating very much in the dark. The written reasons for the SFA’s decision might have been released next week but will now be delayed pending the Celtic appeal. The Parkhead club will call on some heavy duty, expensive legal assistance in an effort to commute the suspension completely. Reducing the ban to three games is not an option. Tonev either made racist remarks or he didn’t. Collins and Tonev leave Hampden after hearing the result, but the club have insisted they will appeal . Neither is it clear when an appeal will be held. With Celtic in Europa League duty in Romania next week, it seems unlikely a panel can be convened before the champions visit Pittodrie a week on Sunday. An SPFL encounter as raw and unpleasant as the increasingly messy, tangled legal wrangle enveloping Aleksander Tonev already looks more likely than not. Deila is maintaining his defence of the former Lech Poznan player. ‘He’s never shown a bad attitude here,’ the Celtic boss added yesterday. ‘He’s a calm, nice boy and he just needs confidence. ‘He’s an athlete and we have to work on his choices and decision-making. But as a professional, I have nothing bad to say about him. ‘He has to work hard every day to improve. He was out for a long time before he came here and his confidence was not the best. ‘We must work every day to get that feeling we have with John Guidetti and all the others. ‘We have to work all the time on getting to know each other and doing the best thing for every player.’ Deila may well be right that Tonev is a ‘nice boy’. Rarely, however, has that been a suitable defence.","Aleksandar Tonev denies calling Shay Logan 'a black c***'

"Roy Keane says Paul Scholes snubbed interviews as a player because he 'couldn't be a****' and is only now doing media work for the money. It was widely believed that Scholes refused to do interviews and TV appearances during his playing career because he was shy.

"For the hero of the hour, there was to be no long night’s sleep. Still, if the baby girl who provided the inspiration for Radoslaw Cierzniak’s penalty shoot-out derring-do was always likely to interrupt Daddy’s slumbers, he could always seek out his usual remedy - winning coffees from his team-mates in a practice-ground spot-kick competition. Cierzniak would probably have needed something extra strong, an intense espresso or the like, on Thursday morning. The Dundee United team coach wouldn’t have hit the city limits until well after midnight following their hugely dramatic League Cup quarter-final win over Hibs at Easter Road. And the Polish goalie may well have been feeling particularly knackered, having first excelled during regulation and extra time, before making two penalty saves - one standard, the other quite extraordinary - to send United to a Hampden semi-final by dint of a 7-6 win. Dundee United's Radoslaw Cierzniak saved two penalties during the Scottish League Cup quarter-final . Revealing the psychology he had employed to first thwart Matthew Kennedy’s tame effort, when conceding would have seen United dumped out of the competition, and then David Gray’s brilliantly-struck attempt, Cierzniak - booked for his clowning around during the shoot-out - said: ‘Of course I was dancing around on the goal line, trying to put the Hibs players off. Every goalkeeper does this. You have to try something. ‘To be honest, I was upset with myself because, all the time, I seemed to be choosing the wrong way. How many penalties did I face before I saved one? Five, six, seven? ‘So I told myself: “Come on, I have to help my team. I have to do this for myself”. I managed to save one. ‘For the last penalty, I thought about my daughter, Nella. She is just five months old, my first child. I said: “OK, I have to make one more save for Nella”. She is very special to me, so I wanted to do something for her. ‘Everything I do is for her and, hopefully, she will be able to watch a video of this in the future = and I’ll tell her I was thinking of her when I made the last save.’ The United stopper helped his side to triumph 7-6 on penalties against Hibernian on Wednesday night . There were times on Wednesday night when it seemed as if the identity of the fourth League Cup semi-finalist would be left unknown into the wee small hours, so expertly were the penalties despatched by both sides. With player after player either thundering shots into corners or deftly disguising their intentions, it was always going to take something special from one of the goalkeepers to settle the tie. Step forward Cierzniak, a well-travelled 31-year-old who admits to being almost obsessive about the art of the penalty. ‘We practice penalties a lot - all the time,’ he said. ‘We have penalty competitions to see who buys the coffees. It’s a very good laugh, with a serious side, because you know it can come in handy. ‘Last week, we actually didn’t practice. We were too busy with a lot of other things. But we do practice them a lot and I think, as a goalkeeper, it’s very helpful. I have to thank the players and the staff for helping me practice. ‘No, I don’t have to buy the coffees very often, actually. Sometimes I have to – but I like to win! I just have to thank the team, because they give me such confidence that I felt very calm when it came to the shoot-out against Hibs. ‘I never study opponents’ penalties before games. It wouldn’t help much in a shoot-out, when you are facing so many. ‘I knew a few Hibs players from last season but, to be honest, I didn’t expect the game to go to extra time and penalties. In a shoot-out, or even when practising, I think it’s about what you feel on the line. How you feel the guy is going to shoot it. Cierzniak's two saves mean that United will head to Hampden Park for a Scottish League Cup semi-final . ‘It was a very busy night even before the penalties. The first thing I have to say is that Hibs played very, very well. Both teams tried to play football and Hibs should be very proud of how they performed. But I am really proud we made it into the semi-finals, of course.’ Cierzniak admits to having a slight preference ahead of Saturday’s draw for the semis, saying: ‘I’ll be honest, I would like to play against Celtic - or maybe Rangers. I like the big games. ‘But we’ll have to play very well to beat anyone left in the draw, Aberdeen are a very good team. We have confidence, though. So, if we play well, I don’t care who we play against.’ While Cierzniak rightly received plenty of plaudits for his performance, there is little doubt Hibs deserved much praise for their efforts in what was a pulsating encounter. In fact, a great deal has changed at Easter Road in the 12 months since Pat Fenlon sat grim-faced in the aftermath of a League Cup quarter-final loss to Hearts, unable *not* to listen to the angry mob gathered outside Easter Road demanding his dismissal. On Wednesday night, Fenlon’s successor’s successor - Alan Stubbs = saw his team applauded off the pitch at their home ground after exiting the same competition at the identical stage. What’s changed for the better? Not the status of the club, a reluctant member of the Scottish Championship. Maybe it’s more about mood. ‘Yes, it is quite a contrast,’ admitted midfielder Scott Robertson. ‘But, ironically, that game against Hearts was probably one of our best performances last season – we just could not score. ‘The fans were right to vent their anger, we lost a derby, even if it was a good performance. Like you say, the fans were happy with our effort and performance level against United - because I don’t think you could have asked much more from any of the players that stepped out on the pitch. ‘The manager has tried to install a bit of devilment in us. Even if we do go behind in game we feel we have a way of finding a way back - we did it three times against United! The manager is trying to get a bit of nastiness about us and that’s been shown.’ If the Hibs players may take some time to recover, mentally and physically, in time they may look back on their performance with pride. Robertson revealed: ‘One of the Dundee United players, Chris Erskine, said to me during the game: “This is the most enjoyable game I’ve played in all season”. That’s probably because it was so open, with lots of goals and chances, decisions for the referee - and obviously the penalty shoot-out at the end. ‘It was disappointing for us to be the losing team on penalties but it was definitely an entertaining game. We can agree on that. ‘Looking at the team we have now and the way we are playing, if we had that philosophy last season then I really do not think we would be in the position we are in now. ‘It is easy to say that. But, when you are playing against a team like Dundee United and matching them - probably more than matching them actually - then it shows how far we have come in a short space of time. ‘We know ourselves but I think we have to prove it to people how good we can be - and do it more consistently. But our last two performances against the opposition we have been playing against shows what we are capable of, it just needs to be on a more consistent basis.’","Dundee United won 7-6 on penalties vs Hibernian in Scottish League Cup .

"An in-form Simona Halep stands between Serena Williams and a third successive WTA Finals crown after both players booked their place in Sunday's title decider in contrasting manner. Williams fought back from a set down and a break in the third set against Caroline Wozniacki to win 2-6 6-3 7-6 (8/6) in two hours and 13 minutes, while Romanian Halep needed just 67 minutes to despatch Agnieszka Radwanska 6-2 6-2. Williams and Halep will meet in Sunday's showpiece at the Singapore Indoor Stadium four days after Halep hammered the world number one 6-0 6-2 in a round-robin fixture, which prompted Williams to declare herself embarrassed. Serena Williams is targeting her third successive WTA Finals crown ahead of Sunday's final in Singapore . Williams defeated Caroline Wozniacki 2-6 6-3 7-6 (8/6) in the semi-finals to progress . Another comprehensive defeat appeared to be on the cards for the 18-time Grand Slam singles winner on Saturday morning as Wozniacki made a blistering start to the last-four encounter, holding serve twice after breaking Williams' opening service game to race into a 3-0 lead. Williams regained her composure, but, although she held her next two service games, Wozniacki did too. Williams' frustration boiled over in the seventh game when she smashed her racquet after missing a break-point chance and her Danish opponent poured salt in her good friend's wounds by then breaking to win the first set 6-2. The American star showed her frustration during her game against Wozniacki when she smashed her racket . Wozniacki made a decent start to the second set and won her first two service games, but Williams drew on all her experience to break twice to win the set 6-3 and force a decider. All the American's hard work had seemingly gone to waste when Wozniacki broke to take a 5-4 lead and serve for the match, but the Danish world number eight could not close it out and the decider went to tie-break when both players held the subsequent service games. Williams sent down her 12th ace to set up match point and she duly sealed the win when Wozniacki had no answer for one of her trademark thunderous forehand ground strokes. Speaking in a post-match courtside interview shown on BT Sport 1, Williams paid tribute to the crowd for helping her to seal a comeback victory. Simona Halep made light work of Agnieszka Radwanska needing just 67 minutes to close out the match . 'I just kept thinking, 'Well, if I lose I get to go home, but if I win I get to stay in front of this amazing crowd',' she said. 'I heard so many fans out here today and after I lost the first set you guys were so behind me and it's the only reason I was able to pull through, so thank you so much Singapore.' Williams, who clinched the year-end world number one ranking without playing on Friday after Maria Sharapova was eliminated from the tournament, was quick to pay tribute to her opponent. Radwanska struggled to match her Romanian opponent's intensity as she crashed to a 6-2 6-2 defeat . She added: 'I have to say Caroline played a great match. It was really difficult today. I felt really bad because she's so amazing and she's so nice and she's the only one who hadn't lost in this tournament, she really deserved to win. 'Just congrats to her and I love you and thank you for playing so well.' World number four Halep, meanwhile, also raced into a 3-0 lead in her semi-final encounter against Radwanska and dropped just one point on her first serve as she took the first set 6-2 without breaking sweat. Halep then broke her opponent's first two service games in the second and held her own for another 3-0 lead before Radwanska finally registered in the second set by breaking her opponent at the sixth attempt. The Polish world number six then undid all her hard work by dropping her next service game before Halep held her own to carve out a 5-1 lead. Radwanska delayed the inevitable by finally holding her serve in the second but Halep soon brought an end to the match by breezing through her next service game to wrap up victory in a little over an hour. 'I'm very excited to be in the final,' Halep said afterwards in a brief courtside interview broadcast on BT Sport 1. 'I've played my best tennis here this week.'","Serena Williams fought back from a set down to defeat Caroline Wozniacki in the semi-finals .

And this time a shattered Robredo reacted with a light-hearted double middle finger salute. Robredo (left) gives Murray a light-hearted salute after losing in the final of the Valencia Open .

"Jonathan Trott has signed a new three-year contract with Warwickshire after enjoying a revival in form and spirit this past season. Trott, having quit England's Ashes tour of Australia last November citing stress and anxiety, made a delayed start to the campaign after a recurrence of the illness in April, but found form quickly after making his return for his county. The 33-year-old piled up 1,156 runs across all three formats last season, helping the Bears finish as runners-up in the LV= County Championship and Royal London One-Day Cup, and making five centuries between July and September. Jonathan Trott exited England's 2013 Ashes tour in Australia early, citing stress and anxiety problems . ""Warwickshire CCC is a very special club for me and my family and I would like to thank everyone associated with the club for their support,"" Trott, who signed his first Warwickshire contract in 2003, said on the county's website. ""It has always been a great honour to represent the Bears and I am delighted to commit to the club once again for a further three years. ""Hopefully we can build on the success of this year by achieving greater success in the years to come."" Trott, who has played in 49 Tests for England, has not featured for the national team since leaving the Ashes tour, but said last month he hoped his recent form had put him back in the international frame, with his problems apparently behind him. Batsman Trott played 49 tests for England and managed to score nine centuries, averaging 47 . Since returning to action with Warwickshire in April, he has fired 1,156 runs and earned a new three-year deal . Warwickshire director of cricket Dougie Brown is certain Trott still has the credentials to contribute for England, although he has been enjoying having him around at Edgbaston more than he is used to. ""Jonathan played some of the best cricket of his career in the second half of last season and he showed that he remains one of the leading batsmen in the English game,"" Brown said. ""It's been great to see him enjoying his cricket and make such a big contribution to the team's strong finish to the season. He loves Warwickshire and playing cricket at Edgbaston, and everyone connected with the club is thrilled to see him commit long term.""","Trott left England's Ashes tour last November due to stress and anxiety .

"The England and Wales Cricket Board's National Performance Centre in Loughborough has been accredited by the International Cricket Council as a testing centre for illegal bowling actions. The site is the fourth to be designated as such by the world governing body, following Cardiff Metropolitan University, the National Cricket Centre in Brisbane and Chennai's Sri Ramachandra University. ICC testing protocols, which are used to determine whether reported bowlers comply with current guidelines, are provided to the four approved facilities to ensure uniformity in the process. The ECB's National Performance Centre in Loughborough (pictured) has been given ICC accreditation to test for illegal bowling actions, becoming just the fourth place in the world to have such authority . Loughborough University's Dr Mark King will act as the lead specialist in cases taken to the NPC. ECB acting chief executive Brian Havill, said: 'We are absolutely delighted that the National Cricket Performance Centre at Loughborough University has been accredited by the ICC as a testing centre for suspected illegal bowling actions. 'The ECB is committed to assisting the ICC in tackling the issue of illegal bowling actions in international cricket, and it is excellent news that the NCPC's facilities, equipment and expertise through Dr Mark King and Loughborough University can be utilised for this purpose.'

"The International Cricket Council has admitted it 'does not have the power to intervene' in the high-stakes dispute between the West Indies Cricket Board and the Board of Control for Cricket in India. The very future of the West Indies national side is up in the air following the squad's premature abandonment of their three-format tour of India - a momentous decision that led to the BCCI initiating legal action against the WICB and suspending all future tour agreements between the teams. With the financial fragility of the WICB - particularly compared to the commercial behemoth that is Indian cricket - either a multi-million dollar claim for damages or the loss in revenue associated with Indian visits could effectively bury the West Indies as a going concern. India cricketer Ravindra Jadeja celebrates taking his wicket of Ravi Rampaul in June 2013 . But as a result of a controversial governance restructure earlier this year - when the boards of India, England and Australia effectively seized executive control - the ICC has no jurisdiction over the future tours programme. As a result, the ICC confirmed on Wednesday that despite concerns over the row - which is rooted in an internal payment dispute between the Windies squad, their players' association WIPA and the WICB - they have no formal powers of mediation. A statement released to Press Association Sport read: 'The International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Wednesday it was concerned with the dispute between the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB), and was closely monitoring the developments arising from the recently cancelled tour of India. 'The ICC hopes that the matter will be resolved amicably, but clarified that, unless the matter is otherwise referred to it, it does not have the power to intervene in disputes resulting from a bilateral FTP tour. 'The ICC added that the matter will be discussed at the ICC Board meeting, which is scheduled for 10 November in Dubai. Until then, the ICC will make no further comment on this matter.'","Future of the West Indies national side is up in the air following the squad's premature abandonment of their three-format tour of India .

"Former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff will play for the Brisbane Heat in Australia's KFC Twenty20 Big Bash League over the winter. Flintoff, 36, came out of retirement to make a return to action this summer with a handful of appearances in the shortest format for Lancashire, coming close to helping them snatch victory over Birmingham Bears in the NatWest Blast T20 final. He will now continue his playing return in Australia, heading out in December to link up with former Lancashire team-mate Stuart Law who is the Brisbane coach, as well as fellow international signings Daniel Vettori of New Zealand and West Indian leg-spinner Samuel Badree. Former England star Andrew Flintoff sports his new Brisbane Heat jersey after signing for the Australian club . Andrew Flintoff batting for Lancashire and hauling them close to victory in the T20 Final . 'I'm excited to be coming back to Australia and especially to Brisbane which has always been a favourite spot of mine to play,' Flintoff said on the Brisbane website. 'Stuart and I have had a few conversations and I'm clear on what we're looking to achieve in the competition. The Heat squad has some exciting talent and I'm looking forward to catching up with Dan Vettori again.' Flintoff agreed a deal to play for Queensland in the competition in 2010 but injury prevented him from taking up the opportunity. 'I've seen from afar how the BBL has evolved so quickly to become a world class competition and it's a challenge that I am certainly up for,' Flintoff added. Flintoff celebrates taking the wicket of Ian Bell in that final and is mobbed by Ashwell Prince and Steven Croft . 'I really enjoyed my T20 season with Lancs and having the opportunity to keep playing is something I am very pleased about. It's going to be great heading out to Brisbane and getting into the swing of things for the BBL in December,' he said. Law added: 'I've told Fred we signed him to win games of cricket, so that means we want him bowling 140km/hr, hitting sixes and using his experience around the group to get the job done. 'He's an enormous competitor and so I know he is coming out for the right reasons. The Brisbane fans will quickly discover he's a champion fella and I'm sure they will love having him with the team.' Flintoff will also undertake media work with Network Ten during the course of the competition.","Former Test star Andrew Flintoff will play in KFC T20 Big Bash League .

"West Indian cricket, once the envy of the world game, is facing oblivion after the Board of Control for Cricket in India responded with fury to the cancelled tour that has again exposed the fragile nature of the sport’s finances. The cricketing community was already reeling following last week’s decision by the West Indian players to call off their tour of India with a three-Test series left unplayed because of a pay dispute with their own board. But on Tuesday the BCCI escalated the crisis, saying they would start legal proceedings against the West Indies Cricket Board for a loss of income they claim to be as high as £40million, and suspending all series between the two countries. Sri Lanka stepped in at a moment’s notice for a five-match one-day series, starting on November 2. West Indies captain Dwayne Bravo, diving in the ICC World Twenty20 in March, whose side left India early . The Board of Control for Cricket in India have announced they are claiming £40million in lost earnings . It is the fate of West Indies, however, that concerns most cricket-lovers. A successful claim by India would cripple West Indian cricket for good. A year ago, their board was £3.5m in debt. This year’s financial report by KPMG suggests ‘there is substantial doubt the company will be able to continue as a going concern’. India’s suspension of bilateral ties will cost the West Indian game more than it can afford. India’s previous full tour of the Caribbean, in 2011, netted the hosts an estimated £14m in TV rights. But that money has gone and the potential loss of India’s proposed visit in 2016 could bring West Indies to their knees. As Tony Cozier, the respected Caribbean broadcaster, wrote: ‘It should not have come to this.’ West Indies all-rounder Darren Sammy  will be part of the team heading home over the pay dispute . In truth, the writing has been on the wall for some time. West Indies’ recent history is bedevilled by squabbles over pay, and the only surprise is that such drastic action, which has produced a sympathetic response from Jamaican legend Michael Holding but opprobrium in other quarters, was not taken earlier. For those who recall West Indies’ 15-year reign of terror, the latest development will bring only sadness. Between 1979-80, when they lost in New Zealand, and 1994-95, when Australia became the first visiting side to win in the Caribbean for 22 years, West Indies won 21 of their 29 Test series and drew eight. Michael Holding (centre) and the West Indies dominated world cricket between 1979 and 1995 . Holding (pictured) sympathises with the situation in the West Indies which threatens to derail Caribbean cricket . No one could touch them; everyone feared them. Now, only Zimbabwe and Bangladesh rank below West Indies in both Tests and one-day internationals. They haven’t won a single Test against a major nation outside the Caribbean for almost seven years. It seems their administrators have mislaid their political nous, too. To fall out with India, whose finances effectively bankroll the smaller Test nations, is tantamount to suicide. India cricketer Ravindra Jadeja celebrates taking the wicket of West Indies batsman Ravi Rampaul in 2013 . Tellingly, the Indians are pointing the finger at the West Indies board rather than the players, many of whom are important members of the various IPL franchises. IPL chairman Ranjib Biswal has blamed ‘the arrogance of the WICB’, adding: ‘The players can’t be blamed.’ What happens next is anyone’s guess. It is inconceivable that West Indies will be allowed to send a second-string team to tour South Africa later this year, nor to the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in early 2015. It should also be inconceivable that West Indian cricket will disintegrate altogether, with disillusioned players set free to pursue Twenty20 careers around the globe. But it could happen. And cricket would never be the same again.

"The West Indies cut their three-format tour of India short after the fourth one-day international on Friday due to a dispute over player payments and a Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) working committee has been debating their response over recent days. The BCCI will begin legal proceedings against the West Indies Cricket Board following the cancellation of the latter's tour and have also suspended all bilateral tours between the two sides. A press release signed by board secretary Sanjay Patel confirmed that legal representatives will now be called, while also calling into doubt the entire future relationship between the two nations. India cricketer Ravindra Jadeja celebrates taking the wicket of West Indies batsman Ravi Rampaul in 2013 . The two brief bullet points which could plunge the WICB into an even wider-scale crisis read: '1. BCCI will initiate legal proceedings against West Indies Cricket Board due to the abrupt cancellation of this tour. 'All Bilateral tours between BCCI and WICB stand suspended.' The West Indies team have been in dispute with the West Indies Players Association (WIPA) over the signing of a new collective bargaining agreement and memorandum of understanding (MoU), which would see sponsorship payments reallocated to fund the wider professional game in the islands. And with no agreement in sight the worst-case option of departing India with one ODI, a Twenty20 international and three Tests still to play was taken. The WICB eventually made a conciliatory offer of a sending a new group of players to fulfill the fixtures but with a guaranteed mis-match not proving appealing to the Indians or their commercial partners, a five-match one-day series against Sri Lanka was hastily fixed. Those games have been confirmed to take place in Cuttack, Hyderabad, Ranchi, Kolkata and Ahmedabad, with a detailed itinerary in the offing. While West Indian relations with the game's most powerful body have now sunk to a new nadir, Sri Lanka Cricket are now in a postion to take advantage of their new status as saviours. An additional note on Tuesday's BCCI release read: 'The Members appreciated the gesture of Sri Lankan Cricket Board for having accepted our request to play five ODIs starting from 2nd of November 2014, at such a short notice. This tour is in lieu of their scheduled tour to India next year which will be reciprocated by India touring Sri Lanka in months of July/August 2015.'","Board of Control for Cricket in India to being legal action against West Indies Cricket Board .
