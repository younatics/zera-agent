"(CNN) -- Bill Cosby has dominated headlines for much of the last month as accusations of sexual assault pile up. More than a dozen women have accused Cosby, many of whom say he drugged them first. Their stories paint a starkly different picture of the man beloved by millions as Dr. Huxtable -- the sweet, sweater-wearing father on the sitcom, ""The Cosby Show."" The 77-year-old comedian has denied some of the allegations and refused to discuss others. He has never been prosecuted. Here's the latest on the controversy: . What are the allegations against Cosby? At least 15 women are speaking out to various media outlets accusing Cosby of sexual misconduct. They include 12 women who either CNN has spoken to or read court documents about, who have spoken on camera about their allegations or whose alleged attacks have been addressed by Cosby's attorney. Among the latest accusers is former supermodel Janice Dickinson. She told ""Entertainment Tonight"" that Cosby assaulted her in 1982 after the two had dinner in Lake Tahoe. She alleges he gave her a pill and a glass of red wine shortly before she passed out. ""The last thing I remember was Bill Cosby in a patchwork robe, dropping his robe and getting on top of me. And I remember a lot of pain,"" she said. Why are we talking about them now? The stories of Cosby's purported crimes have been around for about a decade, but they recently got new life when a comedian took aim at him and a social media stunt inviting fans to meme the comic went awry. In late October, Hannibal Buress bluntly attacked what he perceived as Cosby's ""smuggest old black man public persona"" by saying, ""Yeah, but you rape women, Bill Cosby, so turn the crazy down a couple notches. 'I don't curse onstage.' Well, yeah, you're (a) rapist, so I'll take you saying lots of m*****f*****s on 'Bill Cosby: Himself' if you weren't a rapist."" Earlier this month, Cosby -- or whoever was in charge of his social media -- put out a challenge with a jovial picture of Cosby in a cap: ""Go ahead. Meme me! #cosbymeme."" The Internet immediately reacted. ""Claire, have you seen my ... nevermind, found my raping hat!"" tweeted Trill Withers over the cap picture. ""My two favorite things (--) Jell-O pudding & rape,"" tweeted E.J. Coughlin over a photo of Cosby smiling. Cosby's original tweet was quickly pulled from the Web, which led to this conclusion from Jensen Karp: ""If anyone is looking for a job, the Social Media Manager position for @BillCosby is about to open up."" What has Cosby said about the allegations? He's been mostly mum. When an NPR reporter gave him a chance to deny the allegations, Cosby provided an awkward moment of radio silence, refusing to answer the question. Given the same chance by The Associated Press, he offered no comment. When the interview concluded, he told a reporter that asking him about the allegations was a mark of low integrity and said he'd be appreciative if that portion of the interview was ""scuttled."" Cosby offered an explanation for his silence Friday, when he told Florida Today he wasn't going to respond to ""innuendos,"" referring to the women's accusations. ""I know people are tired of me not saying anything, but a guy doesn't have to answer to innuendos. People should fact-check. People shouldn't have to go through that and shouldn't answer to innuendos,"" he told the newspaper in a backstage interview before his sellout performance at the King Center for the Performing Arts in Melbourne. A lawyer for Cosby has called the increasing number of claims of sexual assault against the legendary comedian ""ridiculous"" and said the media should stop airing ""unsubstantiated, fantastical stories."" Martin D. Singer said in a written statement sent to CNN that it defies common sense that ""so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years."" What's been the fallout for him? The accusations have taken their toll on Cosby's earnings and reputation. Netflix postponed a stand-up comedy special. It was filmed before a live audience in July and scheduled to premiere the day after Thanksgiving. The company did not elaborate, issuing a statement that said only, ""At this time we are postponing the launch of the new stand-up comedy special 'Bill Cosby 77.'"" NBC also decided against moving forward with a Cosby project. The network said last week that it opted to stop developing the comedy show, which was billed this summer as a ""classic, big extended-family sitcom"" revolving around Cosby. ""We can confirm that the Cosby project is no longer in development,"" NBC said. Finally, TV Land, one of the networks that have reruns of ""The Cosby Show"" in their lineups, quietly removed the sitcom from its programming schedule. TV Land also deleted the sitcom page from its website. The channel did not respond to requests for comment about the disappearance of the show. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Todd Leopold, Steve Almasy and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","At least 15 women are speaking out, accusing Cosby of sexual misconduct .

"London, England (CNN) -- The United Kingdom will send an additional 500 troops to Afghanistan in early December, bringing the British contingent there to more than 9,500, Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced Monday. ""We must address the terrorist threat at its source,"" Brown told lawmakers, adding: ""Our task is to prevent the Taliban from giving al Qaeda ... safe haven. ""Instability in Afghanistan can only increase the risk of conflagration where the rest of the world can least afford it."" Brown regularly links British security to events in Afghanistan and Pakistan, saying attacks on London and other British targets have been planned in South Asia. He announced in October the decision in principle to boost force levels, but said certain conditions -- including proper equipment for the British troops and more troop commitments from other countries -- had to be met first. The United Kingdom has the largest contingent in Afghanistan after the United States. The figure of 9,500 does not include special forces, said Brown, who declined to say exactly how many are there, but indicated it is more than 500. Brown's announcement coincided with the news that a British soldier was killed by an explosion in Afghanistan's Helmand province, where troops have been entrenched in heavy combat with Taliban insurgents since July 2006. The soldier, from the 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards, died as a result of injuries sustained in the Babaji area, the Ministry of Defence said in a statement. Britain has lost more than 200 service personnel in Afghanistan since the start of fighting in 2001. More than 100 were lost in the past year.","British contingent in Afghanistan will be increased to 9,500, UK's Brown says .

"(CNN) -- You sure gotta climb a lot of steps to reach the Capitol building in Washington, so just imagine what the tumble down is like. Or, just ask ""Schoolhouse Rock"" Bill, hero of the classic animated educational segment ""I'm Just a Bill"" on how a bill becomes a law. In a sketch on this weekend's episode of ""Saturday Night Live"" that captures the gridlocked climate of Washington politics, President Obama pushes the bill (played by Kenan Thompson) down the steps of the Capitol to make room for a cigarette-smoking executive order (played by Bobby Moynihan). ""There's an easier way to get things done around here,"" Obama (played by Jay Pharoah) tells a bewildered schoolboy visiting the Capitol. The sketch starts off the same way as the original ""Schoolhouse Rock"" segment, with a schoolboy meeting the bill on the Capitol steps. Bill launches into the classic ""I'm Just a Bill"" ditty, explaining how he goes from ""sitting here on Capitol Hill"" to the House, the Senate and then to the President's desk. Then, enter Obama, followed by Executive Order, who tells the student, ""I pretty much just happen."" Bill makes his way up the steps a few times after the tumble, only to meet the same fate. But is this constitutional? the boy asks. Yes, says Executive Order -- ""I create national parks, or new holidays."" ""Or grant legal status to 5 million undocumented immigrants,"" interjects Obama, referring to his plan to overhaul immigration. ""Whoa!"" exclaims Executive Order. ""OK, go big or go home."" Moral of the story? ""I think I want to go into the private sector,"" says the boy.

"(CNN) -- The plan by President Obama to provide legal status to millions of undocumented adults living in the U.S. presents Congressional Republicans with a political quandary of the highest magnitude. Yet the President's decision to act unilaterally actually may provide Republicans with an opportunity to change the dynamic on immigration in a way that yields political benefit, not peril. While the contours of the President's plan won't be known until Thursday evening, timely leaks indicate that two major new policies will be announced. First, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security will change its policies for detaining and deporting undocumented individuals so that parents of children with legal status in the U.S. cannot be deported absent committing additional crimes, and will expand the population eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program which also allows individuals to remain in the U.S. Second, these people will be allowed to apply for work permits to continue or obtain legal employment in the U.S. The media coverage of these policies has conflated the two policies but they involve very different executive branch authorities and political sensitivities. Choosing not to initiate law enforcement action against certain groups of people is a decision that falls squarely within the executive branch's prosecutorial discretion. It is probably true that no prior administration would have ever dared to ignore the law to this magnitude and after Congress failed to enact legislation to legalize this large a population. Nonetheless, this decision is not only likely to be upheld in court if challenged, it is also very hard to overturn by legislation because the very nature of immigration enforcement means choices must be made on what types of cases to pursue. Providing work permits, however, is an affirmative benefit that falls on much shakier legal and political grounds, especially with economic concerns still front and center with American voters. Immigration-reform legislation has been stalled for a decade because neither those most concerned about legalization of the undocumented nor those most concerned about interior enforcement have had enough votes in Congress to pass a one-sided bill and neither side was willing to accept a compromise that included both. Major attempts to tie all of these threads together in a massive bill fell short of final passage in 2006, 2007 and 2013. A major enforcement-only bill passed the House in 2005 but died in the Senate. Without resolution of the legalization and interior enforcement issues, other aspects of immigration reform where there is much more consensus -- such as broader low-skilled guest worker programs, efforts to encourage high-skilled immigration, tourism expansion measures, and mandatory employment verification -- have been held hostage to those more divisive questions. Meanwhile the politics on immigration has hurt Republican efforts to claim the White House in 2008 and 2012. Surely the issue looms as an even larger albatross for the party in 2016. The President's decision to detach the legalization issue is the political lifeline Republicans need. Republicans could include a rider in a must-pass appropriations bill that denies funding to provide work permits to the undocumented and forbids implementation of any initiative that diverts funding away from processing of legal immigration applications from those who have played by the rules. Such a rider would not block changes to deportation policy nor the ability of the White House to set up a fee-based program to allow the undocumented to obtain temporary legal status short of citizenship. The bill should also incorporate the additional border security spending included in the 2013 Senate bill which supporters claimed was necessary at the time to block new waves of undocumented migration. Congressional Democrats would be hard-pressed to block this type of bill, and the President would be faced with a very difficult veto decision when the bill arrived at his desk. Even if Republicans eventually were forced to drop the work permit rider to keep the government operating, at least the debate would have been shifted to their advantage by focusing on the economy and employment instead of an abstract argument about where to prioritize deportations. Separately, when the new Congress arrives in January, the House should take up pieces of legislation that would implement the other facets of immigration reform that are necessary to build an enforceable system for the future. Last year, the House developed an important set of bills to improve border security, implement an agricultural guest worker program, mandate employee verification, and expand high-skilled immigration programs. So long as none of these bills provides legal support for the President's legalization program, House Republicans could pass the rest of immigration reform that would help American businesses and deter future flows of undocumented labor. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has indicated a desire to move these types of measures individually, and it seems unlikely that Senate Democrats have enough leverage to block these popular measures if they do not overturn the legalization done by fiat. And it seems unlikely that the President could insist on an even broader legalization as the price for signing these types of bills. If successful, Republicans could claim credit for building a 21st century immigration system, avoid the political pitfalls of advocating mass deportations, and escape the immigration dilemma without having to offer citizenship to those legalized by the President. Isn't this a better political outcome than an unsuccessful showdown over the President's deportation priorities? Obviously the politics of immigration remain a high wire act that is continually shifting. A terrorist incident, a cross border disease outbreak, economic downturns, or problems with vetting and enrollment of the undocumented, could turn the politics of immigration to the Republicans' advantage. But the alternative scenario is perhaps more likely: once millions of undocumented individuals have passed a background check, how much support will exist to deport them? As has often been said, most Americans support immigration enforcement in general, just not against the specific undocumented individuals they actually know who have families in their neighborhoods, or work at local factories, childcare centers, or hospitals. Perhaps this view is why polling in 2014 shows a majority of Americans support a path to legal status for most undocumented aliens as opposed to a focus on deportation. And it is only the very rare hardliner that wants to pay for a government large enough to deport 12 million people. Republicans need to look beyond the politics of the moment and ask themselves, what is best long-term outcome for immigration policy? Passing pro-business, pro-market, pro-enforcement measures and allowing the President to own the legalization piece is about the best outcome Republicans can expect. The President's decision is a trail out of the immigration box canyon Republicans currently face -- will they be clever enough to take it?

"(CNN) -- We are well into the fall season, so by now, you probably have had your fill of pumpkin and Oktoberfest beers, so now is the time to give a fresh hop beer a try. Fall is harvest time for the hop growers of the Pacific Northwest, where a majority of hops are grown in the U.S. While most of the hops picked are dried and preserved, some hops are spared from the drying kiln and sent directly to brewers within 24-48 hours. These hops are referred to as ""wet hops."" Whole fresh hop cones provide a more grassy and juicy aroma and flavor to the beer by retaining precious lupulin oils from the hop flower. Wet hop beers are the ultimate example of farm-to-glass, and are designed to celebrate the agriculture of beer. Brewers in Oregon and Washington obviously have an advantage in getting the freshest picked hops, but more and more breweries outside of the hop growing regions are going to extreme lengths to get the freshest hops into the brew kettle. I gathered as many of these ""freshies"" as I could get my hands on for a taste test, along with a group of fellow beer lovers, and have listed the cream of the crop. These harvest ales won't be available much longer, so you better hop to it and try some today. Please share your favorite wet hop beer in the comments below. Northern Hemisphere Harvest -- Sierra Nevada . Sierra Nevada has been brewing up wet hop beers since 1996, so they have got it down. They even produce a wet hop beer from hops grown on their estate in Chico, California. The fresh Centennial and Cascade hops give this balanced beer some citrus and herbal notes, but they're not overpowering. Definite pine and grassy notes crop up at the end, but the sweetness from the malts calm things down a bit. Born Yesterday Fresh Hop -- Lagunitas Brewing Company . This was the clear front-runner this year in the wet hop category. The freshness of this pale ale really shines through from beginning to end. Tropical fruits and pine hit you across the face right upon opening it up, and it should, considering the lengths that Lagunitas went through in order to get this beer in your hands as fresh as possible. The wet hops are truly the star of this pale ale. Harvest Ale -- Founders Brewing Company . Who knew that one of the best wet hopped beers would be straight out of Grand Rapids, Michigan? It's a brilliantly juiced up IPA with intense pine and tropical fruit flavor. The fresh hops shine all the way through to the finish. According the brewery, fresh hops from both Washington and Michigan were used in this year's batch of their delicious harvest ale. Chasin' Freshies -- Deschutes Brewery . This IPA features fresh cut Mosaic hops trucked in straight from the fields in nearby Yakima, Washington. Tropical notes are again showcased in this one, along with heavy pine and subtle bread-y sweetness. Super clean and crisp, and a very easy drinker for 7.2% alcohol by volume. Deschutes also serves up a fresh hop pale ale called Hop Trip, which is worth a try as well. So Fresh & So Green, Green -- Terrapin Beer Company . Each year Terrapin pays tribute to the hop by featuring a single wet hop that is flown down on a midnight plane to Georgia from Yakima. This year Terrapin features Simcoe, which is a heavily aromatic hop that gives lots of earthy pine and passionfruit characteristics. This brew tastes like a freshly mowed lawn of pine needles, with a fruity slightly bitter finish. It is a truly another one hop wonder from Terrapin. Sensi Harvest -- Sixpoint Brewery . This is one juicy fresh hop beer, which is surprising given its very drinkable 4.7% ABV. Brooklyn's Sixpoint uses only seedless hop cones in this session IPA to deliver a citrus-y but not at all bitter brew. Vine to Victory Harvest Ale -- Victory Brewing Company . A very ambitious undertaking by Victory to get a whopping six tons of fresh hops hauled in refrigerated trucks from Yakima Valley to their Downingtown, Pennsylvania, brewery for this fresh hop offering. Tons of grapefruit and a pungent hop aroma lead the way, alongside Victory's signature malts, provide a bread-y sweetness. Fresh Hop -- Great Divide . Another early adopter of the wet hop movement, Great Divide give us a pale ale with grassy hop flavor with heavy grapefruit and a little pine on the finish. Moderate bitterness and an all-around well balanced beer. Warrior IPA -- Left Hand Brewing . Probably the only wet hop beer on the list not featuring Pacific Northwest hops. Warrior is made with fresh wet Cascade hops from the high altitudes of Colorado. Once harvested, the hops are loaded onto a small plane and flown about an hour to the Left Brewery in Longmont, Colorado. Heavy-Handed IPA -- Two Brothers Brewing Company . Two Brothers from Chicago put out three separate versions of their Heavy Handed fresh hop IPA, with each one featuring a single hop. This year they have released them in Chinook, Centennial and Cascade. We were able to get our hands on the Cascade version of this beer. The Heavy Handed was probably sweeter than most of the fresh hop beers we tried, with a caramel flavors with a citrus twist.","Wet hop beers are made with hops that haven't been sent to a drying kiln .

"(CNN) -- Brown University was forced to cancel a speech by NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly on Tuesday after protesters shouted at him on stage about stop- and-frisk policies and racism, an online video shows. The video, just under a minute, was posted on 630WPRO.com. It depicts Kelly at the podium as audience members shout and interrupt him before he was to deliver a lecture. ""Racism is not for debate!"" one individual shouts in the video. When a university official asks the hecklers to hold their comments until the question-and-answer segment of the program, one protester loudly responds, ""We're asking that he stops stopping and frisking people!"" A federal judge ruled in August that the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk policy be altered, finding that it violated the Constitution in part by unlawfully targeting blacks and Latinos. The city of New York has since filed for appeal. ""Shut him down!"" another activist yells in the video. Kelly remains at the podium during the ordeal but does not respond to any of the comments in the footage, which cuts off before he leaves the stage. After nearly 30 minutes of disruption by activist students and members of the community, school officials made the decision to close the lecture and clear the auditorium, according to a statement from Brown University, which is in Providence, Rhode Island. ""Loud shouting, persistent interruption and coordinated chants made it impossible for the lecture to take place,"" the statement said. ""The actions that led to the closing of this afternoon's lecture prevented any exchange of ideas and deprived the campus and the Providence community of an opportunity to hear and discuss important social issues,"" said Brown University President Christina H. Paxson. ""The conduct of disruptive members of the audience is indefensible and an affront both to civil democratic society and to the university's core values of dialog and the free exchange of views,"" Paxson said in the statement. Kelly was to deliver a lecture on ""Proactive Policing in America's Biggest City,"" with nearly an hour set aside for direct audience questions afterward, according to the statement. NYPD told CNN it had no comment.","Brown University cancels Ray Kelly's speech in response to disruptive protesters .

"(CNN) -- Medecins Sans Frontieres has been banned from operating in Myanmar's strife-torn Rakhine State, following official accusations the aid organization is biased towards the state's persecuted Rohingya minority. The international medical NGO, also known as Doctors Without Borders, was last week banned from the southeast Asian nation, where it provides essential healthcare to tens of thousands of patients and has operated for 22 years. On Saturday, the organization announced that the government had allowed it to resume operations in a number of regions, but not in Rakhine State, where the majority of the predominantly Buddhist country's disenfranchised Muslim Rohingya minority is concentrated. Since 2012, the state, home to an estimated 800,000 stateless Rohingya, has seen outbreaks of communal violence that have killed hundreds and left 140,000 displaced. In a statement, MSF said it was ""deeply shocked by this unilateral decision. As the major NGO healthcare provider in Rakhine, it ran clinics in nine townships across the state, ""treating anyone who was unable to access the medical care they required,"" including tens of thousands of vulnerable people who displaced into camps by recurrent communal violence. But Ye Htut, spokesman for Myanmar President Thein Sein, said the organization had been banned from the state for consistently showing favoritism towards the Rohingya -- a stateless group Myanmar's government does not recognize as a legitimate ethnic minority, but regards instead as interlopers from neighboring Bangladesh. ""MSF's foreign and local staff in Rakhine have created a lot of problems because they are not following their core principle of neutrality and impartiality,"" he said. ""When they give treatment to people they prefer to emphasize on the Bengali people. Sometimes Rakhine people visit their clinic seeking help and they're refused. They allow transportation of Bengali patients to the nearby hospital but they fail to provide the same service to the Rakhine people."" The perceived bias had ""created a lot of tension in the local community,"" he said. Nine days ago, hundreds protested against the NGO in Sittwe, the state capital. READ MORE: Thai police raid illegal border camp holding Rohingyas . MSF would not reveal the reasons it had been ordered to halt operations, citing the sensitivity of the situation, but responded to the accusation of bias with a statement that ""all MSF services are provided based on medical need only, regardless of ethnicity, religion or any other factor."" Reports have speculated that the ban was triggered by MSF statements contradicting the official government's account of a recent massacre alleged to have occurred in the Rakhine township of Maungdaw in January. The U.N. and human rights groups claim at least 40 Rohingya Muslims were killed by state security forces and ethnic Rakhine, with the MSF claiming it treated 22 people in the area for weapon wounds. But a government inquiry stated that only one police officer had died. Htut said the disagreement over the Maungdaw massacre was ""not a major issue,"" but had been the ""final straw"" for the Rakhine state government when it came to the NGO. ""The state government and local people think the MSF is intentionally creating tension in the community by spreading baseless information like this,"" he said. He also accused the organization of breaching the terms of its Memorandum of Understanding to operate in Myanmar by denying officials access to its clinic, and by employing ""nearly 40"" foreign staff in the state when it was allowed 19. MSF did not respond to the latter allegations, but said it was ""extremely concerned about the fate of tens of thousands of vulnerable people in Rakhine state who currently face a humanitarian medical crisis."" It said it was continuing talks with Myanmar's government to ensure life-saving services could continue in the state.","Medecins Sans Frontieres has been banned from Rakhine State, Myanmar .

"Washington (CNN) -- The House has passed the Republican budget plan submitted by Rep. Paul Ryan, but some budget experts believe that he federal government is so far in the red that it may not balance the budget again in our lifetime. ""We may never, as a country, have a balanced budget again,"" said Marc Goldwein, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""And you know what? We don't have to."" Goldwein is a bit of a budget wunderkind who was also a staffer for the Bowles-Simpson Commission, established by President Obama to address the nation's fiscal problems, and for the congressional super committee. He and the nonpartisan think tank where he works used to push vehemently for a balanced budget. But no longer. Now the bumper sticker hanging in his cubicle reads, ""Stabilize the Debt."" He feels that Washington has fallen so deep into the deficit hole that it has set off a seismic shift among some fiscal hawks. They now hope to contain the deficit, not erase it. ""It'd be great if we could balance the budget,"" Goldwein said. ""But ... it's just not realistic to look at balancing the budget right now. Right now, what we need to look at is bringing the debt down relative to the economy."" The Ryan budget, despite its cuts and aggressive fiscal moves, does not balance the budget for at least 23 years, according to the House Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget Office. House passes GOP budget . ""This just shows you how deep of a hole our country is in,"" Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican and chairman of the Budget Committee, said when asked about the 2035 budget balance date. But in a city where politicians pass appropriation legislation for a few months or sometimes even a few days at a time, such a long timeline for balancing the budget seems hypothetical at best and meaningless at worst. Hence that unlikely catchphrase ""stabilize the debt."" The idea is to keep government's annual deficits small enough that they are outpaced by the growth in the economy. That, some say, would stop the current explosive path the national debt is on. For example, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the 2011 deficit was nearly 9% of the economy, as measured by gross domestic product. But GDP itself grew by less than 2% during the same time. Think of the economy as a living thing, like a tree. If the tree grew by a couple of feet last year but the deficit burned up several times that growth, it would use far more resources than had been created in the past year. Goldwein and those who share his outlook want a budget under which that tree, the economy, grows by more than the deficit is burning and keeps adding fiscal height overall. But under this scenario, the debt itself would probably grow -- just more slowly. ""We don't need a balanced budget,"" Goldwein concluded. ""What we need to do is stabilize the debt relative to the economy."" To do that would take about $4 trillion in deficit cuts, he and others estimate. The Ryan budget gets there, but barely. The problem? ""We're not going to get to this with one party,"" Goldwein asserted. ""The public, I don't think, is going to be able to tolerate the level of cuts in Congressman Ryan's plan, even though the level of deficit reduction is only a little bit more than what we need."" Neither, Goldwein said, would the public tolerate a federal spending plan that cuts the deficit solely by raising taxes. So nearly everyone in Washington admits that it would require compromise, but few admit that even a tough-to-get compromise most likely will just stabilize the budget, not balance it.

"(CNN) -- Not content to simply swim in it, fill balloons with it, shoot it at bystanders during massive water fights or mix it with whiskey, people never cease to find amazing ways to make water even more incredible than it already is. Blasting it sky high, illuminating it with dazzling lights, surrounding it with classical sculpture ... as the magnificent fountains below illustrate, if you're only using water to drink and do laundry, you're missing out on the fun side of our most precious commodity. Banpo Moonlight Rainbow Fountain (Seoul) The world's longest bridge fountain, Seoul's Banpo Moonlight Rainbow Fountain employs 10,000 LEDs and 380 water jets that run along both edges of the 1,140-meter (370 feet) bridge. The jets shoot out 190 tons of water per minute. The water is taken directly from the Han River and the fountains shoot up to 43 meters (141 feet) horizontally. They can also be programmed to move in time with music. Fountain shows take place every day between April and October.

Lotte World Musical Fountain (Busan, South Korea) South Korea is also home to the world's tallest indoor fountain. It opened in 2010 inside the Gwangbok Lotte Department Store in Busan. Within three weeks, 500,000 people had visited to see it in action. Today, it receives 20,000 visitors a day and ranks as Busan's most popular attraction. The hi-tech display incorporates sound, light and color and 16 different songs provide background music. Lotte Department Store, 20-1, 7-ga, Jungang-dong, Jung-gu, Busan, South Korea .

Its creation was actually a mistake. In 1886, a hydraulic power station was built to deliver water from the Rhone to the city's fountains, households and factories. However pressure buildups forced engineers to install a relief valve in the center of Lake Geneva. This marked the birth of the Jet d'Eau, which became such a popular tourist attraction that the valve was moved closer to shore. The volume of water it shoots out has increased dramatically -- these days it spews 500 liters (132 gallons) of water a second. Jet d'Eau, Lake Geneva, Switzerland .

"(CNN) -- The University of Virginia has suspended all fraternity activities until January 2015 while authorities investigate allegations of sexual assault made against members of a prominent fraternity house there. As the father of two young girls who will someday be college women, my heart goes out to any student harmed by sexual assault. There is no place on any campus or anywhere for such behavior, and students need protection from criminals. And as president and chief executive of the North-American Interfraternity Conference, I am eager to work with administrators at Virginia and other campuses to take on this challenge. From both perspectives, I urge college administrators to act responsibly. We cannot solve this terrible problem by punishing all fraternities and fraternity members for the deplorable actions of a few. By all means, schools should investigate every allegation and hold students accountable for their actions. They should seek criminal charges against those who break the law and suspend or expel those who violate university policy. But they should not violate the rights of those who live by the rules simply because they are in some way affiliated with those who do not. The vast majority of fraternity and sorority members join them for all the right reasons. They are looking for a place to belong. They want to learn and apply leadership skills. They seek an outlet where they can give back to their communities. They want to enrich their collegiate experience. To take all of this away from so many good kids simply because a few kids choose to be bad is unfair, misguided and short-sighted. When fraternity is done right, I firmly believe it is one of the best facets of college life. My own fraternity experience enabled me to grow into a man, excel in school and better understand the value of community. I became a better person when I joined, and in my current role, I aspire to help other young men become better people. The North-American Interfraternity Conference stands ready to participate in a productive discussion. This is why I formed three commissions this year to study the most vexing problems facing colleges today: sexual assault, alcohol abuse and hazing. Over the next 18 months, these panels will come up with meaningful recommendations to address each problem. I will share these recommendations with university administrators and NIC members alike, with the explicit goal of overcoming these issues in the years ahead. The developments at Virginia and other campuses are alarming. I hope we can galvanize now to find solutions soon. At the same time, I am committed to protecting the fraternity movement, so that all students who choose to join a fraternity can join one -- and experience membership in the way it was intended.","Peter Smithhisler: University of Virginia suspended fraternities till January after rape allegations .

"Algeria (CNN) -- Mohammed Qassi Al Saeed, Mohammed Shoaib, Saleh Larbas, Jamal Manad, and Tak Ben Sawlah all played international football for Algeria in the 1980s. But, as well as being teammates for their national side, the players also share another common bond -- each one of them has fathered a child that suffers from mental health problems. The players say they suspect this is no coincidence, more a direct consequence of taking performance-enhancing drugs while playing for their country, without their knowledge or consent. Rashid Hanafi is a respected figure in Algerian sport. He is president of the Algerian Olympic Committee, but was once doctor for the national side. He admits that suspicious practices occurred during the 1980s. ""When Russian Gennady Rogov took over as coach in 1981, I was not allowed to take a look at the medical records of the players any more,"" Hanafi told CNN. ""I suspected he was trying to do some suspicious tests, and this is why I submitted a detailed report to the national center of Algeria sports and medicine and the ministry of sports. ""But they asked me not to interfere in the work of the Russian team, which is why I decided to resign. ""Whether the coaches used drugs on the players, and whether that affected their children negatively is something I cannot confirm. But nonetheless, Russians were known in the late 1970s and early 1980s for their suspicious behavior on the sport field."" Hanafi added: ""It is not necessarily true that these drugs had a direct effect on the children, but if we look at the whole situation we'll find that most players' children have some mental issues."" Rogov, who is no longer alive, led Algeria to a famous victory over West Germany at the 1982 World Cup. CNN's efforts to reach any doctors who worked with the Algerian team at that time proved unsuccessful. But could these players and their families merely be victims of coincidence? Professor Richard Sharpe, a senior scientist at the Medical Research Council Human Reproductive Sciences Unit in Scotland, doubts that any performance-enhancing drug or steroid could be transferred to offspring in such a manner. ""It is possible you can take a drug that would cause mutations of DNA and therefore result in children being born with disabilities,"" Sharpe told CNN. ""But I think it is extremely unlikely that this would happen -- and I know of no drugs or substances that would be used to enhance sporting prowess that could be transferred and therefore cause these abnormalities."" Like Hanafi, none of the players can prove there is a direct link, but they want answers to what has happened to their children -- and it is their words that are most poignant of all. Shoaib had three daughters who all suffered mental health problems, with one of them, he says, dying as a result of her condition. ""Nobody can understand our suffering,"" he told CNN. ""I am shocked because I never took drugs in my life -- unless of course I was given them without our knowledge and that the Russian coaches knew it."" He added: ""Some years later, I met with some of my former teammates and we discovered that we were all in the same situation: me, Qassi Al Saeed (his daughter), Larbas (a son), Jamal Manad (three sons) and Ben Sawlah (daughter). We all played at the same time, so we decided to make it public, and find out why."" None of the players would elaborate on those mental issues, which is not uncommon given cultural taboos surrounding the issue in that part of the world. Larbas' son Bilas is now 12 years old. ""When he was born, I said, 'This is our fate, and we should accept it,' "" Larbas told CNN. ""It did not come to my mind that this could be something related to drugs, until I met up with the other guys. ""I remember the Russian doctors who used to supervise our treatment during training sessions; all we cared about was playing and winning. I know it will be difficult to reveal the truth without sufficient evidence, but opening an investigation is very important."" Al Saeed also wants answers. ""I believe in fate, but having the same mental problem among everyone in the team is something very strange,"" he told CNN. ""I don't understand what Dr. Hanafi said in terms of not allowing him to view the files, which means that a group of people were doing something in the dark, but we will not stop asking for our right to know."" He added: ""My second daughter, Madina, was born in 1989. When she reached school age, she said to me: 'Why can't I go to school like other girls?' I did not know what to say, so I held her and cried. ""Is there anyone in this world who prefers money and fame and have some unhealthy children? I don't think so, so we need immediate answers from authorities. We know that reopening this case is difficult, but we need to know the reasons that made us reach this point.""","Several former Algerian footballers have fathered children with disabilities .

"(CNN) -- No one paying attention to the events in Ferguson, Missouri, since August will be surprised by the grand jury decision last week to not indict Officer Darren Wilson. But beyond the fact that the racial make-up of a jury significantly impacts the final results, and that police are far too rarely held accountable for shooting men of color in this country, there was something else that made this ruling feel inevitable: the unmitigated failure of government at civic, local, state and yes, even national level. Sadly, the decision represents everything that is wrong with America today. In high school, you learn that one of the greatest things about America is how multiple levels of government and society work together to solve problems. Civil society made up of churches and volunteer groups work with local government, which gets help from the state government, which itself works in concert with and sometimes independent of the federal government. But in Ferguson, nothing seemed to be working. Indeed, the poor local civil society response to Ferguson was one of the reasons why Brown's tragic death and the subsequent social unrest occurred. In the best-case scenario, community leaders would have banded together following the shooting and developed a long-term political and protest plan to pressure for change. But that didn't happen. Are protests taking place near you? I attended local meetings where the white community in Ferguson pretended that nothing happened, huge church meetings were held where few African-Americans were invited, and the passive/aggressive ""I Love Ferguson"" campaign acted as a racial dog whistle that everyone could hear. Meanwhile, despite a documented history of police harassment, the local black community in Ferguson was pretty disorganized as well. Much of the organizational leadership had to come from outside of Ferguson because the community was so beat down that there was a dearth of strong local voices in the area. Part of the reason why Ferguson Missouri broke into riots and every celebrity from rapper Nelly to Iyanla Vanzant descended upon the area was because there was a vacuum of local leadership to funnel anger and vocalize demands. And although Ferguson Mayor James Knowles obviously didn't realize he'd end up in the national spotlight when he took office in April, that doesn't excuse his weak response as unrest overtook the city. Justice system unfair to minorities . Several local mayors that I spoke to from neighboring towns said Knowles ignored their advice in the aftermath of the shooting. And it is unclear why Knowles failed to demand that the local police promptly release a police report, which is standard procedure in any shooting. The county getting involved didn't make things any better, and placing Robert McCulloch in charge of the prosecution, a man who was seen as having strong local connections to police, was bound to leave residents skeptical. And local civic groups who reportedly collected over 3,000 new voter registrations after the shooting were allegedly quiet when a report emerged claiming that the St. Louis County Elections Board had dramatically revised down the number of registrations, with the board reportedly saying that it was simply a ""mistake."" The state level government was no better. In fact, Gov. Jay Nixon's administration gave a lesson on how not to govern. A short list of his failures? Failing to send trained National Guard to Ferguson the moment that political unrest was apparent, failing to appoint a special prosecutor for the case when clearly the County Prosecutor's objectivity had been called into question, and then declaring a state of emergency a week before the grand jury even announced their decision. Both symbolically and in practical terms, he was a failure all around. Finally, at the federal level, President Barack Obama's spectacular failure in the entire Ferguson saga has been well-documented and debated. The fairest conclusion to draw is that he did little or nothing to help the men and women suffering in Ferguson, instead blathering on in two speeches about respectability politics. True, Obama dispatched Attorney General Eric Holder to Ferguson as protests unfolded in August, and the fact that the Department of Justice is investigating Ferguson is clearly welcome. But that is a slow and overall less than satisfying process. After all, it's been two years since Trayvon Martin was killed and the DOJ hasn't produced any indictments there yet. There's no reason to think that the wheels of justice in Ferguson will move any faster. On top of this, there is the disturbing fact that the single solution that Obama offered, (which I suggested at the time) that the 1033 Program allowing local police to get military surplus for free, with no supervision, be reviewed by the federal government seems to have died a slow and ignominious death. Why do I point all of these things out? Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson . Because whatever you think of the decision not to indict Darren Wilson for shooting Brown, basic government functions such as voter registration, police transparency, review of controversial programs, selecting objective prosecutors and community engagement are basic government functions that should have worked far better in response. If any of these entities at any level were functioning properly, the violence in Ferguson could have been largely prevented and the public would have a lot more faith in the grand jury decision that came out today. Instead, the lack of an indictment is yet another reflection of our broken government. It is a sad day for America when a whole nation -- and in fact the world -- can watch this country eat its own citizens in fire and tear gas. And it's a failure that falls on every single level of society. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Jason Johnson: Ferguson response shows failures at all levels .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- The score was tied at the start of the game's second half. Nigeria and Cameroon had both scored three goals apiece. ""I'm getting so nervous, no doubt about that,"" said Chukwunonso Favour. He was on his feet with the rest of the crowd in the Nigerian section of the stands, surrounded by a rowdy group of fans who were beating traditional African drums, banging cowbells, dancing and singing syncopated chants in support of their team. Just a few meters away, a more subdued group of Cameroonian supporters was also standing and cheering, one of them waving a Cameroonian flag. The two teams had history. Nigeria and Cameroon faced each other in the finals during last year's tournament, with the Nigerians ultimately capturing the championship. Despite the intensely competitive game, Favour was thrilled that the gathering demonstrated a show of African unity for expats in Turkey. ""It's a good time, it's a time of happiness,"" said the Nigerian, who runs an import-export business. ""It's an important thing for us to do here in Istanbul, to make Africans happy and show that we are all one, that all blacks are still one wherever we are."" This is the African Community Football Championship -- an annual tournament held in the heart of Turkey's largest city, and thousands of miles from the homelands of the competition's players and fans. For a few afternoons in the summer, these games give Istanbul's African community -- which isn't always made to feel welcome here -- a chance to feel at home. And with the exception of the occasional interruption of the call to prayer from a nearby mosque and the line of curious Turks watching the match through the outer fence, for a few moments the stadium looked and sounded like a pocket of West Africa -- especially when the Nigerian players danced, some of them waving their shin-pads in the air, while performing a full-throated song in the crowded locker room before the match. ""The way the country is, the way life for Africans here is -- this is the only place we ever get to come together to have fun,"" said Taju Hamza, one of the Nigerian-born organizers of the championship. When he first helped launch the Africa cup nearly a decade ago, he could barely raise enough money to rent the field. On at least one occasion in the early days, police were summoned to restore order, after the sudden influx of large numbers of Africans for a cup game raised tensions with residents here in Ferikoy, a working class neighborhood in the center of Istanbul. Women's football in Turkey . But after eight years, the championship has become a tradition that has attracted sponsorship from local businesses and even Turkish talent scouts and sports columnists. More importantly, Hamza said the games offer a chance to better integrate new waves of African immigrants showing up on Istanbul's shores. ""This competition is a platform whereby you educate the new ones coming not to be involved in illegal things like crime,"" Hamza said. ""We are concentrated on the community, those who are legal here and those who are not legal...trying to educate them."" Turkey is a major gateway for migrants who struggle to illegally cross its Western borders and reach Europe. According to Turkish police statistics, authorities caught more than 32,000 illegal immigrants in Turkey in 2010 alone. Migration experts and human rights activists estimate more than 300,000 people try to smuggle themselves through this backdoor to Europe every year. How match fixing ruined the beautiful game . The majority of the migrants are from the Middle East, as well as central and southern Asia. While Afghans, Iranians and Arabs have little trouble blending in with Turkish society, Africans represent a visible and often persecuted minority of the foreign migrant population. ""There is a sort of double-marginalization that African migrants are confronted with, which is the discrimination and mistreatment that is sometimes directed at them by local populations, combined with a lack of protection from the police or actual violence that is directed at them by the police,"" said Rachel Levitan, a lawyer and co-founder of the first legal clinic to defend refugee rights in Istanbul. She pointed to the case of Festus Okey, a Nigerian immigrant who was shot dead after being taken into custody in an Istanbul police station in 2007. Stenciled portraits in memory of the slain Nigerian are still spray-painted on some streets and alleys of Istanbul. A police officer is facing charges of negligent homicide in a Turkish court, but to date, Turkish authorities have not convicted anyone in connection with the killing. Levitan said Istanbul's Africa Cup marked a success for integration of the African community in at least one sector of Turkish society -- football. ""It is an incredible sense of progress over the last eight years that this tournament has been going on, because it started out with a really scrappy group of guys playing football and it has developed into something that is a very significant sporting event that has been sponsored,"" Levitan said. At least one of the Turks watching the Nigeria-Cameroon match described himself as a fan of the annual African immigrant championship. Women's football in Africa . Taxi driver Ahmet Ozkan, 66, said he had been coming to see the Africans play for the last five years. ""Sometimes I even watch them training in the morning. I like their football and I like them as people,"" Ozkan said. Not all the Turks were as enthusiastic about the African players and fans. ""They litter. Sound-wise, they make noise and shout in ways we don't understand and scare small children,"" said Oktay Kabatas, a 22-year-old Turkish university student who watched the match through the bars of the stadium. ""But their football is nice. It is joyful."" Like many of the players competing in Istanbul's Africa cup, Hamza, the tournament's Nigerian organizer, first came to this city with dreams of breaking into professional Turkish football. Instead, he found himself engaged in community activism and working for a local company. From the sidelines of the match, where he commanded a team of volunteer security guards with the help of a walkie-talkie, Hamza said he too had been subjected to harassment from Turkish police in the past. ""There was a lot of harassment,"" Hamza said, adding ""but now things are better."" Hamza also took comfort in the fact that some of the tournament's players had gone on to play for professional Turkish football clubs. Fans spilled out of the stadium into the streets after the Nigeria-Cameroon match ended in a 3-3 draw. Later in the summer, the two teams battled again, this time for third place in the championship. Nigeria ended up winning 4-1. The winner of this year's African Community Football Championship was Ghana, which edged out Ethiopia in a 2-1 victory.

"Dadaab, Kenya (CNN) -- Humphry Musyoka, a doctor at the world's largest refugee camp, knows well how quickly dehydration can ravage the body of a child. A young girl who seems OK one minute can turn on a dime. But Musyoka, who works at the Dadaab refugee complex in Kenya, says he has no time to think about loss. ""More are still coming, so we have to do something about that,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""It's very challenging mentally, I'd say, because you lose life. But what do you do about the next one?"" ""How are you going to respond?"" he asks. Such are the questions aid agencies are struggling to answer as fighting and famine push hundreds of thousands of Somalis to Dadaab, located near the border. The United Nations has declared famine in five areas in southern Somalia, including the capital of Mogadishu. The human catastrophe was triggered by the worst drought in more than half a century and compounded by decades of conflict, high inflation and increasing global food and fuel prices. In all, about 12 million people in the Horn of Africa region need assistance; Somalia is the worst hit. Originally built for less than 100,000 people, the Dadaab refugee complex now houses more than 400,000, while tens of thousands more cling to its edges. Many of the children who arrive at the camp are severely malnourished, according to relief workers. Some have spent weeks on the road with their mothers, walking at night to avoid the heat, braving dust and dirt storms. Extra beds have been added to the children's ward of a hospital, run by the International Rescue Committee. A six-month old, suffering from diarrhea and vomiting, weighs six pounds. He should be twice that. A listless, four-year-old girl is fed what looks to be fortified milk from a plastic mug; a hand props up her head. Still, they are the lucky ones, says CNN's Sanjay Gupta. About 29,000 children have died in the last month, according to U.N. estimates. And many who are sick will never recover. One such girl was Sarah. Her father, Aden Ibrahim, buried her body beneath the desert floor some two weeks ago. She was four. ""She needed more help,"" Ibrahim said then. ""We have not been given enough help because we have been given flour and maize only -- and a child who is sick will not get better on flour and maize."" The U.N.'s refugee agency is calling for more private and government donations for emergency operations in the Horn of Africa, warning that a lack of funds threatens future aid. The aid organization says it needs $145 million to cover operations through the end of the year, adding that it has received 45% of that amount so far. CNN correspondent David McKenzie recently revisited Ibrahim, who is now confined to his bed inside a makeshift tent. ""I haven't been able to do anything since I saw you last,"" said Ibrahim, weakened by fever and coughing fits. ""All I can do is lie in bed with my son.""","Fighting and famine push Somalis to Kenya's Dadaab complex .

"(CNN) -- A bare-chested man bursts athletically across the floor, flipping sideways, striking out a fierce kick, high above the heads of the screaming crowd. His rival hits back -- sliding across the space with a seamless stream of backflips, jump kicks, and aerial rotations, teetering on the corner of the mat, stretching backwards to recover his balance. We are in warehouse-looking arena in Midtown Atlanta, where the referee is calling 10 seconds remaining in the battle. The shirtless man explodes forward once more, from standing, shooting agressively into the air with final, winning flip. This is ""tricking"" -- a lightning-fast mix of martial arts, gymnastics and breakdancing that has spent 20 years quietly spreading across gymnasium floors and internet video sites, but is now set to burst out. Read this: The street kid who grew into a 'Snake Man' In the burgeoning world of tricking, 23-year-old Will Coneys is the new hero, the bare-chested, high-kicking victor in the Atlanta battle, and champion of tricking's first international ""Throwdown"" tournament on 24 August. Meet the tricker . Coneys says it all started when he was a child, in Arlington, Virginia. He sat watching wide-eyed as Jackie Chan and the Power Rangers blazed across the TV screen with superheroic stunts and frenzied action sequences. ""As a kid you think 'Wow, I want to do that!'"" he says. When he first heard of tricking it was little more than a hobby for likeminded teens with a fondness for impressive acrobatics. Coneys had spent much of his youth studying dance and teaching himself to do gymnastic tumbling moves before taking martial arts lessons aged 16 -- ultimately earning a first degree black belt in taekwondo. Through taekwondo he met the ""trickers,"" a loose collection martial artists who congregated after karate competitions in dojos or on sprung-floor gym mats to show their most impressive jump kicks. In stark contrast to the restrictive worlds of professional dance and rhythmic gymnastics, Coneys found tricking to be fast and free. He and his fellow trickers showcased their own distinctive styles and gradually absorbed techniques from hip-hop dancing, capoeira, cheerleading and free-running -- and anywhere else their creative interests took them. Read this: Mongolia's mind-bending contortionists . ""Now I grab inspiration from just about anything,"" says Coneys. ""I'll watch gymnastics, I'll watch martial arts movies or competitions, I'll watch dancing, even drawing and art and other artistic forms of expression. ""I pick up moves from action sports like skateboarding or bmx or motocross, and I'll start to break it down and change it into something I can do, on gymfloor or on grass, and put it in a different format for tricking."" The new champion of the Throwdown . In August, competitors from across the world assembled in Atlanta's Center Stage venue for tricking's inaugural Throwdown competition, arriving from as far away as Russia, Korea and Finland to meet the top athletes from the United States. Rules were drawn up to pit teams of three against three, or individuals in one-on-one bouts, giving trickers just 90 seconds to show off their skills. In full flow, tricking contests mirror breakdancing battles: turn-based competitions where athletes fire off runs in quick succession in a bid to impress the judges. Arriving as a wildcard -- only being invited to compete after another contestant was forced to pull out -- Coneys went head-to-head with highly regarded athletes at the competition. Over four battles, the judges scored him highest across the five criteria they assess -- including kicking technique and trick difficulty -- and he stole the individual title. Coneys believes the key to his success is his explosive technique, which sees him boosting his 5'6"" frame incredible heights into the air to throw breathtaking moves. The Throwdown's Sports Organizer Rory Bratter explains that Coneys' full-throttle style reflects the distinctive quality that sets tricking apart from more smoothly orchestrated gymnastic events. ""Watching a trick battle is like watching fireworks,"" he says. ""These guys are going up in the air and the things they're doing are so explosive and powerful. ""I think the explosiveness of tricking is really what makes it so exciting. That and the competitors feeding off each other and trying to step each other up -- saying 'Oh that's a great move, but watch this!"" and doing something even bigger."" Going big . Coneys says the sport ""clicked"" for him last year, and since then he's learned to use his movement across the gymfloor to express his own personality: ""For me, it's my way of taking everything that I feel ... and putting it into a physical form."" At the same time, tricking has reached maturity as a sport. Bratter -- a veteran tricker in his own right, who has been competing since tricking's early days in sport karate tournaments -- says the incredible growth in popularity owes a lot to YouTube, where videos of popular trickers have accumulated hundred of thousands of views. There is now a calendar full of meet-ups and open gyms where newcomers are encouraged to get involved and experience tricking firsthand. Top trickers are turning up in increasingly high-profile places, recently showing off their skills in movies, music videos, and at the VMAs and Grammy Awards. For Bratter the progress that the sport is making is ""incredible."" ""I've been in the sport about 20 years, and every year it just gets better and better and more and more crazy,"" he says. ""I mean, these guys are really pushing the limits. The level that we had last year compared to this year is completely night and day. ""I can't even imagine what next year is going to look like.""","Tricking is a sport combining elements of martial arts, gymnastics and dance .

"Swat, Pakistan (CNN) -- In a message of defiance to the Taliban, authorities in Swat have decided to rename a government college after Malala Yousafzai, the 15-year-old girl who was shot in the head after demanding education for girls. The college offers high school and undergraduate education for 2,000 girls and young women. The female students here were reluctant to appear on camera -- afraid they, too, may be targeted. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the October 9 shooting, which left Malala wounded. The students told CNN they were also afraid to attend the school, but were doing so anyway -- inspired by Malala and their right to seek an education. Malala's parents overjoyed after first visit in UK hospital . ""I myself think that education is important because women have no right in this society so, due to education, they can get their right in this Pakhtun society especially,"" said Gulalai, an 18-year-old undergraduate student studying statistics and economics. ""I think she's a very brave girl,"" said Mehreen, 17, who is studying chemistry, botany and zoology. ""She sacrificed her life for us, for education, that girls should take education for their bright future. For women it's very important in this society."" They are attending the Swat Valley's first degree college to be named after a woman. ""We always want to send a message across the world, that here we want to develop the female gender and we also want females to come forward in society,"" said Kamran Rehman Khan, a local government official. Asked if he was trying to send a message to the Taliban, too, he said, ""Yes for sure ... We just want to tell them we will not be deterred by their actions."" Arrests made in shooting of Pakistani schoolgirl Malala . The young women here are studying subjects as varied as English literature and economics to botany and zoology. They talk of becoming psychologists, lawyers, doctors and scientists. ""When you educate a girl, you educate the whole family, the whole race,"" said Talat Qamar, the school's principal. He vowed to continue offering girls and women an education, though he said he needs help. ""I think that we should be more secure,"" he said. ""I have asked the local government officers and the local police chief to provide me with more security."" Such determination and resistance were also visible among residents on the streets of Swat -- men and women who said they too will fight for females' right to education. ""Getting an education is like bringing in the light, being uneducated is complete darkness, you're like a blind man,"" said one. ""I have four daughters,"" said another. ""And yes, they all study."" Yet another resident summed it up this way: ""Both girls and boys need to be educated; without an education, girls and boys are nothing."" Yousafzai, who is undergoing treatment in a British hospital, was reunited Thursday with her parents. Malala has been thinking about school even while she lies in her hospital bed, Pakistan Interior Minister Rehman Malik told reporters after meeting with her family.

"(WIRED) -- The new Apple TV could be Steve Jobs' best sleight-of-hand trick yet. During his modest introduction of the device, Jobs called the Apple TV ""one more hobby."" But a closer look at the code and the hardware powering the Apple TV reveals that there's a lot more going on under the hood than the CEO shared. Interestingly, Jobs didn't mention that Apple TV runs iOS, the same operating system running on its flagship product, the iPhone, and some other big hits -- the iPod Touch and iPad. And there's more, too: The Apple TV's software may already be jailbroken, and some hidden software should eventually allow you to share the Apple TV's media with other iOS devices. These secret ingredients could be the recipe Apple needs to shake up the television industry. For years, Apple executives have labeled the set-top box a ""hobby"" product because of its mild success compared to blockbuster sellers like the iPhone and iPod. Now that Apple TV has been revamped into a streaming rental service with an arsenal of stealth features, maybe Apple has a chance to change the TV business -- if not today, perhaps later. ""The most important hint of Apple's real ambitions in the living room come from AirPlay, which puts iPhones and iPads in the driver's seat and makes the TV just an output device for the Apple ecosystem,"" said James McQuivey, a Forrester analyst, in a recent e-mail statement. ""Expect Apple to gradually push more and more in that direction, but as of this moment in 2010, Apple has not yet made a significant play for control of the TV."" Here, we round up the juicy tidbits we've heard about Apple's mysterious new set-top box. iOS and third-party app support . There's more than enough evidence proving that the Apple TV runs iOS. Dispelling any doubts, Apple recently posted a build of iOS 4.1 specifically for the Apple TV. This piece of information about iOS is important because of a new feature called AirPlay, which streams media from your iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch to the Apple TV. When Jobs demonstrated AirPlay, he only showed the feature working with an iPad's built-in video player, photo app and music library. Now that we know Apple TV runs iOS, it's likely that third-party apps such as MLB at Bat or ABC Player will be able stream media to the set-top box, too. DaringFireball blogger John Gruber confirmed that an AirPlay button is showing up in the MLB at Bat app, and he adds that apps using the built-in media controller will be able to integrate AirPlay. Long story short, you'll be able to wirelessly stream media from some third-party apps straight to your Apple TV with an AirPlay button. AirPlay is shaping up to be Apple's secret weapon to reshape home entertainment. In addition to AirPlay, the fact that Apple TV is running iOS means that -- in principle, at least -- it may someday be able to run applications from the iTunes App Store. For now, that capability is not included in Apple TV, but the underlying operating system certainly supports it, so Apple might open a TV App Store in a future software update. Jailbreaking hacks . Third-party app support will probably be limited for the Apple TV, but that's where the jailbreakers come in. In the same way that we're able to override restrictions on the iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch with a jailbreak, we should be able to run unauthorized apps on the Apple TV -- something Jobs would never advertise, of course. In fact, hackers already have a head start, because a tool called Shatter, which was used to jailbreak the newest iPod Touch, already works with the Apple TV, according to the iPhone Dev Team. That means we should be expecting hackers to code some unauthorized apps soon to unlock additional capabilities such as video conferencing via your Apple TV. On top of that, existing hacks for the old Apple TV should work, too. Dev Team member Will Strafach explained that ""the new AppleTV OS seems to be a mashup of the old AppleTV OS and iOS,"" meaning ""frappliances,"" plug-ins that add functionality to the old Apple TV, should work as well. 'Lowtide' app . The Unofficial Apple Weblog's Erica Sadun, a popular iOS programmer, took a close look at the Apple TV's software and discovered that it runs an application called Lowtide -- the software containing the set-top box's media interface. Sadun dug deeper and found lines of code that suggest that Lowtide might eventually be extended to other iOS devices. In other words, you should be able to share media from the Apple TV to your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad, whereas originally we thought we'd only be able to do the converse with AirPlay. This functionality would be comparable to a Slingbox or an EyeTV. Lowtide isn't readily available for Apple's iOS mobile devices yet, but iOS developer Dustin Howett has already managed to load Lowtide on an iPod touch running iOS 4.1, demonstrated in the video above. He recommended against doing it yourself, though, unless you're ready to reformat your iPhone on a regular basis just to turn it back into a phone.

"(CNN) -- Not too long ago, students had to craft an essay if they wanted to win a scholarship. Now, they just can craft a tweet. The Kentucky Fried Chicken Foundation is asking eligible high school seniors to tweet a photo that illustrates their commitment to education and enriching their communities. The KFC Colonel's Scholars winner, announced December 15, will receive up to $5,000 per year to pursue a bachelor's degree at a public university in his or her home state. KFC started the Twitter contest last year as a way of reinvigorating its scholarship program for the social media age. The competition saw over 2,800 applicants, with the winning tweet coming from California high school senior Amanda Russell: ""#KFCScholar Hey Colonel! Your scholarship's the secret ingredient missing from my recipe for success! Got the grades, drive, just need cash!"" Other organizations, perhaps weary of wading through applicants' lengthy essays, also are offering eager students ways to turn a 140-character message into money for college. Last summer Scholarships.com awarded a ""Short and Tweet"" $1,000 cash prize and Amazon Kindle e-readers to three students who tweeted winning answers to questions like, ""What would an extra $1,000 for college mean to you?"" ""No lengthy essay, no pile of paperwork -- just your thoughts, in real time,"" promised the contest's website. ""To enter, simply log on to Twitter ..."" In place of an essay, the University of Iowa's Tippie College of Business offered a full $38,000 scholarship to its MBA program for the best tweet from a prospective student. ""That's right, it's a 140-character application that pays $271 per letter,"" said the school's website. Why a tweet? Jodi Schafer, the University of Iowa's director of MBA admissions and financial aid, told USA Today that application essays were ""becoming unoriginal."" She said ""we're hoping that incorporating social media in the process will help bring back some of that creativity."" Applicants were encouraged to include in their tweet links to blogs, videos or Facebook accounts. The college plans to bring back the tweeting scholarship next year to international applicants. Competitions like these are done more for marketing purposes than finding qualified candidates, said Sree Sreenivasan, a digital-media professor who teaches classes on Twitter at Columbia Journalism School. He cited a scholarship sponsored by Dr. Pepper that was awarded to a girl who threw the most football passes into a giant Dr. Pepper can at the SEC Championship game. ""How is that better or worse than Twitter?"" he asked. Sreenivasan believes these scholarships get buzz because they are ""marketing to the extreme."" He said he would not be surprised to see more competitions like this in the future, because marketers are very imitative. This year's KFC scholarship competition explores students' creativity in a different way by asking them to tweet a picture instead of just a snippet of text. The ideal image should capture their high school experiences and collegiate dreams. KFC Public Relations Manager Rick Maynard says snapping pictures and sharing them online comes naturally to this generation of students, and the scholarship is a new way to connect with social-networking teens. ""The Colonel was a lifelong learner, reinventing himself at the age of 65 when he turned a $105 Social Security check into what would become a global chicken chain. He would have been thrilled to see how KFC continues to adapt to fit the changing consumer landscape,"" Maynard said. Maynard said KFC is watching for new technological trends to help the company decide what to do for next year's competition. In the meantime, students may submit photos until December 13, and the winner will be named around December 15.","KFC offers a $20,000 scholarship for the student who tweets the best picture .

"(CNN) -- Local favorite Andy Murray was a man under pressure but it seldom showed as he kept his ATP World Tour Finals bid alive on Tuesday. The Scot knew that anything other than victory against Canadian Milos Raonic would have eliminated him from the prestigious season-ending event in London. After losing his opening match to Japan's Kei Nishikori on Sunday, Murray raised his game as he won 6-3 7-5 while Raonic, who suffered his second straight defeat, hit 33 unforced errors. ""On Sunday, there wasn't much magic,"" Murray said on court after victory. ""Today, I came up with some good shots at the right moments. Milos didn't serve as well as he can. ""I played a solid match."" The Scot now needs to beat an in-form Roger Federer in both players' final Group B game on Thursday to be sure of reaching the semifinals. Federer tops the group with a 100% record, while both Murray and Nishikori have won one and lost one. ""It's always a pleasure to play against Roger,"" Murray added. ""He's one of the greatest players that's ever played the game so to get the opportunity to play him in an atmosphere like this is excellent."" Murray may well find that he doesn't receive all the support at the O2 Arena given the sizable Swiss contingent that greeted their favorite's 6-3 6-2 victory over Nishikori earlier on Tuesday. With two wins out of two in Group B, following a straight sets win over Raonic on Sunday, Federer is on course to continue his dependable displays at the tournament. 993 and counting... The 33-year-old, who needs just one set to go through, has reached the semifinals on all but one of his 12 previous appearances at the World Tour Finals. Should he reach the last four, he will match the record of Ivan Lendl -- who reached the semis on 12 occasions. A masterly display against Nishikori, the first Asian man to qualify for the World Tour singles, also took Federer to within seven wins of 1,000 career victories. Currently boasting 993 triumphs from 1,219 matches, only Jimmy Connors (1,253 wins) and Lendl (1,071) have previously broken a barrier that is testament to both longevity and class. ""It would obviously be cool to get there -- I think it's a great number,"" said the 17-time grand slam champion, to cheers and the sound of cowbells from a vocal Swiss contingent. He also has the chance to finish the year as No. 1 for a record-equalling sixth time, although any possibility of doing so will be dashed should Djokovic, who beat U.S. Open champion Marin Cilic in his opener on Monday, win all three of his Group A games. Nishikori, who lacked the poise he showed when beating Murray on Sunday, showered praise on the evergreen Federer afterwards. ""I never feel that he's 33,"" said the 24-year-old, who finished runner-up at this year's U.S. Open. ""He still looks young and plays amazing tennis."" On Wednesday, Group A hosts its second round of matches as Djokovic meets Stan Wawrinka while Cilic and Tomas Berdych both go in search of their first wins.","Andy Murray maintains World Tour bid with straight sets victory over Milos Raonic .

"London (CNN) -- Defending champion Martin Kaymer says that being back on The Old Course at St Andrews is ""paradise,"" while Hugh Grant likens the opportunity to compete as ""dying and going to golfing heaven."" The Alfred Dunhill Links Championship is a tournament like no other on the European Tour where the world's top golfers rub shoulders with acting and sporting legends in a four-day pro-am played over three Scottish links -- St Andrews, Carnoustie and Kingsbarns. Five of the six top ranked players in the world -- Luke Donald, Lee Westwood, Rory McIlroy, America's Dustin Johnson and defending champion Kaymer -- will challenge for a share of the $5m prize pot. This year, amateurs making a star turn include former Dutch footballer Johan Cruyff, cricketer Shane Warne from Australia and Hollywood greats Andy Garcia and Michael Douglas. ""It does not get better than this. This is just a magical place and when we get a week like we are getting now, it's going to be great,"" Michael Douglas said. Pros compete against each other in a traditional 72-hole strokeplay competition while also pairing off with an amateur to compete in a team event. Former England cricketer Ian Botham will play alongside John Daly, while 2005 winner Colin Montgomerie will once again pair Michael Douglas, who returns to play in the event after his much-publicized illness. ""I had my cancer bout so I used the Dunhill as a motivation to get my game together. I am playing with Colin Montgomerie. I played with him back in 2005 when he actually won this event. One of my big treats was to be his partner,"" Douglas said. Simon Dyson, the 2009 champion and recent winner of the Dutch Open will pair up with rock star Huey Lewis. ""Every time I play here, it haunts me. If you could get up at four or five in the morning and look west, you would see all the folds and ridges - its like nothing you could ever create. It's perfect,"" Lewis said. Not all the star golfers are teaming up with A-listers. Many, including Martin Kaymer, Ernie Els and Rory McIlroy, have chosen more familiar faces, to them at least, and will tee off with their fathers. But the prize for most unexpected and welcome visitor of the week goes to...the sun. Players and spectators have been basking in unseasonably warm temperatures (so far) at an event where bobble hats and waterproofs are usually essential.","Golf stars mix with A-listers from film and sport at European Tour event in Scotland .

"(CNN) -- In a sudden turn of events, North Korea on Saturday postponed reunions that were to start next week for families separated during the Korean War. A statement in North Korea's state news agency KCNA blamed South Korea and said the reunions could not be rescheduled until a ""normal atmosphere"" was restored for dialogue and negotiations. North Korea claimed it had made sincere efforts to negotiate with its southern neighbor, but accused the South's conservatives of ""reckless and vicious confrontations."" It also alluded to a recent South Korean scandal involving a leftist politician who is accused of plotting to overthrow the Seoul government in case of a war with the North, calling the recent case a ""witch-hunting campaign."" The North Korean statement also resumed referring to South Korea as a ""puppet regime."" The family reunions were to be held from Wednesday to September 30 in North Korea. The North also announced that it would postpone talks of re-opening tours at Mount Kumgang for South Koreans. This was the location where a South Korean tourist was shot by a North Korean soldier in 2008 for allegedly walking into an off-limits area. The cancellation of the family reunions comes less than a week after it appeared that tensions between the two Koreas were cooling. On Monday, the Kaesong Industrial Complex, which is a joint park and a key symbol of cooperation between the Koreas, re-opened after a five-month hiatus. This had re-ignited hopes of better relations between the two nations. The family reunions are highly anticipated events, as the last such reunion took place in 2010. The emotionally-charged reunions bring together hundreds of families divided by the Korean War, which occurred between 1950-1953. The first such family reunion took place following a landmark summit between the two Koreas in 2000. The meetings are bittersweet, full of tears and hugs from those who haven't seen each other in more than half a century. The chances of any of the divided family members meeting again are slim. A report released this week in South Korea reported that nearly 44% of the 129,000 people who registered in a database to meet their separated relatives have died.","North Korea postpones reunions of family members divided by war .

"(CNN) -- Haiti's poverty has been much discussed since its massive earthquake, but little has been said of its rich, and equally fraught, history. For African-Americans, Haiti's tragedy hits close to home. For more than two centuries the tiny, at times fragile, republic has inspired black political activism in the United States. Born of the influence of the French and American revolutions, Haiti, once prized as the jewel of the French Empire, changed the course of its history by engineering a revolution that startled the world. Once a colony of slaves under French rule in the 18th century, Haiti transformed itself into the first black republic and one of the first nations in the Western Hemisphere to outlaw slavery. It is a breathtakingly inspirational story: Slaves revolted en masse in 1791 under the leadership of Toussaint L'Ouverture, a brilliant statesman and military strategist who was influenced by the Enlightenment ideals of universal freedom and citizenship. Ultimately, the rebels defeated Napoleon's army and England before declaring independence in 1804. The founders of the American Republic had celebrated the news of revolution in France, but news of the revolt in Haiti didn't receive the same applause. News of this successful revolution led by slaves reverberated across the Caribbean to the United States and brought chills up the spines of whites -- including President Thomas Jefferson, who deplored the revolution and despised the new republic's existence. But it emboldened African-American slaves. Fears that Haiti's successful revolt could inspire slave insurrections in the United States led to increased restrictions on the movements of blacks in Southern states. Coupled with concerns over the stability of slavery in Cuba, Haiti represented a powerful threat to the comfort, safety and security of the new American Republic. In antebellum America, and during the Civil War, black and white abolitionists saw Haiti as an example of the potential and possibilities of black political leadership. In many respects, Haiti's liberation from French rule proved to be a high point, sadly followed by a seemingly endless cycle of economic poverty, foreign intervention -- including American occupation from 1915 to 1934 -- government corruption, and dictatorships. Yet there is another, equally important aspect of Haitian history, one that black Americans identify with deeply. During the period of antebellum slavery and after, Haiti profoundly impacted the imagination of African-American political activism. On the eve of the Civil War, Frederick Douglass spoke for most African-Americans when he referred to the ""bright example"" of Haiti. He called Toussaint Louverture ""the noble liberator and law-giver of his brave and dauntless people."" Douglass and other blacks considered Toussaint one of the greatest self-made men of the 19th century. Caribbean migration to the United States, beginning in the early 20th century, transformed black political activism. Immigrants such as Marcus Garvey and Hubert Harrison emerged as street speakers in Harlem. And the Haitian Revolution remained a touchstone for radical black political activists. C.L.R. James, a Trinidadian-born author and activist, wrote a 1939 history of the revolt, ""The Black Jacobins,"" that remains a classic in Africana Studies scholarship. The immigration of Haitians in increasing numbers after the passage of major immigration reform in 1965 has allowed Haitian culture to establish critical beachheads in cities such as New York, Boston, and Miami. Haiti's culture -- its food, music, flag, and proud revolutionary tradition -- resonates alongside of contemporary African-American culture. The popularity of hip hop musician Wyclef Jean, the proliferation of Haitian sports stars, and the prevalence of Kreyol [Haitian Creole] words such as ""Sa k' Pase"" in rap music attest to Haiti's influence. As the Haitian people prepare to rebuild their republic, we would do well to remember that the tragedy of Haiti is not a failure of black power but ultimately the frustration of it, one that involves mistakes by not only Haitians  but by Western powers as well, including the United States. Haitians are the descendants of the great black revolution for liberation, imbued with a history of wrestling with crises. The spirit of the Haitian people is resilient and resourceful. These values will serve them well even during this unimaginable devastation. The Haitian people can also take comfort in the knowledge that African-Americans continue to find deep kinship, one forged in the shared crucible of slavery as well as heroic resistance against this system, in their current plight and efforts to rebuild Port-au-Prince. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Peniel E. Joseph.","Peniel Joseph: For 200 years, Haitian revolution has inspired black activism in the U.S.

"(CNN) -- He used to terrorize defenses, but now former Liverpool and England striker Michael Owen is tearing up the turf after clinching his first Group 1 winner. Seven years ago Owen set up his own yard -- Manor House Stables -- and on Sunday he witnessed his first top-flight success as Brown Panther, a horse he also bred, romped to victory over a stellar field in the Irish St Leger at The Curragh. ""He's the apple of my eye as everyone knows and he was pretty spectacular out there,"" said Owen, who fought back tears amid the emotion of the win following a superb ride by jockey Richard Kingscote. ""Richard was a bit closer to the pace than we envisaged but he's a relentless galloper and he quickened again,"" added Owen. ""He kept galloping and he's a superstar."" Owen was thrust with Liverpool, Manchester United and England jerseys to sign in the winners' enclosure, which was likened to a mosh pit at the music festival Glastonbury. Brown Panther showed the sort of turn of pace with which Owen used to bedevil defenders during his playing days amid a world class field, including Ascot Gold Cup winner Leading Light, trained by Aidan O'Brien. It proved a tough weekend for O'Brien, a day after his star horse Australia suffered a shock defeat in the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown Saturday. As such, Owen proved the star turn of Irish racing at the weekend, a fitting result following the death just two months earlier of Treble Heights, the mother of Brown Panther. The Tom Dascombe-trained stallion had finished third at the same race at the Curragh in 2012, but this time his rivals failed to match his pace heading to the winning post as Brown Panther added to previous victories at both Ascot and Goodwood. ""The first thing to say is he [Richard] gave him a brilliant ride,"" said Dascombe, who hinted Brown Panther is now likely to compete at the Long Distance Cup race at British Champions Day next month at Ascot rather than return to the Melbourne Cup where he was eighth a year ago. ""I was close to pulling him out but there aren't too many Irish levers so you have to run. The horse never lets us down."" In an interview with CNN earlier this year, Owen, who also houses two of Wayne Rooney's horses at his stables, admitted that horse racing wins can only come a close second to scoring goals in his footballing heyday. Introduced to the sport of kings by his dad Terry, Owen also revealed he still struggled with the concept of merely watching a sporting occasion from the stands. ""With football you always feel in control. On the pitch, you can always do something to make something happen. Your destiny is in your hands in many ways,"" he said.","Ex-England striker enjoys his biggest-ever horse-racing win at Irish St Leger .

"Washington (CNN) -- Man up. Afraid. Feckless. Those are terms used to describe House Speaker John Boehner and his plan to sue President Barack Obama. And those are just from from critics on the right. Since Boehner announced his intention nearly two weeks ago, reaction has been mixed -- at best. Republican anger over the President's sidestepping of a stalemated Congress to use his ""pen and phone"" on issues of immigration, minimum wage, LGBT rights and energy production is for real and far reaching. Boehner's attempt to answer what he considers a rogue presidency is to sue. ""The President has circumvented the American people and their elected representatives through executive action, changing and creating his own laws, and excusing himself from enforcing statutes he is sworn to uphold,"" Boehner wrote in an op-ed on CNN.com over the weekend. But sharp critics say taking Obama to court isn't the right one. Naysayers on the right ... Chief among them is Erick Erickson, editor of the conservative blog Red State. ""John Boehner's lawsuit is nothing more than political theater and a further Republican waste of taxpayer dollars,"" he wrote Monday. He also said Boehner needs to ""man up"" in more ways than one. ""John Boehner and the House Republicans may lack the testicular fortitude to fight President Obama,"" Erickson wrote. Another conservative naysayer, columnist and author Andrew McCarthy, called Boehner's actions ""feckless."" ""Boehner and Beltway Republicans are essentially saying, 'We can't use our power because Obama and his media friends would say mean things about us. But our lunatic conservative base is demanding action. So let us file a lawsuit so we can say we did something,' "" McCarthy wrote (sarcastically), dissecting Boehner's suit threat. ""Now that's leadership!"" McCarthy added. For those two, anything short of impeachment is weak and chalked up to political drama in an election year. Proof that political foes do see eye to eye, the White House gleefully seized the opportunity to promote Erickson. Spokesman Eric Schultz tweeted, ""I had a bunch of reporters ask me for response to Boehner op-ed this weekend. Guess I should have sent them here,"" which is a link to Erickson's column. ... and the left . Critics on the left, who obviously don't support impeachment but are critical of Boehner, are making similar claims. They point to holes in Boehner's claim. Commentator Sally Kohn offered this suggestion to Boehner in a CNN.com op-ed: ""Please exercise your (authority) and pass some laws to help America instead of wasting taxpayer money on a frivolous lawsuit that is nothing more than a flagrant partisan stunt."" As for Obama, he dismissed the threat, saying, ""So, sue me."" ""Middle class families can't wait for Republicans in Congress to do stuff,"" he said last week. The merits of a suit . Boehner has given few details and specifics of his complaint. In his op-ed, he points to the use of executive action, says the President is ""ignoring"" 40 bills the House passed focused on job creation and insists Obama ignores ""laws written."" But he has failed to specify which of Obama's 182 executive actions are problematic and which laws he's ignored. In a memo to House Republicans, Boehner indicated the areas of concern pertains to issues of foreign policy, health care, energy and education -- a wide swath of issues. But Boehner has provided few details because the depth and merits of a suit are still unclear. Before the suit is even drafted, the House must pass an authorization to sue Obama. Then a bipartisan committee with a majority of Republicans will formulate the terms of the suit by dissecting all of his actions and determining which have the most legal weight in a court. The lawyers Boehner consulted on the issue wrote that the House must ""demonstrate a concrete, particularized injury, caused by the defendant, which can be remedied by a court."" Perhaps providing more insight in a column, the lawyers, David Rivkin Jr. and Elizabeth Price Foley, were more specific about areas of concern than Boehner.

"(CNN) -- Did the Internet kill Lee Rigby? No. Could the Internet have saved Lee Rigby's life? Perhaps. Those, at least, were the conclusions of the 192-page report, the most detailed that a cross parliamentary committee has ever authored, on the gruesome murder of the British soldier Lee Rigby by Muslim converts Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale in London in May 2013. In December 2012, Adebowale expressed his intention on an unnamed social network, reported by many to be Facebook, to carry out the public execution of a British soldier. But the company hosting this exchange didn't pass on the information to British intelligence and so the opportunity to pinpoint Adebowale was lost. ""This was highly significant,"" noted Malcolm Rifkind, the chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee which carried out the 18-month investigation. ""Had MI5 had access to this exchange at the time, Adebowale would have become a top priority. There is then a significant possibility that MI5 would have been able to prevent the attack."" Indeed, the report went as far to suggest that popular networks like Facebook have become ""safe haven for terrorists"" because messages sent within their services aren't accessible to British intelligence agencies like MI5. So what, exactly, should be the responsibility of Silicon Valley companies when it comes to monitoring the illegal intentions of their users? They ""need to play their part,"" insists Rifkind. ""None of the major U.S. companies we approached proactively monitor and review suspicious content on their systems, largely relying on users to notify them of offensive or suspicious content. They appear to accept no responsibility for the services they provide."" Prime Minister David Cameron went even further in condemning Silicon Valley companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter. ""The Committee is clear and I agree that they have serious concerns about the approach of a number of communication service providers based overseas,"" the PM told Parliament. ""Their networks are being used to plot murder and mayhem. It is their social responsibility to act on this. And we expect them to live up to it."" Cameron's accusations have triggered a predictable storm of outrage. Some commentators, already paranoid about the supposedly apocalyptic threat of Islamic terrorism, have accused Facebook of ""having blood on its hands"" and of ""not giving a monkey's"" about the fate of Lee Rigby. Others, already paranoid about the role of the British government in snooping on its citizens, claim ""war and tyranny,"" rather than Facebook, which that feeds terrorism and that it's ""dangerous"" to blame Internet companies for Rigby's murder. The truth, however, is more complex than either side recognizes. Both Rifkind and Cameron misunderstand Silicon Valley. For all their ideology of making the world a better place, companies like Facebook are multi-billion dollar big data operations focused on selling advertising around the user-generated-content on their networks. They've never had and never will have any ""social responsibility."" That's why Facebook relies on their unpaid users, rather than paid editors, to monitor suspicious activities: peer-to-peer security is free. This its appeal to Facebook. But Rifkind and Cameron also misunderstand contemporary electronic media. They assume that it's a top-down system that, like 20th century postal service or the telephone, can be manageably monitored by state security services like MI5. What they fail to realize is that the explosion of self-broadcasted data from Web 2.0 companies like Facebook has dramatically changed the nature of security and surveillance in the 21st century. Ninety per cent of all the world's data has been produced over the last two years and Facebook users alone are sharing almost 2.5 million pieces of content every minute. Rifkind and Cameron are playing to the xenophobic gallery by suggesting that Facebook is, somehow, to blame for Lee Rigby's death. We can't blame Silicon Valley for this gruesome public execution any more than we can blame Vodafone or BT for terrorist plots hatched over the telephone. But that doesn't completely excuse Facebook, whose unwillingness to actively police the content on its own network is itself deeply troubling. Two contradictory forces are changing everything about contemporary surveillance and security. On the one hand, the state now has the digital tools to watch almost everything that its citizens are doing on the network; on the other, we are all producing so much data that its beyond the ability of any centralized agency to monitor all this information. How we legislate this contradiction by trying to provide ""new tools"" for our security agencies is critically important. It will determine the complexion and boundaries of individual liberty in our networked age.","Lee Rigby's killer posted online about wanting to murder a British soldier .

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- My partner and I recently took our mothers to Las Vegas for a week for Mother's Day. It's not our favorite city, but for a pair of 60-somethings who can sit at the penny slot machines for hours, it was heaven. When they were not being robbed by one-armed bandits, we saw a couple of shows and had some amazing dinners. We also enjoyed trying to figure out which women were hookers and which were just dressed like one. And of course saying ""public drunkenness"" is pretty redundant after 11 a.m. But that's why we go to Vegas, right? Life on the Strip. What happens here stays here ... and all that good stuff. By the end of our trip, the four of us had seen just about everything you would expect to see in a place nicknamed Sin City -- except for faith-based protesters. Funny, a week of walking up and down the main artery of the self-proclaimed heart of moral debauchery, and nary a Bible verse could be heard. In the many times I've been to Las Vegas over the years, I've never seen a religious protest. And yet let a midsize city try to add sexual orientation to its municipal nondiscrimination policy or a high school senior bring a same-gender date to prom, and you would think it was the apocalypse. The Bible doesn't state that one sin is greater than another, but you wouldn't know that by counting the number of comments that quote Scripture on news stories about the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered community. Compare them with how many address murder, or the environment, or the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and well, the word ""hypocrite"" comes to mind. I am never ashamed to say I follow the teachings of Christ, but I am not always proud to say I am a Christian. That's because I am bothered by the continual mutilation of my religion's basic principle of love by the extremists in my religion who construct a hierarchy of sin -- which does not exist in the Bible -- for no other reason than to protect their own prejudices. We've seen this throughout this country's history, and perhaps with the exception of abortion, no current issue illustrates this transgression more so than gay rights. Some conservatives might attend church only twice a year, but ask their opinion about gays in the military. They can find Leviticus 18:22 blindfolded, handcuffed and sinking underwater: ""Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind; it is an abomination."" Rarely do you hear them mention the other ""sexual sins"" in Leviticus, such as making love to your wife while she's menstruating. There are some people who say Jesus freed us from the old laws with one side of their mouths while using old laws to condemn GLBT people with the other. Many turn to the destruction of Sodom as proof against homosexuality. But the King James version lists fornication, greed and lying as sins committed in Sodom as well, and never specifies which particular sin caused God's wrath. In fact, the word ""Sodomite,"" which some like to toss around as an anti-gay insult, is a mistranslation and is not used in the original Hebrew text. The actual word is ""kadesh,"" and it does not refer to the city, its inhabitants or a specific sexual act. It refers to the occult male prostitutes in the shrines, just as ""kedesha"" refers to the female equivalent. Neither word reflects sexual orientation. It may be convenient to say Sodom was all about homosexual people, but historically and scripturally, that isn't accurate. This is why I, like so many other Christians, do not follow a literal interpretation of the Bible. I'm not ducking Leviticus, I'd just rather go directly to the source. Concepts get lost in translation, and we all know history is filled with influential people and institutions that have defined religion for the masses based upon their own selfish needs. For example, King Henry VIII, the man who authorized the first English translation of the Bible, was married six times and essentially had the British Empire separate from the Roman Catholic Church so he could divorce in peace. Then there's King James, whose own writings suggest he was secretly gay or bisexual, according to historians such as Michael B. Young  and Caroline Bingham. He was directed to marry for the sake of the throne before authorizing the version of the Bible that swapped ""kadesh"" for ""Sodomite"" in the first place. Hmm, where have we heard that story -- closeted gay politician with an anti-gay policy -- before? But theology and history aside, it is clear from the lack of consistent reaction to and organization against the litany of other present-day sins that a large number of people who call themselves Christians do not follow the literal interpretation of the Bible either. So, if some of us are picking and choosing which Bible verses to follow, why are so many opting to pick and choose verses that appear to condemn homosexuality and not the one against marrying a woman who isn't a virgin? If sin is sin, why such Christian angst directed at the GLBT community and not the greedy corporate community, which, quite frankly, has more direct impact on the average person's life? The answer is simple: Those who are uncomfortable or fearful of someone who is different from them sometimes hide behind religion to gain power, nurture their ignorance and justify their prejudices. It's no different from Christian slave owners using Scriptures to feel better about enslaving Africans, or men pointing to Jezebel as a way to keep women out of the clergy, or Bob Jones University picking verses that supported the school's ban on interracial dating. The extremists aren't fighting gay rights because of sin and honoring Leviticus 18:22. If they were, then where are the faith-based organizations spending millions trying to make adultery a crime punishable by death, as suggested in Leviticus 20:10? Is 18:22 more true than 20:10, or does it just support a more common and entrenched prejudice? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: The Bible doesn't state one sin is greater than another; sin is sin.
Conservatives don't use Scripture to condemn murder, he says, but often do against gays .
Granderson: Some rarely attend church, but they can find Leviticus 18:22 blindfolded .

"(CNN) -- At age 59, Denzel Washington may have something new: a franchise. The two-time Oscar winner added to his string of successes this weekend with ""The Equalizer,"" which had no equal at the box office, opening with an estimated $35 million in ticket sales. It's the 15th time in 15 years that a Washington film has debuted with $20 million or more, but not one of those movies has been -- or had -- a sequel, let alone a franchise. Denzel Washington: The essential roles . That may change with ""The Equalizer."" It has been widely reported that Sony, the studio behind the action thriller loosely based on the '80s TV series, hopes it will spawn at least a sequel. The film's solid debut, one of Washington's best, certainly makes that a solid prospect. Of course, Washington's career itself is something of a franchise. As this weekend's box office shows, audiences are far from tired of seeing this star in star vehicles, righting wrongs and dispensing justice, violently when necessary. The only difference is that Washington, as he nears his 60th birthday this December, may finally be set to play the same character in more than one movie. A sequel is already in the works for ""The Maze Runner,"" which yielded the top spot at the weekend box office, but managed to hold off the debut of the stop-motion animated film ""The Boxtrolls"" for second. Meanwhile, that other star for the senior set, Liam Neeson, didn't fare nearly as well as Washington, as ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" slid from second place all the way to seventh. Ticket sales dropped by two-thirds in its sophomore weekend. As for the year's top movie, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is now at $319 million and counting in domestic theaters, ranking behind only ""The Avengers"" and ""Iron Man 3"" among Marvel's mÃ©lange of mega-hits. Domestic weekend box office estimates from Exhibitor Relations Co. (final numbers available Monday afternoon): . 1. THE EQUALIZER -- $35 million . 2.

"(CNN) -- Every day, refugees and migrants risk their lives as they seek a new life. Now, a new report from the International Organization for Migration has put a figure to the number of victims: at least 40,000 deaths since 2000. More than half of those who died -- some 22,000 -- were trying to get to Europe, the IOM said. Nearly 6,000 more migrant deaths occurred along the U.S.-Mexico border and another 3,000 deaths from migration routes including Africa's Sahara Desert and the waters of the Indian Ocean, according to the group's research. ""Our message is blunt: migrants are dying who need not,"" said IOM Director General William Lacy Swing. ""It is time to do more than count the number of victims. It is time to engage the world to stop this violence against desperate migrants."" The IOM report, published Monday and titled ""Fatal Journeys -- Tracking Lives Lost during Migration,"" puts the number of those killed trying to reach Europe at nearly 4,000 since the start of 2013. More than three-quarters of those victims died in the first nine months of this year, many of them drowning after being trafficked in unseaworthy vessels from the shores of the Middle East and North Africa across the Mediterranean. Two shipwrecks off the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa last October, in which more than 400 migrants died, made headlines around the world and prompted calls for action. Italy's navy launched Operation Mare Nostrum to try to find and rescue stranded migrants. Nonetheless, there have been many more shipwrecks and many more deaths in the year since. Just this month, witnesses told the IOM that as many as 500 people had died, including women and children, when human traffickers intentionally sunk their boat in the Mediterranean off Malta. Only 11 survivors have been found. Some of those on board were fleeing conflict in Syria or Gaza; others were looking for the chance to escape persecution or poverty and build a better life. Eritreans and Syrians made up the largest number of those arriving in Italy so far this year, the IOM said. Italian navy finds dozens of bodies in migrant boat . Amnesty International: 'Survival test' Rights group Amnesty International released a new report Tuesday, accusing the European Union and its member states of ""imposing a survival test on refugees and migrants."" Its research puts the number of those killed in the Mediterranean so far this year at at least 2,500 people. ""In the absence of safe and regular routes into Europe, accepting the risk of drowning in the central Mediterranean is the price many refugees and migrants must pay to access asylum or job opportunities,"" it said. The group calls for Europe to do more, pointing out that while Italy has shouldered the burden of migrant rescues in the Mediterranean over the past yea, it is unwilling to do so indefinitely. This is partly because it then takes responsibility for those rescued, who often want to reach other European nations. If Italy does scale down its operation without a new system in place or a better response by the European Union border agency, Frontex, many more lives will be lost at sea, the human rights group cautions. Amnesty International also warns that with the current unrest in the Middle East and long-running conflicts elsewhere, the number of people trying to reach Europe is unlikely to fall. Tens of thousands of people are trapped in increasingly lawless Libya, a major transit nation, and are seeking a way out, the report said. With the sealing off of land routes via Turkey, Greece and Bulgaria, many see no option but to embark on the dangerous journey by sea. ""In 2013, 48% of all irregular entrants and 63% of all those arriving irregularly by sea to the EU came from Syria, Eritrea, Afghanistan and Somalia, countries torn by conflict and widespread human rights abuses,"" the report said. 'Laughing' traffickers ram boat full of migrants and kill 500, survivors say . 'Harsh response' to migrants . The IOM warns that the true number of migrants killed is likely to be ""considerably higher"" than the number documented for its report. ""Although vast sums of money are spent collecting migration and border control data, very few agencies collect and publish data on migrant deaths,"" said IOM research chief Frank Laczko. Many migrants disappear and die without a trace as they make perilous journeys across deserts or seas. ""The paradox is that at a time when one in seven people around the world are migrants in one form or another, we are seeing an extraordinarily harsh response to migration in the developed world,"" said Swing. ""Limited opportunities for safe and regular migration drive would-be migrants into the hands of smugglers, feeding an unscrupulous trade that threatens the lives of desperate people. We need to put an end to this cycle. ""Undocumented migrants are not criminals. They are human beings in need of protection and assistance, and deserving respect."" By highlighting the awful toll of migration, the IOM hopes to discourage would-be migrants from falling into the hands of unscrupulous criminal gangs and traffickers, as well as pressuring developed nations to change their policies to create more safe avenues of legal migration. U.S.-Mexico border . An estimated 230 migrants died between January and September of this year trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border, the report said. Because information from the region is so patchy, the figures don't include the likely several hundred people who die in Central America each year as they make their way north to the border. Between fiscal year 1998 and fiscal year 2013, a total of 6,029 migrants were found dead on the U.S. side of the border, the report said. About 100 lives a year have been lost on average in the seas bordering Australia, although the number has dropped off significantly this year, the IOM said. Most of those who travel by boat depart from Indonesia, with the vast majority in recent years coming from Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran and Sri Lanka. CNN's Lindsay Isaac contributed to this report.","IOM: At least 40,000 migrants have died since 2000, more than half trying to reach Europe .

"(CNN) -- Nine commuter aircraft were grounded for safety inspections Tuesday at Chicago's O'Hare airport after a federal security inspector climbed onto them by grabbing sensitive outside instruments, the Transportation Security Administration said Wednesday. ""It delayed a lot of folks getting to where they had to go yesterday,"" said American Eagle spokeswoman Andrea Huguely. ""This was something we had never experienced before."" The inspector used the total air temperature probe and the jetway to haul himself through the open doors of seven of the nine planes he inspected, a TSA official said. The inspector aimed ""to look for and test, among other things, access vulnerabilities or areas were someone with ill intent could gain access to the aircraft,"" the TSA said, adding: ""Aircraft operators are required to secure each aircraft when left unattended."" Sam Mayer, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Union, said the maneuver could have damaged the probes. Pilots use readings from the probes to gauge the probability of icing. ""Apparently the TSA inspector hoisted himself up using the TAT probe as a stirrup. He repeated the same procedure with nine aircraft. Most TAT probes have a painted decal on the side that reads 'NO STEP,' "" he said. ""We caught it this time, but who knows if this has happened other times ... and with other planes that are out there,"" Mayer added. He said pilots examine their planes before take-off, but they might not spot something like a part damaged in an inspection. ""Pilots are the last line of defense. We do our pre-flight inspections, but we don't have a system in place to check for broken parts,"" he said. Huguely said the airline's own inspectors checked out all of the aircraft, did not find any damage, and put them back in service by 10:45 a.m. Tuesday. She said the airline is in touch with the TSA ""and we are working through this issue with them."" TSA spokeswoman Ellen Howe said the inspector did not intend any harm. ""It is not TSA's intent to cause delays or potential damage to aircraft as a result of our inspections,"" she said. American Airlines, which owns and operates American Eagle, could face fines over the incident, she said. ""The inspector was able to gain access to the interior of seven of the nine aircraft inspected, which is an apparent violation of the airline's security program,"" Howe said. The inspector was not identified. ""TSA is reviewing the inspection results and, depending on the conclusion, could take action with the airline up to and including levying of civil penalties,"" Howe said. American Eagle said in a statement that it was ""confident that it followed all proper security procedures."" But, ""if not observed by vigilant Eagle employees in Chicago, the actions of this inspector would have been unknown and could have jeopardized the safety of our customers and crew because of potential damage to the sensitive equipment mounted on the aircraft fuselage,"" the airline said. ""American Eagle is also concerned that the TSA inspector's method of physically hoisting himself up to the jet bridge using a part of the aircraft could have placed him in physical danger.""","Inspector grabbed instrument used to measure outside air temperature .

"(CNN) -- ""Matchmaker"" isn't a job that appears on Claudette Breve's rÃ©sumÃ©, but she's been responsible for more than 100 successful wedding proposals. Part-time actor Rudy Rasmussen spends much of his leisure time on stages across New Orleans. Catch him performing and you'll note that he's fit and trim, despite making dozens of dinner reservations every day. In less than a minute, either of them can spew a list of ideas to fill a travel itinerary focused on romance, family, business or Southern culture, including directions, prices, operating hours, weather conditions and insider tips. Walk up to their desk at the Ritz-Carlton New Orleans, and it's like meeting Google in human form. Defining the job . ""Concierge"" is a French term that evolved from the phrase ""comte des cierges,"" or ""keeper of the candles."" It dates to medieval times, when both candles and keys were required at night to open the doors of a castle and cater to the needs of visiting nobles. Nowadays, the concierge is also the keeper of cufflinks, toothpaste, chargers, combs and hair gel. ""Whether on business or leisure travel, no one wants to spend too much time trying to coordinate, plan, organize, et cetera,"" said Jeanne Mills, president of the U.S. branch of Les Clefs d'Or (The Gold Keys), an international organization of professional concierges with more than 3,000 members worldwide. Members of Les Clefs d'Or are seasoned pros with proven track records of making the mundane memorable. Mills has been a concierge in Las Vegas for 23 years and is currently the chief concierge at the MGM Grand. ""My favorite part of the job is the reward that comes with playing an instrumental part of so many special moments in people's lives. Guests I took care of more than a decade ago have never forgotten me,"" she says. ""We're approachable, and we're not snobs!"" That's the message Rasmussen would like guests to know. He makes every effort to overcome misconceptions about the job, such as the belief that the main purpose of a concierge is to make reservations and hand out maps. Those essential services are only the tip of the iceberg. The concierge ""to-do"" list is ever-changing, and Rasmussen thrives on the revolving roles. One day, he's getting stale bread from the kitchen so visiting kids can feed the ducks at City Park, and the next he's helping facilitate the freezing and shipping of breast milk for a traveling mother on her first post-maternity-leave business trip. All major resorts and five-star hotels provide concierge services to their guests. Many boutique hotels also offer the services, often on a smaller scale. Mills says advanced technology is bringing more savvy travelers to the concierge desk. She believes that access to so much information online actually makes the demand for a concierge even greater. ""Guests are seeking the guidance of concierges now, more than ever, to help them filter the barrage of information and to seek personal insight."" ""Never hesitate to go to your concierge, even if you think your request is impossible,"" said Breve, who has been making the impossible possible for more than 25 years, primarily as senior concierge at the Ritz-Carlton on Canal Street. She says she feels honored to be an ambassador not only for the hotel but for the city of New Orleans -- and she has no fear of being replaced by an Internet search engine. ""Does a computer have a personality and charm or hands-on experience? I'd say no. Can a computer get you courtside seats for playoffs or a front-row seat at a sold-out concert? That's the difference between a computer and a concierge."" Even so, many frequent travelers say they have never ventured to the concierge desk. What keeps them away? Here are a few myths debunked. Myth No. 1: A hefty tip is required. Reality: Tipping is at your discretion. There is no set fee for using a concierge. However, as with so many jobs in the hospitality industry, gratitude is certainly appreciated. Cash tips are appropriate, especially if you are asking for more than directions or help with an easy dinner reservation. Les Clefs d'Or maintains that while gratuity for great service is customary, it's never expected. If you do tip, placing cash in an envelope or handing a tip to a concierge during a departing handshake is appropriate. A verbal ""thank you"" as you're passing the desk is meaningful, as is a handwritten note or a post-trip e-mail. Jeff Brooks, a New Jersey-based financial consultant, says most of his business travel details are worked out in-house, but he'll never forget the concierge who helped him skate off thin ice one February. ""I was in New York City without a dinner reservation on Valentine's Day,"" says Brooks. The hotel concierge came to the rescue, securing a table at a very nice restaurant, resulting in a memorable romantic evening. Brooks tipped the concierge $20. That's in line with recommendations from hotel guru Glenn Haussman of Hotelinteractive.com, who says special requests merit a tip of at least $10 or $20, depending on time spent. ""If the concierge is getting you something that would be otherwise impossible, then you are looking at a tip of $50 or more,"" Haussman said. Consider your own timing as well. ""If you want to get their attention, it's always a good idea to tip the concierge at the start of a trip. Ten dollars to say 'I appreciate you looking out for me while I am here' will go a long way."" Myth No. 2: They are primarily meant to serve elite clientele. Reality: The concierge desk is a perk available to all hotel guests. Fashion stylist Cathie Arquilla often travels for business, but she's always been wary of using a concierge. ""I'm actually sort of intimidated by them. I figure they're for big businessmen on an expense account who want something fast and reliable, a sure bet where money is no object."" Arquilla is the perfect example of a savvy traveler who's packing a flawed perception. It's true that celebrities have been known to keep a concierge or two busy. One high profile guest at the Ritz-Carlton New Orleans called ahead to request that all the furniture in his room be set up so that he was always facing east, whenever sitting or lying down. ""I don't know if it was feng shui or if it was just a personal proclivity. It took a little bit of work, but we got it together,"" Rasmussen said. Breve once chased down a pet psychic for a celebrity guest whose dog was feeling down. ""If it's not illegal or immoral, we'll do it,"" Rasmussen said. One of Breve's most memorable non-celebrity requests came to her at 11 a.m. on a busy Saturday. A man wanted to propose in the French Quarter at 1 p.m. In two hours, she found a stunning location, made the arrangements and found a photographer. Passers-by thought they were filming a scene from a movie. Having ready answers for day-to-day demands is also critical for concierge success. On most days, Breve says, she answers the question, ""How do I take the streetcar?"" more than 100 times. And Rasmussen finds himself constantly explaining the difference between Cajun and Creole cuisine. Myth No. 3: Only overnight guests currently at the hotel can ask for help. Reality: They serve anyone visiting the hotel for any reason, and hotel guests can start the process upon booking. Many people assume the concierge desk is available only once you've arrived at your destination. Not true! Rasmussen says he does his best work when clients call or e-mail ahead of time. More time to work on your agenda means you're likely to get your preferred picks. Hotel concierges also cater to people visiting their properties for special events, such as business conferences or weddings. Maybe you've checked in elsewhere but you're a bridesmaid who somehow forgot to pack your shoes, which were dyed to match your dress. That's when it's time to call on the concierge. The bottom line . Part travel agent, part magician, the concierge is dedicated to defining details and supplying travel joy. In medieval times, they may have held the candles and the keys, but the modern-day concierge is an expert at guarding items even more precious: guest sanity and satisfaction.","Some hotel guests are intimidated or confused by concierge services .

"(CNN) -- An American detained for more than two months in the United Arab Emirates faces up to seven years in prison for stealing police handcuffs, an allegation he says he only confessed to after being tortured. A judge in Dubai is expected to hand down a verdict next week against Adam Foster, 30, of Burdett, New York, whose case has become the focal point of a grassroots letter-writing campaign via Facebook that calls for his release. ""It's hard to be hopeful at this point,"" Foster told CNN by telephone Thursday from Dubai, where he has been detained since his February 26 arrest. ""I don't want to think I'm going to be getting out of here in a few days and then find I have to stay for seven years."" The UAE has charged Foster with theft of government property, possession of police paraphernalia and theft at night. If found guilty, he faces up to seven years in prison. The U.S. State Department confirmed that Foster was detained. American consular officers met him on February 28 before UAE authorities released him on bail March 1. Officials in the UAE did not respond to a CNN request for comment. But investigators claim Foster stole a pair of official police handcuffs during questioning in an unrelated matter at a Dubai police station the night before was due to leave the city, according to his attorney, Yousuf Khalifa Hammad. Foster has said it was a coincidence, saying he was brought in for questioning because he was in possession of a bottle of Korean rice wine -- a parting gift from colleagues. He was released without charges. Foster said he found the handcuffs a day earlier on the ground at a mall parking lot, about a mile and half from the police station where he was questioned. ""I was thinking 'souvenir,'"" Foster said. ""They were lying on the ground. So I picked them up."" Foster, who was on his way home after a six-week stint as a contractor for Dubai Energy Water Authority, was arrested after authorities found the handcuffs in his luggage during a routine security screening at the Dubai airport. He said he was pulled off the plane, questioned and taken to a police station, where he was interrogated twice by two officers. It was during that second round of questioning, after hours of maintaining his innocence, he said he was beaten and forced to confess. Foster claims he was told to take off his shoes and socks, and handcuffed to a chair while one of two officers used a coil to whip the bottom of his feet. He also said he was punched in the face. ""The pain was unimaginable,"" Foster said. ""So I told them I did it. I told them 'I'm sorry.'"" Foster said he then signed a confession written in Arabic. ""I have no idea what it said,"" he said. Hammad said there is little recourse for Foster as there were no witnesses to the alleged torture, though court documents show he initially said he was innocent, confessed and then recanted. ""It is up to the judge to consider this,"" Hammad said. Foster said he recanted his confession after he was released from jail. He said he did not tell U.S. consular officials who met with him while he was in jail nor did he file a complaint against the officer in the case because he was afraid he would be beaten again if he professed his innocence. Robert H. Arbuckle, a public affairs officer at the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi, declined to comment because Foster had not authorized consular officials to act on his behalf with the media. The U.S. Embassy strongly advises travelers to the UAE and those transiting through the country to avoid carrying any type of law enforcement or security item, including weapons, body armor and handcuffs, according to its web site. It warns that people caught carrying such items will face criminal charges. ""I don't understand how they can do this?"" Foster said. ""How can they put me away for seven years with no proof whatsoever?"" Foster has been living at a Dubai hotel since authorities released him on March 1. In lieu of bail, UAE officials confiscated his passport to ensure he would appear in court, Hammad said. Nearly 1,000 people have appealed to Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to the United States, and Jeffrey D. Feltman of the State Department's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs to intervene on Foster's behalf. ""I urge you to do everything in your power to ensure Adam is treated fairly on May 19 with consideration of his illegal torture and coerced confession,"" according to a sample letter posted on Facebook. ""Americans all over the world are counting on you and the State Department to speak boldly in opposition to human rights violations."" Hundreds of others have posted messages of support. ""Imagine yourself in his place for about five minutes. Then do something to help him,"" urges Facebook user Bruce Varner. Foster said he was hanging on to hope that the letters from friends and family might make a difference in his case. Last year, UAE authorities detained Nicholas Moody of Nevada for more than three months on charges of possessing weapons accessories -- parts that could accompany a gun, though no firearm itself. Moody was arrested during an 18-hour layover in Abu Dhabi while heading back from Iraq. A judge later dismissed the charges.

"(CNN) -- A victim of Washington state's notorious ""Green River Killer"" has been identified 29 years after her disappearance, when a relative saw a TV movie about the serial murderer in April and family members gave DNA samples to investigators, authorities said Tuesday. The victim was Sandra Denise Major of Rochester, New York, who was a 20-year-old prostitute when she got into a truck on December 22, 1982, and was never seen again, said Sgt. Cindi West of the King County, Washington, sheriff's office. Gary Leon Ridgway, dubbed the Green River serial killer, pleaded guilty in 2003 to killing 48 women, including Major, though her remains hadn't been identified at the time, West said. The 48 guilty pleas gave Ridgway more murder convictions -- though not necessarily more slayings -- than any other serial killer in U.S. history. Watch: Inside the mind of the 'Green River Killer' In 2011, he pleaded guilty to a 49th murder, in a plea deal to avoid the death penalty. Ridgway, 63, is serving life sentences without parole in Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla, Washington, corrections spokeswoman Judi Feliciano said Tuesday. ""The family said that one of the cousins was watching a movie that re-enacted the catching of the Green River Killer,"" West said, referring to the two-part Lifetime network movie ""The Capture of the Green River Killer."" Ridgway killed mainly runaways and prostitutes in the Seattle-Tacoma area between 1982 and 1998. The first victims turned up near the banks of the Green River south of Seattle, giving the killer his criminal nickname. ""Since (Major) was last known to be in Seattle and ... she was working as a prostitute, (her family) contacted detectives,"" West said. Major's family released a public statement thanking investigators ""for working together to bring closure to our family."" ""We are grateful to finally know what happened to Sandra after all these years,"" the family statement said. ""We were aware of the lifestyle Sandra lived but she was still a part of our family. We last saw Sandra here in New York in 1982. We received a letter from her in 1982 with a Seattle postmark but no return address. We never heard from her again and did not know what happened to her. ""Recently one of Sandra's cousins saw a television show about the Green River Killer. We learned that the remains of some of the victims had not been identified. Since the last contact with Sandra had been the letter from Seattle, we decided to make contact with investigators to see if Sandra was one of the unidentified victims,"" the family statement said. Two days after Major got into the truck, her disappearance was reported by a friend, on December 24, 1982, West said . On December 30, 1985, at the Mountain View Cemetery in Auburn, Washington, authorities found remains that were determined this week as belonging to Major, West said. Also found in the area of the cemetery site were the remains of two other women, though not at the same time that Major's remains were discovered, West said. One of those sets of remains belonged to Kimi Pitsor, and the other remains are still unidentified, West said. A total of three sets of remains in the Ridgway case have yet to be unidentified, West said. ""If we can get someone who knew the last three to come forward with some missing person DNA, that would be awesome,"" West said. 2010: Look back at 'Green River Killer' CNN's Karan Olson contributed to this report.","A cousin watches Lifetime's ""The Capture of the Green River Killer"" in April .

"(Good) -- A few months ago, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a UK-based nonprofit that does amazing work in the field of poverty and social exclusion, issued a surprising report that deserves a much wider readership. The study evaluated the success of a radical new way of working with the long-term homeless. Instead of soup kitchens, shelters, and mobile health clinics, the charity Broadway simply selected 15 homeless people that their outreach workers had found the hardest to reach (one had been on the streets for an astonishing 45 years), asked them what it was they needed to change their lives -- and then bought it for them. One asked for sneakers and a prepaid cell phone, one needed cash to pay off a loan, one wanted a TV and a comfy chair (to make the move into hostel accommodation more attractive), and one requested a camper van. Each of them received the money to purchase exactly what they asked for, with the condition that they also had to choose a personal ""broker"" who would help them write a budget. Good: ""Cultural Tourist Agency"" teaches Angelenos how to walk in the city . Two refused to engage with the pilot project altogether, but of the 13 who agreed to take part, 11 are now off the streets. Several have entered treatment for addiction and mental health issues, some have reconnected with their families, and all are exhibiting an enhanced ability to function independently in society (i.e. paying bills, signing up for welfare, and turning up for training courses, etc.). The participants' own comments give a clue as to why the intervention worked so well: . I've got a 32-inch telly and a DVD. I've come a long way from the street! The option of going to homeless organizations [for support] didn't enter my mind. I know I'm an entirely different creature from most homeless people. I didn't just go for the most expensive, I did it as if it was my money. I'm getting into thinking more [about how the money is spent]. I've got to be honest here, it wasn't just the individual budget, it was the fact there was [co-ordinator] there as well... We was meeting [regularly] to discuss it, and I'd actually gone from the stage of wanting nothing to do with these people, to actually looking forward to seeing them. Good: The 10 most wildly racist things from this anti-Muslim protest . This was only a small-scale pilot project, but its results are compelling and make a lot of sense. Broadway's outreach workers, some of whom confessed that they were initially afraid that the homeless people would ""milk"" the system or spend the money on drugs, testified to the power of treating each person as an individual, respecting their autonomy, and helping them to build a relationship of trust and accountability with an ""establishment"" figure. The upfront expense of a budget and the cost of providing personalized one-on-one ""broker"" support are easily outweighed by the amount the taxpayer will spend over time on police, prison, and medical bills (at least in the UK, where the study was carried out and where social services are more generous). This month, the pilot is being expanded to become a central part of Broadway's regular outreach efforts in the City of London; it will be fascinating to see whether these kinds of successes can be replicated on a larger scale. © 2010 Good.

"Washington (CNN) -- After several years of what it calls broken promises, the U.S. government has singled out Thailand, Malaysia, The Gambia and Venezuela for taking insufficient action against human trafficking. In its annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report, released Friday, the State Department downgraded the four nations to Tier 3, the lowest possible ranking it gives for a country's response to fighting modern-day slavery. The report says there is evidence of forced labor and sex trafficking in Malaysia and Thailand. It highlights Malaysia's problem with migrants from other Asian nations who seek work on farms, factories and construction sites only to be trapped and have their passports taken and wages withheld. In Thailand, the report says, tens of thousands of migrants from neighboring countries are being exploited in the commercial sex industry, on fishing boats or as domestic servants. And in Venezuela, women and girls are often lured from poor interior regions to tourist centers with the promise of false job offers. When they arrive, they are often forced into prostitution. The report ranks governments based on their perceived efforts to acknowledge and combat human trafficking, advance reforms and target resources for prevention, protection and prosecution programs. It divides nations into three tiers based on their compliance with 11 ""minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking."" -- Tier 1 countries include governments fully compliant with the minimum standards. -- Tier 2 countries don't fully comply, but are making significant efforts to do so. (A Tier 2 Watch List includes countries with a high number of victims, or where the numbers are significantly increasing. It also includes countries where there's insufficient evidence of acceptable efforts to improve anti-trafficking programs). -- Tier 3 countries do not fully comply with the minimum standards and have not shown the U.S. they are making significant efforts to do so. A Tier 3 status can also mean less money as the U.S. government may use the designation to withhold or withdraw assistance that is unrelated to trade or humanitarian aid. Those countries could also face U.S. opposition in obtaining development aid from international financial institutions like the World Bank or International Monetary Fund. More than 20 million people worldwide are believed to be ensnared in some form of human trafficking, according to the International Labour Organization. Luis CdeBaca, ambassador-at-large of the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, cited Thailand and Malaysia's repeated noncompliance in meeting minimum anti-trafficking standards. ""Malaysia continues to have a victim care regime that basically locks up the victims,"" Cdebaca said. ""In Thailand, we have a lot of beginnings that will hopefully come to fruition, but the report doesn't look at promises. It looks at results."" In Venezuela, women and girls are often lured from poor interior regions to tourist centers with the promise of false job offers. When they arrive, they are often forced into prostitution. Four other countries had faced possible downgrades to Tier 3 -- Afghanistan, Barbados, Chad and the Maldives. Cdebaca said each of those demonstrated over the past year that their governments were serious about stopping human trafficking. ""In Afghanistan, for the first time now, we're seeing 14 traffickers were convicted. We're even seeing the conviction of soldiers,"" says Cdebaca. While the United States puts itself in the Tier 1 category, the State Department acknowledges its own problems fighting trafficking, something that hadn't been done in the report until 2010. This year's report highlights several new groups within the U.S. that may be vulnerable to traffickers, including teens living on Native American reservations and members of the LGBT community. Other Tier 3 countries are Algeria; Central African Republic; Cuba; Democratic Republic of Congo; Equatorial Guinea; Eritrea; Guinea-Bissau; Iran; Kuwait; Libya; Mauritania; North Korea; Papua New Guinea; Russia; Saudi Arabia; Syria; Uzbekistan; Yemen; and Zimbabwe.","U.S. State Department issues annual Trafficking in Persons Report .

"(CNN) -- In an auction featuring memorabilia from the Beatles, Madonna and Elvis Presley, it was Michael Jackson who proved to be king. The red and black jacket, winged shoulders and all, that the late pop star wore during his zombie-ridden ""Thriller"" video fetched a $1.8 million bid at this weekend's Julien's auction in Beverly Hills, California, according to the auctioneer's website. The winning price was exponentially above the estimated bid of $200,000 to $400,000. Part of the proceeds will go toward the Shambala Preserve where Jackson's two Bengal tigers, Thriller and Sabu, have been living the past five years. The jacket had been given to Dennis Tompkins and Michael Bush, the singer's longtime costume designers, to use as a reference for concert performances of the ""Thriller"" song. It includes an inscription to them on the jacket's lining, and the sleeve is signed, ""Love Michael Jackson."" Its sale came exactly two years after the then 50-year-old Jackson was killed by a surgical anesthetic called Propofol, which a Los Angeles coroner ruled killed the singer in combination with several sedatives found in his blood. The jacket wasn't the only piece of history from the late King of Pop that was part of the auction. The signature fedora Jackson wore during his Bad Tour was sold for $16,250, a handwritten note to friend Elizabeth Taylor went for $5,625 and a signed pillowcase fetched $3,584. And a bidder paid out $330,000 -- more than 10 times what Julien's had expected to get -- for one of the famous, shiny, crystal-covered gloves that Jackson wore during the 1980s. ""Michael Jackson has an unbelievable fan base,"" Darren Julien, the auction house's president, told CNN earlier this month. Other pieces of history, from other members of music royalty, were also featured at the auction. While gold records and instruments were common items, others were more practical -- like Frank Sinatra's boots (selling for $2,500) and his 1986 Jaguar car ($19,000). as well as the U.S. Army-issued sewing kit of Elvis Presley's that went for $1,536. The King of Pop's closest competition at the auction was the Beatles, which had a number of items for sale. A signed postcard from Liverpool's finest sold for $5,504 and Paul McCartney's bass guitar fetched $14,080. But oft-diminished drummer Ringo may have gotten the last laugh, with the cape he wore in the movie ""Help!"" selling for $37,500 -- about five times the estimate.","NEW: One of Jackson's crystal-covered gloves sells for $330,000, 10 times the estimate .

"(CNN) -- Barenaked Ladies have nixed their plans to play at SeaWorld after viewing CNN's ""Blackfish"" documentary. ""This is a complicated issue, and we don't claim to understand all of it, but we don't feel comfortable proceeding with the gig at this time,"" the band said on a Facebook post late Wednesday night. ""The Seaworld folks have been gracious, and extended us invitations to the park to learn more about what they do, and how they do it."" A park spokesman told CNN that the show has been taken off the theme park's concert schedule. The decision to cancel the Canadian rock band's performance came two days after drummer Tyler Stewart posted a tweet saying the group is ""looking at options"" after viewing the documentary. The documentary -- which aired on CNN last month -- tells the story of the SeaWorld trainer who was killed in 2010 by an orca named Tilikum. Fans launched an online petition last week asking the group to cancel after the Barenaked Ladies announced it would perform at SeaWorld's Orlando park on February 15, 2014, during its ""Bands, Brew & BBQ"" events. Mike Garrett of St. Catharines, Canada, posted the petition on Change.org asking band members to watch ""Blackfish"" and ""learn how SeaWorld and other captive display facilities such as Marineland in Niagara Falls have for decades exploited marine mammals solely for profit."" Garrett said he was ""disappointed"" when he heard the group was scheduled to play there ""in light of all the horrific information we're learning."" ""I'm hoping to grab the band's attention on this issue and ask them, on behalf of all their animal-loving fans, to reconsider performing there,"" Garrett wrote. His petition had gained more than 9,200 signatures by Wednesday afternoon. It worked. ""We here at Barenaked Ladies have made a decision based on what we feel.

"(CNN) -- After it spent decades buried in library archives, a newly discovered story from playwright Tennessee Williams was published this month. The story, titled ""Crazy Night,"" appears in the new issue of The Strand mystery magazine released March 25, and coincides with the 70-year anniversary of Williams' classic play ""The Glass Menagerie."" Andrew F. Gulli, managing editor of The Strand, recently uncovered the 14-page manuscript at the University of Texas at Austin's Harry Ransom Center. Gulli says he was researching the Mississippi-born writer when he came across what he describes as a ""treasure trove"" of Williams' personal papers and documents. Williams is one of America's best-known and most revered playwrights. During the peak of his career in the 1940s and '50s, he was praised by critics and scorned by social conservatives for tackling taboo subjects of the time, including rape, incest and homosexuality. Many of his plays were turned into hit movies featuring Hollywood stars such as Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor. Williams twice won the Pulitzer Prize and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Williams died in 1983. Gulli was initially skeptical that the story had never before been published, but several experts, including an agent for Williams' literary estate, said they'd never heard of it. ""I thought it was captivating,"" Gulli says. ""It's raw but has a fresh voice and shows a great deal of maturity for his age."" Williams, who was born in 1911, wrote ""Crazy Night"" in his early 20s, years before his Broadway success with plays such as ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof."" In the semi-autobiographical story, a troubled college freshman faces flunking out of school on the last night of spring term. It explores themes of love and deceit and includes a thinly veiled reference to Williams' romance with one of his college classmates. ""To me, it's a great highlight to find something new from somebody I grew up revering,"" Gulli says. Gulli has a knack for finding long-lost works. In the last five years, he's discovered previously unpublished stories and essays from authors including Agatha Christie, Graham Greene, H.G. Wells and Mark Twain. But Gulli says he has a soft spot for Williams. ""To me he's as relevant today as he was when his works were first published,"" Gulli said. Indeed, many of Williams plays are still performed today. ""The Glass Menagerie"" first premiered in New York on March 31, 1945, and a revival recently wrapped a successful run on Broadway. What's your favorite Tennessee Williams play?

"(CNN) -- The price of being a dumb tourist just went up. Authorities in Rome have slapped a 20,000 euros ($24,800) fine on a Russian tourist caught carving his name into one of the city's most famous historic landmarks. The 42-year-old man was apprehended on Friday after a guard at the Colosseum, the Roman amphitheater in the center of the city, saw him carve the letter ""K"" in a section of brickwork. After police caught up with him, the man was found guilty of causing ""aggravated damage,"" fined and given a four-month suspended sentence. The graffiti was found on a ground floor section of the nearly-2,000 year-old structure where restoration work was taking place, according to the Italian ANSA news agency. ""The damage to the monument is notable,"" site superintendent Mariarosaria Barbera told ANSA. ""The incision cut out part of the surface of the structure and compromises its conservation and image."" ANSA says the Russian was the fifth tourist caught carving graffiti on the Colosseum's walls this year. Internet outrage . The earlier incidents involve two Australians -- a father and son -- and a Canadian and a Brazilian, both teenagers. Rome's ancient amphitheater, which attracts about four million visitors a year, is no stranger to vandalism. The damage reached a peak in during the 1930s heyday of fascist leader Benito Mussolini, the Guardian newspaper says. The Colosseum isn't the only world-famous historic structure to suffer such well-publicized indignities. In 2013, the parents of a 15-year-old Chinese tourist made an apology after their son carved his name on an ancient Egyptian temple. A fellow Chinese traveler spotted the the graffiti, reading ""Ding Jinhao was here,"" at the 3,500 year-old Luxor Temple and posted a picture of it on social media. Ding's family was then tracked down by outraged internet users, prompting the apology. While the Chinese youngster may have escaped with a parental reprimand, as the Colosseum case demonstrates, future scrawlers may soon be paying higher prices for their misdemeanors.

"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN) -- Carol Byrd feels anxious at night when she leaves her home, just a few blocks away from West Florissant Avenue. She fears for her life. She lives near the epicenter of protests that erupted after the killing of Michael Brown in this St. Louis suburb last August. Byrd sought solace Sunday at her church. ""I feel calmer, but I'm still deeply disturbed,"" said Byrd, 49, after service was over at Greater St. Mark Family Church, which has served as a sanctuary for protesters and will be a haven again if things get rough. Byrd said someone in her apartment complex was shot a few weeks ago during protests. She fears that demonstrations could turn violent again. ""I don't know what the verdict will be,"" she said about the grand jury investigating Brown's death. ""I don't know when it will come."" That's a question that hangs heavily over Ferguson, a city that remains on edge as word spreads that a grand jury looking into whether to indict police Officer Darren Wilson has yet to make a decision. Jurors are set to reconvene Monday. Amina Stevenson, 26, said everyone is doing their best to deal with this period of extreme anxiety. ""I know God is protecting me and my family,"" she said. Stevenson says she believes the grand jury decision on whether to indict Wilson may be postponed because no one wants trouble during Thanksgiving. ""But they've already ruined it,"" she said. Voices of Ferguson: What do you want the world to know? The Rev. Tommie L. Pierson Sr., pastor at Greater St. Mark, knew he would have to soothe troubled souls on this Sunday. He was also keenly aware that reporters were in the house of God. ""I hope that I won't disappoint you,"" he said before starting his sermon. ""I'm going to try my best not to say something juicy that for the rest of my life I regret."" Pierson has hardly been guarded on what he deems as injustice and extreme police brutality in Brown's killing. He said that if there is no indictment against Wilson, authorities will be sending a message that black lives don't matter. He asked his flock to rely on their faith to get them through turbulent times. ""The path to moving forward is not always smooth,"" he told CNN. ""We must do it by faith."" A tale of two streets in Ferguson . But, he said, it wasn't enough for African-Americans to show their anger on the streets. He preached that black people must turn tragedy into empowerment. His sermon focused on every person's obligation to vote and participate in the community. Lack of African-American civic engagement in Ferguson, which is 68% black, has been a key theme in discussions about reforming aspects of how the city operates. ""The power to get what you need is already in our hands. We are part of the people, and we must participate,"" Pierson said from the pulpit. ""Pain will force us to do something."" Pierson, like other community leaders, appealed for calm from protesters and relief from God. ""You alone know what the grand jury will do,"" Pierson said, looking up.

"(CNN) -- Imagine a world where anyone could be like Tony Stark in the ""Iron Man"" movies -- manipulating 3-D images in thin air. That future could be a lot closer than you think. A Silicon Valley startup called Meta is creating augmented-reality glasses that will let you interact with virtual objects in the real world. ""It elicits this very magical effect where you could literally place holograms on the real world, reach out and touch them with your hands,"" said Meron Gribetz, Meta founder and CEO. Gribetz, 28, is the brains behind the technology. Originally from Israel, he moved to the United States seven years ago to study computer science and neuroscience at Columbia University. As a student, he began contemplating what the next computer could be. ""All I knew was that I wanted an infinite computer screen, and I wanted to be able to touch holograms and stick them on parts of the real world,"" he said. Gribetz launched the company in December 2012 and moved to California with help from Y Combinator, which helps fund and nurture promising tech startups. He now lives and works with 25 employees in a Los Altos mansion overlooking Silicon Valley and has four other properties where employees sleep at night. ""We all live together, work together, eat together,"" he said. ""At certain key points of the year we have mattresses lined all around the living room."" It's not a typical work environment, but what Gribetz is creating is far from ordinary. He believes Meta glasses could change computing as we know it. ""The fundamental game changer that we're bringing to the table is this application that allows you to take your phone, tablet and soon personal computer and project them in 3-D in your environment when they're not actually there,"" he said. If this happens, it could usher in the next generation of computing using your hands and a pair of glasses. He believes the potential applications are endless. ""We've had surgeons apply for this because they want to be able to perform surgery while seeing a 3-D CAT scan,"" Gribetz said. ""We've had architects apply for this because they want to be able to build houses with their hands collaboratively."" Eventually, Gribetz says, the glasses could also be used for 3-D Skype sessions. ""You could actually put on these glasses and see a 3-D render of your mother from all the way across the country in New York sitting on the chair in your room here in California,"" he said. The first version of the glasses, a developer edition, is selling for around $700. The glasses are set to be delivered in December, Gribetz said. Meta is also creating 3-D apps that range from virtual Lego to surgery applications. But soon developers from around the world will have a chance to weigh in. ""We're going to start off by perfecting five or six applications that showcase the differences from other form factors,"" Gribetz said. ""But soon thereafter we're going to open this up to developers worldwide, and they're going to come up with things that we couldn't even imagine."" In a demonstration video provided by Meta, a woman uses the glasses to sculpt a virtual vase with her fingers before printing it in 3-D, while others play chess on a virtual board. So how does the technology work? ""The glasses are ... a two-part system. The first is a 3-D output display that's built with a stereoscopic pair of see-through augmented-reality glasses. The 3-D output display allows you to see the holograms in 3-D,"" Gribetz said. ""The 3-D scanner scans your environment and tells the computer where to place the 3-D graphics relative to the user and the world."" Unlike Google's rival Glass eyewear, which has a smaller screen and is primarily controlled by your voice, Meta glasses could have the potential for an infinite screen controlled by your hands. ""Google is going to take one category of wearable computing, the notification machine,"" Gribetz said. ""Meta is a graphical solution that's going to allow people to build 'Iron Man'-like interfaces and interact with digital information in a much more natural way graphically."" Until then, there are some limitations. The first version can only be used indoors. The company also is working on increasing the field of view, improving latency issues and making the glasses smaller and less bulky. Within two years, Gribetz says, the glasses will be as sleek as a pair of Ray-Bans. But stylish specs with built-in computer technology do raise the inevitable questions about privacy. ""I'm highly concerned with those issues. ... I have a fundamental belief that when you and I are talking and you're recording information about me, I should know about it,"" Gribetz said. ""There will be an LED light indicating that you're being recorded if that's the situation."" If Gribetz has his way, hardware like the desktop computer, keyboard and mouse could soon be a thing of the past. ""We're looking to change the way people interact with computers by making them much more natural,"" he said. ""Every application from the 2-D world can enter the 3-D world now. It really represents a huge shift from 2-D computing.""","A startup is creating glasses that let you interact with virtual objects in the real world .

"(CNN) -- Former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords completed an 11-mile cycling event Saturday, marking another milestone in her recovery from a 2011 mass shooting. She was greeted with cheers and applause at the finish line. Alongside her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, Giffords crossed the finish line of El Tour de Tucson riding a recumbent bike, which has three wheels and puts the rider in a reclining position. Organizers say some 9,000 people participate in the annual ride, which they call America's largest perimeter cycling event for cyclists of all ages and abilities . Giffords was an avid cyclist and athlete until she was critically injured by a gunshot wound to her head. In January 2011, Jared Lee Loughner opened fire at a Giffords meet-and-greet outside a Tucson supermarket, killing six people and injuring 17 others. Loughner pleaded guilty in 2012 and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Giffords' injuries forced her to resign from Congress. Earlier this year, she threw out the first pitch at the congressional women's softball game in Washington -- a game she used to play in. Kelly said his wife has been practicing for the Tucson ride and also uses a treadmill and rowing machine. ""It's important to stay active, and she wants to do everything she used to do before,"" Kelly told CNN affiliate KGUN. Giffords gets most of her pedaling power from her left leg, Kelly said, which ""makes it a little more difficult, but she's been working really hard at it."" Giffords and Kelly rode the 11-mile Fun Run around downtown Tucson on Saturday. As for next year, Kelly says, ""it's one step at a time. I think she said next year -- and I'm not holding her to this -- but next year she wanted to do the 40-mile.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Labor Secretary Tom Perez on Thursday panned New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's comments that he's ""tired"" of the minimum wage debate. ""Chris Christie's got his head in the sand if he's getting tired about the minimum wage,"" Perez said according to Bloomberg Politics. President Barack Obama and Democrats have led the push to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10, and the issue has made its way onto the campaign trail this year. ""Chris Christie needs to talk to his economists, who will tell him that 70 percent of GDP growth is consumption,"" Perez said Thursday. The criticism came just days after Christie said he was ""tired of hearing about the minimum wage"" at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce conference on Tuesday. ""I really am,"" the Republican governor and potential 2016 hopeful said. ""I don't think there's a mother or a father sitting around the kitchen table tonight in America saying, 'You know, honey, if our son or daughter could just make a higher minimum wage, my God, all of our dreams would be realized.'"" ""Is that what parents aspire to for our children?"" Christie asked. ""They aspire to a greater, growing America, where their children have the ability to make much more money and have much great success than they have, and that's not about a higher minimum wage."" Before the Labor secretary chimed in, the remark drew fire from other Democrats, and White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest even quipped during a briefing Wednesday that people living on a minimum wage are those who are really tired. Christie also used his time at the podium to make a 2016 prediction. ""I am convinced that the next president of the United States is going to be a governor,"" Christie said. ""We've had this experiment of legislating .. and getting on-the-job training in the White House. It has not been pretty."" Christie isn't the only governor considered a potential Republican presidential contender: Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker also have been a part of the 2016 discussion. But when it comes to Republican governors, Christie has an edge as the chairman of the Republican Governors Association. Christie isn't the only politician floated as a 2016 contender who discussed the minimum wage this week. On the Democratic side, Sen. Elizabeth Warren talked about her mother's minimum wage job that helped support her family when she was a child. ""She got a minimum wage job in an America where a minimum wage job would support a family of three and that's how we survived,"" Warren, who has advocated for a higher minimum wage, said Monday while campaigning for Rep. Bruce Braley in Iowa.","Christie said he's ""tired"" of hearing about the minimum wage .

"New York (CNN) -- Her social security card is in the name of Joann Prinzivalli, and so is her driver's license. But her birth certificate has the name Paul Prinzivalli. This is not a case of identity fraud. Prinzivalli said she has been trying to get the gender listed on her birth certificate changed for years. ""I know what was on my birth certificate was a mistake. It was an error,"" Prinzivalli said. ""You didn't necessarily have to have medical testing (to say you were born male or female.) All they did was take a look at you."" States that already allow gender changes on birth certificates without proof of surgery include California, Vermont, Oregon, Washington, the District of Columbia and the state of New York -- but not New York City, says Chase Strangio, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBT project. In New York City, for Prinzivalli to get her gender changed on her birth certificate, she would have to show proof of ""convertive surgery,"" or what some call gender reassignment surgery. But a proposed change in the health code would mean that anyone who wants to change the gender listed on their birth certificate will no longer need proof of surgery to make that change. Instead, someone can simply get an affidavit from a licensed health professional confirming the need for a gender change. New York City Councilman Corey Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said a proposed list of professionals who could sign off on the change ranges from physicians to mental health counselors. The proposal has the backing of Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito. ""For me, this is catching up with what other states and municipalities have done,"" Johnson said. Both Johnson and the ACLU agree that the change would benefit those who struggle financially and need public assistance with food, medical care and housing. ""Birth certificates are often the only form of ID that low income New Yorkers have when applying for jobs or public benefits,"" Johnson said. At the federal level, Strangio said people who opt to change their gender classification on social security cards and passports no longer need surgical proof of a surgical gender change. Prinzivalli has not been able to have the surgery because of health issues, she said. Despite losing 75 pounds, she said her weight is still too high and surgery would not be safe. It's the same situation for David Gomez, 57, of Queens. His identification cards label him a female and he had hoped to get surgery so that he can legally identify himself as a male. But Gomez said a prior stroke keeps him on the medicine Plavix, which the FDA warns increases the risk of bleeding and can be a risk during some surgeries. Facebook's 'real name' policy . Both Gomez and Prinzivalli point out: Surgery is also expensive. Strangio said a full genital reconstructive surgery can cost anywhere from $5,000 to $75,000. Worse, Strangio said, NYC's language about the kind of surgery it requires to make a legal gender change isn't specific. ""There's no such thing as one surgery related to gender surgery,"" Strangio said. Strangio pointed to the fact that some people making transitions choose to do full genital reconstructive surgery, others do what is called ""top surgery,"" where only the chest area is changed, while others simply take hormone therapy. But Peter Sprigg, of the Washington-based Family Research Council, said he believes that changing your gender on your birth certificate is a completely different issue. ""This is a record of a particular historic event,"" Sprigg said. ""If you change that record, you are essentially falsifying the record of that historic event."" Prinzivalli disagrees. ""The historic event is that a child was born,"" she said. Prinzivalli doesn't like labeling her transition as being from ""male to female."" Instead, she believes she was born transgender and is now a female who is ""surgically unchanged."" ""I know who I am,"" she says. Transgender veteran's documents . Sprigg said his organization is against the idea of sex changes as a whole and doesn't believe the law should recognize them. ""The only time we believe you should be able to is, if you can demonstrate medically that the doctor at the time (of birth) made an incorrect determination of your biological sex,"" Sprigg said. ""That's not really what we're talking about here."" Some members of the transgender community may be like Prinzivalli and have driver's licenses, social security cards and even passports with the gender they display outwardly. But knowing that one document exists with a gender they don't identify with can be psychologically damaging, Strangio said. ""If you live as one gender and this one document that you can never change, that lists you in a different gender, that can cause significant psychological harm that I think [is] also important to weigh,"" Strangio said. New York City's Department of Public Health will allow public comments at a hearing November 17.","Proposal would allow transgender people to change birth certificate gender .

"Washington (CNN) -- At 21 weeks of age and 45 pounds each, Apple and Cider would normally be prime candidates for Thanksgiving dinner this year. Instead, the two California-born turkeys got a new lease on life Wednesday when President Obama pardoned them in a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House. ""Now for the record, let me say that I feel pretty good to stop at least one shellacking this November,"" said Obama, referring to the staggering defeat his party suffered in congressional elections this month. Obama celebrated the 63rd anniversary of the national Thanksgiving turkey presentation by sparing the two birds. Their names were chosen from more than 200 suggestions by California schoolchildren, a White House statement said. Apple was designated the official national Thanksgiving turkey, and Cider was the alternate. Obama said the turkeys were among 20,000 born at a Modesto farm last summer chosen to ""strut their stuff"" in a competition for the presidential pardon. ""It's like a turkey version of 'Dancing with the Stars,' "" the president said. ""Except the stakes for the contestants were much higher. Only one pair win the prize: life, and an all-expenses trip to Washington."" Two turkeys that ""didn't quite make the cut"" were delivered to Martha's Table, a local nonprofit organization that serves homeless children and their families, the president said. Having escaped execution, the two birds will head to George Washington's Mount Vernon Estate and Gardens for a Christmas display and then live out their days in a specially built enclosure, the White House statement said. While the tradition of the president receiving a national Thanksgiving turkey began with Harry Truman in 1947, the first official presidential turkey pardon was given in 1989 by George H.W. Bush.","The president celebrates the 63rd anniversary of national Thanksgiving turkey presentation .

"(CNN) -- On June 15, President Barack Obama described the Gulf oil spill in a prime-time address as ""the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced."" A government report released last week, however, said almost 75 percent of the oil that gushed from BP's ruptured well into the Gulf of Mexico has been collected, dispersed or evaporated. The rest remains on or just below the surface of the water in the form of a light sheen or weathered tar balls. Much of the remaining oil is ""being degraded and cleaned up on the shore,"" said Jane Lubchenco, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""Many of the doomsday scenarios that were talked about and repeated a lot have not and will not come to fruition,"" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs has said. So was the oil spill really ""the worst environmental disaster"" in U.S. history? Disasters are hard to rank and tricky to compare, historians say, but they cite several calamities that rival or surpass the Gulf oil spill in terms of lives lost or affected. In 1889, for example, a poorly maintained dam collapsed, sending a wall of water crashing through Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The flood killed over 2,200 people and destroyed 1,600 homes. Historians also cite what happened in blue-collar community of Love Canal, New York, which was built atop more than 20,000 tons of chemical waste and linked to high rates of cancer and birth defects. Hundreds of families were ultimately forced to flee. In terms of permanently disrupting a way of life for the largest number of Americans, historians say, nothing compares to the 1930s Dust Bowl, a slow-motion disaster sparked by years of shortsighted farming practices and serious drought. Native grasses across the country's heartland were torn up, leaving little to hold the topsoil in place. When the winds kicked up, dust storms turning the sky black could be seen as far away as New York City. About 2.5 million people fled the Dust Bowl in one of the largest migrations in U.S. history. Families abandoned countless farms. That devastated the region's agriculture economy. ""The entire way of life of the Great Plains moved away from agriculture for a time,"" said Brian Black, an environmental historian at Penn State. Historians do not dispute the enormity of the damage caused by the Gulf oil spill, which killed 11 people, bruised local and regional economies and caused damage that may not be apparent for years. It was ""plainly the greatest oil spill disaster"" in American history, according to Wesley Warren, director of programs for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a progressive advocacy group. Black agreed. Nearly 206 million gallons of oil gushed into the Gulf of Mexico after an explosion sank BP's Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in April, compared with 11 million gallons of crude that seeped from the Exxon Valdez into Alaska's Prince William Sound in 1989. The Valdez spill was devastating, Black said. The local ecosystem and fishing communities never fully recovered. Yet ""the use of dispersants, the formation of plumes deep under water, and the unique ecology of the Gulf each make (the BP) spill more disastrous,"" he said. The Gulf oil disaster ranks as the largest recorded maritime oil spill in U.S. history -- and the largest accidental oil spill into water in world history, topped only by Iraq's intentional release of 240 million gallons of oil into the Persian Gulf during the Gulf War. In 1910 and 1911, though, more oil spilled onto land in California as a result of the Lakeview Gusher, the consequence of a 1910 well explosion in California's Central Valley. Nearly 380 million gallons are believed to have spilled over nearly a year and a half. That spill, though, directly affected relatively few people and had ""a less complicated ecological impact,"" Black said. So how does the Gulf oil spill compare with the infamous 1889 Johnstown Flood, an event memorialized in American songs and books? The collapse of South Fork Dam sent about 20 million tons of water toward the Pennsylvania steel town, built on a flood plain between two rivers. It's tough to compare Johnstown's broken dam with the Gulf's broken oil well, but they're similar in the sense that they're both at least partly the product of a similar sense of ethics -- or lack thereof, Black said. The 19th century robber barons behind the dam -- Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick -- ignored and did not properly maintain the dam, he said. BP stands similarly accused of placing safety concerns behind financial considerations, an assertion the company has denied. ""That's a very good illustration of the ethics that predominated then and now,"" Black argued. ""At times, big oil's ethical culture is not too different from Carnegie's and Frick's, and it's allowed to exist that way because we depend so much on big oil."" Of course, the long-term impact of the Gulf spill is still unknown. Local residents can be optimistic because oil is a naturally occurring substance, Black said. That means the region eventually will recover, though recovery may come too late for many businesses. One neighborhood that may never wholly recover: Love Canal -- now a synonym for environmental disaster in the United States. Purchased from the Hooker Chemical Company for $1 in 1953, the community's contaminated land was linked to unusually high cancer and birth defect rates, among other things. The federal government declared an emergency in the late 1970s as hundreds of families were forced to evacuate. The incident led to the passage of the Superfund Act, designed to make polluters cover the costs of cleaning up contaminated areas. Though the EPA declared Love Canal clean in 2004, skepticism about its safety has lingered. Fewer people may have been affected by Love Canal than by the Gulf spill, but petroleum is ""not quite as corruptive as the toxins were at Love Canal,"" Black said; chemicals and radioactive materials can pose a potentially greater long term risk. The bottom line: it's tough to rank environmental calamities. ""We can't appreciate the magnitude of (some disasters) until their results and implications have had time to play out,"" Black said. ""Grand statements"" such as Obama's ""miss a very important point: This very bad situation resulted from doing business as usual in the petroleum industry. Such events could occur any time the industry pursues such deep water wells as long as regulation is lax."" Warren agreed. ""Once something crosses a threshold of being a disaster, then it's the worst one of that type in its own way,"" he said. ""The lesson should always be how can we prevent it from happening again.""","Obama declared the Gulf oil America's ""worst environmental disaster""

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- A mayor in Mexican President Felipe Calderon's home state was ambushed and killed by a group of heavily armed men as he returned to his house, news reports said. It was the second assassination attempt in eight days on Vista Hermosa Mayor Octavio Manuel Carrillo Castellanos, the Cambio de Michoacan newspaper said on its Web site Wednesday. Carillo was pulling up to his home around 6 p.m. Tuesday when at least two men got out of a vehicle and opened fire. There were conflicting reports over whether a second vehicle with armed men may have been involved. Family and others came to Carillo's aid while a police officer stationed at his house called for help, Cambio de Michoacan said. Carillo was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died around 7:20 p.m.. Officials said they did not have a motive or know if the mayor had received any threats. But El Excelsior newspaper reported that investigators are looking into Carillo's recent firing of a Vista Hermosa police commander and an officer. Carillo, who took office on January 1, 2008, was the second mayor in the Pacific coast state of Michoacan killed in the last eight months. Marcelo Ibarra Villa, the mayor of Villa Madero, was ambushed in June while riding in his truck with his wife, El Excelsior said. The gunmen escaped in both instances. Tuesday's killing came on Mexican Flag Day, just hours after Calderon vowed that his government would continue to battle the drug cartels that have ravaged the country. The mayor's death also came four days after the sudden resignation of the police chief in Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas. Police Chief Roberto Orduna had received death threats from local drug cartels and resigned after the recent deaths of eight police officers under his command. Violent deaths reached record levels in Mexico last year as drug cartels battle each other and the Mexican government. More than 5,400 killings were reported in 2008, more than double the tally in 2007. Authorities and analysts said a new record could be set this year. Narcotraffickers have adopted a campaign of intimidation against authorities, and the deaths of police, mayors and other officials have become common. Last year, more than 100 police were killed in Ciudad Juarez in attacks blamed on organized crime. ""They started killing police officers when they were going home or getting into police cars,"" Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz told reporters last week. Just last week, the city's police director of operations was gunned down in his car. Another police officer and a prison guard were found dead Friday morning. On Friday, the U.S. State Department renewed a travel alert for Americans considering a visit to Mexico. ""The situation in Ciudad Juarez is of special concern,"" the alert said. ""Mexican authorities report that more than 1,800 people have been killed in the city since January 2008. Additionally, this city of 1.6 million people experienced more than 17,000 car thefts and 1,650 carjackings in 2008."" In addition, the University of Arizona warned its students against going to Mexico on spring break this year, and Arizona State University is considering the same advisory. ""These are flat-out organized crime groups like we think of any other organized crime groups. They are not a small gang on the corner. These are large organizations,"" said David Denlinger, chief of the Arizona Department of Public Safety.","Vista Hermosa Mayor Octavio Manuel Carrillo Castellanos killed outside home .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's education system is beginning to battle back from years of neglect and an exodus of teachers. From a distance the Mathabisana school looks to be in an OK condition. But many parents still find it impossible to pay the U.S. $24 a year fees and some resort to using chickens as payment. The country's education minister in the year-old power-sharing administration believes it could be decade before standards are back up to Zimbabwe's good past record. When President Robert Mugabe took office in 1980, he prioritized education. His government managed to lift Zimbabwe's adult literacy rate to one of the highest on the continent. But like everything else Mugabe achieved during his first decade in power, he has in the past few years managed to undo. The government stopped funding some schools as far back as 1999, and as the economy crumbled so too did the quality of learning. According to the education department, 20,000 teachers have left the country in the past two years and half of Zimbabwe's children have not progressed beyond primary school. Many parents today are too poor to send their children to school. Rural schools -- where pencils, desks and books are luxuries -- are hardest hit. Watch kids trying to learn . When CNN visited a Mathabisana primary school in Umguza, in the southwest of Zimbabwe, headmaster Nonkululeko Ndlovu said that at one point teachers used charcoal as a substitute for chalk. ""There are no textbooks to talk about at the moment because I remember the last text books were bought sometime in 2000 or so, when we were still getting government grants but now we don't have anything. ""Those text books have reached their shelf life. An aid organization donated 32 text books which we really appreciated and we are using those text books right across the grades, trying to impart knowledge to the kids."" In a school with 406 children, that means that almost 13 children have to share one text book. ""So what we normally do is write problems on the board and the children read, this is what we are doing in a bid to ensure that children learn,"" Ndlovu adds. The families of some children are so poor they cannot afford the reduced fees of U.S. $2 a year -- only a quarter of the children have the funds. Some parents have even resorted to paying fees in chickens and other life stock. Ndlovu said: ""When the parents bring a chicken to sell or to offer as school levy, teachers sometimes buy it, so if they agree on the price, the teacher would get the item, pay the fees, and then if there is any change, he would give the parent the change."" Education Minister David Coltart says he inherited a catastrophic system when he took over in February. ""Seven thousand government schools were closed and most of the 80,000 teachers were on strike. At the head office building there was no water in our 18-storey building and the toilets were in a mess. That was emblematic of the state of schools,"" he told CNN. CNN asked the headmaster at Mathabisana about the children's concentration level and trying to learn under such difficult circumstances. ""We have children who are excelling even though they are sitting on the floor, so that is why we are hoping if things normalize these children may be the best in the world,"" he said proudly. Ndlovu is one of the teachers who did not join the exodus. ""In any normal situation when others go out, definitely others have to remain. There is no way we can all of us just go out. ""Those who are remaining, we are just hoping that things will be better. It is not because things are better for us but we just feel we need to teach these kids ... to become something in the world."" Zimbabwe's unity government has managed to get some striking teachers back into classrooms by offering them an improved wage of $150 a month, but that is hardly a living wage. ""If you can pay your rent, pay your bills here and there and then you are able to come back to school. We just do that,"" Ndlovu says. ""We cannot all go out and leave Zimbabwe empty without teachers. Those who are outside understand that we are playing a significant role because some of them left their kids behind. They definitely know they are being taken care of, we are teaching them."" The education minister said he was allocated one-tenth of the budget he needs to rebuild Zimbabwe's education system. He is hoping donors will come to his country's aid. According to his estimates, it could take up to 10 years to get Zimbabwe's education system to where it was in the early 90's. And he understands that he will only be able to achieve this if he can retain committed civil servants like Ndlovu.","In two years, 20,000 teachers have left Zimbabwe .

"(CNN) -- To look at, Lake Kivu seems, well, innocent. Situated on Rwanda's western border, it is both a prominent food source in the country, and -- increasingly -- a tourist hotspot. Hotels have rushed to set up along the coast to cater to the influx of visitors, no doubt lured in by the lake's idyllic beach setting. ""The lake is very important to tourism,"" says Innocent Twagirumukiza, founder of Green Hills Ecotours. ""When people finish visiting mountain gorillas, or other national parks around Rwanda, this is a good place to come and relax,"" he adds. What these tourists may not know, however, is that because of the area's volcanoes and anaerobic bacteria in the water, Lake Kivu is a storehouse for 60 billion cubic meters of methane gas, and susceptible to underwater eruptions. It is one of three ""exploding lakes"" in the world. Though these types of eruptions, known as overturns, can potentially pose a risk to the local community (in 1986, a similar lake in Cameroon released a bubble of CO2 that killed 1,746 people), Lake Kivu is safe, thanks in part to the efforts of the Rwandan government. ""I don't use [the term ""exploding lake""]. It's just a lake that has methane gas and needs degassing,"" says Olivier Ntirushwa, the manager at Kibuye Power Plant in northwest Rwanda. Not only does the ""degassing"" keep the lake safe, it provides electricity for the region. In 2008, Rwanda launched a pilot project to extract methane gas from the lake and use it as a power source. ""This is a source of power, a source of energy that's free. It's our lake, so why not use it like that?"" says Ntirushwa. Currently, only 20% of Rwandan homes have power, and Ntirushwa estimates it will take at least 1,000 megawatts to power the country by 2020. While the project is still in the early stages (the plant currently extracts a mere 2.4 megawatts of power), Ntirushwa sees an enormous amount of potential. ""This lake has the power to produce up to 800 megawatts. We only do 2.4, so imagine how much is left,"" he says. The methane resides 250 meters underneath the lake, and to extract it, engineers lower a pipe to just about the layer of dissolved gas. Once captured, the gas is purified and dried. Overall, it's a cheap method for creating electricity. ""It's a very rewarding job, because it's the first time [it's been done]. It's a new technology, and the people of Rwanda are very excited about it. Being a pioneer, being the first doing this, it gives some us respect.""","Rwanda's Lake Kivu is becoming a tourism hotspot .

"New York (CNN) -- Something about the redness of the red ribbon continues to haunt me. I have had many dreams of it: one is a bonfire of ribbons. Red like blood, red like passion and anger, and red like love. Twenty years. That's how long it has been since the Visual AIDS Artists' Caucus created what they called ""The Ribbon Project."" These New York City artists were compelled to collaboratively create a symbol that was easy to reproduce, that would be cheap, and that would make people think about AIDS. Today we know their work simply as the Red Ribbon; an icon that became most poignant at the height of the AIDS crisis. In 1991, the downtown arts scene was also an unimaginable scene of devastation. AIDS changed contemporary art, and world culture, forever. A multitude of talented people had already died and scores more were ill. Or caring for dying friends, or working collectively as groundbreaking AIDS activists. Some were doing it all. And in a series of meetings in April and May of 1991 members of the Visual AIDS Artists' Caucus decided that a piece of grosgrain ribbon, twisted in a simple loop and hand-stitched to a gold safety pin, would be an appropriate icon to show support and compassion for those with AIDS and their caregivers. 30 years of AIDS moments to remember . When asked about whether a ribbon was enough, the late Rodger McFarlane, executive director of Broadway Cares, who along with Tom Viola of Equity Fights AIDS worked immediately with Visual AIDS to place them in the public, said, ""I never want this to seem like anything more than visibility. The ribbon does not feed people or protect them from discrimination or provide leadership or a cure. But it is, at least, an easy first step."" Founding Visual AIDS Executive Director Patrick O'Connell was quoted the same year in The New York Times, ""People want to say something, not necessarily with anger and confrontation all the time. This allows them. And even if it is only an easy first step, that's great with me. It won't be their last."" Marking the 20th anniversary of the creation of the red ribbon for AIDS is an acknowledgment of the merits of art and necessity of artists. A small group of people changed the world, with an elegantly simple act. We honor their talent, foresight, and dedication in sparking a zeitgeist that pushed the acronyms ""HIV"" and ""AIDS"" into everyday speech. Their story is a source of hope because we now know that advocacy can bring change, but it is also a serious reminder that there is more to be done, because AIDS is not over. Visual AIDS recently commissioned four artists - A.K. Burns, Avram Finkelstein, Joe De Hoyos, and John Chaich -- to create new versions. 10,000 lapel buttons attached to red ribbons will be distributed beginning of December 1. Just as the Artist Caucus did in 1991, this fall, ribbon bees were held throughout New York City at Occupy Wall Street, area colleges, The LGBT Center, and private homes. The red ribbon has been copied. It's been historicized. It is honored as an icon of design and activism transcending language, recognized around the world. Its creators saw that it would never be copyrighted in the U.S., and they emphasized that it should never be made for sale or profit. Still, it has also been commodified. We always hope any profits were used to benefit services for people living with HIV, or towards research for a vaccine, treatments, and a cure, or for effective prevention campaigns that emphasis harm reduction, treatment access, and universal health care. I found a letter from June 21, 1991. Signed by Patrick, Tom, and Rodger on behalf of ""The Ribbon Project,"" it explained that ""by wearing the red ribbon we demonstrate compassion for people living with AIDS; support of the on-going efforts of their caretakers and service organizations; and advocacy for a coordinated response from our government for the research that will lead to effective treatments, vaccines, and ultimately, a cure."" The work of courageous people did lead to effective treatments. Twenty years later, my desire for all the other demands that wearing a ribbon once demonstrated remains. It must be our collective desire. Beyond December 1, we must make HIV/AIDS a part of daily life and in doing so continue to extend safety, dignity, and compassion to all people living with HIV; to honor those we have lost; to work for a cure that can be shared worldwide; and to hold our governments accountable to the coordinated responses developed with community input. But my dreams of the red ribbon continue. It's certainly the iconic symbol of the AIDS crisis and now it even resides in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art. But it is more than a museum piece, it was the first, and remains the most emblematic of all ""disease awareness"" ribbons. Its ethos endures as it embodies the greatest of complexities in one elegant form. As current social movements and activism seek visual embodiments of our varied messages, its spirit endures. But for me, I still see red. The opinions in this piece are solely those of Amy Sadao.","This year marks the 20th anniversary of the creation of the ""Red Ribbon"" for VisualAIDS .

"(CNN) -- Two teenage brothers were arrested and charged with first-degree murder in the death of Autumn Pasquale, the 12-year-old-girl found dead Monday in Clayton, New Jersey, according to authorities. ""The brothers are ages 15 and 17 years old, and both are in police custody at the present time,"" Gloucester County Prosecutor Sean Dalton said Tuesday, adding that the younger brother had also been charged with one count of luring. Prosecutors say Autumn was lured to the boys' home, where they murdered her -- possibly for her BMX bike, which police found among some of the girl's belongings when they searched the site early Tuesday. Autumn's body was found in a recycling container. Dalton said she was strangled and died from blunt-force trauma, but based on preliminary findings, there were no signs of sexual assault. Police were aided by the suspects' mother, who contacted police because of Facebook postings, according to Dalton. The young suspects turned themselves in, accompanied by their attorneys, Tuesday. ""We're strongly considering waiving them to adult court. However, we want to let the process take its part,"" Dalton said. In New Jersey, authorities are not permitted to release the names of juveniles charged with a crime. A Facebook page was created after Autumn went missing Saturday, and many neighbors and friends donated their time to help 200 law enforcement members search for her. She was last seen riding her bike from her home, according to the Gloucester County Prosecutor's Office. Neighbor Joyce Fisher described to CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey how she felt after volunteering and handing out fliers for the search effort, only to find out that those accused live just across the street. ""I'm exhausted,"" she said, and was especially unnerved when she saw investigators bring the girl's bike out of the suspects' house. ""Scared ... devastating ... unnerving. Nice quiet town. We know everybody's move around here. We never had any issues like this,"" she said. ""Everything is shattered."" ""At this point, we have to put our anger aside,"" Dalton said. ""We have to let justice take its course and through the support of all the caring families in Clayton, with the support of the law enforcement community. ... We'll get past this, because we are strong."" Pasquale would have celebrated her 13th birthday next week.

"(CNN) -- For most people plunging into the ocean's cold, dark depths without an oxygen tank would be an alarming experience. But for Ahmad Tahilmet and his friends its one of life's greatest pleasures. They are freedivers -- one of the growing number of young Emiratis who pursue the extreme water sport that is growing in popularity. Unlike regular divers, freedivers prefer to go under water without oxygen tanks or other bulky equipment. ""It has something to do with the ocean and how much we love to be in it. You have so many ways to discover what's under the water,"" says Tahilmet. ""Some people go into scuba diving. Freedivers usually have a different approach because the silence. ""You have no bubbles, nothing. All that you can hear is your heartbeat and you get to see things that other people can't see. You know because you are so quiet and calm."" Freedivers sip coffee with sharks . For these young Emiratis, freediving is not just a hobby, but it's a competitive sport. But unlike other forms of competition, freediving requires participants to learn to relax, instead of relying on adrenaline. Freediving has a long history in the UAE, going back to the old days of pearl diving, a one-time traditional livelihood. Driven by the need to make the living, the pearl divers relied on a weight to drag them to the seabed and a rope to guide them out of water. But as that profession has disappeared, the practice of freediving has taken its place. ""I know it is not a necessity,"" says Tahilmet. ""Now we do it because we love the ocean."" Freedivers compete for either depth or duration of a breath hold under water. And just like his pearl-diving Emirati forebears, present-day free divers such as Ahmed Khouri may opt to use weights to help them drop faster and deeper. ""Personally I prefer to dive with a neck weight,"" Khouri says. ""It just sits around the neck. It's comfortable because it doesn't really choke you. So you'll be alright."" See: 8 wild outdoor adventures in Dubai . Yet, experts warn that many freedivers, including those in the UAE, don't have enough proper training or understand its dangers. And they warn accidents could rise as more people take part in the sport. Adel Ait-Ghezala, a 35-year-old Algerian freediver, went missing on New Year's Day while spearfishing with his friends off the coast of Dubai. His body was found around 10 days later. Both Tahilmet and Khouri are well aware of the dangers; they lost a friend to freediving, also off the coast of Dubai. But AIDA, the international freediving governing body, says the sport has a strong safety record, and serious accidents in organized competitions, like the recent one late last year, are quite rare. (In November, champion American freediver Nicholas Mevoli died after he surfaced from a 72-meter dive in a competitive event in the Bahamas.) For Khouri, the thrill of freediving is like doing another kind of extreme sport. ""The most fun part of the dive is the free fall,"" he says. ""It's like people who do skydiving, they just freefalling. It's just the same. You know I think that's the best sensation you can have because the more you free fall, the deeper you go, the more fun you have.""

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Lebanese military forces battled militants in Tripoli on Saturday, resulting in the deaths of two militants and two civilians, the Lebanese army said. At least six Lebanese soldiers -- including an officer -- were killed, according to Lebanon's state-run National News Agency . There were 24 people wounded in the attack, NNA reports. That figure includes civilians and soldiers. This constitutes a drop in the death toll of soldiers. Previously, nine had been reported killed. The militants are Sunnis who sympathize with ISIS extremists, who have been waging attacks inside neighboring Syria and, beyond that, in parts of Iraq, according to Lebanese media reports. The militants are said to feel marginalized by the Lebanese army, which is heavily allied with Shiite Hezbollah. In the Tripoli violence, both sides used heavy weapons and rockets. The militants have withdrawn from the contested Old Souks area, NNA reported Saturday afternoon. Local leaders and clerics helped mediate the withdrawal, it said. Most of the clashes had been taking place in Old Souks since Friday evening, security officials said. Fighting continues in the nearby Al Muhammara area and the Sunni neighborhood of Bab al-Tabbaneh, security officials said. According to broadcaster LBCI TV, fighting between the army and Sunni militants has intensified in the neighboring district of Akkar. The fighting started Friday when soldiers carried out a security campaign targeting the militants. Security forces have raided several homes in and around Tripoli, confiscating explosives and weapons, including assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. The fighting is also highlighting divisions within Lebanon's Sunni community. In a statement run on the website of An Nahar, the most respected local paper, Prime Minister Tammam Salam, a Sunni, condemned the attacks on the army, as has one of his most important predecessors, Saad Hariri. At the same time, the state-run National News Agency reported that security personnel have raided a guardhouse at the home of Khaled al Daher, a Sunni member of Parliament from Tripoli, and confiscated four rifles. Freelancer Marc Sirois reported from Beirut. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed from London.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A court in Hong Kong has ruled that a British banker charged with the grisly murder of two Indonesian women is psychologically fit to enter a plea on both counts. However, the case has been adjourned until July next year to allow for more than 200 pieces of forensic and DNA evidence to be analyzed. Rurik Jutting has been in custody since November 1 following the discovery of the bodies of the two women at his home in an upscale residential complex in the city's Wan Chai district. His last court appearance on November 10 was adjourned after prosecutors requested psychological assessments of the former employee of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jutting, who has yet to enter a plea, appeared in court Monday unshaven and wearing the same dark sunglasses. He spoke only once to confirm that he understood what was happening. Body in suitcase . The 29 year old is accused of killing Sumarti Ningsih, 25, whose decomposing body was discovered inside a suitcase on the balcony of his high-rise apartment. The other woman, Seneng Mujiasih, 29, was found on the floor of the one-bedroom apartment with her throat slashed. Police say Jutting called them to the apartment early on November 1. They say Mujiasih had been killed that day, and Ningsih five days earlier. The principal magistrate, Ms Bina Chainrai, ruled that Jutting would remain in custody until the hearings resume on July 6. The defense had questioned the length of the latest adjournment, but prosecutors pointed out that the government's forensics department estimated a 28-week period for sifting through the body of evidence. The bodies of the two victims have since been flown back to Indonesia for burial. Sumarti's father has called for his daughter's killer to be executed, but Hong Kong doesn't impose the death penalty. CNN's Vivian Kam, Jonathan Stayton and Andrew Stevens in Hong Kong contributed to this report.","Case adjourned until July to allow analysis of more than 200 pieces of forensic evidence .

"(CNN) -- Don't throw out your roller bag just yet. Officials in the Italian city of Venice are denying a reported ban on wheeled luggage, saying they won't impose large fines on tourists using them. Last week they were widely quoted saying they hoped draft laws to be introduced in May 2015 would curb damage and disturbance from noisy bags. The prospect of fines of up to 500 euros ($620) generated uproar and concerns about how many of the 22 million tourists who annually visit Venice would cart their luggage into a destination with restricted access to vehicles. Now the city's special commissioner, Vittorio Zappalorto, has issued a statement insisting proposed new noise regulations will only be directed at trolleys used by traders and are not intended as an outright prohibition. ""I firmly deny that the municipality of Venice has ever thought to ban the use of trolleys in the historical center,"" he said. 'Preservation of serenity' The new regulations, he insisted, will apply solely to ""handcarts and transpallets transporting goods on the pedestrian paths,"" which he said cause severe erosion to Venice's historic paving. ""This is particularly annoying when it happens in the early hours of the day, when many people are still sleeping."" He added: ""This doesn't mean, however, that the municipality will ban the use of them starting from May. The draft seeks only to regulate."" Despite the denial, Zappalorto said he hoped the furore surrounding reports of restrictions on wheeled luggage would prompt the tourism industry to address the issue of noisy bags. He echoed earlier comments, reported by the local Il Messaggero newspaper, in which he was quoted saying a ban would hopefully inspire luggage manufacturers to introduce softer, air-filled tires. ""This will undoubtedly be a deserving action that will contribute to the preservation of our architectural heritage and to the serenity of residents and tourists themselves,"" he said.","City special commissioner Vittorio Zappalorto says rules on noise restriction have been misinterpreted .

"(CNN) -- Poetry, performance and prayer celebrated the voice of literary giant Maya Angelou at a memorial service held Saturday at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. ""She taught us that we are each wonderfully made, intricately woven and put on this earth for a purpose,"" first lady Michelle Obama said during her tribute to the celebrated poet and actress. Angelou, 86, died at her Winston-Salem home on May 28. Angelou had been ""frail"" and suffering from heart problems, her literary agent said. Angelou taught American studies for years at Wake Forest. Obama did not meet Angelou until 2008, while on the campaign trail, but she said Angelou's poem 'Phenomenal Woman' had a profound impact on her life. ""I was struck by how she celebrated black women's beauty like no one had ever dared to,"" Obama said in the service held at Wait Chapel. ""She also graced us with an anthem for all women, a call to all of us to embrace our God-given beauty. How desperately black girls needed that message,"" the first lady said, remembering that as a young girl her first doll was a white Malibu Barbie. She said that Angelou reminded everyone that "" We must each find our own voice, decide our own value and then announce it to the world with all the pride and joy that is our birthright as members of the human race."" 'Spiritual queen mother' Oprah Winfrey remembered her friend as the greatest woman she has ever known. ""The loss I feel I cannot describe,"" Winfrey said, holding back tears. ""It's like something I've never felt before. She was my spiritual queen mother and everything that that word implies. She taught me the poetry of courage and respect."" Winfrey recalled meeting Angelou in the late 1970s, when she worked as a news reporter. ""She looked at me and said, 'Who are you girl?'"" Winfrey said. ""I will miss her."" 'She had the voice of God' ""I Loved Maya,"" said former President Bill Clinton during his reflection. He said the two last met in April in Austin during a celebration of of the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. Clinton recalled that he hugged Angelou and said, "" I cannot believe that you have gotten yourself here."" He said she responded, ""Just because I'm wheelchair-bound doesn't mean I don't get around."" Clinton became aware of Angelou while in college by reading her book. ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,"" her lasting contribution to literature that bore witness to the brutality of a Jim Crow South. He said Angelou was always paying attention and used her voice to call attention to the things that really mattered. ""God loaned her his voice. She had the voice of God and he decided he wanted it back from her,"" Clinton told the audience. Music and more . Actress Cicely Tyson reflected on a friendship that began in 1960, when both were in a play called ""The Blacks,"" which ran for three years. ""Every emotion known to man was exhibited by Maya. She held nothing (back). She spoke her mind no matter what the situation,"" Tyson remembered. The memorial service also featured singer Lee Ann Womack performing ""I Hope You Dance,"" considered Angelou's favorite song. At the conclusion of the service Saturday, Angelou's voice once more was heard in a recording of the 1996 Ashford & Simpson song ""Been Found."" Maya Angelou remembered by those she inspired .

"(CNN) -- Rosemary Murphy, an Emmy Award-winning actress, has died. She was 89. Murphy died Saturday night at her home in Manhattan, her agent confirmed to CNN. The New York Times cited cancer as the cause of death. Murphy was known for her film role as Miss Maudie Atkinson in the 1962 classic ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Murphy played the neighbor to widower and lawyer Atticus Finch, played by Gregory Peck. In 1976, it was Murphy's portrayal of Sara Delano Roosevelt, the mother of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in the ABC television movie ""Eleanor and Franklin"" that earned her an Emmy. The following year she was nominated for another Emmy when she reprised her role as Roosevelt for the sequel, ""Eleanor and Franklin: The White House Years."" Murphy also appeared on Broadway receiving Tony nominations for roles in 1960's ""Period of Adjustment"" as the wife of a Korean War veteran; as Dorothy Cleaves, a wife who finds out about her husband's infidelity in ""Any Wednesday""; and in ""A Delicate Balance,"" where she played an alcoholic named Claire. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" now an e-book . She continued to work in television, portraying the mother of presidents. In the 1984 miniseries ""George Washington"" Murphy played Mary Ball Washington, the mother of the nation's first president. She also portrayed Rose Kennedy, the mother of President John F. Kennedy, in 1991's ""A Woman Named Jackie."" Her later TV credits include the long-running soap operas, ""The Young and the Restless"" and ""As the World Turns."" According to IMDB, one of Murphy's last roles was for the film ""The Romantics"" with Katie Holmes, Anna Paquin and Josh Duhamel. Murphy's survivors include a sister, Mildred Pond.

"(CNN) -- Pull yourself up a chair (""Like Chairy!""), because everyone's favorite nasal-voiced man-child in the red bow tie and too-small gray suit is back. ""I know you are, but what am I?"" Earlier this week, ""Pee-wee's Playhouse"" was released on Blu-ray by Shout! Factory. The restoration of the series was truly a labor of love for Paul Reubens -- the creator and alter-ego of the Pee-wee Herman character. Reubens personally supervised the frame-by-frame remastering of the original 16mm film -- a yearlong project. The set includes all 45 episodes, over four hours of all-new bonus features, and the beloved Christmas special. It's hard to believe that ""Pee-wee's Playhouse"" -- the critically-acclaimed, whip-smart show that garnered 22 Emmy Awards -- actually got its start as a parody of children's television shows. Reubens drew inspiration from the shows he loved as a child, such as ""The Howdy-Doody Show,"" ""Captain Kangaroo"" and ""The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show."" The character of Pee-wee originated in Reubens' stage show, ""The Pee-wee Herman Show"" at The Groundlings theater in Los Angeles, later transferred to The Roxy theater and was turned into a 1981 HBO special. The stage show garnered Reubens a deal for the 1985 feature film ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure,"" which was directed by then-newcomer Tim Burton; which led to the TV series. Premiering on CBS in 1986, ""Pee-wee's Playhouse"" was a modified, made-for-kids version of the stage show. It became appointment television right out of the gate. Children, parents and even college students couldn't wait for Saturday mornings with the mischievous, fun-loving, obnoxious, sweet, curious, hyperactive Pee-wee Herman. In one of the interviews featured in the Blu-ray extras, executive producer Richard Abramson recalled that on the morning of September 13, 1986, the day the show premiered, CBS still hadn't seen the pilot. The network had been begging for a screener for weeks, but Abramson, Reubens and staff were editing the episode down to the wire. Abramson hand-delivered the final product to CBS at 6:45 a.m. It was broadcast at 9 a.m. That's not to say that the ""Playhouse"" crew was lax in any way, shape or form. On the contrary, the series' attention to detail was one of the attributes that made it so special. These were the pre-digital art days, and ""Playhouse"" featured a mind-boggling medley of Claymation, stop-motion animation, cartoon animation and live action including puppetry. All the artwork was either hand-painted, hand-drawn or sculpted. As if that wasn't quite enough art, the show was shot on film. Clocking in at just under two-and-a-half minutes, the ""Pee-wee's Playhouse"" theme song was, and remains, exceptionally long. It opened with a Claymation beaver and slowly segued into the hyper-fast song, sung by Cyndi Lauper under the pseudonym ""Ellen Shaw,"" then name-checked every inhabitant of the Playhouse. Most household items were alive, from the windows to the flowers to the floor to the ham in the fridge. There was also the wacky Magic Screen (which feared the dentist and was a cousin of Magic Johnson), Conky the robot (who provided each day's secret word), Globey the globe, Clocky the clock and Chairy the chair. Humans who dropped by the Playhouse included Miss Yvonne, Cowboy Curtis and Reba the mail lady, among many others. Some of the other Playhouse regulars were Jambi the genie, Pterri the Pterodactyl and the Puppet Band. As educational as it was artistic and offbeat, ""Pee-wee's Playhouse"" contained enough double-entendres to keep the adults chuckling, and it sure wasn't afraid to be just plain silly. One of the running Pee-wee jokes was the ""why don't you marry it?"" comeback in which someone would proclaim their love for something, and Pee-wee or another character would challenge the person with the aforementioned retort. In the season-two slumber party episode, Pee-wee did, in fact, marry a bowl of fruit salad. Pee-wee: ""Mmm! Fruity! I love fruit salad!"" Slumber party attendees in unison: ""Then why don't you marry it!"" Pee-wee: ""All right then. I will."" Smash-cut to Pee-wee and a bowl of fruit salad (wearing a veil) saying vows and sealing it with a kiss. Paul Reubens had total creative control over ""Pee-wee's Playhouse,"" and he also insisted on a racially and ethnically diverse cast and crew. Much of the early staff had never worked in TV before. Most were still in film or art school or had just graduated. During the summer of 1987, one-day-to-be Academy Award-nominated director John Singleton was a security guard on the set who occasionally took on ""Playhouse"" production assistant gigs. At the time, he was a film school student at the University of Southern California. Laurence Fishburne (Cowboy Curtis) recalled Singleton telling him about the screenplay he was writing, and that he would one day direct Fishburne in a film. The script Singleton was working on became 1991's ""Boyz n the Hood."" True to his word, the young director fought, and won, for Fishburne to play the now-iconic role of Furious Styles. ""Pee-wee's Playhouse"" ended its original run in November 1990 and since then, it's been a mixed bag. There was Reubens' shocking 1991 arrest, his triumphant return as Pee-wee later that year at the MTV Awards and then, not much. More recently, 2010's popular ""The Pee-wee Herman Show on Broadway"" was turned into an HBO special and now it seems like the Pee-wee machine is kicking into high gear. Reubens told Rolling Stone this week that a big announcement about a new Pee-wee movie is ""imminent."" Today, ""Pee-wee's Playhouse"" is a pop culture staple. A cult favorite, it taught lessons in an off-the-wall way that was rooted in never, ever talking down to kids. The points Reubens really wanted to get across were: Don't repress your creativity, never stop asking questions, and it's OK to let your freak flag fly. Above all, however, he wanted to make children laugh.","""Pee-wee's Playhouse"" debuted on Blu-ray this week .
The cult classic ran for 45 episodes on CBS from 1986-1991, netting 22 Emmy Awards .

"(CNN) -- A California judge has dismissed former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega's lawsuit against the creators of the ""Call of Duty"" video game franchise. ""This court concludes that Noriega's right of publicity is outweighed by defendants' First Amendment right to free expression,"" Judge William H. Fahey of the Los Angeles Superior Court said in an order Monday. Noriega -- who's serving a prison sentence in Panama after being convicted of drug trafficking, money laundering and killing political opponents -- had argued that the 2012 video game ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II"" damaged his reputation. Creators of the video game called the lawsuit ""frivolous"" and ""absurd."" They filed a motion to dismiss it, arguing that Noriega's portrayal in the game is protected by the Constitution. ""This ruling is an important victory and we thank the court for protecting free speech,"" said former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, attorney for video game creator Activision Blizzard Inc. ""This was an absurd lawsuit from the very beginning and we're gratified that in the end, a notorious criminal didn't win,"" Giuliani said in a statement Tuesday. ""This is not just a win for the makers of 'Call of Duty,' but is a victory for works of art across the entertainment and publishing industries throughout the world."" Noriega, 80, filed the lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court in July, arguing that his portrayal ""as a kidnapper, murderer and enemy of the state"" in the video game harmed his reputation. Since the company used his image and name, the lawsuit said Noriega was entitled to a share of the profits from the video game. What now? ""At this time, we are still reviewing the court's order and conferring with our client to determine our next steps,"" attorney William T. Gibbs, who represents Noriega, said in an email Tuesday. Manuel Noriega sues over 'Call of Duty' video game . In 2012, Activision Blizzard said ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II"" had netted more than $1 billion in sales worldwide in its first months on the market. The video game includes historical footage and several real-life characters in Cold War scenarios, including former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North. But while North did his own voiceover for the game and acted as an adviser, Noriega said in the July lawsuit that he wasn't consulted -- or compensated -- for the use of his likeness. ""Call of Duty"" video games take storylines from current headlines, and its characters are based on historical figures, from former Cuban leader Fidel Castro to David Petraeus, the retired general and former CIA director. In a statement Tuesday, Activision Blizzard described the game as historical fiction and said Noriega's lawsuit could have had far-reaching consequences if it hadn't been thrown out. ""In the unlikely event the lawsuit had been permitted to proceed, Noriega's efforts could have provided numerous historical and political figures a veto right over their appearances in works of art, having a chilling effect on everything from movies like Forrest Gump and Zero Dark Thirty, to television programs including Saturday Night Live and Boardwalk Empire and even to popular books such as The Paris Wife,"" the statement said. In court documents, Noriega said he learned about the video game from his grandchildren, who told him that his image and likeness were being used. ""Noriega fails to provide any evidence of harm to his reputation,"" Fahey said in his ruling. ""Indeed, given the world-wide reporting of his actions in the 1980s and early 1990s, it is hard to imagine that any such evidence exists."" For almost two decades, Noriega was a major player in a country of critical regional importance to the United States because of its location on the Panama Canal, the key strategic and economic waterway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans on the narrow isthmus linking the Americas. Amid growing unrest in Panama, then-U.S. President George H.W. Bush ordered the invasion of the Central American nation in December 1989, saying Noriega's rule posed a threat to U.S. lives and property. 12 more real people who appeared in video games . Noriega fled his offices and tried to seek sanctuary in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City. He surrendered in January 1990 and was escorted to the United States for civilian trial. Noriega was indicted in the United States on charges of racketeering, laundering drug money and drug trafficking. He was accused of having links to Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar's notorious Medellin cartel and, in the process, amassing a multimillion-dollar fortune. He was convicted of drug trafficking and other crimes and served nearly two decades in prison. In 2010, a French court sentenced Noriega to seven years in prison for laundering 2.3 million euros ($2.9 million) through banks there. He was ordered to pay the money back. In Panama, where he was convicted of killing political opponents, he has been hospitalized several times since he returned in 2011 to serve out his prison sentence.

"(CNN)  -- Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama defended himself and his wife Sunday against suggestions that they are insufficiently patriotic. Sen. Barack Obama defended himself and his wife against recent suggestions that they are not patriotic. After a town hall meeting in Lorain, Ohio, a reporter asked Obama about ""an attempt by conservatives and Republicans to paint you as unpatriotic."" The reporter cited the fact that Obama once failed to put his hand over his heart while singing the national anthem. Obama replied that his choice not to put his hand on his heart is a behavior that ""would disqualify about three-quarters of the people who have ever gone to a football game or baseball game."" The reporter also noted that the Illinois senator does not wear an American flag lapel pin, has met with former members of the radical anti-Vietnam War group, Weather Underground, and his wife was quoted recently as saying she never felt really proud of the United States until recently. Asked how he would fight the image of being unpatriotic, Obama said, ""There's always some nonsense going on in general elections. Right? If it wasn't this, it would be something else. If you recall, first it was my name. Right? That was a problem. And then there was the Muslim e-mail thing and that hasn't worked out so well, and now it's the patriotism thing. ""The way I will respond to it is with the truth: that I owe everything I am to this country,"" he said. The first-term senator from Illinois has been the subject of various debunked rumors since launching his presidential campaign -- allegations that he is a Muslim, that he took his oath of office on a copy of the Quran and that he attended a radical Islamic school while living in Indonesia as a boy. ""You will recall that the reason I came to national attention was a speech in which I spoke of my love of this country,"" said Obama. He and his wife, Michelle, had already explained her comments. ""She simply misspoke,"" he said. ""What she was referring to was [that] this was the first time she has been proud of politics in America.  Watch what Michelle Obama said » . ""That's true of a lot of people who have been cynical and disenchanted. And she's spoken about how she has been cynical about American politics for a very long time, but she's proud of how people are participating and getting involved in ways that they haven't in a very long time."" About not wearing an American flag lapel pin, Obama said Republicans have no lock on patriotism. ""A party that presided over a war in which our troops did not get the body armor they needed, or were sending troops over who were untrained because of poor planning, or are not fulfilling the veterans' benefits that these troops need when they come home, or are undermining our Constitution with warrantless wiretaps that are unnecessary? ""That is a debate I am very happy to have. We'll see what the American people think is the true definition of patriotism."" Obama did not respond to the question about the Weather Underground, a group whose members bombed the U.S. Capitol and the Pentagon during the 1970s. Last week, the New York Sun reported that as an Illinois state senator in 2001, Obama accepted a $200 contribution from William Ayers, a founder of the group who was not convicted for the bombings and now works as a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. But the paper said that, in a statement, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, William Burton, said, ""Sen. Obama strongly condemns the violent actions of the Weathermen group, as he does all acts of violence ... But he was an 8-year-old child when Ayers and the Weathermen were active, and any attempt to connect Obama with events of almost 40 years ago is ridiculous."" Former first lady Sen. Hillary Clinton has said repeatedly that she is a stronger candidate because she has already shown she can withstand conservative attacks.

"(CNN) -- There are dueling narratives in the death of Michael Brown: one says he was holding his hands up in surrender as officer Darren Wilson shot him, and the other says Brown was the aggressor, and Wilson shot as Brown was rushing toward him. Investigators will certainly use high-tech tools to try to get to the truth, but they'll also use a tool as old as the ancient Greeks: the autopsy. Three autopsies have been done on Brown's body: one by St. Louis County; one privately commissioned by the family and one performed Monday by medical examiners from the U.S. military. Detailed findings in the private autopsy -- but not from the other two -- have been released. Based on the circumstances of the case, here are three areas the pathologists likely gave close scrutiny. 1. Signs of struggle . A friend of Wilson's called into a St. Louis radio show to say that Brown ""bum rushed"" Wilson and punched him in the face. CNN confirmed that account matches the one Wilson told authorities. But lawyers for the Brown family say the autopsy they commissioned showed no signs of struggle. To look for signs of struggle, pathologists pay special attention to the hands, forearms, feet and shins, looking for signs of abrasions, cuts and bruises. A bruise on the knuckles might indicate the deceased threw a punch, but a bruise would only show up if the punch was pretty hard, according to Dr. Pat Ross, a forensic pathologist in Newberry, South Carolina. And it would be hard to tell whether the bruise was from a fight with Wilson or from something else. ""You really can't date a bruise exactly,"" Ross said. ""It may have happened two hours ago or five days ago."" Pathologists also look for another person's DNA under the fingernails to help determine whether the deceased person would have scratched the other person during a struggle. 2. The bullet wound at the top of Brown's head . The family-commissioned autopsy showed Brown was shot at the top of his head. ""That bullet went in there and came out near the eye area,"" family lawyer Daryl Parks said at a press conference. ""It supports what the witnesses said about him trying to surrender to the officer. His head was in a downward position."" Ross said it's possible Brown was surrendering, but he might have been bent over for other reasons, too: he might have been crouching to dodge bullets or he might have been slumped over because he was weak from his wounds, or he might have been making an attempt to rush at Wilson with his head down. Brown was shot at least six times, all to the front of his body, according to the preliminary results of this autopsy. Four bullets went into his right arm, and he was shot twice in the head. 3. Gunshot residue . Wilson's friend who called into the radio show said that during the fight inside the officer's car, both men grabbed for the officer's gun and it went off. Dr. Michael Baden, the forensic pathologist hired by the Brown family, said there was no gunshot residue on Brown's skin surface, so at the time the gun went off it was at least a foot or two away. But he added that his team hadn't had the opportunity to examine Brown's clothing, which might have filtered out any gunshot residue. 'An autopsy is a snapshot' One crucial question an autopsy alone can't answer is whether someone was standing still when he was shot or was moving toward the shooter -- and if he was moving at what speed. ""An autopsy is a snapshot,"" said Dr. Eric Mitchell, a forensic pathologist in Kansas City, Kansas. ""And like a snapshot of a ball in midair, you can't tell if it's going up or coming down, or how fast it's going up or down."" To answer that question, more details from the investigation are needed. ""It's uncommon for an autopsy to give you all your answers,"" Mitchell added -- even though crime shows on TV often make it look like autopsies answer all questions with illuminating ""aha"" moments. ""My mother-in law-loves those shows, so I've been forced to watch them, but that's just hokum,"" he said. CNN's John Bonifield and Matthew Stucker contributed to this story.","Three autopsies have been conducted in Michael Brown's death .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Amanda Bynes' claim that a microchip implanted in her brain made her tweet bad things about her father could be key evidence in keeping the actress in a mental facility, according to experts. Bynes, 28, was admitted to a Pasadena, California, facility on an involuntary emergency psychiatric hold Friday, but a probable cause hearing must be held this week if her doctors want to keep her there. Her admission to Las Encinas Hospital came hours after Bynes posted a series of tweets alleging her father verbally, physically and sexually abused her. However, she disavowed responsibility for the accusations in a tweet a short time later: ""My dad never did any of those things The microchip in my brain made me say those things but he's the one that ordered them to microchip me."" Bynes then boarded a flight from New York to Los Angeles, where she told reporters at the airport that she was there to file a lawsuit against her parents. While she was told that a limo driver was taking her to a lawyer's office in Pasadena before going to a West Hollywood hotel, she was instead driven to the hospital -- which resembles an office park -- where her parents' lawyer was waiting for her. ""In a perfect world, one would be honest about getting a person into a psychiatric hospital, but from her past behavior we have seen that Amanda Bynes avoids psychiatric hospitals at all cost because she doesn't believe that she's sick,"" Dr. Carole Lieberman, a Los Angeles psychiatrist who has followed Bynes' story, told CNN on Sunday. If the psychiatrists at Las Encinas Hospital decide to extend Bynes' involuntary treatment beyond the initial 72 hours allowed for evaluation under California's ""5150"" law, they must convince a mental health referee that she is ""a danger to self, to others or is gravely disabled,"" Lieberman said. There does not have to be any expressed desire to kill herself, but the doctors need to show evidence that her behavior was so dangerous that it ""presented a risk to herself, if not others,"" Lieberman said. One reason for keeping psychiatric patients on an involuntary hold is if they are ""having auditory hallucinations"" or they are ""responding to internal stimuli,"" according to guidelines on the Los Angeles County Superior Court website. Unless Bynes volunteers to stay in treatment, the doctors must make their case, according to attorney Wendy Patrick. ""They can't just make up evidence. It has to be true and observable. The hearing is not just a rubber stamp."" The ups and downs of Amanda Bynes . Her tweet about a microchip forcing her to write negative things about her father would not be the only potential evidence, based on her very public history of odd behavior and several criminal charges. Bynes was arrested on a DUI charge in Sherman Oaks, California, last month. Her arrest report noted a ""disheveled appearance."" Her last several days in New York included an incident at a clothing store in which security officers accused her of shoplifting. She was let go after signing a ""no-trespass agreement,"" TMZ reported. Bynes was charged with a hit-and-run in 2012, hospitalized for treatment last year after a psychological evaluation and put on probation after a DUI earlier this year. And she was arrested after allegedly tossing drug paraphernalia out of the window of her New York apartment in May 2013. This is the second time Bynes has been placed under an involuntary psychiatric hold. The previous instance came in July 2013 after she was ""involved in a disturbance in a residential neighborhood"" in Thousand Oaks, California. She eventually entered an inpatient psychiatric facility and was later released into her parents' custody. In September: Amanda Bynes arrested on DUI charge . The latest episodes of odd behavior come a year after her parents told CNN their daughter was ""making great strides towards recovery"" from mental illness. She enrolled into the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles at the start of 2014, but she dropped out in the summer. Bynes' parents will not be allowed to attend the administrative hearing, which would be held at the hospital, unless their daughter invites them, according to court guidelines. They have not publicly indicated if they will ask a judge to give them legal control of their daughter under a conservatorship. Lieberman said if Bynes is returned to a conservatorship under her parents, as was done last year, they need to work with a psychiatrist to ""work out the family dysfunction."" People magazine reported in 2012 that Bynes tried to emancipate herself while still a minor, though she never moved out entirely. CNN's Todd Leopold contributed to this report.","Doctors must decide if they want Bynes kept on an involuntary psychiatric hold .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A well-known Palestinian prisoner died of cancer in Israeli custody on Tuesday, sparking outrage among Palestinian groups who accuse Israel of denying him treatment. Maysara Abu Hamdiya, 64, a retired Palestinian general, had been in Israeli prisons since 2002 and was serving a life sentence for alleged involvement in an attempt to bomb a Jerusalem cafe. He died Tuesday morning in an Israeli hospital after being admitted last week because of his deteriorating health, according to the Palestinian Authority's Government Media Center. After the announcement of Abu Hamdiya's death, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails protested by knocking on the doors of their cells and refusing food, the beginning of what they say is a three-day hunger strike, according to a statement by the Palestinian prisoner association. Abu Hamdiya had been suffering from throat pain since August 2012 and was diagnosed with cancer in January, the Palestinian Authority said. During a news conference about Abu Hamdiya's death, Issa Qaraqe, the Palestinian Authority's minister of prisoner affairs, said Abu Hamdiya died due to ""deliberate Israeli medical negligence."" He said more prisoners are being diagnosed with cancer. ""Israel is committing a new massacre against the Palestinian prisoners,"" he said. ""Abu Hamdiya died due to deliberate medical negligence,"" Qaraqe said. Qaraqe added that Abu Hamdiya was handcuffed when he was admitted to the hospital last week. Sivan Weizman, a spokeswoman for the Israeli Prison Service, denied the Palestinian allegations, saying, ""We have provided all necessary treatment for Abu Hamdiya."" Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that Israel had ignored all previous standing requests to release Abu Hamdiya and blamed Israel for not releasing him for proper medical treatment. ""The Israeli government in its intransigence and arrogance refused to respond to our efforts to save the life of Abu Hamdiya, which led to his martyrdom inside the Occupation prisons."" Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad strongly condemned the death of Abu Hamdiya and the continued policy of medical negligence of Israeli prison authorities against prisoners as the delay in providing them with proper medical treatment, a statement from Fayyad's offices said. Among the prison protests was a demonstration in the Ramon prison in southern Israel, where prison guards used tear gas to break up the protests, the Israeli Prison Service said. Weizman, the prison service's spokeswoman, said that ""six guards and three Palestinian prisoners needed medical treatment."" Abu Hamdiya's death also sparked protests and clashes in the West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza. In Hebron in the West Bank, where Abu Hamdiya was born, dozens of Palestinian protesters were injured in clashes with Israeli soldiers, Palestinian medical services said. Protesters threw rocks and soldiers used rubber bullets and tear gas. In Jerusalem, Arab Union medical services said that more than a dozen Palestinian protesters were injured outside the Old City when Israeli police broke up a solidarity protest, and several others were arrested. The death of Abu Hamdiya is the second death in less than two months inside Israeli jails this year. Arafat Jaradat 30, died inside an Israeli detention facility in February.

"(CNN) -- The meteor that blew up over southwestern Russia in February had survived long-ago collisions that blackened its surface, making it harder to spot, a scientist who studied its pieces said Wednesday. The roughly 60-foot space rock plunged into Earth's atmosphere and exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk with the force of about 30 early nuclear bombs. Of the roughly 100 fragments found so far, the biggest weighs about 11 pounds (5 kilograms), said Maria Gritsevich, a researcher at the University of Helsinki. Read more: Saving Earth from asteroids . Gritsevich and others who have studied those fragments have found the small asteroid was mostly made of ordinary rock. But it was marbled with metallic elements such as iron -- and when the asteroid collided with other bodies floating around the solar system, the heat and force of that impact melted the metal, which seeped into fissures in the surface of the stone and blackened its surface. ""Dark asteroids are harder to detect because they reflect less light,"" Gritsevich, who presented her findings at an American Astronomical Society conference this week, told CNN. Planet of sound: Meteor blast resonated around Earth . While most ordinary rocky asteroids reflect up to 20% of the sunlight that strikes them, and Earth reflects about 40%, dark asteroids reflect 5% of the light or less, she said. The meteorites collected from the Chelyabinsk incident show varying signs of darkening, with some completely blackened, others made up entirely of light-colored stone and some with a mixture of coloration, Gritsevich said. ""All Chelyabinsk meteorites look different,"" she said. ""You can clearly distinguish three different groups."" She said scientists are still working to determine the age of the Chelyabinsk meteor, the largest to hit Earth since the 1908 Tunguska incident in Siberia. NASA estimates 4,700 'potentially hazardous' asteroids . The blast left more than 1,500 injured, mostly by glass from shattered windows, and raised concerns about humanity's vulnerability to stray asteroids. Two months later, NASA announced a goal of sending a spacecraft out to seize and asteroid and tow it into orbit around the moon, where it could be studied by astronauts -- a project billed in part as a planetary defense mission. But it ran into opposition in Congress, where a House committee voted to block any funding for the mission in July.","The space rock that blew up over Russia had been darkened by ancient crashes .

""We want these tickets to go to genuine aviation enthusiasts,"" says Biman CEO Kevin Steele on the company's news page, adding that some short scenic flights out of Birmingham might also be added to the DC-10 farewell tour, depending on public demand. What's the projected demand? No word on that yet. DC-10's checkered history . McDonnell Douglas's famous (and at times infamous) jetliner logged its maiden voyage for passengers on August 5, 1971, on an American Airlines round trip between Los Angeles and Chicago. At the time, the plane filled an industry need for an innovative aircraft smaller than a 747 with long-range capabilities that could serve airports with shorter runways. A staple of several major airlines over four decades -- McDonnell Douglas produced its 446th, and last, DC-10 in 1989 for Nigeria Airways -- the aircraft would be hampered by tragic accidents, including a horrific American Airlines Flight 191 crash at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport in 1979 resulting from a separated engine ripping through a wing shortly after takeoff. The incident would lead to an FAA grounding of all DC-10s in the United States for more than a month and stoke widespread public fear about the DC-10 -- despite findings that a maintenance error was largely the cause. More: Skip the pasta! And other unsavory truths about airplane food . Though few major DC-10 incidents were actually due to mechanical issues alone, and the aircraft's safety record would steadily improve as design flaws were fixed, public confidence in the aircraft was never fully restored. Wired magazine would call the DC-10 the fifth worst ""stupid engineering mistake"" in history. Others called that label unfair. ""The DC-10 had its share of high-profile accidents,"" noted a Los Angeles Times editorial in 2007, when Northwest Airlines became the last major carrier to retire it from passenger service in the United States -- replacing it with an Airbus 330. ""But so have the much-less-maligned Boeing 737 and 747, the latter of which has a fatal-accident rate close to the DC-10's."" Economics factor in retirement . A more significant factor behind the DC-10 retirement wave relates to fuel efficiency and cost. Newer aircraft use less fuel, making DC-10s a more expensive airliner to operate. It also requires a three-man crew, including a second officer or flight engineer -- an overhead-boosting rarity these days. Even if today's harried commercial passengers aren't exactly missing DC-10s (let alone knowing what makes one different than, say, an MD-11), some of its past pilots have nice things to say about them. More: 20 most annoying things people do on planes . ""The DC-10 is a reliable airplane, fun to fly, roomy and quiet. Kind of like flying an old Cadillac Fleetwood,"" noted a spokesman for the Northwest chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association when the planes were shelved in the United States six years ago. ""We're sad to see an old friend go."" Cut to 2013. Who would have thought the last flying Cadillac Fleetwood would be making its swan song from Bangladesh? And just how sad is Biman Bangladesh Airlines to see an old friend go? ""We hope you will join with us in celebrating the farewell of a loyal, beautiful aircraft,"" says Biman's Steele.

"London (CNN) -- Tickets for the Monty Python reunion performance went on sale on Monday for as little as £32 ($51), sold out in 43 seconds and promptly resurfaced on the auction site eBay for £750 ($1212). As one of Eric Idle's characters says in the movie, ""The Life of Brian:"" ""We're supposed to haggle!"" After tickets for the show at London's O2 Arena on July 1 sold out, the PR agency for the event announced more shows on July 2-5. The performance will be the five surviving stars' first show on stage together since appearing at the Hollywood Bowl in September 1980. Tickets are priced from £32 to £106 ($171) including booking fees, with full details announced on the troupe's website montyphythonlive.com. Hours after they went on sale, many tickets were on sale on eBay. Idle tweeted: ""This pretty much took us by surprise, so we are talking about adding more shows."" Idle, John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and the late Graham Chapman became comedic legends with the creation of Monty Python's Flying Circus in October 1969. They produced 45 TV episodes for the BBC and five films together before going their separate ways in 1983. The shows mostly consisted of a string of often incoherent sketches, only occasionally with conventional punch lines and loosely tied together by Gilliam's stream of consciousness animations. Although the TV show ran for only four seasons, it proved a massive cult hit when it was shown in the United States beginning in 1974 -- just as the show was winding up on the other side of the Atlantic. Cleese said at a news conference on Thursday that the show will have some new material, but many old bits -- some featured in new ways -- that fans will expect, along with ""comedy, pathos, music and a tiny bit of ancient sex."" ""I remember going to the Royal Albert Hall and seeing Neil Diamond where he got booed in the second half for singing new numbers. People really do want to see the old hits, but we don't want to do them exactly in a predictable way, so it's going to be a mix-up, I think,"" Cleese added. Asked what he believes the modern twist will be, Gilliam replied: ""The fact that we can actually still walk and stand upright."" While the Python stars said they hoped the new performance will appeal to a new generation of fans, they admitted that money was one of the main factors in their decision to reform. ""I hope it makes us a lot of money. I hope to be able to pay off my mortgage!"" Jones said.","Monty Python reunion show in London on July 1 sells out in 43.5 seconds .

"(CNN) -- A tour bus transporting Willie Nelson's band spun out of control in a storm and crashed into a Texas bridge pillar before dawn Saturday, injuring three of five band members, according to police and the band. Willie Nelson wasn't on the bus, the musician's website said. The three band members were hospitalized, and Willie Nelson and Family postponed the tour's four remaining dates in November and will resume the tour as scheduled in December, the website said. ""No one suffered serious injuries. Paul English injured his ankle, Billy English suffered a bruised hip and crew member Tom Hawkins has a cracked rib. The other family members on the bus are sore but everyone is expected to recover fully,"" Nelson's website said. Authorities had earlier reported that English broke his hip. The crash occurred on Interstate 30 outside Sulphur Springs, and the bus driver was trying to negotiate heavy rains and winds, said Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Sylvia Jennings. The crash occurred 80 miles east of Dallas. Nelson's website said the band believes the accident occurred ""due to icy conditions on the road."" The bus was swept off the road and crashed into a bridge pillar, Jennings said. The bus was carrying five band members and the driver.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. general who oversaw the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq returned home Tuesday with the flag that flew over Baghdad at the end of the war. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden joined military leaders at the military's Joint Base Andrews outside Washington as Army Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III returned the United States Forces-Iraq command flag. The ceremony marks the formal conclusion of the conflict. ""Today, we bring home the colors to United States soil,"" the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, said during Tuesday's commemoration. ""At the same time, we embrace many of our own back into the fold just in time for the holidays. Welcome home."" Neither Obama nor Biden spoke at Tuesday's ceremony. The last U.S. convoy left Iraq early Sunday, bringing an end to a nearly nine-year war that sharply divided the U.S. public. Nearly 4,500 U.S. troops died and more than 30,000 were wounded in the conflict, while estimates of the Iraqi toll run well above 100,000 dead. ""We lack the words to say what you feel on this day because, try as we may, we can never fully know it,"" Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told the families of those killed or wounded. ""But we do know what your sacrifice means to us, to this nation and to a world that still depends so much on America for its security."" The standard that Austin presented in Tuesday's ceremony was the flag that was sheathed last week in a formal ""casing of the colors"" in Baghdad. He said U.S. troops, many of whom served multiple tours in Iraq, have achieved ""truly remarkable"" things. ""Together with our coalition partners and corps of dedicated civilians, they removed a brutal dictator and gave the Iraqi people their freedom,"" Austin said. ""Their courage and their ability to adapt has enabled us to persevere through the darkest days of the insurgency, to create hope and to provide the Iraqis opportunities that they have not seen in their lifetime. And so now the stage has been set for Iraq's young democracy to emerge as a leader in what has been and what will continue to be a very dynamic region."" U.S. and allied troops, mostly British, invaded Iraq in March 2003 after accusing then-dictator Saddam Hussein of concealing banned stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and efforts to build a nuclear bomb. Hussein's government quickly collapsed, but U.S. inspectors later found that Iraq had dismantled its weapons programs under U.N. sanctions in the 1990s. The U.S. occupation quickly found itself battling an insurgency launched by the remnants of Hussein's regime. The Americans also faced Islamic jihadists loyal to an Iraq-based offshoot of al Qaeda and anti-American Shiite militias that U.S. commanders said were backed by neighboring Iran. Iraq elected a new government in 2005, and Hussein was hanged in 2006. But soon afterward, sectarian warfare between Iraq's Shiite Arab majority and Sunni minority erupted after the bombing of the Shiite al-Askariya mosque, with thousands of bodies dumped in the streets of Baghdad and other cities for months. That fighting subsided in 2007, after Washington poured about 30,000 more troops into Iraq and began supporting Sunni Arab groups that turned against the jihadists. The new Iraq finds itself facing a political crisis within days of the American pullout, as Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Shiite-dominated government accused the country's leading Sunni official of orchestrating bomb attacks against government and security officials. The powerful political bloc that draws support largely from Sunni and more secular Iraqis has announced it is boycotting Parliament, and its leaders accuse al-Maliki of trying to amass dictatorial power.

"Aurora, Colorado (CNN) -- The man accused of shooting into a packed movie theater made his first court appearance Monday, giving the public its first look at the 24-year-old former doctoral student since his arrest moments after the gunfire ended early Friday. James E. Holmes, his hair dyed various shades of orange, looked down, then straight ahead. He sat without blinking for long periods. At times, his eyes fluttered, then squeezed tight and reopened in a blank stare. Occasionally, his eyebrows arched over several days of stubble, giving his face a mournful mien. But the dazed-looking man, who identified himself to police as ""The Joker,"" wore a maroon jumpsuit over a white T-shirt and gave little indication that he was paying attention to the courtroom procedure that ensured he will continue to be held without bond. Grief counselors offer solace amid tragedy . He was then led from the courtroom and back to the Arapahoe County Jail, where he is being held in isolation. Formal charges are expected to be filed on July 30. Asked whether Holmes was on medication, Arapaho County Undersheriff David C. Walcher said, ""Even if I did know, I couldn't tell you."" Inside the courtroom, victims and their relatives watched the proceeding. McKayla Hicks was among them. She was seated in the movie theater next door to the one where the killings occurred when a bullet struck her chin. Though she has largely recovered, she said Monday's court appearance was not easy to observe. ""Once he walked into the room, it just made everything a lot harder,"" she told CNN. ""He just looks like a pathetic freak,"" she said. ""I just want him put away forever."" Jordan Ghawi, whose sister Jessica was among the 12 fatalities, was not in the courtroom. ""This guy's already had his 10 minutes of fame and I don't need to see the face of the man who's taken my sister's life,"" he said. ""I was afraid that I may try to get my hands on that man."" He described Holmes as a coward and a genius. ""I don't believe for a second that he's sitting there with his wide eyes and pretending to be incoherent,"" Ghawi said. ""He knows what he's doing."" 'You could feel the anger in the room' ""The charges on which the court found cause included first-degree murder,"" Arapahoe County District Attorney Carol Chambers told reporters outside the courthouse. She said prosecutors have a lot of work to do. ""I would say there's no such thing as a slam-dunk case,"" she said. ""We're still looking at the enormous amount of evidence."" Deciding whether to pursue the death penalty is a long process that involves input from victims and their relatives, she said. A capital case would require a finding of either extreme indifference or deliberation, she said. Holmes is being held in connection with the shootings that also left 58 wounded, and the subsequent discovery of his booby-trapped apartment, which authorities think he rigged before leaving for the Century Aurora 16 multiplex. Authorities have been tight-lipped about a possible motive in the case, and police spokesman Frank Fania told CNN late Sunday that Holmes has been uncooperative with investigators and requested an attorney. Arapahoe County public defender James O'Connor has been assigned to the case. The Colorado Judicial Department declined to say whether Holmes requested a public defender. A telephone call by CNN to O'Connor's office was not returned. Former colleague shocked that Holmes is theater shooting suspect . At the University of Colorado's Anschutz Medical Campus, administrators told reporters that Holmes took his preliminary examinations on June 7 and initiated his withdrawal from the program three days later. ""It's very unusual, very unusual for a student to withdraw from our program,"" Dean Barry Shur told reporters. Entrance to the program is highly competitive: It generally has 10 applicants for each of the five or six slots that open in any given year, Shur said. Those who are accepted typically have undergraduate grade-point averages of more than 3.6 and Graduate Record Examination scores exceeding 1,200, he said. Though all applicants undergo background checks, Shur said he was aware of no program that requires that applicants undergo a psychiatric evaluation. Holmes did not divulge his reason for leaving the program. ""That area of the form was left blank,"" Shur said. Shur described scientists as ""quirky"" people. ""We are trained to challenge authority, to challenge what's known."" But, he added, ""Every laboratory is a team and no scientist is an island. And they have to function productively with their colleagues."" In addition, students in the school's doctoral programs ""are very carefully monitored and coached and counseled,"" he said. Meanwhile, Lisa Damiani, an attorney representing the Holmes family but not the suspect, said his family members were keeping their location secret. ""I don't think they would like the media to know where they are,"" she said, adding that she feared for their safety. ""They're doing as well as they can, under the circumstances,"" Damiani told reporters at her office in San Diego, California, where the family lives. ""I think everyone can imagine how they're feeling -- anyone who's ever been a parent."" She added, ""The family has elected not to discuss James or their relationship with James at this time."" The family issued a statement Friday saying, ""Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved."" It added, ""We are still trying to process this information."" Over the weekend, Aurora Police Chief Daniel Oates told reporters that there was ""evidence of, I think, some calculation and deliberation."" Holmes received deliveries over the past four months at his home and work addresses, which begins to explain how he may have obtained some of the materials used in the attack and those found at his apartment, Oates said. Aurora is bracing for another emotional week as families begin making funeral arrangements. It was not immediately known when the coroner would release the bodies. As of late Monday, at least 15 people remained hospitalized -- five in critical condition -- in four area hospitals.

"(CNN) -- Officials in Joplin, Missouri, trimmed the list of people still missing Monday, more than a week after the most-deadly U.S. tornado in more than 60 years tore through the city. Twenty-nine people remain unaccounted for, down from 43 on Sunday, according to the Missouri Department of Public Safety. That figure includes three people whose families have reported them as dead. ""Our work will not cease until the number of unaccounted-for individuals is zero,"" said Andrea Spillars, deputy director of the Missouri Department of Public Safety. She acknowledged over the weekend that families waiting for information on missing relatives are frustrated the identification process hasn't proceeded as quickly as they might have hoped. Authorities are relying on scientific identification of the remains. While that process is slow, it's more reliable than a family member's visual identification, Spillars said. The May 22 storm flattened buildings, destroyed neighborhoods and killed more people than any other U.S. tornado since modern recordkeeping began in 1950. Early Sunday, Joplin City Manager Mark Rohr told CNN the death toll was 142. State officials have released the names of 101 victims. Authorities have 146 sets of human remains, Spillars said Sunday, but some of the remains may belong to the same person and she cautioned against using that number as a death toll. Also Sunday, President Barack Obama visited Joplin, promising residents the support of the nation as they rebuild. The EF-5 tornado barreled into the city with 200-mph winds, reducing homes to unrecognizable rubble. ""Your country will be with you every step of the way,"" the president said to cheers. ""We're not going anywhere. The cameras may leave, the spotlight may shift, but we will be with you every step of the way until Joplin is restored and this community is back on its feet.""","29 people are still missing, down from 43 a day earlier .

"(CNN) -- An atheist sign criticizing Christianity that was erected alongside a Nativity scene was taken from the Legislative Building in Olympia, Washington, on Friday and later found in a ditch. The Freedom from Religion Foundation had a placard up in the Legislative Building in Olympia, Washington. An employee from country radio station KMPS-FM in Seattle told CNN the sign was dropped off at the station by someone who found it in a ditch. ""I thought it would be safe,"" Freedom From Religion Foundation co-founder Annie Laurie Gaylor told CNN earlier Friday. ""It's always a shock when your sign is censored or stolen or mutilated. It's not something you get used to."" The sign, which celebrates the winter solstice, has had some residents and Christian organizations calling atheists Scrooges because they said it was attacking the celebration of Jesus Christ's birth. ""Religion is but myth and superstition that hardens hearts and enslaves minds,"" the sign from the Freedom From Religion Foundation says in part. The sign, which was at the Legislative Building at 6:30 a.m. PT, was gone by 7:30 a.m., Gaylor said. The incident will not stifle the group's message, Gaylor said. Before reports of the placard's recovery, she said a temporary sign with the same message would be placed in the building's Rotunda. Gaylor said a note would be attached saying, ""Thou shalt not steal."" ""I guess they don't follow their own commandments,"" Gaylor said. ""There's nothing out there with the atheist point of view, and now there is such a firestorm that we have the audacity to exist. And then [whoever took the sign] stifles our speech."" Gaylor said that police are checking security cameras pointed at the building's entrances and exits to see if they can see anyone stealing the sign. ""It's probably about 50 pounds, "" Gaylor said. ""My brother-in-law was huffing and puffing carrying it up the stairs. It's definitely not something you can stick under your arm or conceal."" The Washington State Patrol, which is handling the incident, could not be reached for comment. Dan Barker, a former evangelical preacher and co-founder of the group, said it was important for atheists to see their viewpoints validated alongside everyone else's. Barker said the display is especially important given that 25 percent of Washington state residents are unaffiliated with religion or do not believe in God. (A recent survey by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life found 23 percent of Washingtonians said they were unaffiliated with a religion and 7 percent said they didn't believe in God.) ""It's not that we are trying to coerce anyone; in a way our sign is a signal of protest,"" Barker said. ""If there can be a Nativity scene saying that we are all going to hell if we don't bow down to Jesus, we should be at the table to share our views."" He said if anything, it's the Nativity scene that is the intrusion. ""Most people think December is for Christians and view our signs as an intrusion, when actually it's the other way around,"" he said. ""People have been celebrating the winter solstice long before Christmas. We see Christianity as the intruder, trying to steal the holiday from all of us humans."" The scene in Washington state is not unfamiliar. Barker has had signs in Madison, Wisconsin, for 13 years. The placard is often turned around so the message can't be seen, and one year, someone threw acid on it, forcing the group to encase it in Plexiglas. In Washington, D.C., the American Humanist Association began a bus ad campaign this month questioning belief in God. ""Why believe in a God?"" the advertisement asks. ""Just be good for goodness sake."" That ad has caused the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority to field hundreds of complaints, the group said, but it has heard just as much positive feedback, said Fred Edwords, the association's spokesman. Edwords said the ad campaign, which features a shrugging Santa Claus, was not meant to attack Christmas but rather to reach out to an untapped audience. Edwords maintains the campaign began in December mostly because the group had extra money left over for the year. The connection to Christmas is a coincidence, he said. ""There are a lot of people out there who don't know there are organizations like ours to serve their needs,"" Edwords said. ""The thing is, to reach a minority group, in order to be heard, everyone in the room has to hear you, even when they don't want to."" The ad campaign, Edwords said, is to make people think. He said he doesn't expect to ""convert"" anyone. But the Christian Coalition of America is urging members to oppose the advertisements. ""Although a number of humanists and atheists continue to attempt to rid God and Christmas from the public square, the American people are overwhelmingly opposed to such efforts,"" Roberta Combs, the group's president said in a press release. ""We will ask our millions of supporters to call the city of Washington, D.C., and Congress to stop this un-Godly campaign."" As far as the criticism goes, Edwords said there are far more controversial placards in Washington. ""That's D.C. -- this is a political center,"" he said. ""If I can see a placard with dead fetuses on it, I think someone can look at our question and just think about it."" The anger over the display in Olympia began after it was assembled Monday. The sentiment grew after some national media personalities called upon viewers to flood the phone lines of the governor's office. The governor's office told The Seattle Times it received more than 200 calls an hour afterward. ""I happen to be a Christian, and I don't agree with the display that is up there,"" Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire told The Olympian newspaper. ""But that doesn't mean that as governor, I have the right to deny their ability to express their free speech."" For some, the issue isn't even that the atheists are putting their thoughts on display, but rather the way in which they are doing it. ""They are shooting themselves in the foot,"" said iReport contributor Rich Phillips, who describes himself as an atheist. ""Everyone's out there for the holidays, trying to represent their religion, their beliefs, and it's a time to be positive."" The atheist message was never intended to attack anyone, Barker said. ""When people ask us, 'Why are you hateful? Why are you putting up something critical of people's holidays? -- we respond that we kind of feel that the Christian message is the hate message,"" he said. ""On that Nativity scene, there is this threat of internal violence if we don't submit to that master. Hate speech goes both ways.""","NEW: Placard from Washington state Capitol found in a ditch, radio station says .

"(CNN) -- Literary circles were abuzz after three previously unpublished short stories by American author J.D. Salinger showed up on the Internet this week. The reported works by the reclusive writer of ""The Catcher in the Rye"" appeared numerous places online, including upload sites Imgur and MediaFire. They were previously only available for academic study. The 41-page album is simply called ""Three Stories."" It contains these offerings: ""The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls,"" ""Birthday Boy"" and ""Paula."" So, could this be legit? Los Angeles Times book critic David L. Ulin says yes. ""I've never read ""The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls"": It's part of a collection of Salinger material at the Princeton University library and available only to scholars who are supervised as they read,"" he said in the online edition of the paper. ""I have read the other two stories, however, at the University of Texas' Ransom Center, and the versions of them in 'Three Stories' are the real deal."" Another affirmation comes from Salinger scholar Kenneth Slawenski, author of ""J.D. Salinger: A Life,"" who talked with BuzzFeed. ""While I do quibble with the ethics (or lack of ethics) in posting the Salinger stories, they look to be true transcripts of the originals and match my own copies,"" Slawenski told BuzzFeed in an e-mail. Princeton had its own theories on how the stories could have made it to the public. ""The story is probably an unauthorized version transcribed longhand in our reading room,"" said Martin Mbugua, a Princeton spokesman. ""It's also possible that it came from photocopies of the typescript probably made before the mid-1980s when we decided that we would no longer allow photo-duplication for any work by Salinger."" But several reports point to a September auction on eBay of ""Three Stories UNPUBLISHED JD Salinger (catcher in the rye) First Edition"" which went for about $110, as the source of the online material. The pages were scanned and uploaded, the reports suggest. A photo included with the listing says it was first printed in London in 1999 and identifies it as copy number six out of 25 numbered copies. Ironically, the page also says: ""The three stories in this book remain unpublished and locked by J. D. Salinger for publishing.""

"KEY WEST, Florida (CNN)  -- The USNS General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, a retired U.S. Navy warship, embarked on a sedentary new career Wednesday on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico. The USNS Vandenberg was intentionally sunk Wednesday to create an artificial reef for marine life. The decommissioned warship was scuttled in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary between 10:20 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. ET to become the world's second-largest artificial coral reef. The 17,250-ton ship sank in less than two minutes, said Andy Newman, spokesman for the Florida Keys Tourism Council. It is resting about 140 feet below the surface, but much of its bulk is only 40 to 70 feet below the surface. ""It went down like a rock,"" he told CNN. ""Everything looked very, very smooth."" About 300 boats positioned themselves as close as possible to the site, and cheers went up when the Vandenberg slipped beneath the water seven miles south of Key West, the spokesman said.  Watch the Vandenberg sink » . Newman, who was circling in a helicopter above the 522-foot-long ship, said the Vandenberg appeared to rest in a level position on the Gulf floor. Divers were to assess its position Wednesday. Authorities said once final assessments of the ship are made, divers can begin exploring. The goal of the $8.6 million project is to divert fishing and diving pressure away from natural reefs, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The commission ""estimates that the vessel's life span of at least 100 years will contribute stable, long-term habitat for scores of marine fish species, and provide exceptional diving and fishing opportunities for Florida residents and visitors,"" its Web site says. To sink the Vandenberg, holes were made above the waterline in the side of the ship and throughout various decks, Newman said. Explosive charges were embedded in the bilge area below the water. The explosives detonated inside the hull, blowing outward. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration projects that the Vandenberg artificial reef will result in an annual increase of about $7.5 million in expenditures in the economy of Monroe County, which includes Key West. Sinkthevandenberg.com -- a joint effort by Artificial Reefs of the Keys and Valeo Films -- had offered a live, online stream of the event, but the system apparently was overloaded, making the site inaccessible. The Vandenberg was built at the Kaiser shipyard in Richmond, California, in 1943. It was commissioned as a World War II troop transport ship. After Japan surrendered, the Vandenberg was the first Navy ship to return to New York Harbor. During the 1950s the ship was used to transport refugees from Europe and Australia to America. In the 1960s the Air Force used the Vandenberg to track missiles. It also was used to track rockets and early space shuttle launches. The ship was decommissioned in 1986 and was anchored with more than 25 other mothballed ships in Norfolk, Virginia. The Vandenberg was towed to Key West last month. The Vandenberg was chosen from among 400 decommissioned military vessels mainly based on appearance: ""her topside structure, her smooth, interesting hull lines, big girth and her starring role in a motion picture,"" Newman said. The ship was featured in the 1999 movie ""Virus,"" starring Donald Sutherland and Jamie Lee Curtis. Four men who had served on the Vandenberg traveled to Key West to see the ship go to its final resting place. Patrick Utecht worked for more than 20 years as a civilian contractor on the Vandenberg when it was used for missile and radar tracking and data collection. When he heard about its future as part of an artificial reef, Utecht said, ""My feeling was one of elation.""

The largest ship ever scuttled to create an artificial reef was the decommissioned aircraft carrier USS Oriskany, which sank to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida coast in 2006, according to the U.S. Navy. The former warship slipped under the water about 24 miles south of Pensacola, Florida, the Navy says on its Web site. The Oriskany was 888 feet long, and weighed 32,000 tons. It sank in water about 212 feet deep.","A decommissioned U.S. Navy warship was intentionally sunk off the Florida Keys .

"(CNN) -- Metro stations get a bad reputation as dark, grimy places where travelers are as likely to catch a communicable disease as they are a train. Riding the subway needn't be a journey to the dark side. Brash, bright and colorful new metro stations have begun to open in several cities that make going cheek-to-cheek with 45 strangers in a metal tube almost feel worth it. With the latest of these, New York's sunlit Fulton Transit Center, opening its doors this month, here's a look at some of the world's best. Fulton Transit Center (New York) Gloomier than most, New York's underground rail network would make an ideal hangout for vampires, if only they could put up with the unpredictable weekend services and that weird smell at Canal Street. Creatures of the dark would do well to avoid the newly opened Fulton Transit Center though. This hub for nine subway lines in Lower Manhattan sits under a huge oculus -- a beautiful conical conduit that pulls light down well below street level. Westfriedhof (Munich) Inaugurated in 1998 to little fanfare, this otherwise ordinary looking station took on new life just three years later. In 2001, Westfriedhof's platform was aesthetically enhanced by 11 enormous, domed lighting fixtures that continuously bathe the surroundings in haunting shades of blue, yellow and red. Toledo (Naples, Italy) Opened in 2012, Toledo station defies its depth -- at 50 meters, one of the deepest in Naples -- with a design based around themes of light and water. A work called ""Light Panels,"" by Robert Wilson, illuminates the station corridor furthest underground. This stunning station has competition: it's part of the city's network of so-called Metro Art Stations. Komsomolskaya (Moscow) Komsomolskaya station's baroque-style decor, historical mosaics and chandeliered ceilings resemble a grand ballroom. Opened in 1952 to alleviate the congestion of one of Moscow's busiest transport hubs, the opulence of the mosaics was inspired by an infamous wartime speech by Stalin. Olaias (Lisbon, Portugal) In 1998, Lisbon hosted a world expo, in part to celebrate 500 years of Portuguese inventions. Built to help transport the expo's 11 million visitors, the station is a whimsically colorful space that to this day holds its own as a modern work of art. Formosa Boulevard (Kaohsiung, Taiwan) Half metro station, half kaleidoscope, this church to commuting revolves around a dazzling ""Dome of Light"" said to be the largest glass work in the world. The dome, consisting of 4,500 panels, is the work of Narcissus Quagliata, an Italian designer who subtitled ""Wind, Fire and Time."" Given the ecclesiastical appearance of this installation, it should come as no surprise that its been proposed as a venue for mass weddings. Westminster (London) London Underground might be the great great grandparent of all the world's metro stations, but Westminster, opened just days before the new millennium, has to be one of the most futuristic-looking. The austere concrete and stainless steel design somehow achieves a functional beauty rather than oppressing all those commuters scurrying to and from their offices. Khalid Bin Al Waleed Station (Dubai, UAE) The driverless trains of Dubai's shiny new(ish) metro system might be mildly disconcerting, but not as much as the bizarre, but beautiful jellyfish dangling from the ceiling of the the Khalid Bin Al Waleed Station. These exotic chandeliers cast a luminous blue glow over the stop beneath the BurJuman shopping center and add to a watery theme further complimented by images of traditional pearl divers. T-Centralen (Stockholm) Above ground, Stockholm's central station looks like a pretty average part of a rapid transit system. Start boring down, though, and unexpected changes in color and shape reveal a very different animal. When commuters reach the bold blue and white, cave-like platform at T-Centralen, they're reminded that they've indeed ventured underground. Various stations (Pyongyang, North Korea) There are many grim realities to life in North Korea, but traveling on the Pyongyang Metro is unlikely to be high on the list, not least because of the ornate stations. These spotlessly clean deep level stops on the two-line network are styled as palaces for the people. It's claimed the city's underground rail network began life as a military facility and there are still lines and stations used exclusively by security services and government officials. Bockenheimer Warte (Frankfurt, Germany) Seeking to distinguish his design from the unobtrusive minimalism of other Frankfurt stations, architect Zbigniew Peter Pininski outdid himself with the fantastical entrance to Bockenheimer Warte. Depicting a train car crashing through the sidewalk, it leaves commuters either shocked or bemused, but rarely indifferent. ""Fosteritos"" (Bilbao, Spain) Less than 20 years old, Bilbao's metro is the third-largest in Spain. The curved-glass entrances of many of the stations -- affectionately nicknamed ""Fosteritos"" (""Little Fosters"") after their creator, Lord Foster -- are considered prime examples of the city's modern, up-to-the-minute style. The transparent structures admit plenty of daytime light and at night are lit up. Palais Royal -- Musee du Louvre (Paris) In a city as beautiful as Paris, this unconventional station entrance at Place Colette still stands out. Completed in 2000 (the centennial year of the Paris metro), Jean-Michel Othoniel's ""Kiosque des noctambules"" (""Kiosk of the night owls"") intertwines dazzling colored beads to form two protective cupolas. A meeker design would be overshadowed by the close proximity of the Louvre Museum and surrounding classic architecture. In this case, however, it adds a touch of cheeky hipness. Admiralteyskaya (St. Petersburg, Russia) St. Petersburg's newest metro stop proves that classic and modern design can coexist harmoniously. After many setbacks, the station finally opened for business in December 2011. Stark curved ceilings and low lighting complement traditional marble and arched platforms in what's the deepest station in the network. Plac Wilsona (Warsaw, Poland) The Soviets built some extraordinary metro stations, but this 2005 effort, named after U.S. president Woodrow Wilson, showed that a capitalist Poland could come up with some beauties, too. Unless, as might appear, it was actually built by UFOs. Staromestska (Prague) All the stations on Prague's A Line deserve a place in the European metro hall of fame for their distinctive dimpled metal tunnel walls, but Staromestska is the most visited and photographed. A different color for each station, they look like something from the dystopian film ""A Clockwork Orange,"" but the bubble-wrap design actually strengthens the metal. Universidad de Chile (Santiago, Chile) Santiago's clean and efficient metro network has been built with style in mind, so there's plenty to look at across its 108 stations. Leading the charge is the Universidad de Chile stop where gigantic murals by artist Mario Toral cover the walls. The epic scale of these acrylic and oil on canvas works match their subject matter -- the highs and lows of Chilean history. Puts the daily commute in perspective.

"(CNN) -- Dan Cathy, the CEO of Chick-fil-A, proudly proclaimed his opposition to marriage equality and drew flak from politicians and citizens nationwide, who said Cathy's position made the chain unwelcome on their turf. Some of the condemnation crossed the line, offending the First Amendment. Some did not. Many don't understand where the line is, and now a population already sharply divided over same-sex marriage is collectively less informed about the First Amendment. The First Amendment protects you from government action suppressing your right to free speech. It does not protect you from private individuals' negative reaction to your speech. As an extreme example: In my younger and more impulsive days, I punched out a guy who offended my then-girlfriend (now wife). He said he was exercising his First Amendment rights. I agreed and told him that I would defend him if the government messed with him, but the First Amendment didn't protect him from a private punch. I broke a few laws that day, but I didn't violate the First Amendment. Similarly, the First Amendment does not protect you from criticism. Sarah Palin infamously took us all back a few steps by ignorantly criticizing the media for its negative commenting on her views. She said, ""I don't know what the future of our country would be in terms of First Amendment rights and our ability to ask questions without fear of attacks by the mainstream media."" This statement is utterly wrong. The First Amendment does not protect you from scrutiny or criticism by the media or others. Christian groups allege threats to religious freedom in anti-Chick-fil-A campaigns . Therefore, those claiming that the private calls to boycott Chick-fil-A have any First Amendment implications are wrong. Cathy put his thoughts into the marketplace of ideas, where they may be bought or rejected. He has no First Amendment right to our approval, or to our money for his sandwiches. But can cities use zoning to combat unpopular speech? Unfortunately, when we chip away at the First Amendment, unpleasant unintended consequences are not far behind. In Barnes v. Glen Theatre Inc., the Supreme Court allowed municipalities to use zoning to regulate strip clubs and adult bookstores to combat their ""adverse secondary effects."" In other words, a city can't ban adult bookstores because it doesn't like the books it sells. The city can effectively ban them by claiming it is doing so to prevent litter, traffic, lowered property values or other secondary effects it claims the business may cause (and needs scant evidence to support the regulation). Over the years, courts expanded the doctrine to be virtually limitless. Now a city need only mouth the words ""adverse secondary effects"" when enacting a regulation, and for the most part, courts will uphold it -- even though everyone knows the real reason is that the city doesn't like the books and movies that the store sells. Eatocracy: Why I'm celebrating Chick-fil-Gay Appreciation Day . When municipalities are told for years they can make up zoning or other regulatory issues to make an end run around the First Amendment, is it any surprise that they would look to zoning obstacles to stop Chick-fil-A from coming into town because they don't like the CEO's views on same-sex marriage? Some cities responded to Cathy's statements with proper deference to the First Amendment, but others have not. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino initially said, ""If they need licenses in the city, it will be very difficult. ..."" After considering the issue, though -- and probably talking with his attorneys -- Menino acknowledged he did not have the power to block the chain from operating in Boston. In contrast, Chicago Alderman Joe Moreno went further, saying he would work to block any Chick-fil-A in his ward. Moreno defended his view by saying, ""You have the right to say what you want to say, but zoning is not a right."" He then took a page out of the ""adverse secondary effects"" doctrine playbook by saying he had concerns about increased traffic in the area. So far, Moreno has not backed down. Chick-fil-A wades into a fast-food fight over same-sex marriage rights . These statements clearly raise First Amendment issues. A city can't deny permits because it disapproves of the owner's exercise of his First Amendment rights. Both Menino and Moreno were dead wrong even to claim they would do so. That crosses the line between simply speaking out and abusing government power. Menino's critics are right about his initial misuse of zoning law being a violation of the First Amendment, but after backing down on his threats, the mayor maintained he did not welcome Chick-fil-A in Boston. He was within his rights to do so -- expressing his own opinion, both personally and as mayor. In a letter to the chain, he wrote: ""When Massachusetts became the first state in the country to recognize equal marriage rights, I personally stood on City Hall Plaza to greet same-sex couples coming here to be married,"" he added. ""It would be an insult to them and to our city's long history of expanding freedom to have a Chick-fil-A across the street from that spot."" As mayor of Boston, Menino has a First Amendment right, and perhaps even a duty, to express his views, as all political figures do. They have a position that gives them a platform to speak out, and be heard, on matters of public concern. Rick Santorum had a right to say that a mosque shouldn't be built in Lower Manhattan. A mayor in a less enlightened city has a right to say that Chick-fil-A is especially welcome, just as he might want to say that Starbucks is not welcome because it gives benefits to same-sex couples. A city council member has a right to say that ""my district doesn't want an adult bookstore,"" and Menino has a right to say that Boston does not welcome a business run by someone who is prejudiced. As long as they do not then try and give their views the force of law, they are within bounds. And if their constituents disagree with their views, then they use the political process to cure the problem. Politicians' rights, however, do not bleed over into using their official power to deny a business its fair due because of its, or its CEO's, exercise of our cherished First Amendment rights. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marc J. Randazza.","Marc J. Randazza: Dustup over Chick-fil-A shows confusion over First Amendment .

"Washington (CNN) -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel joined U.S. President Barack Obama on Tuesday in saying Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi must step down, expressing support for the NATO military mission even though her country abstained from the U.N. Security Council vote that authorized it. At a joint news conference at the White House, Merkel said Germany's participation in NATO operations shows its support for the Libya mission. She also noted that Germany has increased resources to the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan to free other countries to contribute to the Libya mission. ""It is our joint will that this NATO mission is successful,"" Merkel said of the Libya operation, adding that what happens in North Africa affects Europe. ""Those are our immediate neighbors, and we have a choice. Either this works out well, or we have an enormous refugee problem. and so it's not only out of charity ... there's not only a moral obligation, but we have also a vested interest in seeing to it that this continent, this region comes on its feet."" Obama and Merkel also said they oppose unilateral actions by players in the Middle East peace process, including a push for a U.N. General Assembly vote on an independent Palestinian state. And Obama warned of possible new sanctions against Iran if an upcoming International Atomic Energy Agency report cites continued non-compliance involving the nation's nuclear energy program. Both played down any major differences in how they think their countries and the international community should deal with continuing economic challenges. On the United States, Obama said he isn't concerned about a possible double-dip recession, but added he is concerned that the nation's economic recovery is not creating jobs more quickly. Merkel diplomatically said she has confidence that the United States will deal with its economic issues. The news conference included some minor unscripted moments, such as Merkel stumbling as the pair walked to the microphones and later shutting off her cell phone when it rang while Obama was speaking. The two leaders were meeting for the 10th time as part of Merkel's official visit to Washington that included a state dinner Tuesday night where she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. In his toast to Merkel at the start of the dinner, Obama presented her with the medal and noted she was a young girl in what became East Germany when the Berlin Wall went up in 1961. Merkel lived to see the wall come down, and went on to become the first woman to serve as German chancellor, the president noted. ""Tonight we honor Angela Merkel ... for what she achieved when she gained her freedom,"" Obama said. In her toast, Merkel thanked the American people and called the award ""a testimony of the excellent Germany-U.S. partnership."" Noting it has been almost 10 years since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Merkel said both countries knew that ""living in freedom and defending freedom are two sides of the same coin."" ""Sometimes this may seem like an endless fight,"" Merkel said, then added that her personal experience was different, showing that ""what we dare dream today may become reality."" Keeping with the preferred theme of the evening, musician James Taylor told reporters when arriving for the dinner that he was asked to perform Carole King's ""You've Got a Friend"" as part of his set. Earlier, Obama and Merkel emphasized the cooperative and vital relationship between their countries, with Obama paying special tribute to the German chancellor. In addition to their 10 meetings, he told reporters, the two communicate regularly by phone and video conference. ""There's hardly any global issue where we don't consult one another,"" Obama said, adding, ""I trust her."" Merkel received an official welcome to the White House on Tuesday morning in a ceremony marked by pomp and circumstance, a major honor for an ally who at times has differed on key issues from her American counterparts. During their talks, the two leaders discussed a range of economic and security topics, including the turmoil in the Middle East and the shaky global economy. At the news conference afterward, Obama said the situation in Europe -- where Greece and some other countries face mounting debt crises that threaten to drag down the global economy -- involves ""tough"" politics. ""You recall how difficult it was for us to make investments in our own auto industry or to make sure that we didn't have a financial meltdown here,"" the president said. ""Well, imagine if you're having to make those same decisions with 27 other countries with respect to somebody else's economic problems."" He expressed confidence that ""Germany's leadership, along with other key actors in Europe, will help us arrive at a path for Greece to return to growth, for this debt to become more manageable. but it's going to require some patience and some time."" He pledged full U.S. cooperation, including working through international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. ""We think it would be disastrous for us to see an uncontrolled spiral and default in Europe, because that could trigger a whole range of other events,"" Obama said. ""And I think Angela shares that same view. and so we're going to have to work through this issue methodically, and we will be supportive in any ways that we can to make sure that all of the best ideas are brought to bear on the problem."" In welcoming Merkel earlier, Obama said the German-U.S. alliance ""at its core is a partnership between two peoples."" ""The story of Germany and our alliance in the 20th century shows what's possible in the 21st,"" Obama said. ""Wars can end, adversaries can become allies, walls can come down.  At long last, nations can be whole and can be free."" Obama also referenced his unique status as America's first African-American president, as well as Merkel's as Germany's first female chancellor. ""It's obvious that neither of us looks exactly like the leaders who preceded us,"" he said. ""The fact that we can stand here today as president of the United States and chancellor of a united Germany is a testament to the progress and freedom that is possible in our world."" Merkel praised America's role in the Cold War, noting that ""when Germany and Europe were divided by the war and barbed wire, America consistently stood on the side of freedom."" ""This we shall never forget,"" she said. ""Europe and Germany have no better partner than America."" Washington and Berlin, however, have been at odds in recent months over the NATO-led war in Libya, among other things.  Germany abstained from the U.N. Security Council vote establishing a no-fly zone over the North African country. In April, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared in a speechin Germany that ""the world did not wait for another Srebrenica in a place called Benghazi,"" referring to the site of a Bosnian massacre and the Libyan rebel stronghold that was under siege by forces loyal to Gadhafi. On the economic front, Germany continues to expand its trade surplus with record exports, causing critics to complain it should boost domestic consumption to ease the imbalance as part of global efforts to quicken recovery from the recession. Merkel advocates tough austerity measures for European Union colleagues, and recently decided to close all of Germany's nuclear power plants in coming years in the wake of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami that caused reactor meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Obama, facing a tough political fight over Republican demands to shrink the government to reduce the federal deficit and national debt, calls for continued investment in education, infrastructure and clean energy while cutting wasteful spending and raising taxes on people with the highest incomes. His administration proposes a broad energy policy that increases domestic oil production as well as nuclear power while pushing to develop solar and wind energy production to compete in a growing global market. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney noted Monday that because Merkel is a head of government, rather than a head of state, her trip has been labeled an official visit rather than a state visit.  But Tuesday night's gathering, he stressed, will be a state dinner. CNN's Alan Silverleib, Tom Cohen, Dan Lothian and Alexander Mooney contributed to this story.","NEW: Obama bestows nation's highest civilian honor on Merkel .

"(CNN) -- It feels as if I've been living a double life all of these years, and I do not want to deceive you, or myself, any longer. The burden has become too heavy, the struggle to deny my true self, too great. In order to be free I have tell you something. I am black. I know; I should have told you sooner. But I was afraid. After all, I've already shared with you that I am gay and well, we all know a person can't be both. At least that's how it feels the conversation is usually framed: There's a black community and a gay community, and the two conflict and do not mix. Since President Obama voiced support for marriage equality and now the board of the NAACP has followed suit, the narrative is that the black community is trying to make room at the table for gay people. Allow me to correct this storyline: No one is making room for gay people, gay people have always been at the table, at the forefront. What Obama, Jay-Z, Julian Bond, Floyd Mayweather Jr. and others have done over the past week is simply acknowledge life is not an ""either/or"" proposition but rather an emphatic ""and."" Boxes are for shoes, not people. So while compartmentalizing folks makes it easier to herd people into target groups and voting blocs, it's a gross misrepresentation of the reality of humanity. I am gay. And I am black. And despite the efforts of black religious conservatives to ignore that intersection, the truth is that intersection is a major part of black culture. It's in our literature (James Baldwin), our films (Lee Daniels), in politics, baseball fields (Glenn Burke), the Black Panthers (Angela Davis) and the civil rights movement (Bayard Rustin). That intersection exists in our hair salons, barbershops and, yes, even our churches. Before becoming a journalist, I worked in youth ministry in two churches in my early 20s. I lived with one of my pastors and his family and would study the Bible for hours on end under his tutelage. I fasted and tithed. I poured my heart out to the kids in the congregation. On occasion I even would fall asleep on the steps of the altar worshipping my God. I am black. I am gay. And yes, I am a Christian. I also know I was not the only gay, black man in ministry desperately trying to pray the gay away. In fact, I know one prominent choir director who finally had the courage to come out not too long ago. This is the messy and beautiful reality of humanity. The National Organization for Marriage, a fringe anti-gay think tank, actually had outlined a plan to try to race bait the black community into fighting with... itself. ""N.O.M.'s memos detailed its campaign to direct money to a handful of African-American clergy in order to attack gay and lesbian couples that have made a lifelong promise to one another,"" said Sharon Lettman-Hicks, the executive director of the National Black Justice Coalition. ""The organization admitted their key goal is to drive a wedge between gays and blacks."" But I am black, and I am gay. A wedge cannot be driven between parts of my being. I was talking with NFL Hall of Famer Michael Irvin this past weekend, and he told me something that made a lot of sense. He said, in the fight for equality, you must be willing to run a race in which you may not be around to see the finish line. Not necessarily a pick-me-up, but filled with truth nonetheless. We are just beginning to have this conversation about sexual orientation and gender identity within the black community, but it is long overdue. A study conducted by the National Center for Children in Poverty found that African-American and Native American young people ""are overrepresented"" in the population of runaways. The study also found that between 20% and 40% of all homeless youth identify themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or questioning. Many say they were kicked out of their homes or ran away because of violence. Even on the streets these children are much more likely than others to be abused. How can the black community heal if it turns a blind eye to its own children? It doesn't make any sense. Blacks trying to separate the gay community from blacks? Well, that makes even less sense. After all, a house divided against itself cannot stand, and gay people are, and always will be, living in this house. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: Black, gay communities treated as if they are totally separate .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN)  -- Kenyan wildlife officials are ferrying thousands of zebras and wildebeest to a park in the country's south to feed starving lions and hyenas, and prevent a conflict with humans. The animals will be hauled from four locations to restock Amboseli National Park's population, which lost 80 percent of its herbivores in a recent drought, said Kentice Tikolo, spokeswoman for the Kenya Wildlife Service. ""It was the worst drought in 26 years,"" Tikolo said. ""The Amboseli ecosystem was severely affected. ... Lots of herbivores died, carnivores don't have anything to feed on, and have been attacking neighboring livestock."" The imbalance has sparked a row with villagers who lost animals in the drought and have threatened to kill lions and hyenas preying on remaining livestock. Should the zebras be brought in to help the lions? ""There are only 2,000 lions left nationwide, and we are concerned because the numbers are dropping,"" the spokeswoman said. ""Maasais are getting angry and threatening to spear them -- the human versus wildlife conflict is getting out of hand -- and our carnivores are already greatly endangered."" About 4,000 zebras and 3,000 wildebeest will be transferred to Amboseli. The zebras will go first. The wildebeest will follow, after calving season, Tikolo said. Once at Amboseli, they're expected to breed and sustain the lions over the long term. Shipping the animals from Soysambu Conservancy in the Rift Valley and three other nearby locations will cost about $ 1.4 million, according to Tikolo. The animals are herded into a funnel-shape enclosure using helicopters and loaded into trucks to Amboseli. From there, they are released into the wild, she said. Tourism is the second-largest source of foreign exchange in the east African nation. About 20 percent of the income comes from tourism, with Amboseli as the second -highest earner, Tikolo said . Lions are among the big five -- the list of top wildlife tourist attractions in the nation. Others are elephants, leopards, rhinos and buffalo.","Animals brought in to restock Amboseli National Park's population .

"(CNN) -- It's not shocking to see a woman talking on her cell phone while walking down the street. It is, however, shocking when the woman is an extra in a silent film from 1928. Charlie Chaplin's ""The Circus"" is getting internet buzz with a clip from the black-and-white comedy spreading at viral speed. The clip -- a DVD extra spotted by filmmaker George Clarke -- shows a woman holding what some say appears to be a mobile phone to her ear and talking. The only explanation: She's a time traveler. At least that's the word on the Web. In the late 1920s, Chaplin was nominated for an Academy Award for acting, writing, directing and producing ""The Circus,"" but he was taken out of the running and presented with a ""Special Award"" instead. Perhaps the Academy didn't think it was fair to include him in the race -- what with the use of technology from the future and all. We're just curious who operates her mobile network.","Internet writers say they've spotted a ""cell phone"" from 1928 .

"(CNN) -- Susan Atkins is terminally ill; Charles ""Tex"" Watson is an ordained minister. They and other members of Charles Manson's murderous ""family"" now shun him. A new photo of Charles Manson shows his gray beard and the swastika tattooed into his forehead. After three decades behind bars, Manson family members Atkins, Watson, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten have repeatedly been described as model prisoners who have accepted responsibility for their crimes. Parole boards, however, continue to reject their bids for release, and a debate rages over whether the four should ever be freed. The release of Manson's prison photo recently rekindled public interest in slayings of pregnant actress Sharon Tate and six others in a two-night rampage that terrorized the city of Los Angeles, California, in August 1969. CNN looked into the status of some of his former followers. Atkins, California's longest-serving female inmate, requested a ""compassionate release"" from the California Board of Parole Hearings in July. She has terminal brain cancer, doctors say. The board unanimously denied her request. Atkins' 18th parole suitability hearing is scheduled for May 28, according to a Web site maintained by her husband and attorney, James Whitehouse. The Web site says Atkins, now 60, is paralyzed over 85 percent of her body and cannot sit up in bed or even be moved into a wheelchair. Despite her declining condition and spotless prison record, the site says, ""there is still a very real chance the Parole Board will nonetheless insist her release would be a danger to society."" The Manson family members were initially sentenced to death, only to have their sentences commuted to life in prison when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down death penalty laws in 1972, establishing a four-year moratorium on executions. By her own admission, Atkins held Tate down as she pleaded for mercy, and stabbed the eight-months-pregnant woman 16 times. In a 1993 parole board hearing, Atkins said Tate ""asked me to let her baby live ... I told her I didn't have any mercy on her."" After stabbing Tate to death, according to historical accounts of the murders, Atkins scrawled the word ""pig"" in blood on the door of the home Tate shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski, who was not home at the time. Three of Tate's house guests were also slain, as was a teenager who was visiting the home's caretaker in his cottage out back. Atkins' compassionate release was opposed by Tate's sister, Debra, Los Angeles County prosecutors and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, among others. However, the former prosecutor who won her conviction, Vincent Bugliosi, said he supported Atkins' request for release. Debra Tate told CNN in an e-mail she does not believe any Manson family member convicted of murder should ever be set free. She said the slayings of the victims, including some that may have not been discovered, were ""so vicious, so inhumane, so depraved, that there is no turning back. "" ""The 'Manson Family' murderers are sociopaths, and from that, they can never be rehabilitated,"" Debra Tate said. ""They should all stay right where they are -- in prison -- until they die. There will never be true justice for my sister Sharon and the other victims of the 'Manson Family.' Keeping the murderers in prison is the least we, as a society who values justice, can do."" In a manuscript posted on her Web site, Atkins, who was known within the Manson family as Sadie Mae Glutz, wrote, ""I will never be able to replace what my crime took away. And that's not 'neat,' and that's not 'cool.'"" Known as Katie within the Manson Family, Krenwinkel killed coffee heiress Abigail Folger at the Tate home and, the following night, stabbed Rosemary LaBianca and carved the word ""War"" on her husband Leno LaBianca's abdomen. She remained faithful to Manson throughout her trial and into the first few years of her incarceration, according to a profile posted on the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law Web site, but she later ""made strides to turn her life around."" Now 61, Krenwinkel is a model inmate at the California Institution for Women in Frontera, according to Lt. Robert Patterson, a prison spokesman. She is involved in the Prison Pups program, which helps train puppies to be service dogs, he said. ""It gives you a reason to wake up every morning, and keep moving on,"" Krenwinkel told Los Angeles station KABC, a CNN affiiate. The program at that time had trained more than 100 dogs; Krenwinkel said she was training her seventh dog. According to the Manson Family Today Web site, which keeps tabs on all things related to the case, Krenwinkel has largely accepted the fact that she probably will never leave prison. Her next parole hearing will be sometime before December, Patterson said. Van Houten was convicted in the raid at the LaBianca home, where she helped hold Rosemary LaBianca down as the woman was stabbed to death. At the time, she was 19. ""The autopsy reports have shown that it was Tex that wielded the fatal wounds, but I contributed, and I attempted to hold her down for Pat [Krenwinkel],"" Van Houten said in a 2002 appearance on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""I called to Tex because we couldn't kill her. You know, it's -- morally, I feel as though I did."" Her conviction was overturned in 1976, on the grounds that a judge erred in not granting a mistrial after the disappearance of her attorney, Ronald Hughes, who later was found dead. In Van Houten's first retrial, the jury was unable to reach a verdict, and she was released on bond for a few months. But in her third trial, in 1978, she was convicted of first-degree murder. Known as Lulu within the Manson family, Van Houten, a former high school homecoming queen, is serving her life sentence at the California Institution for Women at Frontera, the same facility as Krenwinkel and, until last year, Atkins. Like Krenwinkel, Van Houten is involved in prison programs and is a mentor to other inmates in the facility's college program, Patterson said. She is also a model inmate, he added. During her 2002 CNN appearance, Van Houten called Manson ""an opportunist of the cruelest, most vicious kind."" But she was quick to emphasize that she accepts blame for her role in the crime. Like the others, Van Houten, 59, has repeatedly been turned down for parole. She is widely seen as the best candidate for parole. But her next parole hearing probably will not be until 2010, according to Patterson. ""Tex"" Watson's participation in the Manson murders is ""a part of history that he deeply regrets,"" according to a Web site dedicated to his prisoner outreach program. Watson converted to Christianity in 1975, several years after he was incarcerated, and became an ordained minister in 1983, according to the site. ""He was manipulative,"" Watson said of Manson in a November 2004 radio interview, the transcript of which is posted on the Web site. ""But I take full responsibility for my ignorance, lack of identity, emptiness and choices in life, which left me prey to his deceptive plan. My actions were my own."" Watson stabbed four people, including Tate, to death and fatally shot  two others. After the Tate murders, Watson reportedly told Manson, ""Boy, it sure was helter skelter."" However, Watson was not tried along with the others in the slayings. A month and a half after the two-night crime spree, he said, he fled to Texas. Watson, now 63, writes on the site that he has no computer or Internet access in prison, but maintains contact with the site administrator through the mail and writes much of the site's content. Watson had been denied parole 13 times as of November 2006, a correction spokeswoman said. His next parole hearing is scheduled for November.","Recent release of Charles Manson's prison photo rekindles interest in case .

"(CNN) -- Isolated in the moment, the shooting death of Trayvon Martin may seem a singular tragedy: a teenager mistaken for a criminal by an overzealous neighborhood watchman armed with a gun and backed by a state law that gives greater latitude to people to defend themselves when they feel threatened. But that moment in February in the central Florida town of Sanford was steeped in a history that has haunted the state, the South and the country for generations. No matter the state, the circumstances are eerily familiar: a slaying. Minimal police investigation. A suspect known to authorities. No arrest. Protests and outrage in a racially charged atmosphere. Florida is known for its amusement parks, beaches and pensioners from the North. But history bears out that Florida has been as much a part of the South and its vigilante-enforced racial caste system as Georgia and Alabama. In 1920, a white mob burned down the black section of Ocoee, Florida, 30 miles west of Sanford, when two ""colored"" men tried to vote. The two black men were killed for having gone to the polls. The black people who survived the massacre fled. The town remained all-white for generations. Three years later, a white mob burned and leveled the town of Rosewood, a black settlement by the Gulf of Mexico, 140 miles west of Sanford, after a white woman said a ""colored"" man had attacked her. It was where, a survivor said, ""anything that was black or looked black was killed."" It was in 1934 that perhaps the single worst act of torture and execution in 20th-century America happened. In the Florida Panhandle town of Marianna, a farm settlement between Pensacola and Tallahassee, a 23-year-old black field hand named Claude Neal was accused of the rape and murder of a 20-year-old white woman. He was arrested and signed a written confession that some historians have since called into question. A mob of more than 300 men armed with guns, torches and dynamite went searching for Neal in every jail in a 75-mile radius. The manhunt forced authorities to move Neal across the Panhandle -- by car and by boat, with the mob on their trail at every turn -- before they took him out of the state altogether, to the tiny town of Brewton, Alabama. Someone leaked Neal's whereabouts, and a lynching party stormed the jail and took Neal, his wrists hogtied, back to Marianna. It went over the news wires that he would be lynched the following day. Thousands gathered to see the lynching, so many people that the lynching party, fearing a riot, decided to take him to the woods. There they castrated him and tortured him for hours with such cruelty that one of the lynchers was reported to have thrown up. Neal's body was dragged through town and hanged from an oak tree on the courthouse lawn, his fingers displayed as souvenirs. No one was ever charged or spent a day in jail for Neal's murder. In 1951, the first casualties of the modern civil rights movement, Harry T. Moore, and his wife, Harriette, were fatally wounded in Mims, Florida, 30 miles east of Sanford, when a bomb exploded under their bed on Christmas Day. Moore had been the lone representative of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Florida, crisscrossing the state to get equal wages for black teachers and the right to vote for blacks, who were denied that right in Florida and the rest of the South. In more recent times, the first major race riots in the post-civil rights era erupted in Miami over a series of shootings of black men at the hands of white police officers who were all acquitted in the slayings. In 1979, Arthur McDuffie, a black Marine Corps veteran and insurance salesman, was killed after a high-speed chase. The police said he had died from the crash of his motorcycle. But the coroner discovered multiple blunt-force wounds inconsistent with a crash. A police investigation found that the officers had pulled McDuffie from the bike, handcuffed him and took turns beating him with nightsticks and flashlights until he was motionless. The officers then gouged the road with tire tracks and drove over the motorcycle so that there would appear to have been a crash. The officers were acquitted. The verdict set off rioting in Miami in May 1980 that left 18 people dead and more than 1,000 arrested. In 1982, Nevell Johnson Jr., a 20-year-old black man, who had worked as a Dade County messenger, was shot dead at a video arcade in Miami by a Cuban-born police officer. The shooting set off three days of rioting in Miami. The officer was acquitted. And in 1989, a block from the arcade where Johnson was slain, Clement Anthony Lloyd was shot dead on his motorcycle by a Colombian-born police officer after a routine traffic stop. A passenger, also a black male, was killed when the motorcycle crashed. The police officer said he was acting in self-defense. He was acquitted of manslaughter in 1993 in Orlando. Each case has its complexities, and each reflects an atmosphere that extends far beyond the Florida border. It's a moral challenge not for just one state but for America. Each case has a similar algorithm of caste and controversy in a region where old wounds appear to have yet to heal. But while each of the previous cases seems almost lost to memory now, it is the national outpouring of outrage from people of all backgrounds in response to the Trayvon Martin case that could signal the difference between the last century and this one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Isabel Wilkerson.","Isabel Wilkerson: Trayvon Martin case not first Florida killing with racial overtones and no arrest .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Christopher Schwarzenegger, the 13-year-old son of former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, was hospitalized after a serious surfing accident in Malibu, California, over the weekend, a source close to the family said. His parents confirmed the accident in a joint statement issued Friday. ""While it has been a very scary week, Christopher is surrounded by his family and friends,"" they said. ""He is a brave boy and is expected to make a full recovery."" Schwarzenegger slammed face-on into an object on a beach and was seriously injured, said the source, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. He was initially treated in an intensive care unit but was later moved to another unit in the unidentified hospital, the source said. ""On behalf of our entire family, we want to sincerely thank the paramedics and lifeguards who responded so swiftly as well as the doctors, nurses, emergency room and hospital staff who have cared for our son,"" the family statement said. Patrick, his 17-year-old brother, posted a Twitter message Friday morning indicating that Christopher is doing well in the hospital. ""Thank you everyone for your messages about my brother. This kid is strongest kid I ever seen. Keep praying,"" he said. Christopher is the youngest child of the former couple. Shriver filed for divorce from Schwarzenegger on July 1 after the revelation that he fathered a child with their housekeeper. The child was born less than a week after Christopher, according to birth records.","NEW: ""It has been a very scary week,"" his parents say .

"(Mental Floss) -- Being a product of the Delaware school system, I can't help but love Quakers. My middle and junior high schools were located on a Meeting House Lane. Pacifism, abolitionism and tolerance have always seemed like good ideas to me. And I'm a total sucker for Quaker Oats packaging. Richard Nixon married Patricia in a 1940 Quaker ceremony at the Mission Inn in Riverside, California. But the fact is, aside from William Penn and Betsy Ross, I really don't know that many famous Quakers. So I decided to look 'em up. Here's what I found... 1. Richard Nixon . People made such a big deal about Kennedy being a Catholic. So it's interesting to note that old Milhous Nixon was born and raised Quaker. His strict mother instilled conservative Quaker values in him (no swearing, drinking or dancing). When he couldn't afford to go to Harvard (despite earning a scholarship there), he attended Whittier- a local Quaker college where he became class President, started a frat, practiced with the football team, and even spent his Sundays teaching Sunday school to little tykes. 2. Daniel Boone . American settler, hunter, and folk hero Daniel Boone was born and raised Quaker. In fact, his family emigrated to the U.S. from England partially for that reason. What's more interesting, however, is why the Boone family didn't stay within the fold. Apparently, Danny's sister Sarah made waves in the community when she married a non-Quaker. That, in itself, might not have caused a controversy. The fact that she was visibly pregnant at the time did. The family publicly apologized for their daughter's behavior. But after their son Israel also married a non-Quaker, the Boone's became a famiglia non grata and up and moved to Carolina. 3. Joan Baez . If you're wondering how folk singer Joan Baez's religion might have played into her development as a political activist, you might want to take a look at her father's life choices. Albert Baez converted to Quakerism when Joan was a youngster, and despite being a co-inventor of the X-ray microscope and a well-known physicist, he refused to work on the atomic bomb project in Los Alamos, and also turned down lucrative job offers from defense contractors during the Cold War. 4. John Cadbury . If you love Cadbury's chocolates, you definitely owe a note of thanks to the Society of Friends. As a young man, Cadbury hoped to pursue a career in medicine or law. But because Quakers were discriminated against by all of the major universities at the time, John decided to focus on business. Believing that alcohol only exacerbated society's ills, Cadbury decided to focus on a happy alternative: chocolate and drinking cocoas. In addition to his views on temperance, Cadbury was also a bit of an activist. He led a campaign to stop the use of boys as chimney sweeps, and he founded an organization to prevent animal cruelty. 5. James Dean . Sent off to be raised by his father's sister in Fairmount, Indiana, James Dean was raised Quaker. And though the faith may not have played the biggest role in his life or career (there are tales that it was through befriending a Methodist reverend that he was encouraged to pursue his loves of bullfighting, car racing and theater), today he's buried in a Quaker cemetery. 6. Edward R. Murrow . Born in North Carolina to Quaker parents. Amazingly, for the first 6 years of his life, the famed reporter grew up in a log cabin without plumbing or electricity. His parents, who farmed for a living, made only a few hundred dollars a year, at least until they picked up and moved to Washington state. 7. Piers Anthony . While agnostic today, best-selling science fiction author Piers Anthony grew up in a fairly devout family. During the Spanish Civil War his parents left young Piers and his sister to their grandparents care, and then went to ""fight"" in Spain. In his own words, ""my parents were helping to keep those devastated children alive, by importing food and milk and feeding them on a regular basis. It was worthy work, and I don't fault it, but there was a personal cost."" 8. Judi Dench . The award-winning actress converted to Quakerism after attending a Friends school. According to Quakernet, she was first attracted to the faith because she loved the school uniforms. 9. Annie Oakley . The sharp-shooting female who was rumored to split playing cards edge-wise, then shoot through them a few times before they hit the ground, grew up a dirt-poor Quaker. In fact, her early skill with the gun came from having to hunt food for her impoverished family. 10. Bonnie Raitt . In her own words, ""I grew up... in a Quaker family, and for me being Quaker was a political calling rather than a religious one."" 11. Joseph Lister . The British surgeon who promoted cleanliness and sterility (and for whom Listerine mouthwash is named) grew up in a wealthy Quaker family. Of course, this didn't stop him from being discriminated against. In fact, Lister studied medicine at the University of London precisely because it was one of the only institutions at the time which accepted Quakers. 12. David Byrne . According to TalkingHeads.net, the musician to-be was regularly encouraged by his mother's ""tolerant Quaker philosophies."" That, along with the constant drone of Scottish and American folk music in the house, supposedly played a large role in his eventual career choice. 13. Cassius Coolidge . I really only included ""Cash"" Coolidge because I have a fondness for his Dogs Playing Poker prints (one used to hang over my puppy's sleeping cushion in my old house). Still, it's pretty interesting to know that the painter was born to abolitionist Quakers in upstate New York, and that he's oft-credited with creating Comic Foregrounds, or those novelty photo scenes you pay $2 to stick your head into, to make your body look muscle-bound at the beach.

"(CNN) -- Does your dog object to vacationing in a cage? Can't count on your brother-in-law to commit to dog-sitting for two weeks? Now there are home stay websites for four-legged creatures. Frustrated with kennels that keep dogs cooped up and charge extra for petting and walks, the founders of DogVacay.com and Rover.com are connecting dog lovers who want to earn extra cash with travelers who want dog-friendly people to care for their pets close to home while they're away. DogVacay.com founders Karine and Aaron Hirschhorn loved getting away when they first moved in together but hated taking their dogs to the kennel. ""Every time we traveled, the dogs hated the kennel and came back with kennel cough,"" said Karine. And they paid up to $120 a day for the privilege. When they took their dogs to a local trainer's home instead, the animals came back happy and rested. It was as if the dogs had been on vacation, too. So they decided to host dogs with traveling owners in their home. With Aaron Hirschhorn working at home, he had plenty of time to bike and run with the dogs and keep them company. The couple found an incredible demand for their services, which culminated in the launch of DogVacay.com last month. Rover.com launched in Seattle in November and went national this week, attracting over 10,000 people signing up to both host dogs and use the services of dog hosts. Dogvacay.com launched in March and already has had 6,000 people apply to be hosts across the country (1700 have been accepted so far). Similar to a dating site or Airbnb rental site, hosts fill out detailed profiles about their canine experience, including training, medical certification and licensing qualifications; the size and dog-friendliness of their homes and any resident dogs or other animals on site. Some hosts specifically will take puppies that aren't ready for their vaccinations yet and others will not take dogs that don't like children. Customers also fill out detailed profiles of their dogs, behavior issues and medical or other special needs. Fees start at around $15 per day for smaller apartments with hosts who are dog lovers to much higher fees for dog trainers with large yards where dogs can roam. Extra services, like a departure day bath, can often be had for an extra fee. Owners can even get photos or videos texts or emails sent to their mobile phones. Rover.com CEO Aaron Easterly, formerly in advertising for Microsoft, would get upset at the thought of Caramel, his 4-pound Pomeranian, getting stressed out before he leaves on a trip. ""Every time I leave town, I'm in a frantic rush as to what to do with her,"" said Easterly, who now uses Rover.com's services for Caramel. ""When I see how she behaves even temporarily in a cage at the vet or groomer, I would not take her to a kennel. When I take her to someone else's house, she's totally excited. The fact I'm leaving? She couldn't care less."" Now he screens the potential hosts listed on Rover.com near where he lives to pick the best option for his wallet and comfort level. The company also has a bill of rights and a 24-hour hotline (""Barkline"" in the company's terminology). DogVacay.com offers a 100% guarantee that includes insurance and emergency support. Both sites try to screen hosts and customers but agree that host and customer alike must vet their counterpart and feel comfortable with the match. Both sites recommend a meet-n-greet so dog owners and humans and dogs can meet and sniff out the temporary digs. ""Generally mass murderers and animal lovers don't overlap,"" said Karine. ""Part of the phone interview process is making sure this person has truly devoted their life to animals. A lot of our hosts have long histories around animal rescue or trainers or work for shelters. They are known in community as animal lovers."" Customers pay through the sites, which company officials said protects the customer in case of a negative experience. Both sites also only allow customers who have paid for a host's services to review that host, while Rover.com also allows testimonials from anyone who wants to recommend the host. Dogvacay.com allows the hosts to review their canine guests as well. Rover.com also holds payment for three days after a home-stay has ended to allow the customer to make any complaints before payment is made. A pre-stay visit is a good idea, according to veterinarian Kim Hennessy, because you can see if a dog-sitter keeps a clean house or has too many animals. Owners also want to make sure the other dogs are current on their vaccinations. ""You definitely want to take your dog's own food with you because a change in food can cause a lot of gastrointestinal distress,"" said Hennessy, a Downingtown, Pennsylvania, veterinarian. ""Make sure the dog sitter is knowledgeable about pets and has a fenced in yard that looks very safe. The main thing would be safety of the dog, not being able to escape and its exposure to other dogs."" ""You'd also want to have a backup vet available. I would actually call the vet and give permission for any major disasters. The vet hospital will (usually) write it down in your chart."" Rover.com, which collects 3-15% of the charge depending on the host's reviews and other factors, recently announced that it has raised $3.4 million from investors. Dogvacay.com, which collects 3-10% of the charge, just announced $1 million in funding and is on a New York City press tour this week to draw more attention to its New York listings.

"(CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder on Tuesday praised top state prosecutors who have followed his lead by declining to defend state bans on same-sex marriage. The speech to a gathering of state attorneys general was the latest by Holder in his ongoing effort to build an activist legacy on issues ranging from gay rights to changing sentencing laws for non-violent crimes. Holder cited the Obama administration decision in 2011 to quit defending the Defense of Marriage Act, which eventually led to last year's Supreme Court ruling striking down the law that required the federal government to deny recognition of state-sanctioned same-sex marriages. Since then, attorneys general in several states, from Pennsylvania to Virginia to Oregon, have similarly decided not defend their state laws banning same-sex marriage. Such decisions should only be done in ""exceptional circumstances"" Holder said Tuesday. ""I believe we must be suspicious of legal classifications based solely on sexual orientation. And we must endeavor -- in all of our efforts -- to uphold and advance the values that once led our forebears to declare unequivocally that all are created equal and entitled to equal opportunity,"" he said. In recent weeks, Holder announced plans to extend spousal benefits to same-sex married couples in all federal legal matters. For Holder, 63, it's a way to carve out a modern civil rights legacy. In discussing his gay-rights efforts, he often mentions his sister-in-law, who in 1963 made history as one of the two black students who integrated the University of Alabama under federal armed guard. A portrait of a Justice Department prosecutor who stood watch on the university steps that day hangs in Holder's personal office in a fifth-floor corner of the Justice Department headquarters named for Robert F. Kennedy. Holder and his supporters have eagerly embraced the RFK legacy as a comparison. ""When you look at his entire record, Eric Holder will have done more to expand justice in the United States than any attorney general since Bobby Kennedy,"" says Matthew Miller, a former aide to Holder who remains close to the attorney general. It's not the way his critics have portrayed him, particularly during some of the rocky periods of his tenure. For a time, he was involved in fights with Republicans and White House rivals over a variety of national security issues. And he survived a bruising battle with House Republicans over the ""Fast and Furious"" gun trafficking controversy, including becoming the first sitting Cabinet member to be held in contempt of Congress. ""I've had some days that have been better than others,"" Holder told CNN in a November interview. But added that now, ""There's the ability to focus on issues now that really matter to me."" Among those issues is working to change sentencing guidelines to give prosecutors more flexibility in certain non-violent criminal cases, pushing for rehabilitation instead of warehousing of prisoners, and getting rid of the disparity in the way the justice system deals with defendants charged in cocaine and crack cocaine crimes. Holder also recently made a public push for states to more quickly restore voting rights to felons after they've completed their sentences and probation. He is joined in that effort by Sen. Rand Paul and other conservatives who've similarly view it in line with their views on expanded individual rights. Following Holder's plea, Alabama's Republican governor said he could support such an idea, and a modified proposal in Paul's home state of Kentucky has begun moving through the legislature. But Holder's moves to use administrative memos to make effective changes before Congress passes new laws have also generated criticism. Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey told CNN's Jake Tapper in an August interview that ""I generally agree with the goal of getting rid of mandatory minimums. ... But the way to do that is to pass a law, not to say you're going to disregard the law."" Sen. Charles Grassley similarly has criticized Holder and the Obama administration for taking action without waiting for Congress. Holder's most notable moves have come in recent weeks with an aggressive interpretation of last year's Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage. After much internal debate, Holder decided the department would give full equal treatment to same-sex married couples, going so far as extending the right to refuse to provide incriminating testimony against a spouse, a bedrock right for married couples. Earlier this month, Holder basked in applause in a New York City hotel ballroom where he announced the department's latest decision on same-same marriage legal rights. The Human Rights Campaign, which held the event, praised him, by saying the decision ""cements his place in history alongside Robert F. Kennedy, another attorney general who crusaded for civil rights.""","Attorney general aggressively pushing civil rights and social justice issues .

"(CNN) -- For discerning clubbers around the world the hottest sound in dance music right now is coming not from New York or London, but from the townships of Pretoria, South Africa. DJ Mujava's ""Township Funk"" was the first Township House track to receive international attention. DJ Mujava's ""Township Funk"" became the surprise global club anthem of last year, an instant favorite on dance floors everywhere, with its ear-popping mix of incessant, driving snare drums and retro electronic noises. Its distinctive sound is part of a larger scene known as Township House that comes straight from the townships of Pretoria. But its improbable journey  to glitzy superclubs around the world may never have happened without the help of South Africa's taxi drivers. South Africa has long been a voracious consumer of imported European House music, but over the last few years a small group of producers in Pretoria have begun experimenting with their own sound, more representative of the music of the townships they live in. They came up with a style that mixes the raw beats of the South African hip-hop style called Kwaito with House music's tempos and electronic sounds. But the problem for the Pretorian producers was getting their music heard. Neither the radio stations nor the big record labels in South Africa were interested in their rough-and-ready sound -- so the producers decided to go directly to the public. DJ Qness writes for South African dance music magazine BPM and works for Mujava's record label, Sheer Music. ""In South Africa, the easiest way to the people is through the taxis,"" he told CNN. South African taxis are actually small mini buses and are by far the most popular mode of public transport in a country where car ownership is limited. A Pretoria University study estimates that between five and 10 million South Africans use taxis every day. The Township House pioneers began to give CDs of their tracks to taxi drivers. The drivers played the CDs to a captive audience of commuters and the response was incredible. Passengers wanted to know where they could buy the tracks they were hearing, and with no record stores stocking the music, taxi drivers began selling CDs directly from taxi ranks and roadside stalls. Do you think Township House is the next big thing in dance music? Sound off below. Qness said that even without radio play the township sound began outselling imported dance music and the record labels began to take notice. ""These people created a demand,"" he said. ""Then Mujava's 'Township Funk' blew up on the streets and everything went crazy."" But the Pretorian producers aren't the only ones to realize the power of taxi drivers when it comes to promoting a cause. Pretoria-based Gospel Taxi Club spreads the word of God by giving taxi drivers CDs that mix music with messages from the Bible. In the run up to the recent general election, South African opposition party the Democratic Alliance (DA) gave taxi drivers CDs featuring specially recorded songs that promoted the party message. The idea was the brainchild of Makashule Gana, of the DA Youth. He told CNN that giving the CDs to taxi drivers to play in their vehicles was a way of reaching as many people as possible, and that while there was no way of quantifying its effectiveness, he believed that the party had received extra votes because of the CD. Once Pretoria's taxi drivers had generated a buzz about ""Township Funk,"" Sheer Music stepped in, signing Mujava. The track got a low-budget video of township dancers demonstrating their best moves while Mujava DJs at the roadside. The video was posted to YouTube, where it was spotted by British labels Warp Records and This is Music. The result was a worldwide release, big-name remixes and a global club sensation. Mujava's success has created an international buzz about the Pretorian sound. Producers like Bojo Mujo are starting to make waves, McLloyd's ""Tembisa Funk"" has just been released by British dance label Positiva and Mujava is currently scheduled for a European tour, but has had to cancel because of illness. Qness told CNN, ""By combining the electronic sound from European House with the hard drum and the raw snare they've created something totally unique. You can't find it anywhere in the world -- only in South Africa."" Only in South Africa -- and thanks to Pretoria's taxi drivers, in clued-up nightclubs around the world.","The hottest sound in dance music is coming from Pretoria, South Africa .

"(CNN) -- The government of Argentina's capital will not appeal a court decision this week that legalizes same-sex marriage, Buenos Aires Mayor Mauricio Macri said Friday. The court ruled that two articles in the city's civil code that say only people of different sexes can get married are illegal. The court decision applies only to Buenos Aires. Same-sex unions in most of the rest of Argentina remain illegal. The legal challenge was initiated by a gay couple, Alejandro Freyre and Jose Maria Di Bello. Judge Gabriela Seijas ordered the city's civil registry department to honor their union. ""The law should treat each person with equal respect in relation to each person's singularities without the need to understand or regulate them,"" the judge said in her ruling. The city code prevents people from ""enjoying the rights that couples who enter into matrimony are entitled to,"" she said. Those rights include inheritances, pensions and the ability to make decisions for the other person when he or she is incapacitated. Macri called the ruling a ""very important step,"" adding that ""we have to live together and accept reality. ... The world is headed in that direction."" His decision was not easy, Macri said. Many people wanted him to appeal. ""I had an important internal debate, weighing my upbringing with my search for the best customs and best liberties for society,"" he said in a videotaped message on his Facebook page. ""What we have to learn is to live in liberty without violating the rights of others,"" he said. Macri likened the current debate over same-sex marriage to a similar discourse years ago. ""It's the same as happened with divorce several decades ago -- a very intense debate. And today it is something very natural,"" the mayor said. Judge Seijas issued the ruling Wednesday but it did not become public knowledge until Thursday, when it was posted on the court's Web site. Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Uruguay are also addressing the issue of same-sex civil unions.","Civil code that says only people of different sexes can get married is illegal, court rules .

"Washington (CNN) -- The president's top counterterrorism adviser says there is indisputable evidence that dozens of terrorist groups have sought weapons of mass destruction. But a U.S. intelligence official who is not authorized to speak for attribution said although al Qaeda clearly wants a nuclear weapons capability, it hasn't gotten very far. ""At this point, they don't appear to have made much progress, but we continue to review every bit of information that comes in to determine whether they've advanced their efforts in any way whatsoever,"" said the official. ""Developing a nuclear device involves a highly sophisticated technical process, and al Qaeda doesn't seem to have mastered it based on what we know now."" The concern that terrorists will get hold of nuclear material and use it in an attack is a far greater threat than the older concern of global nuclear war, according to the president's Nuclear Posture Review. At a briefing kicking off President Obama's nuclear security summit on Monday, presidential adviser John Brennan said al Qaeda in particular has been actively trying to acquire a nuclear weapon for the past 15 years. ""Al Qaeda is especially notable for its longstanding interest in weapons [of] useable nuclear material and the requisite expertise that would allow it to develop a yield-producing improvised nuclear device,"" said Brennan. With a nuclear capability, al Qaeda would be able to achieve what Brennan called its sole objective. ""They would have the ability not only to threaten our security and world order in an unprecedented manner, but also to kill and injure many thousands of innocent men, women and children,"" he said. Officials are concerned not only about the possibility that terrorists could get full-fledged nuclear weapons, but also about the threat that radioactive material could be spread by simpler devices. CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen wrote in 2008 that ""there is plenty of evidence that [al Qaeda] has experimented with crude chemical and biological weapons, and also attempted to acquire radioactive materials suitable for a 'dirty' bomb, a device that marries conventional explosives to radioactive materials."" Organized crime and criminal gangs are well aware of the terrorist group's interest in acquiring bomb-making materials, which has led criminals to pursue getting those items for their own profit, according to Brennan. When pressed by reporters about whether there was specific intelligence indicating an active threat now, Brennan would only say, ""I think you can point to a lot of al Qaeda activities and public statements that underscore their determination to carry out attacks against the U.S. and Western interests."" Nuclear weapons expert David Albright said it is unclear what terrorists are up to and when they might act. ""All the evidence supports that al Qaeda is looking to try to gather the capabilities to make a nuclear weapon. It's not easy to do. But they're learning,"" he told CNN on Tuesday. ""They're doing the things that one would need to do to get nuclear weapons -- get help from those who know, start looking around for loose nukes ... look into black markets, can you buy it? That's why this summit is so important. We do need to secure the nuclear explosive materials much better. And it has to be done internationally."" A new report released on Monday indicates there have been 18 documented cases of theft or loss of the two key ingredients of a nuclear weapon. ""Securing the Bomb 2010,"" a report from the Nuclear Threat Initiative, cites two incidents in particular. In November 2007, a group of armed men attacked a nuclear facility in South Africa that contained hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium. The men were stopped, but they escaped capture. And in February 2006, a Russian man was arrested in the country of Georgia with nearly 80 grams of highly enriched uranium. There was some evidence suggesting the uranium came from a Russian nuclear fuel plant. The author of a book called ""Peddling Peril,"" Albright also worries about whether Pakistan's nuclear stockpile is secure, despite assurances from both the United States and Pakistan that it is. Pakistan ""has had many leaks from its program of classified information and sensitive nuclear equipment, and so you have to worry that it could be acquired in Pakistan,"" Albright said. However the U.S. intelligence official said there is no indication that terrorists have gotten anything from Pakistan, and added there is confidence right now in Pakistan's security apparatus. The Pakistanis store their nuclear stockpile in a way that makes it difficult to put the pieces together; that is, components are located in different places. The official said Pakistan has put the appropriate safeguards in place.","Terrorists getting nuclear material bigger concern than threat of nuclear war .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The condition of a kite-surfer thrown airborne into a Fort Lauderdale building by strong winds this week has improved, a hospital spokeswoman said Thursday. Wind lifted Kevin Kearney over a Fort Lauderdale beach before slamming him into a building Monday. Broward General Medical Center upgraded Kevin Kearney's condition from serious to fair, said Broward General Medical Center spokeswoman Candice Ogden. Monday's incident, which a television crew captured on video as Tropical Storm Fay approached Florida, left the 28-year-old Kearney with spinal fractures, brain swelling, a broken rib and a broken ankle, among other injuries. Kearney was harnessed to a kite, or sail, along a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, beach when strong wind caught the kite, sending him into the air, WFOR-TV reported.  Watch wind lift Kearney into the air » . WFOR video shows Kearney rise into the air before slamming into the beach and being dragged for a brief time along the sand. The kite then lifted into the air again, slamming him into a nearby building, WFOR reported. Kearny's mother Alicia Paradise-Garza said Wednesday that her son is able to walk but has spent a lot of time sedated at the hospital so his injuries could be treated. She said Kearney has no recollection of what happened, and that no one has yet shown him the footage of Monday's incident. In a statement given to the news media the family said Kearney, a Fort Lauderdale resident, is an ""experienced kite-boarder."" Kite-surfers stand on boards while winds catch their kites and move them across water. The video showed no board at Kearney's feet while he was airborne. Kearney's friends said his harness had emergency releases, but that it is possible things happened too fast for him to unhook his clasps, WFOR reported.","Winds carried kite-surfer into the air, slamming him into a beach and a building .

"(CNN) -- While Japan's economy continues to falter, lawmakers are betting big that the casino industry can swoop in and lift it out of the doldrums. Gambling is currently illegal in Japan, though many play pachinko, a quintessentially Japanese game often likened to pinball. While cash prizes are forbidden, many pachinko parlors work on a gray economy where prizes are exchanged -- off-premises -- for hard currency. This week, a major conference focusing on the future of the industry opened in Tokyo. It comes at a time when key legislation is being pushed through Japan's parliament that could pave the way for the development of a large-scale gaming industry in the country. ""There is ample chance that the bill will be debated in parliament (this session) and will be passed by both houses,"" said Toru Mihara, Director of the Institute of Amusement Industry Studies, Osaka University of Commerce and a key speaker at this week's Japan Gaming Congress. Tokyo, along with Japan's second city, Osaka, is being eyed as a key destination for so-called ""Integrated Resorts"" (IR), which would combine casinos with hotel, luxury retail and entertainment complexes. The industry has the potential to generate tens of billions of dollars for Japan, attracting massive investment from overseas -- in particular from Las Vegas-based companies and Asian gaming operators -- and boosting its tourism numbers. The next Singapore? ""The easy comparison to make is with the Singapore market,"" said Michael Paladino, Gaming, Lodging & Leisure Sector Head at Fitch Ratings. ""The success of the Singapore market and its ability to generate non-gaming revenues, much more so than the Macau market. That is a lot easier to sell politically. Tourism creates the meetings, incentives and retail. Everything else that comes with it aside from gambling."" Part of the urgency in getting the legislation ratified in this Diet session comes from the desire to keep the gaming project concurrent with the opening of the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. ""The government is looking at the Olympics and IR as a one- two in terms of elevating Japan's tourism presence and then really going after foreign inbound visitors,"" Grant Govertsen, principal and analyst at Union Gaming Research Macau, told CNN. ""Inbound foreign visitation is fairly anemic on an annual basis for such a developed and interesting country. I think that's the key there. It has nothing to do with economics -- using IRs as a means to help fund Olympics development."" With casinos opening up across Asia, from new developments in Cambodia and the Philippines to Korea, Singapore and China's gambling mecca Macau, eyes are firmly fixed on this side of the world for the industry's expansion. Japan is seen as a huge untapped market and one which, unlike Macau for example, would not be heavily reliant on inbound tourism to fulfill its potential. Homegrown crowd . Much of the investment interest is pegged on Japanese gamblers flocking to their own casinos -- Mihara suggests that upwards of 80% of Japanese casinos visitors could be locals, and this stable, relatively disposable income-rich market is certainly a selling point, as it is likely that the region's biggest gambling market may choose to shun Japanese casinos. Historical and cultural tensions between China and Japan -- Japanese aggression during the Second World War remains a highly political issue across much of Asia -- may dampen Chinese enthusiasm for Japanese travel. ""We will not be too dependent on Chinese, like Macau,"" said Mihara. ""Given the political relationship, there is a potential risk (if Japanese casinos were too dependent on Mainland visitors)."" The strength of the domestic market could have a knock-on effect to other gaming destinations in the region, particularly South Korea, which could see a drop-off in Japanese gamblers traveling overseas. Untapped potential . The interest from casino companies -- Las Vegas-based companies like Sands but also Asian operators -- is palpable. The bidding process, which will begin if and when the law is passed, will lead to potentially the most expensive resorts ever built, with some figures suggesting anything up to a $10 billion investment. The numbers involved in Japan are much higher than they are elsewhere in Asia, largely due to the high price of land. Nonetheless, the opportunity to break into a new market is seemingly too tempting to resist. ""It will be highly sought after from all the major global players, as (potentially) the second-largest market in Asia, from a gaming revenue point,"" said Paladino. Given potentially low returns, thanks to eyewatering capital expenditure including land and construction costs and higher wages, along with a potentially more punitive tax climate than neighboring countries, the risk that gaming operations are taking on appear to be higher. ""You're going to have to spend a lot more money to get the same amount of casino, it is not clear that the return profile will be as good as Macau or Singapore, but it could very well be,"" said Govertsen. Pachinko threatened? Analysts are divided on whether the influx of gaming tables will affect the pachinko industry, which has seen the development of thousands of parlors dotted across the country. Regardless, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party -- along with a handy majority of cross-party support -- sees the arrival of legalized gambling in Japan as a boon for the country's coffers. ""Clearly, there can be a significant economic stimulus associated with the development of IR,"" said Govertsen. ""From a taxing and jobs perspective, it could meaningful for Japan.""","Japan's ruling party hopes to legalize gambling within the month .
Ruling could pave the way for huge integrated resorts in Japan's major cities .
Advocates say the liberalization of the gaming industry will help Japan's ailing economy ."
"(CNN) -- The Windsors, ruling House of the British royal family, have endured world wars, personal tragedies and highly public scandals. In the 20th century, through moments of pain and joy, they provided the British people with a fixture of redoubtable comfort, an unchanging physical constitution in a world fraught with uncertainty. But how will the British royals face their greatest challenge -- maintaining relevance in the 21st century? The new prince born to Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and her husband, Prince William, will be a critical part of the answer. It may be true that the royal family remains ingrained at the heart of the British establishment. The title ER (Elizabeth Regina) adorns the helmets of British police officers, the laws of Parliament still require royal assent and the monarch remains technical head of the UK armed forces. But things change. 'Wicked' author: Royal baby stands for hope . Next February, Queen Elizabeth II will have worn the crown for 62 years. She's 86 and her public appearances are becoming less frequent. Elizabeth's reign will one day end. And without the princess who won hearts in war and then became a queen in peace, the royals will have to re-win the public's affection. And they'll have to do so by navigating a changing British society; one more socially liberal and less predisposed to tradition. Recent history suggests it won't be easy. Consider the queen's experience following Princess Diana's death in 1997. Facing intense pressure to show personal emotion in the face of a loss that was felt widely, the queen hesitated. Public expectations conflicted with her conception of royal purpose, that of a stoic, unmovable figurehead. Her inclination was to mourn in private, allowing the politicians to provide the public face of suffering. Eventually though, realizing that times had changed, the Queen of England bent to the will of her people. She recognized the intrinsic truth of her throne, one that the future king, William, and his son (the future king) will also have to grasp: that their royal adornments of power exist subject to the grant of their British subjects. Opinion: How to raise a royal baby . Ultimately, in an era increasingly defined by vigorous social entrepreneurship, institutional relevance is determined less by history, than by a perception of worth. It's in this sense that change, the ability of the royals to evolve and find sustaining worth, will determine whether they rise or fall. So far, it seems that William gets this. When, on their wedding day, the future king and his wife drove down The Mall in an open-topped Aston Martin, the watching throngs reacted with elation. Why such glee? Because the crowds perceived a royal interpretation of cool Britannia; both seemingly natural and delicately informal. A simple act hinting at the prospect of a modern monarchy. Representatives to be proud of. This success is crucial. Where royals are regarded as living in an overly insulated bubble, major problems arise. Just look at the outrage that has followed the recent outing of Prince Charles' (next in line to the throne) tax planning. For royalists then, it's fortunate that the just-born prince defines royal change. He offers a royal family that is both necessarily distant and semi-relatable, an incarnation of royal tradition gelled to social modernity. In short, a prince for the present and a king for the future. But just as he'll live without worldly want, the prince won't be afforded a normal life. Opinion: Why I wouldn't want to be royal baby . As his parents and uncle have repeatedly found out, the media has little interest in royal privacy, especially for a royal destined to one day become monarch. Just as the spotlights of the world fixed on his birth, so too will they follow him in life. That's the price of modern royalty. And British history has begun its latest chapter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tom Rogan.","Tom Rogan: The British royal family is enduring; can it maintain relevance in 21st century?
He says how new royal parents, son reflect modern world to Brits is key to answer .
When queen's reign ends, Will, Kate will need to show worth, be relatable but distant, he says .

"Warsaw, Poland (CNN) -- At least 11 people were injured in clashes Tuesday in Warsaw between Russian and Polish fans before and after a Euro 2012 soccer match, Polish officials said. Eight of those hurt, one of whom is a policeman, are Poles, two are Russian and one is German, Poland's Interior Ministry said. None of the injuries was life-threatening, medical officials said. In all, 123 people were arrested, both Russian and Polish fans among them, the ministry said. UEFA fights racism in football . More arrests were expected as police check surveillance footage to identify ""hooligans"" taking part in the disorder in the Polish capital, the statement said. Video showed dozens of men running through the streets, some carrying burning flares. Russian state-run broadcaster RT reported that police fired warning shots and used water cannon and tear gas as they sought to break up the clashes. Feelings had been expected to run high ahead of the Russia-Poland game, which ended in a 1-1 draw, because of a long history of bad blood between the countries. Both nations have also struggled to deal with hardcore, violent football fans. Poland is co-hosting the Euro 2012 football tournament with Ukraine. Russian fans had organized a march through Warsaw before the game to mark Russia's June 12 national day. When Poland almost ruled the world . The disorder broke out as about 5,000 Russian fans reached Warsaw's Poniatowski Bridge, on their way to the National Stadium, the Interior Ministry said, with ""hooligans"" from both sides seeking to start a fight. ""As the crowd entered the Poniatowski Bridge, approximately a hundred pseudo football fans of the two opposing teams have attempted to confront each other,"" the statement said. Riot police took ""decisive"" action to stop it from escalating, the ministry said. Some 6,000 police were on duty Tuesday in Warsaw. Russian officials had already called for better behavior from the country's supporters after unrest during Friday's opening 4-1 win against the Czech Republic team. ""We believe that some people who were present at the stadium (behaved) unworthy of the true football fans,"" read a statement on the Russian Football Union's website. ""Those who choose the sports arena for the declaration of their personal political and other positions have no place in the stands. ""The Russian Football Union and the national team of Russia kindly request all the fans of these provocative actions to confront bullies and to cooperate fully with the organizers of the match in matters of security,"" the statement added. ""We appeal to all fans who are in Poland. Remember that you represent your country. Respect yourself, your home and your team.""

"(CNN) -- The Central Americans crossing the U.S. border in massive waves have been described as immigrants or refugees. The distinction is significant and could determine whether the migrants are subject to deportation to their home country or eligible to remain in the United States under asylum. What is an immigrant? An immigrant is someone who chooses to resettle to another country. The United States has a legal process for that immigrant to seek legal residency and eventually citizenship. Many immigrants, however, don't have such legal status and are thus undocumented. As such, they are subject to ""removal"" or deportation from the United States. There are 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States -- a problem that has led Democrats and Republicans alike to declare the U.S. immigration system as ""broken."" Congress has been deadlocked for years on how to reform immigration laws. ""Migrants, especially economic migrants, choose to move in order to improve the future prospects of themselves and their families,"" the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says. ""Refugees have to move if they are to save their lives or preserve their freedom."" What is a refugee? A refugee is someone who has been forced to flee his or her home country. As such, refugees can apply for asylum in the United States, a process that could take years. Getting refugee status isn't easy. The applicants have to prove that if they return to their home country, they'll be injured because of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or their political opinion. ""Refugees are generally people outside of their country who are unable or unwilling to return home because they fear serious harm,"" the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services says. The Central Americans overwhelming the U.S.-Mexican border are Hondurans, Guatemalans and Salvadorans. Many are fleeing drug- and gang-fueled violence back home. Is the violence -- any kind -- grounds for a refugee claim? Not necessarily. The violence has to be targeted to a person specifically, and that's where things get complicated. Every case is different, and because of a law signed by President George W. Bush in 2008, children fall into a special class. The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Action Act, named after a 19th century British abolitionist, is designed to crack down on the global child slave trade. The U.S. law ensured that children who came to the country got a full immigration hearing instead of being turned away or sent back. The hearing would determine whether the children had a valid claim for asylum. The law is now cited as one cause behind a projected 90,000 children from Central America and Mexico who will cross the U.S. border alone or with other children this year, a huge increase over the 39,000 that the Border Patrol detained last year. Asylum is a protection available to people who are already in the United States or are seeking admission at the U.S. border. CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","The distinction can determine deportation from U.S. or the chance to stay under asylum .

"(CNN) -- Following a fall movie season filled with tales of gritty survival and the resilience of the human spirit, now comes family dysfunction and corruption. Between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day, the cineplex will boast a selection that zeroes in on greed (""The Wolf of Wall Street"") and con artists (""American Hustle""), plus families lost (""Out of the Furnace""), found (""Philomena""), comically troubled (""August: Osage County"") and created from operating systems (""Her""). What a merry season, right? Here are the 10 movies that we can't wait to dig in to over the next six weeks -- for a more comprehensive guide to titles to watch for, check out the holiday movie guide above. 1. ""Philomena"" (November 27) What it's about: Judi Dench stars as an older Irish woman who teams up with journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) to find the son she had out of wedlock 50 years earlier. It's based on the true story of Philomena Lee, who, as a pregnant teenager in the '50s, was left at a convent where she was forced to give up her child for adoption. (If you want to catch up on the story behind the film, Martin Sixsmith chronicled the journey in the 2009 book, ""The Lost Child of Philomena Lee."") Who it stars: Directed by Stephen Frears, ""Philomena"" also stars Michelle Fairley, Mare Winningham and Sophie Kennedy Clark, who portrays the younger version of Philomena. The buzz: Critics and audiences fell in love with this movie when it screened at the Venice Film Festival. ""Philomena"" isn't without its flaws -- some have complained that the script can veer toward righteousness -- but they're easy to overlook with Dench and Coogan (who also co-wrote the script) anchoring the touching drama. 2. ""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom"" (November 29, limited) What it's about: Based on the autobiography of Nelson Mandela, this biopic from Justin Chadwick promises to introduce moviegoers to the man who became a legendary leader. Obviously, that's a huge promise that inevitably will go unfulfilled -- after all, this is the long and influential scope of Mandela's life we're talking about. Still, Chadwick, with a screenplay from William Nicholson, retraces Mandela's rise from boyhood to revolutionary leader to international icon. Who it stars: Idris Elba (Mandela), Naomie Harris (Winnie Mandela), Tony Kgoroge and Terry Pheto. The buzz: With such a valuable story at stake, Idris Elba's performance is being closely watched as a potential contender this awards season. And while early reviews have been mixed, everyone's agreed that Elba shines as Mandela. 3. ""Out of the Furnace"" (December 6) What it's about: The story of a desperate man seeking justice for his family has been told with success earlier this year -- see Hugh Jackman's ""Prisoners"" -- but Scott Cooper's ""Out of the Furnace"" is taking a different approach. This crime thriller centers on brothers Russell and Rodney Blaze. The former is a blue-collar steel mill worker who spends his nights caring for their terminally ill father. The other brother, Rodney, is an Iraqi war vet who literally loses himself in an infamous crime ring. When police fail to locate Rodney, Russell takes the search for his missing family into his own hands. Who it stars: Christian Bale (Russell Blaze); Casey Affleck (Rodney Blaze); Zoe Saldana; Woody Harrelson; Sam Shepard and Forest Whitaker. The buzz: ""Out of the Furnace"" has two draws right off the bat. There's the return of Scott Cooper as a writer/director following his massive 2009 success with ""Crazy Heart."" And then there's the crazy strong line-up in the cast that left the Hollywood Reporter calling the drama solidly well-acted. 4. ""The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug"" (December 13) What it's about: If you really need to know what ""Desolation of Smaug"" is about, start with J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Hobbit,"" as that's the basis for Peter Jackson's trilogy. But Jackson has taken some liberties with translating Tolkien's children's classic to the big screen. As hobbit Bilbo Baggins joins 13 dwarves on their mission to reclaim their land from the vile dragon Smaug, the crew encounter mythical obstacles as well as a character of Jackson's own imagination, Evangeline Lilly's elf Tauriel. Who it stars: Martin Freeman (Bilbo Baggins); Ian McKellen; Richard Armitage; Orlando Bloom; and Benedict Cumberbatch as the voice of Smaug. The buzz: The first installment of ""The Hobbit"" franchise, 2012's ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"" was criticized for both its unconventional film speed and its meandering pace. This time around, trailers have emphasized the greater stakes and action at play in ""Desolation of Smaug"" -- and whenever Cumberbatch is the villain, you know you're in for a fun time. 5. ""her"" (December 18, limited) What it's about: A modern but sincere love story, ""her"" follows a lonely, heartbroken writer named Theodore who finds love 2.0 with an operating system. Set in a futuristic Los Angeles, the OS is a female personal assistant named Samantha who can put Siri to shame. Who it stars: Joaquin Phoenix (Theodore); Scarlett Johansson (Samantha); Amy Adams; Chris Pratt; Rooney Mara; Olivia Wilde; and Portia Doubleday. The buzz: With director Spike Jonze at the helm, ""her"" made an ostentatious splash on the film festival circuit this year, setting it up for lots of attention in its limited release. The story raises so many questions about social engagement and matters of the heart in the digital age, and it doesn't hurt that Phoenix, Johansson and Adams turn in strong performances as well. 6. ""American Hustle"" (December 18) What it's about: Pulling inspiration from the FBI's Abscam operation of the late 1970s, ""American Hustle"" is a glorious pairing of criminals and the law in an effort to suss out corrupt politicians. The story centers on con artist Irving Rosenfeld and his partner Sydney Prosser as they're forced to work with FBI agent Richie DiMaso to pull off the sting. Who it stars: A cast doesn't get much better than this: Bradley Cooper (Richie DiMaso); Christian Bale (Irving Rosenfeld); Amy Adams (Sydney Prosser); Jeremy Renner (politician Carmine Polito); and Jennifer Lawrence (Irving's wife Rosalyn) all star. The buzz: With so many marquee names -- some of whom are reteaming with director David O. Russell after winning over audiences with 2012's ""Silver Linings Playbook"" -- ""American Hustle"" looks to be all but a slam-dunk with audiences and critics. 7. ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" (December 20) What it's about: In the folk scene of Greenwich Village in 1961, a musician by the name of Llewyn Davis is struggling to make something of his career. Formerly of a folk music duo, Davis is attempting to craft solo stardom while relying on the kindness of friends to help keep a roof over his head. He's talented, yes, but not at all likeable, as the audience learns while following Davis from one couch to the next. Who it stars: Oscar Issac (Llewyn Davis); John Goodman; Garrett Hedlund; Justin Timberlake; and Carey Mulligan. The buzz: Ethan and Joel Coen wrote and directed this humorous drama, and T-Bone Burnett executive produced the soundtrack. Like ""O Brother Where Art Thou?,"" the music from ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is as integral to the project as the performances. 8. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" (December 20) What it's about: Before 1964's ""Mary Poppins"" became a classic, a battle was waged between the character's creator, P. L. Travers, and the man who promised his daughters he'd turn the mystical nanny into a movie, Walt Disney. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" recounts Disney's persistent wooing of Travers and the behind the scenes give-and-take that led to ""Mary Poppins"" being made. Who it stars: Tom Hanks (Walt Disney); Emma Thompson (P. L. Travers); Colin Farrell; Paul Giamatti and Bradley Whitford. The buzz: Directed by John Lee Hancock, critics have praised Disney for not turning ""Saving Mr. Banks"" into a self-admiring love letter -- a feat owed in great amounts to the performances of Hanks and Thompson. 9. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" (December 25) What it's about: In the 1990s, penny stockbroker Jordan Belfort was living a life of extreme decadence won from his fraudulent scheming -- that is, until his house of cards began to crumble and resulted in his arrest. Belfort's swindling, already captured in his memoir ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" is making the leap to the big screen with Leonardo DiCaprio as the ""wolf"" himself. Who it stars: Directed by Martin Scorsese, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" also stars Jonah Hill; Margot Robbie; P.J. Byrne and Jon Favreau. The buzz: The movie's release recently had a close call when it looked like it was going to drop off the 2013 calendar altogether; thankfully, Paramount is still going to make the cut with the December 25 release date. The combination of Scorsese and DiCaprio isn't always a sure thing -- remember ""Shutter Island""? -- but we're placing our bets with this delicious look at the perils of excess. 10. ""August: Osage County"" (December 25) What it's about: The story here originated with Tracy Letts' award-winning 2007 stage production, which has been transformed for the screen with John Wells at the helm. ""August: Osage County"" reunites the three daughters of the Oklahoma-based Weston family, grounded by cancer-stricken matriarch Violet, after a painful loss. What results is a darkly funny examination of the ties that bind. Who it stars: This cast is virtual awards-season catnip, packed with the likes of Meryl Streep (Violet), Julia Roberts, Margo Martindale, Juliette Lewis, Benedict Cumberbatch, Julianne Nicholson, Ewan McGregor and Sam Shepard, among others. The buzz: Early reviews from film festivals suggest that ""August: Osage County"" hasn't rid an ounce of its theatricality as it moved from stage to screen, and Meryl Streep in particular goes big with her role. Yet subtle and compelling performances from supporting cast, mixed with the story's juicy, humorous drama, should nonetheless make it a draw.","The holiday movie season zeroes in on family, greed and corruption .

"Washington (CNN) -- The White House confirmed Monday that it has received a letter from 12 Nobel Peace Laureates calling on the U.S. to disclose torture methods allegedly used by American forces following the 9/11 terror attacks on the U.S. Bernadette Meehan, National Security Council Spokesperson, told CNN ""The President believes that the former rendition, detention, and interrogation program was inconsistent with our values as a nation and that public scrutiny, debate, and transparency will help to inform the public's understanding of the program to ensure that such a program will never be used again."" The letter, signed by Nobel Laureates including South Africa's Archbishop Bishop Desmond Tutu, and John Hume who helped secure peace in Northern Ireland, calls on the administration to fully disclose, ""the extent and use of torture and rendition by American soldiers, operatives, and contractors, as well as the authorization of torture and rendition by American officials."" The letter also calls for, ""Full verification of the closure and dismantling of 'black sites' abroad."" The group also asks for a clear plan from the administration to close the detention center at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The Laureates are also asking for the administration to push for the release of a Senate Intelligence report ""that will allow the world to see ... the extent to which their government and its representatives authorized, ordered and inflicted torture on their fellow human beings."" The letter notes that the Laureates have reason to feel strongly about torture, saying, ""Many of us among the Nobel Peace Prize laureates have seen firsthand the effects of the use of torture in our own countries. Some are torture survivors ourselves. Many have also been involved in the process of recovery, of helping to walk our countries and our regions out of the shadows of their own periods of conflict and abuse."" ""It is with this experience that we stand firmly with those Americans who are asking the US to bring its use of torture into the light of day, and for the United States to take the necessary steps to emerge from this dark period of its history, never to return."" The letter continues. ""Torture continues to haunt the waking hours of its victims long after the conflict has passed, so it will continue to haunt its perpetrators."" Meehan points out that one of President Barack Obama's first acts in office was to sign an executive order which brought an end to the program, which was started under the Bush administration. ""As directed in that Executive Order, individuals detained in any armed conflict shall in all circumstances and in accordance with our international legal obligations be treated humanely, and shall not be subjected to violence to life and person, nor to outrages upon personal dignity, whenever such individuals are in the custody or effective control of the United States,"" Meehan said. Meehan tells CNN that the administration has made clear that it believes the Senate Intelligence report on the former rendition and interrogation program should be declassified, but with ""appropriate redactions necessary to protect national security.""

"(CNN) -- Ukrainians have voted, and they have overwhelmingly chosen to stay the course on European integration. Late last month, pro-European parties won a sweeping victory in parliamentary elections that saw allies of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk come out on top. But while Europe and the United States are celebrating the outcome as a strategic victory for the West, the election result itself simply builds on the slogans of last winter's Euromaidan Revolution. The trouble is that in Ukraine, such rhetoric has all too often led to disappointment. Of course, the West can hope that this time, Ukraine's political class will fulfill its promises. But as the axiom goes: Hope alone is not a strategy. Indeed, Kiev's hopes have already begun to deflate since Russian-backed rebels held their own elections in the self-proclaimed People's Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, and threatened to seize further territory in Ukraine's southeast. To win a meaningful victory in Ukraine, therefore, the West now needs to clearly define its own interests, develop a strategy that recognizes constraints as well as opportunities to advance those interests, and deploy sufficient financial, political and military resources to put that strategy into action. So, how should the West start? First, it is essential that the West define its interest in Ukraine on its own terms -- it cannot simply be the opposite of what Russia wants. Nor can it be just whatever Ukrainian leaders say they want from one moment to the next. For Europe and North America, Ukraine's future is surely about the welfare of 45 million Ukrainians and the geopolitical orientation of one of Europe's largest countries. Yet even more is at stake. The West's vital interests in Ukraine cut to the very heart of more than half a century of Western security and prosperity: To sustain the credibility of the Western socio-economic and political ""model,"" preserve a privileged, central position in the globalizing economy, and reinforce the critical infrastructure of Euro-Atlantic peace and security, with NATO at its core. To secure these interests in Ukraine demands a strategic approach that has so far been lacking from either European or American policies, despite abundant soaring rhetoric and political theater. The Western socio-economic model is under assault not only in the post-Soviet space, but in Europe itself, where economic uncertainty and social malaise are fertile ground for anti-establishment ideologues, including some overtly or covertly allied with Kremlin propagandists and flush with Russian cash. To restore and rebuild the credibility of this model, Brussels and Washington should start by intervening decisively to stem the crisis at its weakest point, which is now Ukraine. Although they have embraced what they consider to be Western political values, Ukrainians are uncertain that they can achieve prosperity. The country has suffered a currency devaluation of almost 100% with double digit GDP loss, the banking sector is functionally insolvent, and the government is perpetually on the verge of default. The global financial crisis that originated in the West proved that only a swift and overwhelming response can prevent panic from freezing private credit and consumer confidence exactly when they are needed most. Ukraine now needs far more than the roughly $18 billion so far offered by the IMF and Western governments to avert disaster. The real figure may be closer to $50 billion in the next year, money that should be offered on credit to give markets full confidence in Ukraine's future, but with the tightest possible controls so the country's notoriously corrupt officials and oligarchs cannot siphon it to pad their private accounts. Meanwhile, the West's ""targeted"" and ""sectoral"" sanctions against Russia have had so little immediate impact on the Russian economy that they are unlikely to prevent further Russian intervention in Ukraine, which the Kremlin views as a vital to its domestic political survival. At the same time, the West's decision to exploit its privileged position in the global economy to punish Russia may be exactly the push that Chinese, Indians, Brazilians and others need to begin seriously hedging -- limiting dollar and euro transactions, while shifting away from Western service providers, middlemen and lenders. A smart strategy would couple each punitive sanction on the Kremlin elite with positive incentives for closer engagement with ordinary Russians, as well as small and medium sized Russian businesses, such as reduced barriers to travel and favorable financing. It would also entail steps to enhance the appeal of the current global trading and financial system for rising economies in Asia, Africa and Latin America, above all offering them influence commensurate with their growing prosperity. Against such a strategy, an iron-fisted Kremlin response -- closing Russia off to the West and leaning on others to do the same -- would quickly alienate both the Russian people and the wider world. The West's vital interest in secure, stable borders in the Euro-Atlantic region is imperiled not only in Ukraine itself, but among NATO members like Poland and the Baltic states, which fear that hybrid and asymmetric warfare tactics developed by Russian-backed forces in Ukraine may soon be tried out on them. The September NATO summit in Wales and U.S. President Barack Obama's visit to Estonia announced steps to reassure these allies, but the seeds of future conflict persist as long as Russia and its close neighbors face each other with inveterate hostility and suspicion. NATO's commitment to Euro-Atlantic security should entail not only enhancing conventional deterrence, but also conducting a hard-nosed audit of vulnerabilities in NATO members' own security establishments, politics and societies. Russia's western neighbors are now deeply and understandably concerned about potential Russian-backed ""fifth columns"" in their midst, but they cannot turn a blind eye to nationalist strains in their domestic politics that demean or ignore the concerns of Russian-speaking minorities and Russia itself. NATO should therefore couple concrete reassurance with steps to help increase resiliency and inclusiveness in member states' domestic politics, as well as a renewed commitment to the NATO-Russia Council as a platform for direct dialogue. Ukraine's pro-Western political transition is an important and historic development that can deliver far greater freedom, security and prosperity for Ukrainians and the region in the long term. Europe and North America stand to benefit as well -- but only if they recognize that their own vital interests are now at stake in Ukraine, and decide to take them seriously.","Pro-European parties won solid victories in Ukraine's parliamentary polls .

"Tianjin, China (CNN) -- In a gleaming classroom at Chong Hua High School in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin, students peer at onion slices under microscopes. Their biology teacher calls on Abdurrahman Mamat to explain what he sees. ""Plasmolysis,"" he replies in perfect Mandarin. Mamat is Uyghur, a mostly Muslim minority from China's far-west Xinjiang region, and he is thousands of miles from home. How he ended up in this mostly Han Chinese school is the largely untold story of a grand Communist Party experiment. For more than a decade, the Chinese government has selected tens of thousands of top minority students from Xinjiang and placed them in high schools in eastern China -- the heartland of the Han, the country's biggest ethnic group. They call it the ""Xinjiang Class."" ""Eastern China is more developed than Xinjiang and we get to enjoy better educational resources here,"" says Mamat, closely watched by government minders. Mamat's journey to Chong Hua High took a well-traveled route. He was born in the ancient city of Kashgar in southern Xinjiang. Mamat showed academic promise and was shipped to Xinjiang's capital Urumqi for middle school. After passing a strict entrance exam Mamat joined the Xinjiang class. First time away from home . But he had to look up Tianjin on the Internet to find out where he was going. It was his first time out of Xinjiang. ""At first I wasn't used to the weather, the schedule and eating habits, but the teachers helped us adapt,"" he says. Uyghurs' religion, culture and Turkic language separate them from the millions of Han Chinese who have been encouraged by the state to migrate to Xinjiang, helping to exacerbate ethnic tensions in this restive region. In 2009, that tension boiled over with deadly ethnic riots between Han Chinese and Uyghurs that spilled out onto the streets of Urumqi. And in recent months, China has been rocked by a series of attacks that the government in Beijing blames on Uyghur separatists. For a Party touting a ""harmonious society,"" this is deeply embarrassing. The dean of Chong Hua's minority students claims that their program has nothing to do with those ""thugs."" ""We are just building future talent,"" says Li Zhenchong. Political purpose? But from its inception, the Xinjiang class had an overtly political purpose. Education Ministry documents repeatedly call on the program to educate minority students to ""defend the unity of China"" and ""safeguard national security."" ""We are not just educating them, we are cultivating their love for the country,"" Li admits. The same could be said for any classroom in Communist China, but for the Xinjiang class, the political indoctrination appears to take on a special urgency. ""The political goal is to try and create a patriotic ethnic minority cadre pool that will hopefully go back to Xinjiang and serve the Party state,"" says Professor James Leibold, a political scientist at Australia's Latrobe University. He says the Party could be failing. ""On the ideological front it hasn't succeeded. What we've seen is actually students who participate and graduate at these programs tend to feel more Uyghur than they do Chinese when they come out."" Long-term studies, like those conducted by Timothy Grose, a specialist in Uyghur studies at the Indiana-based Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology seem to back that up. Grose followed graduates from the Xinjiang class for years and found that they didn't internalize Communist Party ideals. In particular, they appeared to become more religious, not less, despite or perhaps because of the ban on prayer in the program. At Chong Hua, minority students live together in dorm rooms, they eat in separate Halal cafeterias and often end up forming their own soccer teams. The school insists there is no division amongst the students. For Mamat, the Xinjiang Class is the only opportunity to get a strong education and he says he wants to go to college and then back to his home to develop the region. ""This is a really good policy provided by the Party, I am honored to be a part of it,"" he says. Q&A: Xinjiang and tensions in China's far west . CNN's Serena Dong contributed to this report.","Mamat is Uyghur, just one of many from China's ethnic minorities studying far from home .
Many have been placed by the government in eastern China, the heartland of the majority Han .
At the same time, many Han have been encouraged to moved to Xinjiang, where Uyghurs are from .
This has created tensions that have frequently erupted into violent clashes ."
"(Wired) -- For years, the U.S. Navy has been pursuing a workable ray gun that could provide a leap ahead in ship self-defenses. Now, with a series of tests of a system called the Laser Weapon System, or LaWS), it may be one step closer to that goal. Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), the service's technology development arm, announced today that LaWS had ""successfully tracked, engaged, and destroyed"" a drone in flight, during an over-the-water engagement at San Nicholas Island, California. It's certainly not the first time lasers have shot down an unmanned aerial vehicle -- last year, the Air Force zapped several drones with beam weapons in a series of tests at China Lake, California, -- but this test brings an additional bit of realism -- and an extra technical challenge. Laser beams can lose strength as they move through the moist, salty sea atmosphere above the sea, so the Navy needs directed-energy weapons that can work effectively on ships. The LaWS is essentially a laser upgrade to the MK 15 Close In Weapon System (CIWS), a.k.a. the Phalanx gun, a radar-guided autocannon that is already installed on Navy surface combatants. According to NAVSEA, the system tested (shown here) fired a laser through a beam director installed on a tracking mount, which in turn was controlled by a Mk 15 CIWS. That's the basically same system that controls the Phalanx. It represents a possible next step for the Phalanx system, which is currently limited by the range of its 20mm autocannon (Raytheon, manufacturer of the Phalanx, is also marketing a missile system to replace the gun). The Phalanx is a last line of defense against sea-skimming anti-ship missiles and hostile aircraft, but the laser wouldn't replace the gun completely. Theoretically, directed energy weapons would increase the range of the system, but you would still have the gun as a backup if the laser fails to do the job. LaWS might also have other applications: land-based Phalanx guns have been used to shoot down incoming rockets and mortars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a laser Phalanx could -- theoretically -- avoid the problem of the ""20mm shower"" (unexploded rounds falling back to earth).

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Under almost any circumstance, Louisiana politics are hot and spicy. The race for the Senate seat this year plays to type, and then some: It's an almost guaranteed runoff, to be decided in December. So the answer to the question of who controls the Senate could actually have to wait for Louisiana voters to figure it out. The stakes are high, yet the contest is a combination of Louisiana dynasty (as in incumbent Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu, whose wobble dance this month is a viral hit) vs. three term Republican congressman Bill Cassidy (a physician who has focused his message on President Barack Obama's record) vs. conservative tea party candidate Rob Maness, a retired Air Force colonel (running with the Sarah Palin seal of approval). Republicans are fuming at Maness, calling him a spoiler because they believe their candidate could have gotten half of the vote if he had disappeared from the race. He didn't, and he won't. We asked him about the accuracy of the term ""spoiler"" to describe his bid, and he was having none of it. ""Absolutely not,"" he responded. ""There is no taking votes away from so-and-so...people will go out and vote for who they believe, can best serve us here in Louisiana."" And so he remains very much in the race. A USA Today/Suffolk University Poll this week showed Landrieu and Cassidy almost neck and neck, at 36% - 35%. Maness, meantime, is at 11%. So the top two finishers will face off in a run-off on Dec. 6. ""We call it a jungle primary system because we just let all the candidates get into one room, so to speak, and just go at it and see who makes the runoff,"" said Jeremy Alford, publisher of LaPolitics.com. Democrats and Republicans are already into the runoff mode, with more than $10 million reserved on TV for the next phase. Expect that to grow if, in fact, control of the Senate comes down to Louisiana. But Louisiana might not be the only cliffhanger. In Georgia, a libertarian could force the Senate race there to a run-off in January -- a month later than Louisiana's December date. As for Maness, he's not letting the establishment talk him out of anything. ""The party, it's about power, you know,"" Maness told CNN. ""Well, the back room got together and decided that so and so's gonna be the guy or gal."" He said he's gotten calls urging him not to run -- which he resisted. His campaign got a splash — literally — as he ""wrestled"" an alligator, sort of. He does that in an ad in which he said ""Here in Louisiana you learn to be tough. One moment of weakness, and the alligators can eat you alive... Louisiana needs a senator that will stand up to the career politicians and the alligators."" ""Some said it was a stunt. But it was a very good way to communicate effectively visually with the people of Louisiana,"" Maness told CNN in an interview. It did get him noticed, and Sarah Palin has been to La. several times to campaign for him and help raise money. In Louisiana — which is also hosting the comeback campaign of ex Gov Edwin Edwards, a Democrat, now running for a House seat, and Republican Rep. Vance McAllister, an incumbent running for re-election after being caught on a surveillance camera kissing a married female staffer — the Senate race is par for the course. And maybe even a little bland. At least according to Isaac Toups, owner and chef of the New Orleans restaurant Toups' Meatery whose family has been in Louisiana for five generations. ""You can fly your freak flag here in New Orleans. You can be a lot more liberal...you can have a purple Mohawk and have your teeth painted black and someone next to you is gonna be twice as crazy"" Toups said as he prepared some Cajun fare. ""In north Louisiana, it can be very conservative, and that's the way they roll...our politics are lively and unique.""

"San Diego (CNN) -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry is right to immediately send 1,000 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border in response to the border kids crisis. In fact, ""immediately"" wasn't soon enough. While Perry has been demanding that the Obama administration send in the troops for several weeks now, the governor shouldn't have wasted his time trying to get the folks in Washington to focus on a border that President Obama didn't even bother to visit recently when he was doing a fundraiser in Dallas just 500 miles away. For those Americans in both parties who think the United States is undergoing an invasion from the South, it makes perfect sense to call out the troops. I'm not in the ""invasion"" crowd. After 25 years of writing about immigration, and a half-dozen trips to the U.S.-Mexico border, I know this much: What we see down there isn't comparable to the encroachment of a foreign army. Most of it is more like a jobs fair, where people from poor countries in Latin America -- especially Mexico -- go north to do jobs that Americans aren't doing or won't do for anything less than bankers' wages. In the last few months, due to the humanitarian crisis involving at least 57,000 unaccompanied minors who have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border since October 2013, we've seen the rest of the story -- that some of what goes on down there is tantamount to a fire drill, where the frightened and desperate jump out of a burning building and into what they hope is the warm embrace of a compassionate neighbor. The real reason that Perry is right to send the National Guard to the border is not what you'll hear from conservatives who continue to show through their rhetoric and rants that they don't have the foggiest understanding of that part of the world. Key questions about Rick Perry's border plan . Some folks on the right probably think that, under what Perry has in mind, there will be armed troops standing guard on the line and apprehending unauthorized border crossers, including children. Yeah. That's not going to happen. Can you imagine the horrible optics of that kind of operation, or the international incident that would be created if -- heaven forbid -- a soldier were to hurt a child? As a likely 2016 presidential candidate, Perry would never risk that possibility. Let's remember that, in 2012, during an earlier and unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination, the governor went after members of his own party. Defending his support for a Texas law that let undocumented students pay in-state tuition, Perry said that Republican critics who had a problem with that didn't ""have a heart."" Now, encouraging a confrontation between armed soldiers and a bunch of underage refugees would show that Perry doesn't have a brain. So, we can expect the National Guard to be used much the same way that George W. Bush twice used it during his presidency -- as a support system for the Border Patrol, intended to free up personnel by relieving some of the more mundane duties that occupy the time of those who are supposed to be guarding our borders. Don't be surprised if the troops wind up freeing up border patrol agents to get out and patrol by doing paperwork, transporting those in custody, fixing vehicles and performing other essential tasks that don't force a confrontation between soldiers and children. Perry told reporters this week that the guard would be ""force multipliers"" who help border patrol agents catch those crossing the border who aren't children -- which may be the majority at this point -- and to combat ancillary crime associated with smuggling and drug cartels. My sources on the border tell me that's the real and untold story here. It's not the kids. It's just how much unabated street crime is occurring every day in the border region, now that so much of the Border Patrol is tied up babysitting the lost children of Central America. Most Americans who are unfamiliar with the border don't realize that, under normal circumstances (and we're a long way from there), Border Patrol agents don't just keep away uninvited visitors. They also act as a deterrent to the host of street crimes that bad guys might engage in along the border that has nothing to do with immigrants: drug dealing, shootouts, robbery, sexual assault, cartels raiding stash houses and stealing from one another, etc. That is what is going on at our back door as we speak. It's total mayhem. The Border Patrol can stop some of it, but only if the National Guard frees its hands to do so. All that at a price tag of $12 million a month, with Texas being forced to pick up the tab. Meanwhile, two of Perry's fellow border governors â€” California Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, and New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, a Republican â€” have already said they have no plans to send National Guard troops to the border. Once again, Texas is going its own way. Appearing at the press conference with Perry, Texas Adjutant General John Nichols said the troops could detain people if they were asked to do so, but emphasized that they will primarily play a ""referring and deterring"" role by referring immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally to other agencies and deterring cartel activity by their very presence. That sounds good. Let's hope it's enough. But for now, Americans need to get behind the idea of using National Guard troops on the border -- which, frankly, had to come from the states because it reeks of too much common sense to have ever come from the current occupant of the White House.

"(CNN) -- As attackers target reporters and governments shut down television stations, Latin America ranks among the most dangerous regions for journalists, according to an Amnesty International report released Friday . Nearly 400 journalists were threatened or attacked in the Americas in 2010, and at least 13 were killed by unidentified assailants, the human rights organization said in its annual report. ""In many cases, those killed were believed to have been targeted because of their efforts to uncover corruption or to expose the links between officials and criminal networks,"" Amnesty International's annual report says. Mexico is one of the worst offenders, said Javier Zuniga, a special adviser on human rights at Amnesty International. In that country alone, he said, 11 journalists have been killed since the beginning of 2010. ""It's a sense of impunity that feeds into more killings and more abuses throughout the continent, especially in Mexico, Colombia, Honduras and Brazil,"" he said. Amnesty International's report also cites Venezuela and the Dominican Republic, where the organization said government officials shut down ""a significant number of TV stations."" Over the past week, press freedom advocates have highlighted several incidents in the region. On Wednesday, the Committee to Protect Journalists called on authorities to investigate the killing of a Honduran journalist who was reportedly shot in the back outside his home this week. Cable television host Hector Francisco Medina Polanco had been threatened several times over the past six months as he reported on corruption in the local mayor's office and regional land disputes, the New York-based organization said. ""It is unacceptable that Medina Polanco had reported being threatened and was not given protection,"" CPJ Deputy Director  Robert Mahoney said in a statement. Ecuador's government also drew criticism from the organization last week as voters across the country headed to the polls for a referendum on proposals that included the creation of a council to regulate media content. Another controversial proposal would prevent media owners and their shareholders from owning stock in any company outside of that industry. Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa has said that if approved, the measure would prevent conflicts of interest, but others see it differently. ""We believe the referendum questions are aimed at stifling voices that oppose your administration,"" CPJ Executive Director Joel Simon wrote in a letter to Correa. Correa has said all 10 referendum proposals passed, but authorities were still counting votes Thursday. In a visit to Argentina last week, a delegation from the Inter American Press Association accused the South American country's government of cracking down on press freedom. Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner spearheaded a controversial audio-visual communication policy in 2008 that critics said was aimed at hobbling the holdings of the Clarin media company. Fernandez has accused Clarin of unfairly criticizing her administration. But the implications of Latin America's struggle over press freedom could stretch far beyond the region's borders, Amnesty International's Zuniga said. ""The Americas should be a lesson for what might happen in the future in the Middle East and North Africa,"" he said. Even though military regimes collapsed in many Latin American countries, he said, ""the culture of impunity and repression remained."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Javier Doberti contributed to this report.","The report says nearly 400 journalists were threatened or attacked in 2010 .

"(CNN) -- After staging a ""vomit as art"" performance and facing lackluster sales for her latest album, Lady Gaga is ready to speak her piece. On the ""Today"" show Friday, the 27-year-old singer defended her commitment to the weird and spectacular (and sometimes the spectacularly weird), explaining that she'd be doing the same outlandish things whether she'd found ""The Fame"" or not. ""There's a perception that what I'm doing is all a big show, and I really truly feel that it's really just part of who I am. Every moment of my life is devoted to my music and my fans, and it's really, truly me,"" she said. ""I'd just be doing it on the Lower East Side, it'd be the same show, the same act."" That act has appeared to take a stumble. Her newest album, ""Artpop,"" reached No. 1 with just 258,000 copies sold upon its release in November. Her previous album, ""Born This Way,"" notched the same spot in 2011 with 1.1 million copies snapped up in its first week. Industry observers are quick to note the caveats here: ""Born This Way"" did have an Amazon.com special attached to it, where fans could buy ""Born"" for 99 cents for a limited period of time. And compared with other singers with big releases in the fall of 2013, Gaga is still playing in the same league: Katy Perry's ""Prism"" pushed 286,000 copies in its first week, according to Billboard, while Miley Cyrus' ""Bangerz"" hit 270,000. But album sales have become just a slice of Gaga's dwindling perception among an ambivalent public. Her latest effort is a mash-up of high art and pop music that met with mixed reviews from critics who weren't sure what to make of her more avant-garde direction. (""As pop, the album is a well-executed and entertaining tour of Gaga's tried-and-true tricks,"" Entertainment Weekly said. ""But as art, it falls short when it comes to one basic function: making an impression."") And somewhere along the way, Gaga's usual outrageous behavior -- think meat dresses, arriving at awards shows encased in egg-like structures -- has soured from entertaining to off-putting. At the South By Southwest music festival last week, Gaga invited ""vomit artist"" Millie Brown to join her onstage to do what Brown does best: swill brightly colored goos and then regurgitate them in the name of art. So while Gaga sang the ""Artpop"" track ""Swine,"" Brown participated in the performance by sticking her fingers down her throat and vomiting green and black paint all over the pop star. Both Brown and Gaga have been accused of everything from crossing a line of general decency to glamorizing eating disorders, which both artists have said was not their intent. For her part, Brown explained to Elle magazine that she came up with the idea of ""vomit art"" because she ""wanted to use my body to create a performance that was about the beauty from inside out. I came up with the idea of actually vomiting a rainbow using my body as a tool to create paintings. ... My performance is not a statement about eating disorders in any way. I think the whole bulimia thing -- it's important for people to know that I'm not trying to promote it."" And on ""Today"" on Friday, Gaga stood behind Brown's view of her work. ""(The artist) Millie Brown and I know that not everyone's going to love that performance, but we both really believe in artistic expression and strong identities and I support her and what she does. 'Artpop' is about bringing music and art together in the spirit of creative rebellion, and for us that performance was art in its purest form,"" the singer said. ""(Controversy) doesn't matter. We don't make things for any intention in particular other than in the spirit of entertaining the crowd and really for the moment. It was meant for a club performance in Austin, and it was a great time."" Gaga appeared undaunted by any criticism, explaining that she's charging ahead and at work writing new music. If her appearance at SXSW is any indication, we can expect the singer to continue pointing her arrow more in the same direction. ""I refuse to compromise and allow my talents to be monetized to the point that I don't want to be here anymore,"" Gaga said during a keynote address at the Texas festival. ""I will stop. I will quit. I will retire from the commercial market if I have to do something other than be myself because if I can't be myself in this moment (then) everything I have said to my friends since the beginning will be a total lie. ... No, I'll be myself till they f***ing close the coffin.""","Lady Gaga has appeared to struggle since the release of her album ""Artpop""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Up, up and away. Way away -- to the moon, in fact. China launched an experimental spacecraft early Friday that is scheduled to orbit the moon before returning to Earth, a first for the country's ambitious space program and considered a precursor to a planned mission to the moon. The unmanned spacecraft was launched by a Long March 3C rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan, western China, state media said. It is China's first lunar module capable of returning to Earth and the mission's main technical challenge will be making sure the spacecraft slows down enough to re-enter Earth's atmosphere safely. Too fast and it could overheat or become difficult to track and control, Hu Hao, chief designer of the lunar exploration program, told The China Daily. It is expected to take around a week to fly around the moon. The spacecraft will end its mission by landing on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia. The mission tests technology that will be used in a more ambitious launch, scheduled to take place in 2017, when an unmanned lunar probe will go to the moon, collect soil samples and return home. Chinese astronauts have made five manned space flights on a series of Shenzhou ""Divine Vessel"" modules, with the latest mission in 2013 completing a successful manual docking with the Tiangong-1 space station. Last December, China put a lunar rover -- known as the Jade Rabbit -- on the moon but it has been plagued by mechanical troubles, the China Daily said. On course for the moon? Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor at the U.S. Naval War College, said the lunar orbiter marks a step forward in the capabilities needed for a potential manned lunar program, which while under discussion hasn't been officially approved yet. ""It's significance is not only in demonstration of technical abilities, but in a continued political will to achieve its space goals over long periods of time â€” which is what China has that the U.S. currently lacks."" While the United States has pulled back its space program, other countries are trying to match or surpass China's accomplishments in what some observers have called an Asian space race. In September, India became the first Asian country to send an orbiter around Mars. Political symbolism . China sent its first astronaut into space in 2003 and has made rapid advances in the intervening decade. Despite this, its space program is still yet to achieve capabilities reached by the U.S. and then Soviet Union decades ago, says James A.

"(CNN) -- Guantanamo Bay detainee Omar Khadr pleaded guilty to charges against him Monday, the Pentagon said, in the first military commission trial there since Barack Obama became president. Khadr, 24, was accused of throwing a grenade during a 2002 firefight in Afghanistan that resulted in the death of Army Sgt. 1st Class Christopher Speer, a Special Forces medic. He also admitted that he ""converted landmines to Improvised Explosive Devices and assisted in the planting of 10 IEDs with the intent of killing American forces"" in the months before killing Speer, the Pentagon said. Khadr, the youngest detainee at Guantanamo Bay, was 15 at the time. He faced a maximum sentence of life in prison. He pleaded guilty to murder in violation of the laws of war, attempted murder in violation of the laws of war, conspiracy, two counts of providing material support for terrorism and spying in the United States, a Canadian diplomat said. Canada -- where Khadr was born -- has been closely involved in negotiations with the United States over his plea. A source close to the case told CNN on Monday that the deal includes an eight-year prison sentence -- one year in U.S. custody and seven to be served in Canada. Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan said he expects the sentencing phase of Khadr's trial to start Tuesday, adding that it probably will finish sometime this week. Details of the plea agreement are not made public, Lapan said, because the seven military officers on the jury ""get the case without any knowledge of the pretrial agreement. They will issue a sentence for the record, and after that -- if the judge allows it -- the pretrial agreement can be revealed."" If the jury's sentence is different from the plea agreement, the shorter sentence will be imposed, Lapan said. ""During the next several days, I look forward to proving to the panel and the world that Omar Khadr is a kind, compassionate and decent young man who deserves a first chance at a meaningful life,"" his military defense attorney, Army Lt. Col Jon Jackson, said in an e-mailed statement. The military court in August viewed a 30-minute video that the government said shows Khadr helping to assemble and plant roadside bombs targeting American troops in Afghanistan. The video is undated. The tape was discovered at the compound where Khadr was captured in 2002, a month after the firefight in which Khadr was seriously wounded and Speer was killed, the military said. The video was allowed into evidence only after a flurry of defense objections, and the judge warned that it was difficult to tell who was speaking at different points on the tape. One of Khadr's Canadian attorneys indicated last week that he was open to a plea deal. ""He is anxious to avoid a trial before that kangaroo court,"" Nate Whitling said in reference to the U.S. military commission at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility. Catherine Loubier, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Foreign Ministry, offered no details about Khadr's plea, saying: ""This matter is between Mr. Khadr and the U.S. government, and we will not have further comment on this today."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reached out to Canadian officials last week as part of an effort to resolve the case, according to two sources. CNN's Jeanne Meserve, Chris Lawrence, Carol Cratty, Charley Keyes, Elise Labott and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","NEW: Plea deal includes an eight-year prison sentence, source says .

"Pretoria (CNN) -- Reeva Steenkamp's parents said Tuesday they are ""satisfied"" with the sentence handed down to their daughter's killer, as Oscar Pistorius started his first full day in a South African prison. June and Barry Steenkamp told broadcaster ITV's ""Good Morning Britain"" show that they accepted the five-year prison term Pistorius was given Tuesday -- although they feel there's still a ""big missing piece of the puzzle"" concerning their daughter's final moments. ""He's got to pay for what he's done,"" said June Steenkamp. ""It's not that we want vengeance or anything or him to suffer with his disabilities, but at the same time we feel satisfied that he will realize now that you can't go around doing things like that."" ""We have gone along with the judge and her decision,"" her husband said. ""Only Oscar knows whether that sentence is acceptable to him; I've got my feelings to the whole thing but we do accept what the judge handed down."" Pistorius, who won global renown as a medal-winning double amputee track star before his dramatic fall from grace, woke up Wednesday morning in Kgosi Mampuru II prison, formerly known as Pretoria Central. He was convicted of culpable homicide, or negligent killing, but cleared of murder. His uncle, Arnold Pistorius, said the family accepted the sentence and that his nephew would ""embrace this opportunity to pay back to society."" 'More to the story' Asked if she believed the athlete's account that he shot Steenkamp through a locked toilet door under the mistaken belief that she was an intruder, June Steenkamp expressed skepticism. ""No -- there's more to the whole story than everybody knows, only Oscar knows,"" she said. Her doubts are based in part on the evidence heard in court that Steenkamp was at times scared of Pistorius. ""She described exactly how she felt and that he wasn't treating her properly, he was always irritable with her and snapped quickly, so we know all of that so that's why we feel that it is not actually what happened,"" said June Steenkamp. The couple were disappointed, ""even shocked,"" that Pistorius was cleared of murder, she said, but feel that perhaps insufficient facts were put before the judge. Barry Steenkamp told ""Good Morning Britain"" they had known ""very little"" about their daughter's relationship with Pistorius before she was killed on February 14 last year. If an appeal is lodged over the sentence, they will have to accept it, hard though that may be, his wife said. The key thing, she said, is that he will now realize in prison what he has done. ""I think he has lost everything but now he has to pay for what he has done to our daughter and no words can actually describe what that has done to us -- but we have to live with this now for the rest of our lives without her and it's so difficult to go through this and to have that pain in your heart and in your soul for her."" Blankets, place to sleep . Ofentse Morwane, of Gauteng Correctional Services, told CNN that Pistorius was one of nine disabled offenders now held at the prison, notorious during the Apartheid era for its harsh treatment of political prisoners. After leaving the Pretoria courtroom where his seven-month trial played out before the Steenkamp family and world's watching media, Pistorius was driven in an armored police van to the prison. There, he will have undergone a health risk assessment within six hours of arrival, Morwane said. Within 21 days, a comprehensive assessment of his needs will be done. ""He was allocated blankets, a place to sleep,"" Morwane said. ""The second day he will undergo an orientation and induction process which includes explaining to him the services available to him in the correctional center and ensuring he knows the dos and don'ts."" The prison has 7,217 inmates in total, just over 4,700 of whom have been sentenced, with the remainder in custody awaiting trial, Morwane added. The defense argued during the sentencing hearing that Pistorius was too vulnerable to be sent to prison and should be sentenced to house arrest with community service. But Judge Thokozile Masipa ruled that the prison system was equipped to cater for Pistorius' needs. Orange jumpsuit . Prison commissioner Zedilon Monama said Tuesday that Pistorius was placed in a cell for one person in the hospital section of the prison. The cell has has a bed, toilet, blanket, sheets, prison-issued toothpaste and toilet paper, she said. Pistorius was dressed in the standard-issue orange jumpsuit. As is routine for all prisoners, he saw a nurse, psychologist and chaplain, Monama explained. Pistorius is a ""B"" group inmate, which means he's only allowed two no-contact visits on weekends, with a limit of 45 visits per year. If he behaves, after six months, he could be allowed to join group ""A"" and get 60 visits a year, Monama said, and enjoy special perks like chocolate and Coca Cola. CNN's Diana Magnay reported from Pretoria and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported from London. CNN's Khushbu Shah contributed to this report.","Reeva Steenkamp's parents tell UK broadcaster they are satisfied with the sentence .

"(CNN) -- Christopher Salmon just wanted to make an animated film from a short story he loved. Searching for funds to make his film a reality, Salmon turned to Kickstarter, an online fundraising site for creative projects. His goal? To raise $150,000 to bankroll a 3-D-style short of author Neil Gaiman's ""The Price,"" one of a growing number of six-figure projects on the 1½-year-old site. ""I was trying to find a way to fund it and wasn't finding success anywhere because it didn't fit the model -- especially here in America where the short film is viewed as a novelty,"" Salmon said Monday. ""[Kickstarter] was perfect, because if the fans want it, they'll say something. And, boy, have they ever."" As of Monday afternoon, the Kickstarter project to fund Salmon's short film had raised about $124,000 -- some of it donated by fans of Gaiman, the internationally celebrated author of ""Coraline"" and other works. Salmon needs another $26,000 by Wednesday, the project's deadline, for it to become a reality. Salmon's is one of two projects active on Kickstarter that are poised to land in the site's all-time Top 5 in terms of funds raised. The other seeks start-up funds for a device that converts an iPod Nano into a wristwatch. It set out to raise $15,000 and now has hit a record $446,000 with more than two weeks to go. Contributions to that project of at least $25 act as pre-orders for the TikTok and LunaTik multi-touch watch kits. Since Kickstarter's launch in April 2009, more than 300,000 people have pledged more than $25 million toward what the site calls ""creative ideas and ambitious endeavors,"" co-founder Yancey Strickler said. During that time, each month's total has been bigger than the one before. Need a sign of the growth? Nine out of the site's 10 largest-grossing projects have closed in the past two months. It's not a charity site or a way for small businesses to sell their wares. The projects that have been bankrolled include films, books, video games and technology start-ups. ""It's really exciting seeing that increasing diversity,"" Strickler said. ""It's something we're really proud of and have always hoped for, but you can hope and you never know how it's going to turn out."" Kickstarter, which uses the Amazon Payments system, makes a profit by taking a small percentage of the funds donated to each project. It uses an all-or-nothing funding system. Donors who pledge don't pay up until the project reaches its funding goal. If it falls short, they aren't charged. Virtually all projects offer rewards to donors. On Salmon's project, a $25 pledge gets a digital download of the film, $50 gets a DVD and, at the top end, a $5,000 pledge [there have been six so far] earns an associate producer credit, VIP seating with Gaiman and Salmon at a screening of the movie and other rewards. Until recently, the most high-profile project on Kickstarter was Diaspora, a social-networking site that creators said would emphasize privacy in ways that Facebook doesn't. Creators set out to raise $10,000 and in June ended up with $200,000, promising donors access to the service's private alpha launch, which went live just more than a week ago. Gaiman, whose honors include the Newbery Medal for children's writing, the Hugo for science-fiction and fantasy and a Carnegie Medal in literature, has written fantasy epics ""Neverwhere"" and ""American Gods"" and the groundbreaking graphic-novel series ""The Sandman,"" among other works. Last year's feature-film adaptation of ""Coraline"" was nominated for an Oscar. He's an active blogger and one of the most popular users of Twitter, with more than 1.5 million followers. He has used both to promote the fund drive. ""I think that the best thing about Kickstarter is it takes the ability to decide what you see, what happens, from the privileged few to the crowd,"" Gaiman said Monday via e-mail. ""I can't wait until the first $50 million movie is funded through Kickstarter. ""For an author, it's fun. Instead of selling the rights to my story, to actually kick in a few hundred dollars -- but I don't think I could do that if I didn't trust Christopher Salmon to make a great little film."" Others agree. ""That project has a lot of people rooting for it,"" Strickler said. ""Neil Gaiman is really incredible in how connected he is to his fans and the rest of the Web community. ""He could get money from anybody to do anything ... but he obviously sees something in engaging the audience in a different way, letting them really feel that ownership."" For Salmon, the next two days will be a pressure cooker, he said, as he sweats out the project's final hours. He said a pitch to get donors to increase their pledges (in exchange for a poster) has gotten more than 100 takers. He's also hoping for a last-minute push from Gaiman and other backers. But he said he's already been deeply affected by the Kickstarter community. Salmon mentions a man -- a complete stranger -- who contacted him to say that he's homeless, but mowed lawns to raise money to give to the project because it means that much to him. ""I can't even explain or put words to it -- the unbelievable good will from all these people,"" he said. ""So many stories you read are so horrible and so depressing you want to crawl under a rock. And then this.""","Kickstarter, the creativity fundraising site, is raising cash for its biggest projects ever .

"(CNN) -- The Germans are coming -- and this time London cannot wait. Germany suddenly finds itself in the unusual position of being uber cool, and that is in no small part thanks to the first all-German European Champions League final on Saturday, when Bayern Munich takes on Borussia Dortmund at Wembley Stadium, the home of English soccer. From triple world champion Sebastian Vettel revving up as the poster boy of Formula One, to Oscar-winning actor Christoph Waltz, -- who is the son of a German father and Austrian mother -- starring on the big screen, Germany has a newfound confidence about itself. And yet, some stereotypes just won't disappear. Within minutes of Dortmund's semifinal victory over Real Madrid, the first ""jokes"" began to emerge with the UK's tabloid papers jesting that ""fans had their towels on the seats already"" -- a reference to German holidaymakers' apparent habit of claiming sun loungers at beach resorts. Traditionally the British have had a particularly testing relationship with Germany, and it has much to do with the two World Wars of the 20th Century. As recently as a decade ago, stereotypical images of Germans decked out in Lederhosen, socks and sandals goosestepping to the beat of the Oompah Band armed with a Bratwurst and quaffing a Weissbier were not uncommon in British red-top tabloids. On the terraces, England fans would taunt their German opponents with songs about World War II and the infamous ""Ten German Bombers song"" where the victory of the Royal Air Force during the Battle of Britain is recounted. Peep Show, one of the most popular British TV sitcoms of recent years, is one of the more contemporary programs to reference the ""Sausage-munching Bosch"" and ""Fritz, the Bratwurst Guzzler."" But former tennis star Boris Becker believes his country's successful hosting of the World Cup in 2006 has helped transformed Germany's image. ""I think we have shown the world how diverse and multicultural Germany has become,"" says the six-time grand slam champion, who has been hugely popular in Britain since winning Wimbledon at the age of 17 in 1985. ""We did a great job with the visiting fans,"" he told CNN. ""And whoever was there seven years ago has seen a different side of Germany and have realized that the new Germans are much 'cooler.' ""I wouldn't say that the English are falling in love with Germany, but I think they have respect for what Germany has achieved in the sporting world. ""There is a new multicultural wave coming from Germany, which is very international and very cosmopolitan."" Swashbuckling style . Britain, too, has come a long way in its perception of Germany since John Cleese famously goosestepped his way around Fawlty Towers as hotel owner Basil Fawlty in one of the country's most beloved TV comedies during the 1970s. It's not just the swashbuckling style personified by Bayern and Dortmund that has helped reinvent attitudes to Germany -- it's also been reinforced by the nation's football team under the guidance of ultra-cool Joachim Low. Comprised of players from the German, Polish, Turkish, Tunisian and African communities, Low's squad produced the kind of exhilarating and vibrant football which helped the team reach the final of the 2008 European Championships, as well as the semifinals of the 2010 World Cup and 2012 Euros. Behind the scenes, the Bundesliga, with its low ticket prices, safe standing areas and stylish infrastructure, has eclipsed the English Premier League and Spain's La Liga as the hipsters' choice. These days fans from all over Europe flock to stand on Dortmund's famous Sudtribune terrace, to catch a glimpse of Bayern or venture further to the likes of St. Pauli in Hamburg, a favorite with many foreign supporters. ""The weather is good and the beer is better,"" quipped the Bundesliga's chief executive Christian Seifert after being asked why German football attracts so many tourists. ""But I think it's more to do with safe standing, the relatively low ticket prices in relation to very attractive games and a good atmosphere at the stadium,"" he told CNN. ""In 2006, more English tourists were in Germany than ever before and in those four weeks we had great marketing and great weather. It was the best summer I can remember. ""After the World Cup, a lot of investment was made in stadium infrastructure, so it was really easy to get there. ""We have a relatively low amount of season tickets, so it's possible to get a ticket in the 'free' sale at a fair price. If then, somebody says they want to see a Bundesliga game, then that's great."" Football fans are also attracted to the Oktoberfest, a 16-day celebration of beer held in Munich each year, with its clubs and bars making it a popular destination for bachelor parties and weekends away. Jingoistic stereotypes . Matthias Krug, an author and journalist, says he heard and witnessed anti-German chants and rhetoric when he lived in England between 2004 and 2007. The nations' footballing rivalry stems back to the 1966 World Cup final, when England controversially beat West Germany in extra time at Wembley as Geoff Hurst scored a goal that is still debated to this day. West Germany got revenge in Mexico four years later, while the English have since suffered heartbreak against ""Die Mannschaft"" in several high-profile tournaments since -- though 2001's 5-1 triumph in a World Cup qualifier in Munich provided some respite. ""I once traveled on a train in northern England which was completely packed and then people suddenly began singing a vivid song about one English victory in football and two in wars,"" says Krug, who lived in Nottingham between 2004 and 2007, but now works in Qatar. ""I think fighter pilots from the RAF were also mentioned. It must have been my looks which sparked them. I don't remember having said a word, either pre- or post-singing,"" he told CNN. ""Obviously stereotypes related to Germany, both positive and negative, that have been very strong as a result of history and also our sporting history. ""They also vary greatly; others in England showed a strong sense of respect for the achievements and consistency of German football."" In 1996, before England hosted a semifinal clash with Germany at the European Championships, the tabloid Daily Mirror published a front page with the words, ""Achtung, surrender, for you Fritz, ze Euro 96 Championship is over."" Ten years later, The Sun newspaper provoked fury from German Chancellor Angela Merkel after publishing an unflattering photo of her from behind while she changed into a swimming costume with a headline of: ""I'm bigger than the Bumdestag."" That incident provoked fury in Germany and no shortage of embarrassment in the UK. But it's not just in Britain, where this deep-rooted hostility towards Germany is alive and kicking. Most recently, Merkel has suffered from having her economic policies compared to those of the Nazis by the Hungarian Prime Minister, while the the German leader has also been lampooned by the Greek press. Media perception . According to the 2011 UK census, there are 274,000 Germans living on British shores. ""At the moment it is really cool to read all the very well-informed and positive articles about German football in the British press,"" says Karl Pfeiffer, the director of educational links at London's Goethe-Institut. ""Since the 2006 World Cup in Germany, the media perception of German football and Germany in general has dramatically changed,"" added Pfeiffer, who has lived in England since 1986. ""Personally I never encountered stereotypical comments or remarks, but parts of the press here before 2006 were a different matter. ""In my job I work on a German football project with Arsenal, which has two great and popular German players, Lukas Podolski and Per Mertesacker. ""The project is for school children and it is great to see how interested they are in in German football, too."" Dortmund's success in reaching the final has particularly struck a chord with neutral fans given the club almost went out of business eight years ago. Under the guidance of charismatic coach Jurgen Klopp, whose popularity has seen a pop song written about him, Dortmund's run to the final has left even the most hard-hearted of seasoned aficionados willing on the men in yellow and black. ""It is really nice to see how well Dortmund and Klopp are liked all over Europe,"" Sandra Goldschmidt, a devoted follower of the club, told CNN. ""Everyone loves a little fairytale story like ours from nearly having to go into administration to being in a Champions League final, and that is really all thanks to Klopp. ""I guess that people in England also really admire it that we have done this without making big-money signings but by finding talents."" So as Bayern and Dortmund fans walk down Wembley Way, originally constructed by German prisoners of war in the 1940s, it will provoke a timely reminder of how the world has moved on. And it is Krug's hope that Saturday's showpiece will galvanize further change in attitudes towards Germans. ""This year's Champions League final may well prove to be a temporary culmination of changing perceptions towards Germany,"" he said. ""Football has the power to change worldwide stereotypes and perceptions. It's done so in the past and it will do so again.""","Bayern Munich plays Borussia Dortmund in all-German European soccer final .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court for now has ordered Texas not to enforce a law that had effectively shut down several clinics that provide abortions. The court's order means those clinics can reopen immediately. The restrictions had gone into effect in recent days, but a number of abortion rights supporters then asked the justices to intervene on an emergency basis. The 6-3 order Tuesday from the high court was a setback for the law's backers. A ruling by a federal appeals court earlier this month gave Texas the green light to move forward on the mandate requiring all abortion clinics in the state be ""ambulatory surgical centers,"" regulated under the same standards as hospitals. Another challenged provision would force doctors performing abortions to first obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. Abortion rights groups said 13 reproductive health clinics were forced to immediately close after the court ruling, leaving all but eight still operating. The high court's action would only have temporary effect, until more appeals can be filed on the larger questions of the Texas law's constitutionality. That process may take several months, at least, to resolve at the appeals court level. The Supreme Court refused to intervene previously when other sections of the Texas law were challenged in court. Lawmakers in the state's Republican-majority legislature have said the regulations would improve patient care and safety. Abortion rights groups counter, saying the law is designed to make it nearly impossible to operate an abortion clinic in Texas. The Center for Reproductive Rights had sued Texas this past spring, on behalf of a coalition of abortion clinics. In August, a federal judge ruled that the ""ambulatory surgical centers"" requirement was unconstitutional and imposed an injunction. Thursday's appeals court ruling lifted that injunction and allowed the measure to go into effect immediately. Abortion rights groups cheered the justices' intervention. ""The U.S. Supreme Court gave Texas women a tremendous victory today,"" said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights. ""This fight against Texas' sham abortion law is not over. HB2 was designed to gut the constitutional protections of Roe v. Wade and half of the state's clinics remain closed. "" There was no immediate reaction from state officials to the Supreme Court's one-page order, which Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito opposed. A spokeswoman for the state attorney general's office, who earlier defended the law, said it was passed after ""careful deliberation by the Texas Legislature to craft a law to protect the health and safety of Texas women."" Abortion rights groups counter the mandate will leave women of reproductive age in the state with minimal health care options, and called the appeals court decision ""demonstrably wrong."" Clinic supporters said before the bill was enacted, there were 41 facilities in Texas providing abortions. The law also bans abortions past 20 weeks of pregnancy and tightens usage guidelines for ""abortion-inducing drugs"" such as RU-486. Critics contend the law, in addition to eliminating abortion across huge swaths of the state, will further deny access to many women in rural communities and will force women to seek dangerous ""back-alley"" abortions. Republican Gov. Rick Perry signed the bill into law last year. The high court case is Whole Woman's Health v. Lakey (14A365).","Strict new law caused some Texas abortion clinics to close .

"(CNN) -- Tens of thousands of people spent part of April 15 at organized ""tea party"" demonstrations across the country, protesting what some view as excessive government spending and bailouts. ""Tea party"" protesters rally on Wednesday in Boston, Massachusetts. Widely promoted by conservatives on videos and blogs, the movement appears, in part, a reflection of a general anger among people who contend the government takes too much from their pocketbooks. Though financial-industry and automotive bailouts were launched at the end of George W. Bush's presidency, many demonstrators aimed their words and signs at the Obama administration, criticizing it in part for the recently passed stimulus package. CNN's Rick Sanchez spoke Wednesday afternoon to one of the organizers of the ""tea party"" protests, Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity. The organization's Web site identifies him as ""a veteran political strategist and one of the nation's premier grassroots organizers with nearly two decades of experience, including presidential, gubernatorial and congressional races, as well as state legislative, local and issue-advocacy campaigns."" He is a former chief of staff to Rep. Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia. Here are excerpts from the interview. SANCHEZ: How do you feel about the turnout? As I looked at it, I saw that there were a couple of places where the group was small. But, still, you have to take into account that the spread is amazing. PHILLIPS: Yes. SANCHEZ: This is all over the country. PHILLIPS: There are literally -- the best estimate is between 800 and 1,000 of these things across the country. And it's a genuine grassroots uprising. Yes, groups like Americans for Prosperity, we're working and helping and organizing. But no one group, Rick, no one organization, no one political party could pull off something like this. It's a genuine grassroots fire out there. SANCHEZ: Why didn't we see these during the Bush administration, who, by the way, has been accused, by the right and the left, of being a bit of a spendthrift himself? PHILLIPS: Well, let me tell you, in 2006, I was in these very studios as part of Americans for Prosperity's Ending Earmark Express. We went to the site of the 50 most outrageous earmarks in the country. We went to more Republican districts than Democrat districts. And it's similar, because it's overspending and wasteful spending. SANCHEZ: But you know what takes -- you know, my old football coach used to call it intestinal fortitude. It's when you do what no one expects you to do. Like [Rep.] Ron Paul [R-Texas], when he stood up in front of a Republican debate and was booed for saying this administration, referring to Bush, has been irresponsible and has spent too much, that's surprising. That's news. Those are the guys you have got to give credence to. Republicans now blaming Obama for spending too much, it almost looks like, gee, there is a surprise. You guys were going to do this no matter what he did. PHILLIPS: I think you're missing an important point. Today is not a Republican thing. The Republican Party frankly is too disorganized and too unsure of itself to pull off stuff like this. This is a grassroots uprising that is telling elected officials in both parties, hey, guys, there is too much debt. We're going to pile up more debt this year [than we did] from 1776 to 1980 in adjusted dollars. That's unsustainable. Today is a movement, a freedom movement, a conservative freedom movement. It's not a party movement. SANCHEZ: And I think that's fair. And I think a lot of people would agree with you, looking at it from a fiscal standpoint. PHILLIPS: Right. SANCHEZ: But then there's also this. We were doing a report earlier today. One of our correspondents was on the air reporting. And I noticed something behind her. And I said, oh my goodness, look at that. And I bet you it's not something Tim's going to be pleased by. Look at that, what it says. Go ahead and turn around. Look at the screen right there. Do we see that guy that says, ""I'm not your ATM""? PHILLIPS: Right. SANCHEZ: It's a white hand giving money to a black hand. You know, what do you make of that? Does that bother you a little bit? PHILLIPS: I think that any time you have literally tens of thousands of people from all walks of life coming out to rallies and events, there's going to be one sign that's objectionable or one statement that you would rather not be said. SANCHEZ: It's not representative? PHILLIPS: Right. [Not] in any way does it discount, you know, the good American protest that's going out there today. Here's what I would challenge every media organization to do: Go to the rally in Atlanta [Georgia] today or any of the rallies that have happened across the country and grab the first 12 people you see. And say, why are you here and tell me what about your background. You're going to find the most broadly represented mainstream Americans who are concerned about the future with all this spending, all this debt, all these new taxes. I would challenge organizations to do that. Whenever you've got tens of thousands, really, over 100,000, coming to somewhere between 800 and 1,000 events across the country.... SANCHEZ: But you're saying it's by far the exception and by no means the norm. PHILLIPS: Right. And the best way, though, to prove that is go to the events and by the way, you've been showing people at the rallies who are normal average folks and I'm not dinging you. But that's the best way to do it. The events I've been to across the country leading up to today and then today, these are the most mainstream, broadly defined Americans who are genuinely concerned.","Tim Phillips: Tea parties are a broad grassroots movement for freedom .

"(CNN) -- Federal troops are on the way to a southern Mexican town where 43 students went missing, and local police have been ordered to lay down their weapons. Mexico's federal Gendarmerie force will take over security in the southern municipality of Iguala along with the Mexican Army, the head of the country's National Security council told reporters Monday. Monte Alejandro Rubido Garcia, head of the commission, said President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto had ordered the takeover, according to Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency. Mexican Army and Federal Police forces are on the way to the municipality, where authorities are investigating the disappearance of 43 students after a night of violence last month. Authorities have accused local police of involvement in shootouts the night of September 26, when gunmen opened fire on buses carrying dozens of students and soccer players. Since then, 43 students from a rural teachers' college have been missing. Investigators found unmarked mass graves near the town over the weekend, and they say the graves could be connected to the case. State prosecutors say the remains of at least 28 people were in the graves, but the bodies were covered with gasoline and burned before they were buried, and it could take months to identify them. On their Twitter account Monday, Mexican Federal Police posted a photograph of vehicles on the way to Iguala, lights flashing. The case has drawn widespread attention and sharp criticism of officials in Iguala and Mexico's Guerrero state. ""Like all of Mexican society, I am outraged and troubled by this situation, and I assure you there will not be impunity,"" PeÃ±a Nieto said in a Twitter post Monday. Mexico's Attorney General's Office also said Monday that it was forming a special team to investigate the students' disappearance.

"(WIRED)  -- The Verizon iPhone and AT&T iPhone have gone head-to-head in thousands of broadband tests, and the numbers tell the story you'd expect: AT&T's network is much faster. Ookla, creators of the Speedtest.net broadband test, compiled data from tests run by iPhone customers using the Speedtest.net app on both AT&T and Verizon. On average, the reported AT&T iPhone transfer rates were roughly two times faster than the Verizon iPhone's. The AT&T iPhone's average download speed was 1,769 Kbps, and the average upload speed was 730 Kbps. By way of comparison, the Verizon iPhone's average download speed was 848 Kbps, and the average upload speed was 506 Kbps. The results come from 43,000 AT&T iPhones and 14,000 Verizon iPhones all over the United States. Most Speedtest.net app users ran the tests multiple times, totaling 106,000 results from AT&T iPhone users and 49,000 results from Verizon iPhone users. The Speedtest.net results did not provide data on coverage reliability or dropped connections. From my benchmarking of the Verizon iPhone versus the AT&T iPhone, I also found that the AT&T iPhone's 3G transfer rates were much faster than Verizon's. However, the AT&T iPhone sometimes could not complete tests because it did not have a connection, whereas the Verizon iPhone successfully completed every test. In short, I found the Verizon iPhone to be slower with network transfers but more reliable with coverage. Reviewers at other publications had the same results. ""I think that's the story I expected to see,"" said Doug Suttles, co-founder of Ookla. ""Verizon has never talked up their speed, but they always talk up coverage and reliability.... I think the story is quality versus throughput: What are you after?"" Speedtest.net's nationwide results back my verdict: You should get a Verizon iPhone if you really care about voice quality and calls, but the AT&T iPhone is better as a media-consumption device (Netflix movies, photo downloads and uploads, etc.) because of its faster speeds.

"(CNN) -- London's 'ghost stations' are a paradise for urban explorers, daredevils who compete for the most spectacular photos of their visits to the abandoned labyrinths that stretch under the capital. But the party may be over, as London seeks to transform its abandoned tube stations into a powerhouse of urban development, and address the problem of expansion in one of the most expensive cities in the world. Ex-banker Ajit Chambers, 41, is leading a campaign to push the ghost stations into service. The founder of the Old London Underground Company has plans to develop 26 sites with an estimated value of £3.6 billion. He envisages leasing and converting them into retail parks, entertainment centers, offices and cultural experiences. ""You can operate 24 hours a day underground,"" says Chambers. ""Workers could come and go at any time without worrying about the noise."" ""Then there is the unique selling point that almost no one has seen these places before, which will guarantee a lot of interest."" Five years after beginning the planning process, the entrepreneur believes his vision is on the verge of reality. A single site -- Down Street station - has undergone extensive assessments for logistics and safety, and Chambers claims that Transport for London (TfL) have assured him it will be converted and opened to the public in 2015. Development would make use of the city's cultural capital. Previously a World War Two bomb shelter, Down Street also accommodated wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill's private apartments, Chambers intends to make the site a tourist attraction based on its history and according to his figures, it would return a profit within three years. The entrepreneur believes this would be a breakthrough to herald mass-scale development. ""The value is the model,"" he says. ""There are billions in these properties that need to go to market. We are launching a new sector."" Chambers has corralled an international team of investors, and construction company Mace -- which built London's Shard -- is ready to convert the space. He claims there is enough interest to launch all 26 sites whenever permission was granted. TfL would not confirm any deal, but said that assessments are ongoing and did not rule out a single site opening commercially next year. A spokesperson stressed that mass development would be limited as many stations are still in ""operational use"" -- including as emergency exits. The network has already made some tentative steps, using part of Clapham Station to host an underground farm. The Ministry of Defence has sold one its underground site - Brompton road - to Ukrainian investors. Mayor of London Boris Johnson has called the development of ghost stations a ""brilliant plan"" and pledged to support it if it does not require the investment of public money. Should the plans go ahead, it would see London take a lead in a global race to develop cities underground. In recent years, Mexico City has sought to address its overcrowding with a 300-meter deep 'Earthscraper' to accommodate retail, housing and cultural attractions. New York's 'Lowline Project' is an audacious attempt to create the world's first underground park, slated for a 2018 opening powered by innovative solar technology that would support the growth of plants deep below the surface. Finnish capital Helsinki has taken the concept furthest, getting around its space limitations with strategic 'Underground City Plan'. Features include leisure centers and shopping malls, along with much of the infrastructure, such as roads and data centers. With over 80% of the world's population projected to live in cities by the end of the century, subterranean development has become a critical facet of efforts to sustain growth. In a 2013 report, the US National Research Council suggested that ""facilities underground may be the most successful way to encourage or support the redirection of urban development into sustainable patterns."" ""It's absolutely a growth area,"" says Mark Hansford, editor of the New Civil Engineer. ""All the businesses we talk to anticipate growth in construction of ever deeper underground spaces. In London a growing number of properties are three or four stories deep. With so little space there has to be new ways to make use of it."" Hanford says that technology has played a role, with the development of self-supporting concrete, and 3D computational modeling that allows architects to plan at ever-greater depths with minimized risk. ""There has been development of skill in underground tunneling that gives confidence to clients now, that projects will be built on time and budget,"" says Hansford. Hansford adds that energy costs could be significantly lowered through the warmer atmosphere underground, another inducement for potential occupants. For the future of business, the only way is down.","Underground sites worth £3.6 billion to be converted in London .

"(CNN) -- Seven former high-ranking Bosnian Serb military and police officials were convicted Thursday for their roles in the notorious 1995 Srebrenica massacre, the war crimes tribunal in The Hague said. The men were found guilty of a range of crimes including genocide, extermination, murder, and persecution, according to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The trial was the largest one to date held at the tribunal, the ICTY said. More than 7,000 Muslim men and boys were killed in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica in 1995 when ethnic Serb troops overran a United Nations safe area. The five-day slaughter was the worst European massacre since World War II and was described by the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal as ""the triumph of evil."" The Serbian Parliament officially condemned the massacre in March. The ICTY found Vujadin Popovic, chief of security of the Drina Corps of the Bosnian Serb Army, and Ljublisa Beara, chief of security in the army's main staff, guilty of genocide, extermination, murder, and persecution over the genocide and sentenced both of them to life in prison. Drago Nikolic, chief of security in the Zvornik Brigade, was found guilty of aiding and abetting genocide, extermination, murder, and persecution and sentenced to 35 years in prison. Ljubomir Borovcanin, deputy commander of the Special Police Brigade of the police forces, was convicted of aiding and abetting extermination, murder, persecution, and forcible transfer. As a superior, he was also convicted of murder as a crime against humanity and as a violation of the laws of customs of war, and sentenced to 17 years in prison. Radivoje Miletic, the chief of administration for operations and training at the main army staff, was found guilty of murder by majority, persecution, and inhumane acts, specifically forcible transfer. He was sentenced to 19 years in prison. Milan Gvero, assistant commander for Moral, Legal and Religious Affairs of the main army staff, was found guilty of persecution and inhumane acts and sentenced to five years in prison. He was acquitted of one count of murder and one of deportation. Vinko Pandurevic, commander of the Zvornik Brigade, was found guilty of aiding and abetting murder, persecution and inhumane acts and sentenced to 13 years in prison. He was acquitted of charges of genocide, extermination and deportation. The trial opened in August 2009 and ended in September last year. The court head from 315 witnesses and examined 5,383 exhibits. The court found the attack began with an order from former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to the army's Drina Corps to create ""an unbearable situation of total insecurity with no hope of further survival or life for the inhabitants of Srebrenica and Zepa,"" the court found. At least 5,336 identified people were killed in the executions following the fall of Srebrenica, the court found, but it said the number could be as high as 7,826 considering the lack of evidence about the killings. ""The scale and nature of the murder operation, with the staggering number of killings, the systematic and organized manner in which it was carried out, the targeting and relentless pursuit of the victims, and the plain intention -- apparent from the evidence -- to eliminate every Bosnian Muslim male who was captured or surrendered proves beyond reasonable doubt that this was genocide,"" the trial chamber found. ""In the context of the war in the former Yugoslavia, and in the context of human history, these events are arrestive in their scale and brutality."" Popovic was found to be one of the major participants in the massacre, the court said. He was present at a number of sites where captured Bosnian Muslims were detained or executed between July 13 and 23, 1995, the court said. ""Popovic knew that the intent was not just to kill those who had fallen into the hands of the Bosnian Serb forces, but to kill as many as possible with the aim of destroying the group,"" the court said. Beara was the ""driving force behind the murder enterprise,"" the court found. He made personal visits to the various detention and execution sites and ""had a very personal view of the staggering number of victims destined for execution."" Borovcanin was not aware of the murder plans in advance, the court found, but he failed to try to stop them once he became aware. Borovcanin was also present at a warehouse where he saw more than 1,000 Bosnian Muslim men detained and a busload of dead bodies out front, the court said. ""After seeing the evidence of executions, Borovcanin removed himself and his men from the ... warehouse as quickly as he could,"" the court said. ""The chamber found that Borovcanin had the means to protect the remaining prisoners and knew that it was probable that the prisoners would be killed. His failure to protect them substantially contributed to the full-scale execution which later took place."" Pandurevic actually opened a corridor on July 16 to allow a column of Bosnian Muslims to move to an area held by Bosnian Muslim forces, contrary to orders he had received, the court said. After the corridor was closed, Pandurevic's men found 10 wounded Bosnian Muslims who were then taken to a hospital, in Pandurevic's custody, the court said. Pandurevic was told that Popovic would come to take the 10 wounded men, and they were later killed. The court found Pandurevic did not possess the intent to murder to the 10 men, but that he knew it was ""probable"" they would be killed once they were transferred into Popovic's custody. ""By failing to intervene, Pandurevic failed to discharge his legal duty to protect the wounded prisoners and therefore substantially contributed to the murder of these 10 men,"" the court found. A total of 21 people have been indicted for crimes committed in Srebrenica, the court said. Karadzic and three others are currently on trial. Ratko Mladic, the wartime leader of the Bosnian Serb Army, has been charged with genocide and remains a fugitive.","Tribunal convicts seven Bosnian Serbs over Srebrenica massacre .

"(EW.com) -- Last year, in the avidly faithful but ultimately rather flat-footed screen version of ""The Hunger Games,"" we saw Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) triumph in a Survivor-meets-gladiator teen war to the death. How did the stoic archeress from District 12 win the ""Hunger Games""? By making herself over into a lethally clever (but never murderous) scamp of the woods. Now it's out of the frying pan and into the even hungrier games. In ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,"" Katniss has become a star, a lightning-rod symbol of the early stirrings of a people's rebellion. But she's still the superwarrior girl next door; she wears her rebel impulses lightly, if not politely. EW: 'Hunger Games' coverage . On a Victory Tour of the 12 districts, she and her fellow champion, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), have to carry on the charade that they're in love, and the first sign of Katniss' insurrectionary fever is that she's not very good at faking it. (Or maybe it's just that Hutcherson, with his captain-of-the-cricket-team geek hunkitude, isn't much of an inspiration.) As the two speak, rebel miscreants are subdued by stormtroopers, and the crowds just get angrier. So the ruling powers, led by the velvet-voiced fascist President Snow (Donald Sutherland), figure it's time to nip Katniss — and the rebellion — in the bud with the Quarter Quell, a special, once-every-25-years edition of the Games in which past winners compete against each other. In other words: It's all badasses. Up on stage with Stanley Tucci's purple-eyebrowed, gleaming-white-smiled Caesar — the Ryan Seacrest of Oz — Katniss shows off her wedding gown, and the outfit burns down to reveal a stunning black Mockingjay dress. It's the revolution as fashion statement — a wink to the masses watching her on TV. But in the presidential lair, Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the sinister Games designer, predicts that the blood sport to come will squelch her popularity. He smirks, ''Let's watch her get her hands dirty!'' EW: Willow Shields talks 'Catching Fire' Yet Katniss Everdeen does not get her hands dirty. She competes in ruthless kill-or-be-killed contests using her speed and wits, but she never has to do anything too ugly or brutal — or, for my money, too surprising. There's a ritualistic quality to these films that's key to their appeal, but it also limits their capacity to truly wow us. ""Catching Fire"" is more energized than the first ""Hunger Games"" movie; it's been directed, by Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend), with a darkly sustained verve. The Quarter Quell is more openly a contest between Katniss and the Capitol powers, and in its gimmicky way it's more gripping — a lethal jungle fun house, with Katniss and her allies facing down a toxic fog, a vicious tribe of baboons, even the arena itself. As newcomer Johanna, Jena Malone delivers her lines with a scene-stealing screw-it-all nastiness, and Sam Claflin nails the role of the wicked-smart former champion Finnick. As for Lawrence, she more than holds her own, turning her face into a dreamy-pale Valkyrie mask. You react to every wave of sadness and fury roiling around inside Katniss, even when Katniss isn't allowed to show it. ""Catching Fire"" is smoothly exciting but a bit of a tease. It gets mileage out of setting up the Quarter Quell as some ultimate Fear Factor version of Deliverance, yet there isn't a moment of real dread in it. The film also sets up Katniss, with her sizzling (in every way) costumes and goth-Cleopatra makeup, as the feral face of revolt, but the cliff-hanger finale reveals that she is, thus far, a passive agent in this revolution. Lawrence plays her as a riveting icon of girl power, but I hope that in the upcoming sequels, Katniss gets to show another dimension or two to go along with her precocious, defiant strength.

"Bel Air, Maryland (CNN) -- A man who jumped the White House fence Wednesday night suffers from mental health problems, and has been arrested in a previous security breach there, according to his father. Dominic Adesanya, 23, of Bel Air, Maryland, barely made it onto the lawn before he was subdued as he fought off two police dogs, the Secret Service said. ""Dog got him,"" a Secret Service spokesman said. Adesanya has been charged with two counts of felony assault on a police officer for attacking the K-9 dogs, four counts of resisting and unlawful entry, and one count of making threats, said Brian Leary, a Secret Service spokesman. Authorities said he was unarmed at the time of his arrest. His father, Victor Adesanya, said his son is paranoid and hears voices. Adesanya was arrested near the White House about two months ago and charged with a misdemeanor, his father told CNN affiliate WMAR. ""He had done it before,"" the father said. ""He didn't cross the fence. He was at the gate, fussing at the people, wanting to talk to the President to tell the President about his situation."" He said his son has been experiencing a downward mental health spiral after he was prohibited from trying out for a college football team at Stevenson University in Westminster, Maryland. He dropped out of school in November. Doctors have diagnosed him with paranoia and schizophrenia, and have prescribed antidepressants and other drugs. He was fighting the dogs because he thinks ""he's got to prove he's this phenomenon athlete,"" his father said. ""He doesn't understand, you know, his problem is not the President, you know, his problem is in his head,"" Adesanya told CNN outside the family home north of Baltimore. "" And he don't want help ... we think he needs to be forced to get the help."" The father said they've asked the government for help, without any success. ""It's hard to be in your house and not know if the person you're living with is trustworthy and to know they're mentally disturbed like he is,"" the father said. Before officers moved in, Adesanya kicked a K-9 unit dog and punched another one. The two dogs -- Hurricane and Jordan -- were treated by a vet for minor injuries and cleared for continued duty by the Secret Service on Thursday morning. Elaborate video shows entire security breach at White House . Wednesday's incident is the second time someone has jumped the fence at the White House in the last month. This time, the President was in the residence when the intruder jumped over the fence. In September, a man -- whom police identified as Omar Gonzalez -- scaled a fence armed with a knife and made it into the White House before he was detained. Gonzalez's indictment has been delayed until he undergoes a full mental competency evaluation. The Secret Service used its Twitter account later Thursday to show pictures of the two dogs involved in the incident ready to return to work. . CNN's Jim Acosta reported from Washington, with Faith Karimi reporting and writing in Atlanta. CNN's Eric Bradner, Paul Courson and Justin Peligri also contributed to this report.","NEW: This is the second time he's been arrested at the White House, father says .

"Seoul (CNN) -- Head butting stacked tiles, smashing a slab of granite on your chest with a mallet, breaking light bulbs with one finger. All vital qualifications if you want a job protecting the elite of North Korea. Propaganda footage from North Korean TV shows a staggering array of physical feats, using taekwondo and other martial arts. Visually impressive -- although it's not certain how the skills would keep an armed assassin at bay. Lee Young-guk was bodyguard to the late Kim Jong Il for 10 years until just before he took control of North Korea. He says he went through very similar training before he was considered fit to protect a leader. ""It's tough training,"" says Lee. ""But why do it? It's to build up loyalty. A handgun won't win a war and taekwondo serves nothing but the spirit, but it creates loyalty."" Bodyguards 'brainwashed' In an interview at CNN's Seoul bureau, Lee says his training also involved more traditional methods. Target practice, physical, tactical and weight training, swimming and using a boat. But that's only part of the preparation. A large part of the training, he claims, is ideological brainwashing. Lee says he was trained to believe Kim Jong Il was a god -- and that the only reason he was born was to serve and protect the ""Dear Leader."" But in the almost eleven years he stood by his side, he says he saw a man surrounded by fear. He recalls ""two faces"" to the man -- describing him as someone who could give out gold when he was happy, and death sentences when he was not. ""When Kim Jong Il would arrive in his vehicle, 60- to 70-year old advisors would run away and throw themselves onto the grass. They had dust on their clothes but they wanted to hide from him,"" says Lee. ""They are scared because even when he was happy he would be rude and could chop off their heads."" He remembers a senior official who once used Kim Jong Il's private elevator and ashtray. When Kim found out, he sent him to a concentration camp -- where the man died. 'Abundant evidence' of crimes against humanity in North Korea, panel says . Kim Jong Un worst of all? Lee knew the North Korean leader was cruel when he was serving him. But, he says, it was only after he escaped to South Korea, his new home, that he realized Kim was a true dictator -- as his father Kim Il Sung had been before him, and his son and current leader Kim Jong Un is now. But he is worried that Kim Jong Un may be the worst of all. ""Kim Jong Un ended up killing his uncle, who even Kim Jong Il could not kill,"" said Lee. ""As power was handed down to the third generation, it became crueler. Kim Jong Un has created loyalty, but it is fake and based on fear."" From experiencing the opulent palaces, food and women he says were in abundance in Kim Jong Il's entourage, Lee then saw the other extreme of life in North Korea. North Korea: 'We were forced to eat grass and soil' After being caught trying to escape in 1994, he was sent to the infamously brutal Yodok political camp. He eventually escaped, becoming one of an estimated 25,000 defectors who now call South Korea home. In his new life, he has worked as a duck farmer, written a book about his life in the North, and developed a career as a media pundit, speaking about his experiences on the other side of the border. It was this desire to escape, and tell the world the story of what he had witnessed, that helped him survive the horrors of the camps, he says. Under pressure, North Korea proposes human rights visit .","Lee Young-guk was bodyguard to the late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il for ten years .

"(CNN) -- Four French hostages held in Niger since 2010 have been released, French President Francois Hollande announced Tuesday. A French Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed the release to CNN, adding that Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian have arrived in Niamey, Niger's capital, to bring the men back to France. The President's announcement came during a visit to Slovakia. The men -- Pierre Legrand, Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol and Marc Feret -- were part of a group of seven people who were abducted by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb on September 16, 2010, in Arlit, a city in central Niger. Three people were released in 2011, including Larribe's wife, Francoise, who was ill, as well as Jean-Claude Rakotorilalao of Madagascar and Alex Awando from Togo. In April 2011, AQIM released a video of the men asking then-President Nicolas Sarkozy to withdraw French troops from Afghanistan.","Seven people were abducted by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in 2010 .

"(CNN) -- Last week, Kaci Hickox, the nurse isolated and tested for Ebola in New Jersey when she returned from working with patients in Sierra Leone, came to a settlement in her legal battle with Maine over a forced quarantine in that state. A District Court judge ordered that she cooperate with ""direct active monitoring,"" coordinate her movements with public health authorities and immediately report any symptoms but didn't otherwise restrict her movement. But was this the correct decision for the time -- based on medicine, scientific knowledge and best public health practices? The panic response in much of the United States, as health workers and others have returned from Ebola-stricken West Africa, has pitted public officials against doctors against whole communities over the issue of quarantine. Who is right? What is best? Medical quarantines are as old as ""the plague."" They were used in the 14th century when ships arriving in Venice from plague-infected ports were forced to lay at anchor for quaranta giorni -- Italian for 40 days -- before landing. Quarantines quickly became the default mechanism for controlling outbreaks of untreatable diseases. But are these measures still needed, effective and appropriate in the 21st century? More to the point, why has the U.S. Defense Department decided it will quarantine military personnel returning from Ebola-stricken areas of West Africa for 21 days, while the federal government has decided not to enforce quarantine, and multiple states have implemented various quarantine procedures? Legally, the federal government has the authority to quarantine. U.S. Code grants the Public Health Service quarantine and inspection authority, and similar laws exist in most state constitutions. However, these powers have rarely been used, in part because advances in medicine have made such measures superfluous. In 2014, we must evaluate laws, treatments and public health measures and adapt them to the times. We must ask if this ancient measure is applicable and reasonable during this Ebola public health emergency. There are multiple considerations; public safety is a big one. But then there are costs: economic costs of instituting quarantine to the individual and his or her family and employer, and to local, state and national government; economic costs of not instituting quarantine -- i.e., the cost of providing health care if additional cases of Ebola arise. There is a price to pay in individual freedom as well as for the social and emotional effects of quarantine to individuals and families, and of course the social and emotional costs of not instituting quarantine. Certainly, there are political costs for instituting or not instituting quarantine, and there is a chilling effect on volunteerism for hazardous duty in the hot zone if volunteers can expect to be quarantined on their return home. In addition, there are practical issues such as the nature of the quarantine (voluntary vs. involuntary), the length of quarantine, the locations of quarantine and alternatives to quarantine. But beyond all of these things, there are science and technology -- and this is critical. At a time when we have 21st-century tools and knowledge to decrease the world's -- and the U.S. -- risk from Ebola, to preserve public freedom as best as possible, and to act to reduce not only the health risk but also the economic and social toll from this outbreak, can't we come up with a better solution than quarantine? Yes, we can. Science, coupled with our on-the-ground experience in West Africa, demonstrates that a person who has the Ebola virus inside his or her body but who has not yet developed any symptoms does not have enough virus to share and is not contagious. In fact, on the day someone develops symptoms, the exceptionally sensitive blood polymerase-chain-reaction test for Ebola is often negative, and the test only becomes reliably positive two or even three days after symptoms start. That means someone without symptoms does not need to be in quarantine. It does mean, however, that someone with high exposure to Ebola virus needs to be monitored. Can we monitor safely without quarantine? Yes, and this is where technology steps in. We have technology to monitor people with devices that can be placed on their wrists and that can send back (in real time) their pulse, temperatures and even their blood oxygen levels. These devices can relay information to a state public health office and send an alert to an assigned public health officer if there is an abnormal parameter. They can also be adapted to alert the person wearing the device to stop and call the public health office. This can allow for free range of movement and for a rapid stop to all movement the instant a person becomes symptomatic (if they ever do). If you think that the use of a wrist-sensing device is an expensive option, it is not (about $100 per person). Compare that with the option of a 21-day quarantine, estimated to cost a minimum of $1,000 a day per person. The Defense Department could use this option, too, but it has so far opted for quarantine. The reasons are simple. The military likely looked at the cost of managing an Ebola patient (which in the United States is about $18,000 to $24,000 a day) and decided that quarantining its personnel (which costs a lot less than the cost for a civilian to be quarantined) is a smaller price to pay than the risk of additional Ebola patients if one of its troops becomes symptomatic. The military must pay for medical care of all its personnel and has to avoid unnecessary risks. The Defense Department does not have to deal with the issues of who pays for quarantine and who pays for decreased work output while someone is in quarantine; military laws apply, and the other issues of social, individual freedom, volunteerism and political costs do not apply.

"(CNN) -- Billy Ray Cyrus may be a country boy at heart, but he is also pretty savvy when it comes to navigating Hollywood. Billy Ray Cyrus has a full plate with acting, touring, composing and being a dad. When others wrote him off as a novelty act after the 1992 hit ""Achy Breaky Heart,"" Cyrus kept making music and eventually turned to acting. It was a decision he said came after some well-timed fatherly advice. ""In the mid-'90s, my dad said to me 'Son, you've got all of your eggs in one basket and you are living and dying by music,' "" Cyrus recalled. ""He said 'I want you to have a career like Kenny Rogers.' "" Cyrus said his dad suggested he branch out into acting. Cyrus eventually auditioned for and won a role in what appeared to be an unlikely vehicle -- David Lynch's 2001 film ""Mulholland Drive."" After Lynch, known for such works as ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Twin Peaks,"" suggested that Cyrus should continue to pursue the craft, he went on to star in the television drama ""Doc,"" which also helped spur the career of Cyrus' greatest production -- ""Hannah Montana"" star, and Cyrus' daughter, Miley Cyrus. Now, with the release of ""Hannah Montana: The Movie"" on Blu-ray and DVD, a music tour and an upcoming role in a film featuring comedian George Lopez and martial arts expert Jackie Chan, Cyrus is staying busy. He recently took some time out of his hectic schedule to talk to CNN about how he keeps it all together, how he manages raising a family full of performers (son Trace is a member of the band Metro Station, daughter Brandi performs with the band Frank and Derol and also acts, as do younger children Braison and Noah) and what makes him a good fit for Hollywood. CNN: What do you like about ""Hannah Montana: The Movie?"" Billy Ray Cyrus: I think it's got a certain amount of realism to it with art imitating life imitating art. It certainly parallels a lot of things in mine and Miley's real world and real lives. I wrote the song ""Back to Tennessee"" and as I read the script for the movie, ""Back to Tennessee"" became a cornerstone of the film and the title track off the album. The realism of the film translates into the music, and I think vice versa. CNN: The film speaks to never losing touch with your roots. How important is that to you? Cyrus: Extremely. My dad told me as a kid to always be aware of where you are, always have a vision for your future, but never forget where you came from. CNN: You've had careers in both music and acting. Do you still feel a bit like a fish out of water dealing with Hollywood? Cyrus: I love Hollywood as far as being an actor. Getting to work with Jackie Chan and George Lopez in this new film we have coming out in January [""The Spy Next Door""], working with Heather Locklear and Patricia Neal in the Lifetime movie ""Flying By"" and Brooke Shields, who has appeared as my deceased wife on ""Hannah Montana."" I look back at it now and think that I may fit in more to the film community than I do Nashville, to tell you the truth. I love what I do. CNN: Do you have a preference, then, for acting over music? Cyrus: My preference is to find projects that can combine the two. I also love to write scores. I wrote a lot of the scores for ""Doc"" and I love to write scores for other projects. CNN: How do you balance being a star with being a dad? Cyrus: The very best I can. I just take it one step at a time and do the best I can. My dad was to me what I try to be to Miley, which is somewhat of a best friend. I try my best to be a good daddy and if she wants to talk about business or music I try my best to be a good manager. I try to be all of those things because that's what my dad was to me. Unfortunately, my dad passed away four years ago from mesothelioma, but I feel like in some ways my dad is looking down on me and smiling. His name was Ronald Ray Cyrus and a lot of people say Miley changed her name to Miley Ray because of Billy Ray, but that's not true. She did that in honor of my dad, because the two of them just loved each other to pieces. CNN: So will Miley ever remake ""Achy Breaky Heart""? Cyrus: I doubt it, but anything is a possibility. In 1991 I recorded ""Achy Breaky Heart"" and we are not too terribly far away from the 20-year anniversary, and there are some major stars who want to re-do that song. I'm flirting with the idea. There's one cat in particular that if I told you who it was, it would blow your mind. But I've got to keep it under my hat right now.","Billy Ray Cyrus has worked steadily since 1992's ""Achy Breaky Heart""

"(CNN) -- The United States should drop charges against an Indian diplomat accused of fraud and making false statements on a visa application for her housekeeper, the country's foreign minister told CNN on Friday. ""I imagine yes, if we think the charges are unwarranted, unjustified, then how would we say, 'But you can carry on,'"" Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid said. ""I mean charges have to be withdrawn."" Devyani Khobragade, India's deputy consul general in New York, was arrested and stripped-searched last week on charges of visa fraud related to her treatment of a woman she brought from India to work as her housekeeper. She's accused of telling the U.S. government she would pay the woman, who has been publicly identified as Sangeeta Richard, $9.75 an hour. Authorities say in reality, the woman received only $3.31 an hour and was told to keep quiet about the arrangement. ""This type of fraud on the United States and exploitation of an individual will not be tolerated,"" the chief federal prosecutor in Manhattan, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, said Thursday. Khurshid, however, said the matter should have been handled by Indian courts. ""It's not a really good idea to have people put question marks on the Indian judicial system,"" he told CNN. ""We may take time to decide cases in this country, but we have one of the finest rule-of-law institutions. ""I mean if you have a problem, you have a problem about compliance with the labor law, just tell us,"" Khurshid said. ""I mean what would we do â€” either withdraw the person, the employee â€” or just negotiate a, negotiate some, some exceptions."" Indian diplomat: Does she have immunity? The incident has outraged Indian politicians, some of whom may be stirring up anti-U.S. sentiment ahead of presidential elections, prompting the removal of barricades from the road leading to the U.S. Embassy. A senior U.S. official expressed concern about removal of the barricades. But Khurshid told CNN's Mallika Kapur that traffic barricades, not security barricades, were removed. Indian politicians have called the diplomat's treatment ""barbaric"" and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called her treatment ""deplorable."" Bharara defended how Khobragade was treated, saying officials took pains to treat her better than many other suspects. ""Khobragade was accorded courtesies well beyond what other defendants, most of whom are American citizens, are accorded,"" he said Wednesday. ""She was not, as has been incorrectly reported, arrested in front of her children. The agents arrested her in the most discreet way possible, and unlike most defendants, she was not then handcuffed or restrained."" In addition, she was allowed to keep her phone and make calls to arrange personal matters, including child care, he said. Khobragade was strip-searched by a female officer, Bharara said, but noted that's standard practice for every suspect taken into custody of the U.S. Marshal's Service. Debate: Arrest, strip-search of Indian diplomat 'barbaric?' In a statement, Secretary of State John Kerry expressed ""regret"" over the situation, without saying the United States had done anything wrong. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said officials are trying to arrange a call between Kerry and Khurshid. She also said the department has not received a request to change the status of the Indian diplomat and that such a change would not wipe out any criminal charges filed before her immunity status changed. Khurshid said Friday he hoped the row would not pose long-term harm to U.S.-Indian relations. ""I think it's important that we, we understand this is a valuable relationship for both sides. There's a huge amount of investment both public and private into this relationship,"" he said, ""and I don't think the world wants a relationship like this to deteriorate at all."" Khobragade is charged with one count of visa fraud and one count of making false statements, which carry a combined maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. According to court documents and statements, prosecutors argue she lied in her visa application to bring the housekeeper to the United States, promising to pay her the minimum wage of $9.75. She was actually paid $3.31 an hour, prosecutors say. Khobragade allegedly instructed the housekeeper to say she would be paid the higher rate and not mention her actual pay. Khobragade allegedly also had the housekeeper sign another employment contract that ""deleted the required language protecting the victim from other forms of exploitation and abuse"" and also deleted language that said Khobragade agreed to abide by U.S. laws, Bharara said Wednesday. That document wasn't provided to U.S. authorities as part of the visa application process, authorities said. Her attorney, Dan Arshack, said Thursday that the allegations have ""nothing to do with what the actual facts are."" Richard requested the second contact, Arshack said. The document shows that a portion of Richard's earnings would be sent to her husband in New Delhi, he said. ""And that's what happened,"" Arshack said. ""And that's what the documents support."" But Dana Sussman, the housekeeper's attorney, said his client was only paid the smaller amount, which was deposited into an Indian bank account. Her client denies being given any money in the United States that could be considered a salary, she said. ""I don't know what he's talking about,"" Sussman said of Arshack's claims. ""This story seems to keep changing."" Opinion: What about the nanny? CNN's Josh Levs, Jethro Mullen, Tom Watkins, Deborah Feyerick, Elise Labott, Harmeet Shah Singh, Ross Levitt and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","U.S. should drop charges, India's foreign minister says .

"(CNN) -- Whether it's through music, dancing or his art, Nigerian Jimi Solanke is a master of telling local folk stories. The 70-year-old, who is fondly referred to as ""Uncle Jimi,"" is one of the West African country's most accomplished performing artists, most famous for his story-telling on children's television shows. ""You put everything in a character and you bundle it as though you become it,"" says award-winning Solanke. ""You don't play it on the thin skin, you play it from your middle."" Armed with an expressive face and a baritone voice, Solanke is renowned for his uncanny ability to tell stories, moving brilliantly and convincingly between characters and settings. ""The character playing is like getting into a spirit and 10-15 minutes after coming off stage ... I will still have that old warrior in me, until it fizzles out little by little,"" he says. ""That is the acting I love -- the acting where your fingers are the fingers of the character, everything you're doing is what the character is doing,"" adds Solanke. Ethiopian 'Sesame Street' teaches life-saving lessons . The prolific artist, poet and singer rose to fame in Nigeria with his two children's television shows, ""Storyland"" and ""African Stories."" The successful TV programs were broadcast across the country, entertaining and educating different generations of Nigerian children. ""I discovered that children are very important people in this whole world,"" he says. ""They know you inside out, if you stand in front of them, that you want to entertain them. If you are not serious about it, they will know and in less than five minutes you will lose their concentration."" Solanke has also released several music albums over the years and collaborated with many great playwrights on stage, including the Nobel Literature laureate Wole Soyinka. He says that performing in front of an audience always makes him feel alive. ""Take me away from performance and in a week I'll be sick -- and I've never been sick because I've been performing all the time,"" says Solanke. ""I feel I am doing what God has asked me in life -- am I doing it well, I want to do it better still, I'm trying. I feel fulfilled when it comes to performing in front of audiences."" Despite his age, the septuagenarian performance artist says he has no plans of slowing down. He lives and works with his wife at Obafemi Awolowo University in the city of Ife in south-west Nigeria and has recently started a new project -- creating 2,000 collages of local deities made out of newspapers. Blind music pioneer fires up Nigeria's modern sound . Solanke has also been taking his acting into the rural villages to train local aspiring artists and to help keep his Yoruba culture alive. He says traditions play a big part in his work. ""If you lose the perspectives of your culture as an artist anywhere in the world and you lose the depths of your cultural perspectives -- you can have nothing to sell,"" says Solanke. ""People like us, we will keep the flag of our ancestors flying, no matter what other spiritual concerns. At least at my age, I've lived it and seen it, I've taught it, I've discussed it, so I believe it can never be totally pushed into extinction,"" he adds.","Jimi Solanke is one of Nigeria's most public and prolific masters of performing arts .

"Washington (CNN) -- Venezuela's consul general in Miami has been declared to be persona non grata and must leave the United States, a State Department spokesman said Sunday. Spokesman William Ostick declined to comment on specific details behind the decision to expel Livia Acosta Noguera, who has headed Venezuela's consulate in Miami since March 2011. The Venezuelan Embassy in Washington was informed of the decision Friday, Ostick said in a written statement, and the State Department said Acosta must depart the United States by Tuesday. It was unclear Sunday whether or not she was still in the United States. There was no immediate response from the Venezuelan government. Last month, a group of American lawmakers said they had ""grave concerns"" about Acosta and called for an investigation after the Spanish-language TV channel Univision aired a documentary alleging that she was among a group of Venezuelan and Iranian diplomats who expressed interest in an offer from a group of Mexican hackers to infiltrate the websites of the White House, the FBI, the Pentagon and U.S. nuclear plants. The evidence that the plot was real, according to Univision, are secret recordings with diplomats who ask questions about what the hackers can do and promise to send information to their governments. Univision interviewed a purported Mexican whistle-blower -- a student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico named Juan Carlos Munoz Ledo. The student told Univision he was recruited by a leftist professor who wanted to wage cyber attacks on the United States and its allies. Munoz told Univision he secretly recorded a meeting in 2008 with Acosta, who was then the cultural attache of the Venezuelan Embassy in Mexico. According to a recording Univision aired as part of its report, Acosta is heard saying that she can send the information gathered by the hackers straight to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Chavez has called the report ""lies."" One of the Iranian diplomats told Univision that although he, indeed, was presented with a hacking plot by the Mexican group, he turned it down, in part because he thought they were CIA agents. In a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last month, Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, David Rivera, Mario Diaz-Balart and Albio Sires asked the State Department to require Acosta's ""immediate departure"" from the United States if the Univision report proved true. Ros-Lehtinen, who is chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, cheered the decision to declare Acosta persona non grata on Sunday, but said the United States must do more to ""counter Iranian plots in the Western Hemisphere."" Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is on a four-nation Latin American tour this week, a visit the Florida Republican said serves ""as a somber reminder that our enemies are welcomed by our undemocratic neighbors."" ""We must strengthen our regional alliances to confront the onslaught of anti-democratic forces in Latin America whose goal is to undermine our nation,"" Ros-Lehtinen said. A State Department spokesman said last month that the United States did not know about the alleged plot, but that it found the Univision allegations ""very disturbing."" However, ""we don't have any information, at this point, to corroborate it,"" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said. CNN's Rafael Fuenmayor, Jill Dougherty, Juan Carlos Lopez and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","NEW: Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen says the U.S. must do more to ""counter Iranian plots""

"Jacksonville, Florida (CNN) -- Florida Gov. Rick Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist face off for the third and final time Tuesday night in a debate hosted by CNN and Jacksonville affiliate WJXT. The showdown comes just two weeks before Election Day and marks a final point in what's become the most expensive 2014 midterm race in the country, more than any House or Senate campaign. Scott, an unpopular Republican governor, is trying to fend off a challenge from his predecessor, a Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat whose likability numbers are also underwater. While Crist entered the race last November with a sizable polling advantage over Scott, the race has tightened up and the two men now find themselves neck-and-neck toward the finish line. A CNN/ORC International poll last week indicated the race was tied at 44%. The contest also takes place in the largest presidential swing state, meaning both parties are paying close attention to who will be in the governor's office come 2016. And last week the race became the setting for perhaps the most unusual moment in recent political debate history, when the candidates spent the first seven minutes in a stand-off over Crist's use of a personal fan on stage, a blow-up that's since become known as ""fangate."" ""It's the perfect storm. You can't script a better race than this,"" said Robert Watson, professor of American Studies at Lynn University in Boca Raton. ""Two unpopular candidates. The most expensive race. The backdrop of the 2016 presidential race — and now fangate."" Despite the political circus, Watson added, the two men have stark differences on policy, and Tuesday night gives them a final opportunity to hash out their disagreements. Here are seven things to watch for in the debate: . 1. Elephant in the room: While Crist appeared to break the rules in last week's debate by having a fan underneath his podium, Scott might have fared worse in the optics of the scuffle. He maintains he didn't know the debate had started, but by not coming out on stage for seven minutes, Democrats quickly seized on the episode to paint Scott as petty and uninterested in debating the issues. Fans of Charlie Crist can now buy their own fan . The moment quickly became fodder for late-night TV, and it sparked renewed interest in a race that had extremely low voter turnout in the primaries. CNN has stated that no fans will be allowed, so it will be interesting to see how Crist handles the lack of circulation Tuesday night and how Scott addresses the mini-drama that put a national spotlight on the race. 2. Will Scott try to add some personality? Florida has a history of popular governors — from Jeb Bush to Lawton Chiles to Bob Graham. But the back-slapping retail politicking of Scott's predecessors hasn't come easy for the current governor, a former health care CEO. ""He comes off as a cold fish; one that doesn't connect well with the average Floridian,"" said Kevin Walsh, political science professor at Broward College in the Miami area. ""Contrast that with a very personable, polished and telegenic Charlie Crist."" Opinion: When the Rick hits the fan . Experts say Scott needs to use the final debate to leave a lasting impression with voters, one that show he has a sense of humor and is capable of exuding warmth. 3. Look for the zinger. One easy way Scott could display some humor would be to go after Crist over fangate. Closing debates offer candidates a chance to deliver a line or zinger that can help solidify the storyline for themselves or their opponent in the final stretch of the campaign. ""It's their last chance to really make that final impression, both of them would love to come away with a zinger that really resonates,"" Walsh said. ""I think they're going to stay pretty close to their talking points, but I think they may want to take a risk at trying to produce a gotcha moment or real memorable moment."" College GOP: 'Say yes' to Scott's dress . 4. Expect Scott to link Crist to Obama. Scott's campaign released a new ad Monday that features Crist praising President Barack Obama. With Obama's approval rating at dismal levels — 39% in Florida -- it's a strategy employed by many Republicans against their Democratic opponents this fall. Unlike a lot of Democrats, however, Crist hasn't entirely sought to distance himself from the President, which gives Scott more room to sharpen his attack. ""The drinking game is going to be how many times Rick Scott mentions Barack Obama,"" Watson said. Scott will also attempt to pin Crist as untrustworthy because of the former governor's party switch. While Crist agrees that same-sex marriage should be legal now, for example, Scott argues it's hard to know how Crist truly feels about the issue, given that he opposed it in 2008 when he helped get the state's same-sex marriage ban on the ballot. Expect Scott to pounce on this flip-flopping angle as much as possible. 5. The three numbers you'll hear (again and again). The candidates are almost sure to use three numbers over and over again. One of Scott's most frequent talking points is an attack against Crist for overseeing the loss of 832,000 jobs while he was governor from 2007 to 2011. Meanwhile, Scott will be sure to highlight the 640,000+ jobs created under his administration since then. By this point, however, Crist is well versed in how to respond to Scott's attack on the economy. ""People in Florida know I didn't cause the global economic meltdown any more than Rick Scott caused the national economic recovery,"" he said last week in the debate. For his part, Crist will focus on the $1.3 billion in education cuts during Scott's first year as governor. While the cuts were caused by the expiration of stimulus funds and while some of them were restored, education is nonetheless a big issue in Florida and Crist will attempt to hammer home the statistic as much as possible. 6. Libertarian appeal. According to CNN's poll last week, Libertarian candidate Adrian Wyllie pulled a significant share of the vote at 9%, enough to make a huge difference in a tied race. Experts say Wyllie could pull votes away from both candidates but perhaps slightly more votes from Scott, given his shared views with libertarians on small government, taxes and stand your ground laws. And an amendment to legalize medical marijuana is on the ballot this fall, which could boost Democratic turnout and swing some of the libertarian vote toward Crist, who fully endorses the measure. Scott opposes the initiative, but he has already signed into law a bill that approves certain strains of marijuana for patients with epilepsy, muscle spasms and cancer. Opinion: The truth about the midterms . Lance deHaven-Smith, a public policy professor at Florida State University, said Scott could try to attract Wyllie supporters by arguing for less government, but he'll ""have to overcome his association with big business."" Crist, meanwhile, might find more favor with libertarians on social issues. ""I will be watching for comments bemoaning big government, big business, and big labor,"" said deHaven-Smith. ""But of course this is not an easy sell for either candidate, because Scott is supported by big business and Crist by big labor."" 7. Blue Dog Democrats. DeHaven-Smith added that neither candidate has done much to reach out to the rural, white Southern voters in the panhandle and central part of the state. While most are registered as Democrats, Scott appears to think they will vote Republican as they tend to do in statewide races, deHaven-Smith said. ""But Blue Dogs might be up for grabs if Crist stressed his Florida roots. He is a native Floridian. Scott had lived in Florida for only four years before running for governor,"" he said. ""Without the Blue Dogs, Crist needs a very large turnout to win."" Surveys say Obama and Democrats hit lowest marks . So how would Crist try to make such an appeal Tuesday night? DeHaven-Smith said to watch for how the Democrat talks about environmental issues. Blue Dogs live in rural areas and like to fish and hunt, so they want to protect the environment for recreation and sporting purposes. ""This means they support public lands acquisition, water quality protection, high water levels in fishes and streams,"" he said. ""Blue Dogs and traditional white Southerners have been ridiculed for being preoccupied by 'guns, gays, and God,' but they are actually more complicated than that. They love Florida's forests, swamps, rivers, and streams.""","Rick Scott and Charlie Crist take part in a debate Tuesday night hosted by CNN and WJXT.
The biggest elephant in the room is Crist's use of a fan last week that led to Scott protesting the debate.
The final debate could come down to whether a candidate makes a zinger that sticks with voters."
"UTTAR PRADESH, India (CNN) -- On World Population Day this year India's new health and welfare minister came out with an idea on how to tackle the population issue: Bring electricity to every Indian village so that people would watch television until late at night and therefore be too tired to make babies. Could the remote control be a birth control method? That statement raised eyebrows across this vast country -- but what are the realities and reactions from families who make up the second largest population in the world? At 80-plus years old Omar Mohammed has never heard of population control. He lives in India's most populous state Uttar Pradesh and has certainly done his part in contributing to India's burgeoning population. ""Now you see I have 24 children, 13 boys and 11 girls,"" Omar says. Omar believes only God can decide how many children you should have. He lifts his hands to the sky and says: ""This is His command. It's not my doing, it's His doing."" On the other hand there's the Arora family in the capital city of Delhi. They have two children. ""You can't even get enough water or electricity now. So its advisable that people have only two children and then they should stop having more kids."" mother Anjana Arora says. The Aroras know a little something about population issues; their daughter was given the official title of India's one billionth citizen when she was born in 2000. With family planning and free contraceptive programs the Indian government has long tried to encourage families to have only two children. Overall government statistics show the birth rate is coming down. The numbers show 14 of India's 35 states have reached the two child per family target. But the push is failing in other states, especially in villages and among the poor and illiterate where the fertility rate is as high as 3.5 children per woman. There are all kinds of reasons -- from the desire to continue having children until a son is born to lack of access to contraceptives. The government's concern is that a booming population will further test already scarce resources, greatly impact the environment, and make life even harder for the poor. According to the United Nations, India is home to 50 percent of the world's poor and on current projections, India will become the most populous country on earth sometime in the next 50 years, overtaking China. Upon hearing about the latest idea to use electricity and television to give people something else to do besides procreate, mom Anjana Arora scoffed. ""That's a stupid thing"" she said in English then switched to Hindi ""The only way to change people's mentality is through education."" But not everyone is writing the idea off. ""It's an idea that can really work."" says A.R. Nanda. Years ago Nanda helped draft some of India's population stabilization policies and he now runs the Population Foundation of India. He says while education and access to health care is paramount, electrifying villages is not a bad idea. ""It gives a message loud and clear that we need to do something for the people which is people-friendly and which in a way will keep their minds from taking irrational decisions about producing more babies,"" Nanda says. He says there are studies that prove it. One such survey done in 2006 by an Italian sexologist reveals couples with televisions in their bedrooms had sex half as much as those without it. That being said Omar Mohammed, the man with 24 children had a different take. ""After watching TV,"" he says, ""when we look at scintillating things we will probably want to make more children.""","An Indian idea to curb its population growth is raising eyebrows .
Health minister suggested late night TV could make people too tired for sex .
Population expert says the idea has some merits .
But parents are not so sure the plan would work ."
"Birmingham, Alabama (CNN) -- The pilot and co-pilot of a UPS cargo plane did not issue a distress call prior to crashing while on approach Wednesday to Birmingham's airport, a National Transportation Safety Board official said. While UPS said the status of its crew remained unconfirmed, Birmingham Airport Authority Chairwoman Gaynell Hendricks and the city's mayor confirmed the pilot and co-pilot died in the crash. ""It's a grim scene,"" Hendricks told CNN affiliate WBRC. The plane, an Airbus A300-600F, broke into pieces, spreading the majority of the debris over an area of about 300 yards, said Robert Sumwalt of the NTSB. A photograph provided by city officials shows the crumpled front portion of the plane resting in a debris-strewn field. The plane, which took off from Louisville, Kentucky, went down around 4:45 a.m. on a street that runs parallel to the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport, Mayor William Bell said. The location is about a half-mile north of the runway, FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen told CNN. NTSB investigators have yet to retrieve the cockpit and voice recorders of the plane because the wreckage is still smoldering, Sumwalt said. Once the fire is out, authorities will retrieve the recorders, he said. Even so, investigators have begun working to piece together what led to the crash. The crew did not issue a distress call, Sumwalt said, confirming what the mayor said earlier. The crew did not report any trouble, Bell said, citing conversations with control tower officials. Light showers and a visibility of 10 miles were reported in the area of the airport at the time of the crash, according to CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. A spokesman for Bell, the mayor, confirmed late Wednesday morning that no buildings were hit and no one on the ground was injured. Five facts to calm plane crash fears . Alabama Power cut electricity to about 140 buildings near the crash site as a precaution, utility spokesman Michael Sznajderman told CNN. Witness Peter Torres, a Civil Air Patrol member who said he is a former airline mechanic, said he thought he heard what sounded like a backfire from the jet's engines as the plane passed overhead. He rushed to his window. ""I saw the flash,"" of an apparent explosion, he said, followed by a ""boom"" that shook his home. Airport neighbor Sharon Wilson told WBRC the plane seemed lower than usual for flights into the airport and sounded like it was sputtering as it flew overhead. ""We heard this loud boom, like, jump up out of your bed,"" she told the station. The plane was one of two flights UPS sends to Birmingham each day, company spokesman Mike Mangeot told CNN affiliate WBRC. ""This incident is very unfortunate, and our thoughts and prayers are with those involved,"" UPS Airlines President Mitch Nichols said in a statement. The plane that crashed Wednesday was built in 2003 and had 11,000 hours in the air spread over 6,800 flights, Airbus said in a news release. Only UPS and FedEx fly the A300 in the United States, according to its manufacturer, Airbus. While it was once used for commercial passenger flights in the United States, the plane is now used only for cargo flights. UPS has 53 of the planes, according to Airbus. Wednesday's crash is the second involving an A300 in the United States. In 2001, an American Airlines A300 crashed in the Belle Harbor neighborhood of Queens, in New York City, shortly after takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport. All 260 people on board the plane, as well as five people on the ground, were killed. The cause was ultimately attributed to pilot error, according to the NTSB, which said the first officer put excessive pressure on the rudder pedal, causing the separation of the vertical stabilizer. The Birmingham crash is the second fatal accident involving a large jet in the United States since early July, when an Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 crashed on landing at San Francisco International Airport. Three people died. Wednesday's crash comes nearly three years after UPS's last major incident, the crash of a Boeing 747 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, that killed two crew members. Investigators traced the crash to a large fire in the cargo hold, which included a number of flammable lithium batteries, according to the country's General Civil Aviation Authority. In 2006, a McDonnell Douglas DC-8 flown by UPS caught fire after landing at Philadelphia International Airport. Three crew members on the plane evacuated with minor injuries, according to NTSB records. Most of the cargo was destroyed. CNN's David Mattingly reported from Birmingham, with Michael Pearson and Chelsea J. Carter writing in Atlanta. CNN's Marlena Baldacci, Aaron Cooper, Mike Ahlers and Stephanie Gallman also contributed to this report.","NEW: There was no distress call from the pilots prior to impact, the NTSB says .

"(CNN) -- In South London, a life-size wax house is melting. In the city's busy Covent Garden shopping piazza, a building floated above the ground. A 20-minute walk away, a townhouse is flipped on its head. No, you're not hallucinating. These are the most recent irreverent installations from Alex Chinneck, the British artist making a name for himself with site-specific works that appeal to the imagination and beg for a photo-op. For the past year, he's been achieving this through architecture. ""Architecture is the fabric and surroundings of our daily and habitual environments,"" says Chinneck, 30. ""It provides a very good canvas for creative exploration and abstraction."" An architectural chapter . When I meet with Chinneck at his psychiatric ward-turned-apartment in Hackney (seriously), Take My Lighting, But Don't Steal my Thunder -- the polystyrene building floating above Covent Garden -- has just been taken down after its three-week run. ""It was on the national news in 24 countries that piece, and footfall was up 18 percent in respect to trade and the piazza. So that's just great,"" he says. The floating building is part of what Chinneck calls the ""architectural chapter"" of his career, which has born four large-scale installations that use the materials, language and shapes associated with the craft. Though he'd previously used construction materials to create small sculptures, he only recently started working on a larger scale, partly inspired by Rachel Whiteread's House (a concrete mold of a Victorian house that won the Turner Prize in 1993) and the installations of Richard Wilson. ""It just made sense to integrate those creative explorations into an architectural context and scale, back to where they belonged."" Making the familiar strange . What makes Chinneck's work distinctive -- other than its obvious mind-bending properties -- is how each one seems both at home and out of place in its surrounding neighborhood. A Pound of Flesh for 50p, built in Southwark as part of Merge Festival, would look like a typical Georgian house were it not made of wax and melting a little more each day. The floating building looks like a part of the 184-year-old market has just been plucked and suspended in mid air. ""I don't like to disrupt a district too much, so the work is contextually sensitive. The material and visual decisions are informed by the district and the area and the architectural language of that region,"" he explains. ""The concepts are extremely considered despite their playfulness and simplicity. They're tailored to their environment and their audience."" His installation in Covent Garden, for example, needed to speak to the piazza's high levels or foot traffic and tourists to please the commissioning landlords. ""The demographic through the piazza is incredibly eclectic, but it's very fast-paced and recreational. People come and go, take a photo and move on, so the artwork had to deliver an impact for the Instagram generation."" This last phrase seems to sum up his installations well. The pieces are difficult to execute, simple to enjoy and, he insists, free of any particular meaning or concept. The priority is public enjoyment. Conceptually light, sculpturally complex . The response to the floating house, as well as his other works, has been overwhelmingly positive. Along with comments on-site, Chinneck says he regularly receives emails, tweets and links to articles from people who have enjoyed his installations. The owner of a vintage shop near From the Knees of My Nose to the Belly of my Toes, his sliding house in the seaside town of Margate, even gifted him a free suit because of the number of shoppers his installation attracted. Though he tries to avoid the usual traps -- internet comment sections, namely -- Chinneck still receives his share of negative criticism too. He's grown immune to accusations that his work is pointless, a waste of taxpayers' money, or, alternately, a waste of private commissioners' money, but he's still occasionally frustrated by the assumption that his work is easy or banal because of its simplicity and lack of intellectual intent. ""I don't understand at what point the experience needed this intellectual justification to be an important and valuable one,"" he says. ""I'm often criticized for this lack of conceptual content. But what we lose in conceptual content we make up for in structural and sculptural complexity."" (To wit: The floating house took eight months to realize, and had over 100 people involved from design to construction, The melting house -- which was commissioned, designed and constructed concurrently -- required about 75 people to take care of wax fabrication, carpentry, steelwork, painting and brick-laying.) ""With art, and I think really a lot of public art, you create it and then you have to abandon it a little bit, distance yourself from it, because it's not really yours anymore,"" he says. ""There's no safe place in the public eye."" Creating a legacy . With the melting house now a pile of hardened goo being scraped off a pebbled lot (the installation finished Sunday), and the floating building broken down and hauled away, Chinneck is focusing on the future. He's currently investigating how to tie the Tate Modern's distinctive chimney into a knot, and developing a windmill that has fallen from its base, causing the building to spin while the sails remain stuck in the ground, efforts he suspects could trump his past projects in size and ambition. ""I'm kind of bored by the last and excited by the next, which is a healthy attitude,"" he says. ""I think it encourages progress.""

"(CNN) -- ""Lose weight"" is one of the top New Year's resolutions every year. You've probably made it once or twice yourself, and we commend you for accomplishing such an ambitious goal. Oh, you didn't? Don't worry, the majority of your fellow resolutioners didn't either. ""Do you know the meaning of 'resolution'?"" asked Dr. Caroline Cederquist, medical director for bistroMD and the Cederquist Medical Wellness Center. ""It's 'solution,' meaning you are solving a problem, with the prefix 're,' which usually means again. ... We strive to solve a problem again and again and again. ""They tend to become empty promises to ourselves."" The good news is that losing weight isn't the only path to well-being in 2014. If there's one thing we've learned at CNN Health, it's that a lot of factors affect your health, from where you live to how much TV you watch. ""Good health happens when the physical, emotional and social or environmental parts of our lives are in balance,"" said Dr. Amy Crawford-Faucher, a family physician at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. ""When people resolve to 'lose weight,' they are actually saying, 'I want to feel and look better.' "" So this year, we challenge you to make a new kind of New Year's resolution. We asked a few of our favorite experts for recommendations, and their answers may surprise you. Pick one, or several, from the list below. Then make a deal with yourself: This year, ""lose weight"" isn't going to be your main goal, just a nice side benefit to being happy and healthy. Get some fresh air . Simply being in nature can have a big effect on an overloaded mind, says Jennifer Beaton, vice president for fitness with the Bay Club Company in San Francisco. When the body's sympathetic nervous system mobilizes our fight-or-flight response, it can't tell the difference between stress caused by a bear attack and stress caused by a meeting with the boss. In other words, it's always on. ""Though we might not feel it directly, our bodies do,"" Beaton said. Find a place in nature that speaks to you, whether it's a spot in your backyard or a bench at a local park. Visit there regularly, even if it's only for a short time. Then make an effort to get some fresh air every day. Park your car a little farther from the door in parking lots, take a quick walk around your office building at lunch, or wake up 15 minutes earlier and jog around your neighborhood, suggests Dr. Rebecca Cipriano, co-founder of Healthy Woman USA. You'll be surprised by how much you missed the great outdoors. Step away from the screen . As shiny as that new device you got for Christmas is, once in a while, you need to put it down. Research shows children who spend too much time in front of screens -- computers, TV, video games -- are at a greater risk for obesity, have a harder time falling and staying asleep, don't focus well and experience more anxiety and depression. Who's to say adults are any different? ""My 9-year-old daughter loves when I paint with her, so I make sure to turn off the cell phone and step away from all things work, and just enjoy the moment,"" Cipriano said. ""Turn the TV off, leave the tablet out of your bedroom, and pick up a good book."" Sleep more . If you want a major life overhaul without much effort, getting more shut-eye is the way to go. Sleeping helps you burn fat, decreases stress, improves your immune system and boosts your mood and mental clarity, says Jae Berman, a registered dietician and personal trainer with the Bay Club Company. ""Slowly change your routine to add 15 minutes a night until you get to eight hours,"" she said. Add something . Instead of subtracting soda, sugar or fat from your diet, make a resolution to add something, suggests Crawford-Faucher. Add a serving of vegetables to every meal. Add protein to your snacks. Add two glasses of water to your daily routine. You'll find over time that these additions will leave no room for unhealthy habits. The same resolution can be used for other areas of your life, too. Add 15 minutes of meditation to your bedtime routine or 15 minutes of classical music to your commute to help you destress. Add some organization time to your daily schedule. Add a book on financial planning to your reading list. Get the point? Good, add this one to your New Year's resolutions. Stop multitasking . If there's one word that sums up health advice in 2013, it's mindfulness: a ""state of active, open attention on the present,"" according to Psychology Today. ""We teach our guests to be mindful around their eating,"" said registered dietician Kimberly Gomer of the Pritikin Longevity Center + Spa. ""What does this mean? It means not eating in front of the TV, while on the computer, checking e-mails on the phone or iPad, eating while driving in the car. ... The list goes on and on."" Research shows that people who practice mindfulness weigh less, stress less and smile more. And those who try to multitask do it badly. So make an effort to be present this year. Take time to breathe . When was the last time you inhaled deeply, feeling your ribcage lift and your chest expand? Most people take only shallow breaths throughout the day. This limits the oxygen circulating throughout the body, leading to increased anxiety and higher blood pressure, according to Harvard's Family Health Guide. ""When a thought comes to your mind, acknowledge it and let it go,"" Berman recommended. ""Count your breaths until you get to 10 breaths and then start back at 1."" Try something new . Try a yoga class or a Spin class. If you don't enjoy that, try Pilates or Zumba. Go ice skating, snow tubing or skiing, says Deborah Levy, a health and nutrition consultant for Carrington Co., LLC. Want to eat better? Take a healthy cooking class. If you enjoy something, you're more likely to do it again. And meeting people who share your passion will help incorporate those healthy habits into your social life. ""The goal is to rediscover yourself,"" Levy said. ""Find those things that bring a smile to your face and good health to your body, and your New Year's resolution will become a way of life."" Be better . No one is perfect. But what if every day, you made a pact with yourself to be a little bit better? Today at lunch, instead of chips, you could buy an apple. Instead of watching TV to relax after work, you could do 15 minutes of yoga. Today, you'll take the kids to the park instead of handing them a video game controller. Not all at once but one thing every day. ""How can you truly treat yourself and your loved ones better? That should be the start of your New Year's resolution,"" said Paula Procida, a personal trainer at CLAY Health Club + Spa. ""The good habits will follow."" Choose a theme . If we were giving prizes for the most innovative New Year's resolution, trainer Shay Kostabi would take home the gold. Every year, Kostabi picks a theme as her New Year's resolution. In 2011, it was ""authenticity."" In 2012, it was ""clarity."" Next year, her theme will be ""Maitri,"" a Sanskrit word that means gentle, loving kindness toward oneself. ""Choosing just one word that describes how you want to feel instead of what you think you should do or accomplish in the New Year is really powerful,"" Kostabi said. ""Once you've chosen your theme or your one word, say it out loud, write it down and make sure you really connect to it on a personal level."" ""Throughout the year, your theme will guide you in aligning actions, behavior, goal-setting and even how to make the best use of your free time.""","Losing weight, although a popular resolution, isn't the only path to well-being in 2014 .
Make a New Year's resolution to go outside daily or try one new thing every week .
Instead of subtracting things from your diet, add healthy options to every meal ."
"LONDON, England (CNN) -- If mention of The Pirate Bay conjures up images of parrots, peg legs and planks, or geeky jargon like BitTorrent and jailbreak leaves you all at sea, this handy A-Z will help you navigate the choppy waters of the online piracy debate. ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" starring Hugh Jackman, was downloaded over a million times after being leaked in early April. The Screening Room's indispensable lexicon of online piracy will teach you cracking from key generators: You'll never again be caught out wondering how ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" fits into warez. A is for anti-piracy  Efforts to prevent the illegal transfer and use of copyrighted material -- often spearheaded by corporate associations like the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) -- using a variety of digital rights management (DRM) tools like encryption, product keys and serial numbers. Technologically often a step or two behind the pirates, the entertainment industry will sue for breach of copyright. B is for Bill Gates As early as 1976, Gates wrote an open letter saying that software piracy could be a problem. Ironically, he has since said that Microsoft actually benefited from piracy in China, where over 90 percent of computers use Windows, most copies of which are pirated. The widespread use of Microsoft's operating system has enabled the software giant to gain pole position in the fast-growing market. C is for cracking  Modifying software to remove copy protection -- one of the technologies companies use to prevent unauthorized reproduction of media -- to enable the illegal duplication and proliferation of pirated material on disks and online. Mostly done by hackers, not usually for money but to gain respect within the hacker community. D is for digital rights management (DRM) Access-control technologies used by manufacturers. Most pirating technology is created to circumvent various types of DRM in order to share copyrighted material online. Apple rid its iTunes library of DRM in early April, but is charging users 30 cents per song to upgrade to DRM-free tracks. E is for encryption Originally used by militaries to protect secret message transmissions, encryption allows a user to transform and ""lock"" information that, upon transfer, can only be opened by a person who has the right ""key."" Encryption software is one of many anti-piracy measures designed to prevent the spread of copying and transferring copyrighted material. F is for Free Culture movement Led by Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig, the movement believes restrictive copyright laws are strangling humanity's creativity. Under Lessig's ""Creative Commons"" organization, the movement is advocating for the free copying and modification of creative works -- and rejecting what they perceive to be the culturally oppressive ""permission culture"" of copyright and intellectual property. G is for Global Software Piracy  This report by the Business Software Alliance suggested that 35 percent of software installed on PCs worldwide in 2006 was pirated. H is for hackers  Hackers ""wiped,"" or erased, all the data from the Recording Industry Association of America's (RIAA) Web site in 2008. The incident, which exposed serious flaws in the RIAA's web security, was an embarrassment for the group, which represents the recording industry of the United States. I is for International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI)  According to the IFPI's 2008 Digital Music Report, up to 80 percent of data traffic via Internet service providers (ISPs) is involved in the illegal transfer of pirated material. J is for jailbreak Mostly commonly associated with the iPhone, it is the practice of downloading illicit software designed to bypass digital rights management, allowing people to upload pirated versions of official iPhone applications for free and use them on their phones. K is for key generators Small programs found on pirate sites that allow users to crack open key-locked software like Microsoft Office or Adobe Photoshop by generating valid serial numbers for pirated copies of software that would otherwise only be included with legitimately purchased copies. L is for Limewire One of the oldest and most popular peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing clients, Limewire is a free program used to search for and download pirated content. The program has been accused of having massive security gaps and an abundance of ""malware"" files, which contain computer viruses that infect users' computers upon completion of a download. M is for Metallica The first major band to sue for online music piracy in 2000, Metallica sued file-sharing service, Napster and three U.S. universities for enabling illegal downloading of copyrighted content. The case, which saw the rock group harshly criticized by many of its fans, was eventually settled out of court when Napster agreed to block illegal downloads of the band's songs. N is for Napster Online music-sharing service created by a college student in Boston in 1999, which spearheaded the widespread illegal copying and transferring of MP3 music files. A judge shut down the service in 2001. Napster has since relaunched as a legitimate monthly subscription music site. O is for organized crime International recording industry organization, IFPI and Interpol say there are links between online piracy and organized crime and terrorism, citing examples from South America to South Africa and Eastern Europe to East Asia. P is for P2P More than 20 times as much music is exchanged on peer-to-peer networks as is legally purchased, the Economist magazine wrote in 2008. BitTorrent is a growing P2P technology that allows the rapid downloading of large, multi-gigabyte files. Q is for quality According to a survey by the auditor Ernst and Young in India, 66 percent of people believe pirated content is of an inferior quality to the original, but 89 percent say they've used pirated music or films anyway. R is for R4 card A $30 Nintendo DS cartridge that can be loaded with hundreds of free, pirated Nintendo games, the R4 card is cheaper than the store price of many single authentic games. S is for Sweden Prosecutors in the country filed suit against The Pirate Bay Web site earlier this year for ""promoting other people's infringement of copyright laws."" Dubbed the ""Internet piracy trial of the decade"" by UK newspaper The Times, the verdict against the site will have massive implications for the future of online file-sharing, but The Pirate Bay's founders plan to appeal and have previously said that the site will stay up and running. T is for The Pirate Bay A very popular file-sharing Web site primarily used as a linking site to find and download pirated movies, music, video games, applications and more. It tracks BitTorrents -- file sharing protocols that enable big, fast file transfers. The Pirate Bay's founders have constantly argued that the Web site does not violate copyright law because the site does not host any copyrighted material, but simply provides a service by indexing the BitTorrents. U is for Usenet.com Regarded as a source of much pirated material, this bulletin board site is being sued by the RIAA. Unlike The Pirate Bay, Usenet allows paying customers to download files in a way that is nearly impossible to track. But, like the Swedish site, Usenet has had to defend itself from charges that it encourages its users to violate copyright law. V is for video games The Entertainment Software Association says the industry loses $3 billion annually to online piracy. W is for ""Warez"" Slang for any movies, music, applications or any other materials being traded in violation of copyright law. X is for ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" A version of the upcoming blockbuster leaked online in March this year, the film has already been downloaded over a million times. The FBI says it is investigating the source of the leak, and the film's star Hugh Jackman has spoken out, calling the leak ""a serious crime,"" and ""heartbreaking."" Y is for YouTube  The ubiquitous video site has been sued by major companies like Viacom for publishing and proliferating unauthorized video content online. YouTube has responded by removing copyrighted content, but popular clips of television programs are often reposted by users as soon as they are taken down. Z is for Zune Microsoft's answer to the iPod plans to make its entire catalogue of music DRM-free, which will make it even easier to copy and share copyrighted music.","A run-down of the biggest online piracy moments since Napster in 1999 .
F is for Free Culture, a group that rejects the idea of modern copyright law .
D is for DRM, technologies companies use to try to restrict online piracy .
S is for Sweden, where the ""Internet trial of the century"" has just concluded ."
"Zlitan, Libya (CNN) -- Firefighters battled a blaze caused by NATO airstrikes at a food-storage complex Monday in Zlitan, increasingly a front-line city in the conflict between Libyan government troops and rebels fighting to oust longtime ruler Moammar Gadhafi. The firefighters doused burning sacks of flour with water after bombs punctured the high roofs of three facilities packed with flour, rice and cooking oil in Zlitan, on the Libyan coast east of Tripoli. An unexploded bomb lay buried in the concrete floor of one of the buildings, beneath a hole in the ceiling where sunlight streamed through. Zlitan is about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of the opposition-held port city of Misrata, and the front line between the rebels and pro-regime forces is somewhere in between the two cities. Smoke rising on the horizon and the rumble of artillery in the east suggested that by Monday, the fighting had moved closer to the city limits. ""It's continuous bombing, morning day and night,"" said Fathi Amar, who stood armed with a radio and camouflage uniform at the entrance to the burning storage center. No one was hurt in Monday's attack, Amar said. But he said five guards had been killed in another bombing run that struck the agricultural police center next door on Saturday, leaving little more than a heap of rubble. And another attack two days ago demolished what he described as a military base several hundred yards up the road, killing at least two people, he said. Moments after a busload of international journalists arrived, a handful of Libyan men ran up before television cameras chanting the oft-repeated pro-regime slogan ""Allah, Moammar, Libya, nothing else!"" in Arabic. When Libyan government minders last brought CNN to Zlitan about a week and a half ago, it was to see a large pro-Gadhafi rally in the city's main square. Crowds of Libyans waved green government flags, fired guns in the air, and fervently pledged their loyalty to their embattled leader. But the scene was dramatically different Monday, as fire trucks and ambulances regularly raced through the city's largely deserted streets. Many shops appeared to be closed, and the ominous rumble of warplanes could be heard overhead periodically. The NATO alliance says it has been hitting targets it describes as tanks, ""military storage facilities"" and artillery pieces in the vicinity of Zlitan on a daily basis for the past week. Officials from the embattled Gadhafi government also say the air strikes have intensified in frequency. ""People here call NATO the crazy one which lost its sanity,"" said Ramadan Mohamad Ramadan, an official from the local city government.  ""It is waging wide-scale war on the people. They are destroying everything."" Ramadan was standing in front of the rubble of a health clinic that he said had been demolished by a pre-dawn attack on Monday. Several bulldozers dug through wreckage strewn with medical supplies, including syringes, medication and even a microscope. Government officials said they were looking for the bodies of three people believed to be buried underneath, and said the bodies of eight people had been pulled out earlier in the day. Journalists did not see any evidence of dead or wounded at the site. Barely 100 yards away, however, drivers had parked a number of pick-up trucks under the cover of olive trees. Some of the vehicles were smeared with mud and the equipment in their chassis covered with branches -- an apparent camouflage tactic seen used by both loyalist and rebel fighters around Libya. Uniformed troops could also be seen resting in the shade of the orchard. Responding to the Libyan government's claims to journalists that a health clinic and food-storage facility had been hit, NATO had found no evidence to support the allegations, a NATO representative said. NATO forces had hit a number of targets near Zlitan that were ""military in nature"" Monday, the representative said. ""These targets were a command and control node and a vehicle storage facility that contained military vehicles. ""This is not the first time that such allegations have been made and as is the case with all NATO strikes a thorough damage assessment is conducted afterwards. As always great care is taken to minimize the risk of civilian casualties. ""We are always concerned by any reports of civilian casualties, take them seriously and the appropriate analysis will be conducted to ascertain the legitimacy, or otherwise, of these allegations."" In the afternoon, government minders brought journalists to the ruins of a mosque and school located in an all-but-deserted residential neighborhood several kilometers to the east of Zlitan's city center. An air attack clearly destroyed the compound, but there were conflicting reports from government minders regarding which week the strike took place. As another small group of pro-regime supporters began chanting at the ruins of the school, the thud of big guns continued to rumble. One of the minders said NATO warships in the Mediterranean Sea were shelling loyalist positions, but it was impossible for CNN to confirm whether the fire was incoming or outgoing. Two vehicles loaded with women, children and belongings drove past the shattered buildings, heading west -- away from the fighting. Suddenly, the unmistakable cloud from an air strike mushroomed up several miles away to the east. A four-door sedan, caked with mud and carrying several men wearing camouflage and carrying Kalashnikov rifles, drove past, also headed away from the direction of the front lines as the cloud from a second apparent air strike billowed in the distance. ""Come on, let's go,"" the minders repeated.  ""We have to go, they could bomb us here any time,"" they said, some of them visibly nervous. Monday's government tour of Zlitan was over, but the fighting there appeared to have barely begun. CNN's Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","NEW: NATO rejects claims it hit non-military targets near the coastal city of Zlitan Monday .

"Zakouma National Park, Chad (CNN) -- Rian Labuschagne pilots his single-engine bush plane low over a herd of elephants, his trained eye scanning for calves. He's spotted 21 in just the last few months. ""See that baby drinking?"" he asks, as he dips the left wing over a watering hole. It's something Chad's Zakouma National Park has been without for nearly five years. Large-scale Sudanese poaching operations from across the border have decimated the park's elephants. In the span of just a few years they slaughtered 90% of the park's elephant population. Labuschagne, the park's director, says until now, the survivors were too traumatized to mate. Zakouma is both blessed and cursed by its geography. The 3,000 square kilometers of pristine Sahel is a crucial habitat for the species, separating desert to the north and savannah to the south. But the park is also surrounded by conflict. To the east is Darfur, to the south, Central African Republic, and to the west is Nigeria. Opinion: Elephants slaughtered for trinkets and terrorism . ""There were less weapons in the past,"" says Idriss DÃ©by, President of Chad. ""Today all around us there are more weapons and more men who can use them. Poaching has no borders. All of this leads us to believe that national security, and regional security may be threatened by the poachers."" We fly towards the park's northern boundary, the landscape below dotted with nomad tents and their livestock, and the occasional camel caravan crossing ancient trading tracks. The terrain here is rugged, lawless and largely inaccessible by car, making it ideal for poachers. It's been that way for centuries, Labuschagne tells us from his pilot's seat. Hunting elephants here is nothing new. What is, are the weapons and tactics. ""They operate in small groups, they are usually about four to five people on horseback, they've got good communication systems, satellite phones, local phones,"" he says. ""They are absolute professionals in what they do. Except the shooting â€” it's just done in a massacre way. They just machine gun as many as they can, shoot as many as they can, get the ivory and then move on."" In September 2012, African Parks, which manages Zakouma, saw six of its rangers killed in a sophisticated three-pronged strike on their hillside outpost. Piles of stones mark the graves where they were buried. Dark patches still outline where the tents once stood, burnt to the ground by the poachers. It's the first time one of the ranger's sons, 18-year-old Issa Idris, has visited the site where his father was slain. ""I am remembering everything about him, what he must have been doing, what happened to him,"" Idris says in hushed tones, his eyes filled with pain. The attack, Labuschagne tells us, was revenge for a raid his rangers conducted on the poacher's camp just weeks before. Evidence collected from the camp gave Labuschagne more evidence into just what they were up against. They found thousands of rounds of ammunition, satellite phones containing images of hundreds of slaughtered elephants that matched those of carcasses in Cameroon, linking the poachers to one of the biggest elephant slaughters in decades. Also recovered at the site were Sudanese military uniforms, one identified as similar to those issued to Sudan's Abu Tira paramilitary service, notorious for its brutality and linked to atrocities in Darfur, and a stamped leave slip from the Sudanese Army. This month, the park, with the help of an outside agency, traced the ammunitions back to Khartoum. Sudan's Minister of Information, Ahmed Bilal Osman, denies the military link. ""Sudan has an ammunition factory, but the presence of Sudanese ammunition in Chad may have occurred in many different ways,"" he said. ""Sudan gets blamed for everything."" The war in neighboring Central African Republic is bringing even more threats. As Chadians living in the CAR flee the violence many return to the area which borders the park, where they have roots. Like so many others, Amin Younes, 29, is coming home to escape the violence. His wife and three-year-old daughter were brutally murdered. 'Machetes -- I didn't have the courage to look at them,"" he tells us as he unloads his luggage at a repatriation center. ""My heart wouldn't let me look at them."" He's hoping to escape the haunting memory and says he'll try to look for work in agriculture. But the influx of refugees, some of whom have weapons from the conflict, ties to the military or the Seleka rebels is a concern to local leaders. There aren't enough jobs here to go around and poaching is lucrative, especially for those battle-hardened. Since taking control of the park in 2010, Labuschagne's employer, the non-profit African Parks, has managed to keep the remaining elephants relatively safe. Labuschagne's team are collaring elephants, allowing them to track and respond to threats with younger, more highly trained rangers. He tells us that one of central Africa's largest herds is secure for now. But, he says, ""we have to prepare ourselves. We will become a target again in the future.""","Rangers in Chad's Zakouma National Park face a serious threat from poaching operations .
In recent years, park rangers have been executed in their line of work .

"(CNN) -- Demi Lovato reveals her father didn't ""function very well in society"" before he passed. The 20-year-old singer's dad Patrick died recently after a battle with cancer. Lovato revealed on Thursday that he suffered from a mental illness. It was previously reported she and her father were estranged for several years, but Lovato has a lot of compassion for her late father. ""I've dealt with mental illness.

"Moscow (CNN) -- Voters in rebel-held eastern Ukraine turned out at the polls Sunday to elect members of Parliament and prime ministers in the pro-Russian separatist provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk in a vote criticized by the Ukrainian government in Kiev and Western governments. Against a backdrop of violence and bloodshed, the vote played out despite a truce on paper between pro-Russian separatist groups and Ukrainian government forces. Moscow has said it will recognize the results, while the central Ukraine government in Kiev, the United States and European Union have condemned the elections, calling them ""illegitimate"" and a violation of the Minsk agreement. The self-proclaimed People's Republic of Donetsk announced that its current Prime Minister, Aleksandr Zakharchenko, had won the vote there. After all the ballot papers were counted, Zakharchenko secured 765,350 votes, Roman Lyagin, the leader of the Central Election Commission in Donetsk, told a news conference Monday. He didn't say what percentage of the vote that was. ""Everything went better than expected,"" Lyagin had earlier told Novorossiya, the press center for the separatist Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. In the self-declared Luhansk People's Republic, the head of the Central Election Commission said more then a half million people turned out to cast ballots at over 100 polling stations, including three inside Russia, according to preliminary numbers from the CEC's website. The vote count is now under way. Earlier Sunday, Luhansk CEC head Sergei Kozyakov told Itar-Tass so many people turned out to vote they extended polling station hours at several locations until 10 p.m. The Russian news agency also reported on a statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry, which said it considers the vote valid. ""The elections in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions were held in an organized way in general and with high voter turnout,"" the ministry said, according to Itar-Tass. ""We respect the will expression of the citizens of the southeast."" Authorities in Kiev are basically ignoring the election. In a statement Sunday, the Security Service of Ukraine said ""it is a false election ... and a farce organized by criminals to collect data about people."" Before the vote, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko called the ballot ""pseudo elections ... by terrorists and bandits."" Ukrainian authorities also said Sunday they are launching a criminal investigation into the separatist elections, calling it ""a power grab,"" Agence France-Presse reported, citing the Security Service of Ukraine. Vegetables in exchange for votes . Some residents of the devastated region have said they were determined to participate in the vote, whether it's recognized by Kiev or not. And many were rewarded with offers of free or cheap fruits and vegetables. Pictures at polling stations show large piles of vegetables outside stations in some areas in a bid to lure voters to polls. Produce aside, people said they hoped the election would help end the violence. ""Day and night we hear shots. Yes, they bomb us. Yes, we have bomb shelters and basements. But we don't want to go back there. That's why we are preparing for the elections and hope for something better,"" said Tatyana, a schoolteacher. ""Mostly people are afraid. The constant shooting scares people. But of course we should go and vote to reach something good in life,"" said Valentina. But there is no way to even verify the credibility of the balloting in the rebel-held areas. The voting has actually been under way for a week, by email and at mobile voting stations. And no official observers have been used to monitor the voting. Last weekend, the bulk of Ukraine under government control held its own parliamentary elections, which kept pro-Western parties in power. But citizens in Russian-annexed Crimea and the eastern areas controlled by separatists didn't participate in those elections because of the ongoing violence. U.S. and Russia at loggerheads . As Ukraine wrestles with internal turmoil, torn between Russiaan influence and Western support, the United States slammed the separatist vote. ""US will not recognize any election in separatist areas that doesn't follow Ukrainian law (and) is not held with consent of Ukrainian government,"" Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, tweeted on Sunday. ""We deplore the intent of separatists in parts of eastern Ukraine to hold illegitimate so-called local 'elections' on Sunday, November 2,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said in a statement Friday. She warned Russia ""against using any such illegitimate vote as a pretext to insert additional troops and military equipment into Ukraine."" Russia is rejecting calls to distance itself from the rebel vote. ""We will of course recognize their results. And we expect that this election will be free and that no one will try to disrupt it from the outside,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said last week.

"(CNN) -- Justin Bieber was in serious damage control mode Sunday after a video of him telling a racist joke to friends surfaced. In the video, posted to TMZ.com, the pop star, then 15, asks: ""Why are black people afraid of chain saws?"" He answers his own question: ""Run n*****, n*****, n*****, n*****,"" he says, imitating the sound of a chain saw. Then he laughs. TMZ reported it got the video four years ago but decided against posting it then because of Bieber's age and because he ""immediately told his friends what he did was stupid."" It was reportedly shot backstage at a promotional event. ""As a young man, I didn't understand the power of certain words and how they can hurt. I thought it was OK to repeat hurtful words and jokes, but didn't realize at the time that it wasn't funny and that in fact my actions were continuing the ignorance,"" Bieber, now 20, said in a statement. He added: ""I take my friendships with people of all cultures very seriously and I apologize for offending or hurting anyone with my childish and inexcusable mistake. I was a kid then and I am a man now who knows my responsibility to the world and to not make that mistake again."" The video is the latest in a string of troubles for the star, who shot to fame as a fresh-faced teen. There was a DUI arrest in Miami, an assault charge in Toronto and a felony vandalism probe in Los Angeles. Also, the Federal Aviation Administration is investigating allegations that Bieber and other passengers aboard a charter flight from Canada to New Jersey's Teterboro Airport interfered with the flight crew.

"Washington (CNN) -- Jeb Bush might not be announcing his candidacy for president in 2016 any time soon, but he is sharing his vision of the future with Iowan Republicans. The Des Moines Register reports Tuesday that GOP Iowans recently received mailers from the former Floridian governor that sounded more like a campaign pitch than a donation plea for his social fundraising group, Excellence in Education National. In the four and a half page letter, Bush proposes an economic plan that he believes are the stepping stones to make the country ""the most economically and socially mobile country in the world,"" once again. ""I am gravely concerned about the direction of our country, the lack of leadership in Washington, and the economic stagnation we have suffered through for the past six years,"" he said in the beginning of his letter. Kristy Campbell, Bush's spokeswoman, confirmed to CNN that the letter was sent in an effort to raise awareness about the current state of the education system, which should not be interpreted as a political sign. George W. Bush: I think my brother wants to be president . ""Gov. Bush raises money for his education work throughout the year and the letter is not related to any decision about his political future,"" she said. Campbell said that the governor will consider running and expects to make a decision later this year or in early 2015. The Des Moines Register said that Iowans had told them that they had never received anything from Bush or his foundation before. However, Campbell said the mailers are being sent across the country, not just to Iowa Republicans. In several bullet points, Bush lists the need for immigration reform, simplifying tax regulations, and other policies, half a page before touching upon the ""failing education system."" While the mailer does ask Iowans to donate for his cause, Bush's disclosure of his vision for only adds fuel to the rumor mill about whether he will run in 2016.

On Sunday, both of Bush's sons hinted that their father is seriously considering running. In an interview with the New York Times, Jeb Bush Jr. said that people and donors are ""getting fired up"" about the idea of his father running for president. ""I think it's more than likely that...he'll run. The family will be behind him 100 percent if he decides to do it,"" George P.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A Philippine teenager with a shy, crooked smile and expressive eyebrows -- who also happens to be the first figure skater ever to represent a Southeast Asian country -- qualified for the free skate after his performance on Thursday. Michael Christian Martinez, the lone athlete for the Philippines, is an unlikely competitor from a country without snow. Catapulted into the limelight after qualifying last year, his entire home country, which has never won a medal in the Winter Olympics, is rooting for him. On Thursday, he finished 19th overall with a total segment score of 64.81 which means he'll move on to Friday's final free skate. ""I'd love to qualify for the free skate [top 24]; that would be a big accomplishment for me,"" Martinez, 17, said in an interview with NBCOlympics.com prior to the competition. ""I don't know what placement I'll get because my training is so different, but we'll see."" It's likely to be a David-versus-Goliath match-up. Facing medal favorites such as Japan's Yuzuru Hanyu and Canada's Patrick Chan, who rank first and second after the short program, Martinez has not benefited from the same intensive training as many of his competitors. Maria Teresa Martinez, his mother, said her son had full training for two months before arriving in Sochi because of difficulties funding his Olympic aspirations. Ice skating is a costly endeavor with expenses for travel, equipments and coaches. His mother told CNN in an email that the family patched together donations from a local shopping mall ice rink, friends and his skating club. She said the family's life saving has been depleted and that their family's farm in Luzon province had been damaged by typhoons last year. If Martinez hadn't qualified for the Olympics in 2013, he would've had to quit competitive skating because his family couldn't afford it, his mother added. ""Now that he qualified, we are hoping we can finally get support so he can continue, and try to qualify again in 2018, where he will be more matured and more ready physically and mentally,"" she wrote. Regardless of how he fares this week, Martinez has come a long way. Born in Paranaque City, Martinez was stricken with asthmatic bronchitis at two months old. As a young boy, he struggled with sports because of his asthma attacks. ""I couldn't take up any sport. I tried outdoor sports when I was younger, but I easily got asthma attacks so I stopped,"" he said in his Sochi Olympic athletes profile. ""I had asthma maintenance medicine when I started skating, since the cold in the rink makes me sick too. But year after year, my health keeps improving, so my mother fully supported me to continue skating. She said it's better to spend the money on skating than in the hospital."" He got his first glimpse of skating after going to a shopping mall with his mother at age 8. He became mesmerized when he saw skaters spinning and jumping. By age 12, he was competing in European junior competitions and winning gold without a coach, his mother said. In 2010, he began training in the United States with coaches including John Nicks and Ilia Kulik, she said. Martinez splits his time between Manila and Los Angeles. In 2013, he came in fifth at the world Junior Championships in Milan. He is currently ranked 30th by the International Skating Union. Martinez does not have a dedicated practice rink in the Philippines and has to use a public one, his mother said. In late January, Martinez nursed an inflamed knee, saying it was likely caused by skating on rough ice, according to an interview with Catholic News Service. Martinez' social media accounts show a smile-prone teenager flashing peace signs in photographs and having the time of his life in Sochi.","Teenage from the Philippines is first Olympic figure skater from southeast Asia .

"(CNN) -- You are told -- twice-- that your son has died, once by a state trooper and then again by a local police officer. What do you do? Express thanks, and perhaps frustration, that it's not true. An Alaska family rode this emotional roller coaster earlier this week. And on Friday, Justin Priest -- the man whose parents believed had died -- said his family is ""very private,"" but hopes some good comes from getting the story out so no one else has to endure a similar nightmare ride. ""We wanted to put a little pressure on the police department to make sure this sort of thing doesn't happen again,"" Priest said. ""And I think we achieved our goal."" It is true that Justin D. Priest was pronounced dead at the scene late Wednesday after the car he was driving slammed into a tree in Juneau, police announced in a news release. Two other passengers in his vehicle were injured, including one ""with apparent life-threatening injuries."" When something horrible like this happens, law enforcement officers have the unenviable job of notifying next of kin. So, Juneau police reached out to the Alaska State Troopers, trying to get information on a Justin Priest from his parents in Palmer to determine if their son was in Juneau at the time of the accident. ""Instead, ... the communication got mixed up,"" Juneau Police Chief Bryce Johnson said. ""We somehow communicated it wrong, and they thought that we wanted to tell the family that their son had died in the crash."" That's what troopers did, going to the Priest home in Palmer before dawn to relay the horrific news. Then, Priest's father called Juneau police to verify it was his son who died in the accident. A Juneau officer said it was. But a different Justin Priest had died, one who was 33, as police noted in their press release, and from Juneau. The Justin Priest whose parents were contacted is 29, according to the Alaska Dispatch News, and from south Anchorage, about 570 miles away by air or boat and 850 miles by car from Juneau. The parents of the 29-year-old thought their son was dead when they went to his house early Thursday morning. They knocked on the door. And guess who answered, according to the Dispatch News? Their son Justin, alive and well. ""Justin?"" his father asked, the news website reported. ""It's Justin! Praise Jesus, we thought you were dead."" The mixup got back to Juneau later Thursday. Police there issued an updated press release, apologizing ""for our error"" and ""for any anguish our mistake has caused."" Johnson, Juneau's police chief, talked directly to the living Justin Priest's father by phone. ""He told me what they went through, and I was left speechless,"" said a choked up Johnson. ""From my perspective, after hearing all that they did, I was talking to a great man. I was left with an immense amount of respect for him."" After this incident, Johnson said Juneau police would review its dispatch recordings, talk to officers about following procedures, and possibly change protocols if it makes sense. What the police chief is not doing is shirking blame for what happened. ""It was our case, our responsibility,"" Johnson said. ""...The family deserves for us to acknowledge that it was our mistake, and we are sorry.""","A young man is killed in a car crash late Wednesday in Juneau, Alaska .

"Washington (CNN) -- Independent Senator Angus King announced Wednesday that he will continue to caucus with the Democratic Party despite their loss of the majority late Tuesday night. And despite rumors that he might be switching sides, moderate Democratic West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin also insists he'll stick with the party. In a press conference on Tuesday, the Maine senator was quick to downplay his decision as a political move, telling the public that he will not ""become a Democrat"" or side with all the their policy positions going forward. ""Who I caucus with is less important than who I work with--every day in the committee, on the senate floor, in the hallways, and here at home,"" he said. ""That's what's best for Maine--and that's what's best for the country; that's what I've done so far."" King, who considered siding with the Republicans, would have added an extra seat to the majority if he caucused with them. ""A fair question at the outset is whether being in the majority caucus isn't reason enough in itself to make the switch,"" he said. ""But I think there are other considerations -- particularly as they relate to Maine -- that offset this argument. "" King said he now has the responsibility to ""pull his colleagues toward the center,"" the same type of role he said fellow Mainer and Republican Sen. Susan Collins had under a Democratic majority. Manchin echoed King's sentiments in an interview Wednesday, saying he wouldn't leave the Democratic party to caucus with the GOP despite his own party losing the Senate majority Tuesday night. ""If you don't have moderates on both sides, you don't get anything done,"" he told The Washington Post. He said the Republicans ""played it masterfully,"" and admitted that he's frustrated with Democratic leadership -- especially Harry Reid. ""This is a real ass-whuppin,"" Manchin said. The first-term senator is rumored to be considering leaving Congress and mounting a bid for governor in his home state. ""One of the real problems with modern American politicsâ€”and the Congressâ€”is polarization,"" King said. ""Both sides need problem-solvers who are more interested in getting things done than scoring ideological or political points,"" he said. With Ebola battle brewing, Obama heads to Maine .

"(CNN) -- I grew up on the border, at the site of today's humanitarian crisis involving tens of thousands of immigrant children seeking asylum. Even though I was born in Texas' Rio Grande Valley, my family and I lived on the Mexican side of the river for seven years of my childhood. There I saw poverty firsthand, right around the corner from our house, in the streets, by the bridge, in the countryside. Poverty was everywhere. It looked like hungry children in dirty diapers living in dirt floor huts with no shoes, no clothes, no running water, no education, no health care and often no idea from where the next meal would come. It was the stench of running sewage, of dirty laundry, of mangy dogs, of rotting food. And later, as the drug trade and related violence increased, it wasn't just poverty that hung in the air, it became fear. I narrowly dodged being at a restaurant one evening in Matamoros, Mexico, when a gunbattle broke out. My best friend hit the floor so hard he woke up with bruises all over his knees and elbows, blood splattered on his sneakers. Another night, walking near my grandparents' home, I bumped into a man bathed in blood. He'd just been shot and was running for his life. The area was the site of the infamous Santa Elena Ranch killings. The environment had changed. And that was more than 20 years ago. It's only gotten worse, not just on the border but throughout Mexico and Central America, which is why our nation must shift its foreign policy priorities closer to home. Fortunately, for me, I was born into a middle-class family. Our life was filled with tensions most Americans know too well: saving our home from foreclosure, keeping the lights on and worrying whether my dad's small business would survive tough times. But -- unlike the children flooding into our country -- we felt safe from hunger, from violence, from fear of losing our lives at any moment. Like most Americans, we found comfort and complacency in that degree of safety. And so like most Americans, we did not question the priority our nation continuously placed on the Middle East. September 11, 2001, only fueled that focus because we felt the impact of terrorism bred in the Middle East on our own soil. But shouldn't today's humanitarian crisis along the border be a wake-up call to the fact that we must finally place a higher priority on Latin America? The results of the unbridled violence and poverty south of our border have long spilled onto our soil. And, after the failure of governments throughout the hemisphere to turn the tide, the effects are evident in this flood of desperate humanity seeking refuge and opportunity. As someone who grew up there, I can assure you that more border security is not the answer. This solution -- often prioritized by political leaders and epitomized by Texas Gov. Rick Perry's decision to deploy the National Guard -- is nothing but macho swagger that oversimplifies the problem and will only succeed in turning our border region into more of a war zone. We must remember that places such as the Rio Grande Valley are still a part of America. The beleaguered people who live there have a right to enjoy the same freedom and safety the rest of America holds dear. And no matter how much border security exists, it will not stop this deluge of humanity, but it will tell our children and those watching around the world that America is a heartless nation. If the Statue of Liberty is the symbol of immigrant America from another era, what statue should be erected in the Rio Grande Valley? A solider pointing a weapon southward through a towering barbed wire fence? Is that the new image we wish to form of America for generations to come? To the contrary, we must stop dealing only with symptoms and tackle the real problems. The constant tide of northward migration from Latin America is a symptom of deeper problems, as is our nation's paralysis in dealing with all of the undocumented immigrants who have already crossed our borders. Our foreign policy priorities must shift, and we must invest more talent and resources in collaborating with Latin American governments to fix their broken countries, economies and societies. President Barack Obama's meeting with Central American leaders this week must be the beginning of a deeper commitment to solving our shared challenges. A quick glance at the U.S. Agency for International Development's list of the top 20 nations benefiting from American foreign aid includes only one Latin American nation, Colombia coming at 15th. Four out of the top seven recipient nations are in the Middle East. Absent from the list of the top 20 are any of the nations most directly involved in this recent wave of immigrants: Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Mexico. While the crises in Ukraine and Gaza are reminders that we cannot ignore the rest of the world, it is also clear we must do more in our own backyard so that so many of our neighbors don't feel compelled to flee their homes. The problem begins, and must be resolved, in these immigrants' nations of origin. But we must also deal with the situation we have at home. Not only should we be humane and generous in caring for these young immigrants; we must include them within our approach to comprehensive immigration reform. We must act fast. And we must act now. We must embrace a more inclusive vision of the Americas as our larger shared home because we are so highly interdependent, as evidenced by this mounting crisis. And we must make this hemispheric home a better place to live for all, everywhere, so that people are more likely to build their lives closer to where they were born, nearer to their families and connected to their cultures. If they had that chance, I'm sure they'd take it. And we'd all be better off as Americans, and Americanos.

"Bariloche, Argentina (CNN) -- During a visit to Argentina 11 years ago, Elena Durón Miranda was horrified to see children as young as 3 years old rummaging through a trash dump for food and valuable materials. ""I saw children collect green sausages, a bag of potato chip crumbs, a bag of noodles with cream, and recovered leftover yogurt next to a diaper,"" said Durón Miranda, a Mexican psychologist who was visiting Bariloche to do research. ""The children began to gently clean the food -- wiping each little noodle, each potato and peeling the sausage skin so methodically and accurately. It was as if they had done this same activity many times."" Durón Miranda said there were maybe 200 children at the dump collecting things to eat and sell. ""At that moment in time, my son was the same age as many of them,"" said Durón Miranda, now 41. ""So that struck me as horrific."" Durón Miranda learned that many children in Bariloche, a popular city for skiers and tourists in southern Argentina, drop out of school and spend their lives working at the dump. Determined to restore their dignity, Durón Miranda decided to stay in the country and start a nonprofit called PETISOS, which stands for Prevención y Erradicación del Trabajo Infantil SOS (Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor SOS). The organization aims to provide children with free education and extracurricular programs so they have an alternative to working. Today, approximately 200 boys and girls in Bariloche benefit from PETISOS. ""We carry out very personalized tracking of all the boys and girls we work with,"" Durón Miranda said. ""We work with the families, we work with the schools, we work with the medical or health centers in order to ... get them out of the labor situation."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . When she was starting, Durón Miranda first set out to understand what was leading the children to work in the dump. ""I wanted to know what would lead a family to let this happen,"" she said. ""What I did was set up camp inside the garbage dump and work with the children, right alongside them. I picked through garbage, too. I also watched how they got around, everything they did. So the families started to develop a lot of trust in me."" While Argentina has laws against child labor, the majority of working children do so for their families as unpaid laborers, according to the International Labor Organization. Parents don't force their children to work, but the children join in at an early age because work activities often revolve around family networks. ""All parents want a better life for their children than what they had,"" Durón Miranda said. ""However, there are times when their situation is so precarious they have no other way out but for the whole family to work and try to make ends meet."" PETISOS programs are open to anyone in the community, working or nonworking. But involving a working child can be a lengthy process. Durón Miranda and her team start by tracking a child and observing his or her work habits. After earning the child's trust, which can often take between six months and a year, they set up a meeting with the child's family. Then they develop an integrated plan for helping the child and try to get the family to understand the importance of education. ""When you work in situations where the context is one of such great poverty, it's very difficult to talk to parents about the long term because usually they live in the immediate term,"" Durón Miranda said. ""We tell them that a child that has more years of schooling has the opportunity to get a better job and eventually (make) more money than (they make) doing subsistence work."" PETISOS has a team of professionals and volunteers working with the children to ensure their growth. The children are enrolled in school and have a tracking group to make sure they attend. There are afterschool workshops held at the PETISOS headquarters, where children can get help with their homework or do art projects. And psychologists, doctors and social workers are also available to work with the children and their families. Family heads can also receive job training and child-rearing support. ""The parents are happy with the project because they realize we're concerned about the children. ... We give them an incentive to have a better future, a different future,"" Durón Miranda said. Oftentimes, there are several children from the same family in the PETISOS program. Rosa Del Carmen Aguilar is a single mother of seven who used to work in the garbage dump to provide for her family. Durón Miranda's programs helped Aguilar get out of the dump and keep her children out of trouble. ""I didn't have a salary, I didn't have a job, and we always have the need,"" Aguilar said. ""I resorted to her. She was the person I had the most trust in. ... The kids are moving forward, and we've gone a long way."" The group is funded by grants and donations. As a result of PETISOS efforts, many children have gone on to graduate from high school and attend college. There are others who are working stable jobs, and many young women have started families and are more sensitive to the upbringing of their children. ""That's very important for us,"" Durón Miranda said. ""I think that's where we start to break vicious cycles stemming from negligent upbringing and upbringing with mistreatment. I think that's our greatest success to date."" Durón Miranda describes her job as ""full-life"" rather than ""full-time,"" but she said she can't imagine it any other way. ""The problems these boys and girls are living, and which we spend all our time on, are very painful,"" she said. ""Fortunately, we have the capacity to transform pain into the desire to do something about it."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- The GOP-led House Select Committee on the Benghazi terror attack shows no sign of backing down despite a report from another congressional panel that, according to a top Democrat, found no intelligence failures around the deadly 2012 assault. ""There is more work to be done and more to be investigated,"" a spokeswoman for House Select Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy told CNN on Wednesday. Shortly before beginning its August recess, the House Intelligence Committee, also led by Republicans, approved its report on the militant attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in eastern Libya that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. ""Our investigation found the intelligence community warned about an increased threat environment, but did not have specific tactical warning of an attack before it happened,"" Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, the senior Democrat on the intelligence panel, said in a statement after its vote. Ruppersberger said the finding is ""consistent with testimony that the attacks appeared to be opportunistic."" Other committee probes . The Intelligence panel, along with several other House committees, has spent the past two years interviewing witnesses and examining evidence about the Obama administration's response to the attacks and the related controversy that has been a flashpoint between Republicans and President Barack Obama over his conduct of foreign policy. In a key finding, the Intelligence Committee reached a conclusion on one of the most contentious issues -- the now-infamous talking points used by a senior administration official to describe publicly what had occurred. Using that information, then U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice explained in television interviews just days after the September 11 attack that it stemmed from spontaneous protests over an anti-Muslim film produced in the United States. There had been such demonstrations in other areas of the Mideast. U.S. intelligence officials soon determined, however, that groups with links to terrorists planned and carried out the armed assault on a diplomatic facility and a CIA annex. A flawed process . The committee report, according to Ruppersberger, found that ""the process used to develop the talking points was flawed"" and that they ""reflected the conflicting intelligence assessments in the days immediately following the crisis."" Like an earlier report by the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee also found that there was no 'stand down' order issued by the U.S. military command in Tripoli, which sought to support Americans under fire in Benghazi. CNN reached out to Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers for comment on the panel's report but did not receive a response. Gowdy has said repeatedly that the House Select Committee will review what other congressional committees have found, but also seek testimony from those who haven't done so yet. Gowdy told his hometown newspaper, the Greenville News, ""witnesses who were previously unavailable or not interested in cooperating are now interested in cooperating."" He added that ""the universe of witnesses is expanding."" Gowdy also indicated that the Select Committee would hold its first public hearing in September to hear how the State Department is carrying out new efforts on diplomatic security. Broader mandate . Gowdy spokeswoman Amanda Duvall told CNN the committee's ""mandate is broader"" than work done by other panels. ""The chairman has repeatedly noted the Select Committee wants every relevant document and all relevant witnesses to ensure every relevant fact is uncovered. This is a fact-centered investigation and the committee will go where the facts lead,"" Duvall said. The plan now is to declassify the Intelligence Committee report and make it public. A time frame for that, however, is not yet clear. Where are the Benghazi suspects? One of them appears in court . Many questions in handling of Benghazi .","House Select Committee on Benghazi is will press ahead with investigation .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Someone stole an ""incomplete and early version"" of the next installment in the blockbuster ""X-Men"" movie series and posted it on the Internet this week, according to the studio that owns the billion-dollar film franchise. Hugh Jackman stars in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine."" An early version of the film was leaked to the Web. Twentieth Century Fox said the FBI was investigating who leaked ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" which is set for release in U.S. theaters May 1. The digital file quickly spread across the Internet and was available for free, but illegal, downloading from hundreds of easily found Web sites. ""The source of the initial leak and any subsequent postings will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law; the courts have handed down significant criminal sentences for such acts in the past,"" the studio's statement said.  Watch how the leak might affect ticket sales » . Removing the pirated files from the Internet may prove an impossible challenge, an industry source said. This source did not want to be named because of the sensitive nature of the matter. Although the studio said it was removed from the Web site that first hosted it, the digital file has probably been downloaded tens of thousands of times, the source said. ""It's not removed from the Internet,"" the industry source said. ""It's still there."" Twentieth Century Fox downplayed the value of the pirated copy, noting that it was not the final version. ""It was without many effects, had missing and unedited scenes and temporary sound and music,"" the studio said. Online movie reviewer Kent Lundblad said he was given a copy by a friend just hours after the rough ""Wolverine"" first appeared on a Web site Tuesday afternoon. ""Even in this rough form, it's much better than the last 'X-Men' outing or anything Fox has given us in a long, long time,"" Lundblad said in a review he wrote after watching it. He said the movie is a rough cut, using placeholder images in many sections and special effects that look like ""video games 12 years ago."" He said he suspects that the final movie will look much different than the pirated version, with scenes that were re-shot. Lundblad, a 25-year-old who describes himself as ""a total nerd,"" said he will see the movie at its midnight premiere May 1. He bought his ticket weeks ago online, he said. Steve Zeitchik, who covers the film industry for The Hollywood Reporter, said the studio's biggest concern may be that having people view a rough cut ""completely throws the studios off their game"" of building a positive buzz for the movie. ""If people see this movie, and they don't like it, and they tell their friends, and their friends blog about it, and it just spreads throughout the blogosphere, there are a lot of people that don't even get near a pirated copy of this film, who don't go see [the movie in theaters] because of this leak,"" Zeitchik said. Whether the leaked video will eventually hurt the film's box office earnings ""is very difficult to discern,"" according to CNN's source. The latest ""X-Men"" film stars Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Investigators have several tools to help find the source of the leak, including digital watermarking, the studio said. ""We forensically mark our content so we can identify sources that make it available or download it,"" the studio said. An FBI spokeswoman confirmed that the agency is ""working with the studio and investigating the alleged online compromise of the movie."" The Motion Picture Association of America, the film industry's main trade association, confirmed it was also helping in the probe.","NEW: Online reviewer saw early ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" praises film .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Almost 50 percent of the world's primates are in danger of extinction, according to a report from an international conservation group that cites habitat destruction and hunting as the two greatest threats. The golden-headed lion tamarin has been brought back from the edge of extinction. The situation is especially dire in Asia, where the report says more than 70 percent of monkeys, apes, and other primates are classified as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered. ""We've raised concerns for years about primates being in peril, but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined,"" said Russell Mittermeier, president of Conservation International and chairman of the IUCN Primate Specialist Group. ""Tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause, but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas, even where the habitat is still quite intact,"" he said. The report from Conservation International, issued at this week's International Primatological Society Congress in Edinburgh, Scotland, looked at the world's 634 kinds of primates, mankind's closest relatives. Conservation International funded the review along with the Margot Marsh Biodiversity Foundation, Disney's Animal Kingdom, and the Swiss-based IUCN, or International Union for Conservation of Nature. The report found that about 90 percent of primate species in Vietnam and Cambodia were at risk of extinction. Populations of gibbons, leaf monkeys, langurs and other species had dwindled, the report said, because of ""rampant habitat loss exacerbated by hunting for food and to supply the wildlife trade in traditional Chinese medicine and pets."" Jean-Christophe Vie, deputy head of the IUCN Species Program, called the situation in southeast Asia terrifying. ""To have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is, quite frankly, unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date,"" he said in a news release. Great apes like gorillas and bonobos still faced challenges in Africa, the report said, but it was the smaller primates -- such as the red colobus monkey, with its striking white, black and rust-colored coat -- that could die out first. In Africa, 11 of the 13 kinds of red colobus monkeys assessed in the report were listed as critically endangered or endangered, and two may already be extinct, the report said. Bouvier's red colobus has not been seen in 25 years, and despite occasional sightings, no primatologist has recorded a living Miss Waldron's red colobus since 1978, the report says. Primates are important to the health of their surrounding ecosystems, the report's authors say, supporting a wide range of plant and animal life in the world's tropical forests. Healthy forests, in turn, provide vital resources for local human populations. Reforestation is crucial to restoring primate populations because it restores their habitat, the report said. It cites the cases of the black lion tamarin and golden lion tamarin in Brazil, which were downgraded from critically endangered to endangered after three decades of conservation efforts. ""If you have forests, you can save primates,"" said Anthony Rylands, a scientist with Conservation International and the deputy chair of the IUCN Primate Specialist Group. ""The work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates, but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change.""","Report: Almost 50 percent of world's primates in danger of extinction .

"(CNN) -- Despite government claims of a ceasefire that will supposedly lead to the release of more than 200 girls abducted by Boko Haram, members of the Islamist terror group have abducted at least 60 young women and girls from Christian villages in northeast Nigeria, residents said Thursday. The heavily armed fighters left 1,500 naira, or about $9, and kolanuts as a bride price for each of the women abducted Saturday, suggesting that they would be taken as sex slaves, residents told CNN. The latest abductions in the villages of Wagga and Gwarta raise serious questions about recent Nigerian government claims that more than 200 girls abducted by Boko Haram in April would be released soon as part of a ceasefire with the Islamist militants. Boko Haram has remained silent on the deal the government said it signed with the group in neighboring Chad last week. Nigerian officials have emphasized there is no set time line for the release, which will likely happen on a piecemeal basis instead of all at once. Boko Haram, meanwhile, has let its weapons do the talking, continuing five years of violence. Over the weekend, gunmen believed to be Boko Haram fighters attacked two villages and a town, killing at least eight people and kidnapping others. Residents of Wagga, near a town where more than 200 girls were abducted in April, told CNN that heavily armed fighters stormed the village Saturday and took away 40 women by force. The gunmen went door to door, seizing women and young girls and driving off in vans and motorcycles with them into the bush, resident Lazarus Baushe said. Enoch Mark, a priest from Chibok whose daughter and niece were among the more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped in April in Chibok, said he received a call from an elder in Wagga on Saturday with word of the 40 women being abducted. Boko Haram: The essence of terror . In Garta, another 20 women were abducted, and three people were killed, resident Solomon Bature told CNN. Residents of Pina, a nearby village, managed to escape into the mountains before the gunmen arrived, resident Bulus Maiyaki told CNN. Maiyaki said two residents were shot and killed. David Cook, who studies jihad, has doubts about the ceasefire deal going through. ""It remains to be seen whether this truce will actually materialize, whether it is merely an election ploy for Nigeria's embattled President, Goodluck Jonathan, and most crucially whether it will bring about the release of numerous captives taken by Boko Haram during the past year,"" he wrote in an analysis for CNN. The Islamists have employed particularly bloody tactics this year, killing thousands. Boko Haram has gone after Christians, foreigners and educated people, driving them out of the country's northeast. And they have continued kidnapping. They have often sidelined Nigeria's army. And government soldiers have at times mutinied, complaining of lacking support from the government. Boko Haram has been waging an insurgency in the country's north since 2009. What is Boko Haram?","At least 60 young women and girls from northeast Nigeria are kidnapped by Boko Haram .

"(CNN) -- Much was made of the death of the VW Kombi last year, when the last van rolled off a Brazilian factory floor after more than 60 years of continuous production. But there are still places where this icon of world travel can be found, spluttering and stuttering along the dusty paths of adventure. A small tour company in Uganda has discovered a few Kombis rusting away, abandoned by their owners in dusty corners of the country, and is putting them to use as hardy servants of travelers seeking alternate means of travel. In 2009, Steven Cresswell and William Boase toured Uganda from the UK on a motorcycle and saw several deserted Kombi vans along their way. A year later they returned, bought and revived one of these relics, named it ""Piglet,"" and founded Kombi Nation Tours. From ambulance to tour bus . Piglet, a 37-year-old red Kombi van, was first registered as an ambulance in the northwest of Uganda. ""She'd been last used as a matatu (bus/taxi),"" says Rachel Landman, director of Kombi Nation Tours. ""Though when we found her, she was being used as a storage for car parts with the words 'Please Enjoy Me Again' painted on the back window."" The company quickly found two more camper vans, namely Beatrice (Betty) -- formerly an ambulance -- and The Dude, formerly a chicken hutch. Many of the Kombis were used as taxis and minibuses until they become difficult to maintain. ""VW Kombi are no longer common in Uganda,"" says Landman. ""They ceased to be used as taxis and buses in 2000. ""They're actually the more expensive choice because of the amount of (maintenance) invested in them but most clients still choose them for the novelty factor,"" says Landman. Every recovered Kombi is reincarnated by chief mechanic Fred Seruwo, who refits the engine and brakes, reworks the body and takes the van on a 700-kilometer test drive. ""When I get back [from the test drive], we have a nice Kombi,"" says Seruwo. Good, bad, ugly of a Kombi tour . Not all Kombi fans are confident the vehicle is suited to Africa's terrain. ""Having been to Africa, I believe there are more appropriate vehicles for touring this part of the world,"" says Californian Gary Garfield, a Kombi fan who toured Europe in a Kombi in 1973. ""The Kombi is/was fun and has great memories, but it's old technology and I wouldn't seek out a tour that uses these for a nostalgic rationale,"" he adds. Thus, the company also owns a fleet of 4x4 Toyota Landcruisers as backups. ""[Our camper vans are] a bunch of old ladies, and this means that they do occasionally have hiccups, usually related to poor-quality fuel confusing their guts,"" says Landman. But the company says no major breakdowns have occurred so far. ""Kombi Nation Tours was born out of Boase's and Cresswell's motorcycle tour and it remains the inspiration of the tour company,"" says Landman. ""[Kombi tours] are to replicate that trip, a true adventure,"" says Landman. ""Many of the clients that we attract are from that 'nostalgia market,' those who traveled in a Kombi back in the 1970s."" One quality that has turned Kombis into icons of resourcefulness are the stories that get towed along in their exhaust stream. Landman describes one such episode: ""In February 2014, we were traveling between Ishasha, home of the tree-climbing lion and Bwindi, home of the mountain gorillas. ""We left the savannah of the national park only to find the road had been resurfaced the day before and raised about 40 centimeters and we couldn't get the Kombi onto the main road. ""Luckily, Kate, one of the clients who had owned a Kombi in Nepal in the '70s, and her nephew, had a good sense of adventure. ""Together we dug some of the gravel and sand -- luckily not yet tarmac -- and made a clearance to drive the vehicle up -- and replaced it afterward of course."" 'They'll be around another 40 years' The Kombi has been in production since the 1950s but Volkswagen shut down its Brazil plant, the last facility making the vans, on the last day of 2013. ""We are, of course, all saddened that they will at some point fade away,"" says Landman. ""But we think they'll be around for another 40 years or so. From a business perspective, it makes them more special and unique. ""On tour outside of Kampala [the vans] certainly turn heads. Children run to them in the village and sometimes just stare at them, confused, in the very remote areas. ""Old men wave and its been known for them to stop walking and take off their hats!"" Have you traveled in a VW Kombi? Share your experience in the comments section.","VW ended the production of the Kombi last year, but the vans' resourceful spirit thrives in Uganda .

"(CNN) -- Earlier this week, Brian Shepherd sat down in a small doctor's office in Bethesda, Maryland. A technician swabbed his arm and gave him a quick jab with a needle. With that, Shepherd became subject No. 13 in the experiment testing a potential Ebola vaccine. The trial was launched on an emergency basis earlier this month by the National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Disease. It's the first to test this kind of Ebola vaccine in humans. ""It's not just for the money,"" Shepherd wrote in a Reddit AMA. ""I'm very interested in translational research and experiencing it from the guinea pig side is very rewarding. But yeah, the money helps. This one study will fund most of my grad school application costs, though not in time for application season."" The vaccine doesn't use live virus and can't infect volunteers with Ebola. Instead it uses specific Ebola proteins to trigger an immune response. They're delivered through the body on a modified version of an adenovirus, a type of cold virus. In the initial phase, 10 healthy volunteers were given a low dose of vaccine. They were monitored for side effects and tested to see if their bodies are producing antibodies. In the second phase, of which Brian is a part, an additional 10 volunteers are being given a higher dose. All participants will be followed for nearly a year and tested at regular intervals. Shepherd, who has volunteered for several prior research studies at NIH, spoke with CNN about his experience. The following is a condensed version of that conversation: . CNN: How did you come to join the study? Brian Shepherd: I actually work at NIH; I'm a post-doc researcher in a developmental biology lab. Most trials I learn about from reading a ListServ (email list). I heard about the vaccine study from going to preliminary meetings for a different study. CNN: When was this? Shepherd: Less than a month ago. I had my first appointment on August 26. It was just a sit-down, to talk about the trial, go through paperwork and consent forms, explaining what the trial was for. Then they did an initial run-through of my health history. CNN: What was next? Shepherd: The next week I had my second appointment. They did a full physical, blood work, health history, breathing checks. A lot of poking and prodding. My third visit was Wednesday. They drew blood, then gave me a shot. Now, my next appointment is Sunday. CNN: What was it like? You wrote that pulling off the Band-aid was the worst of the pain. Shepherd: I'm supposed to keep a daily diary for the first seven days, logging my temperature and any symptoms. The next morning, I woke up with a slight fever, 100.5. I took some Tylenol and it went away. Other than that I feel fine. In fact, I ran a half-mile in a relay race at lunchtime with some people from work. CNN: You wrote that for each of these regular visits, you're paid $175. How many times have you been a human guinea pig? Shepherd: This is my second drug trial. Before that, I did mostly MRI studies. The first one I did, I was in the MRI machine and had three tasks. They gave me two buttons and showed pictures. If it was Spiderman, I'd hit one button; if it was the Green Goblin, I'd hit the other. So I spent 15 minutes playing Spiderman vs. Green Goblin. CNN: Did you have any reservation at all, taking part in this Ebola vaccine trial? Shepherd: None at all.","Brian Shepherd is a healthy volunteer who agreed to test an Ebola vaccine .

"(CNN) -- The hanging of an Iranian woman, convicted of murder in a killing that human rights groups called self-defense against her rapist, has been delayed for 10 days, according to Amnesty International. Reyhaneh Jabbari, 26, was sentenced to death for the 2007 killing of Morteza Abdolali Sarbandi, a former employee of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security. The United Nations' Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights says that the killing was an act of self-defense against a rapist and that Jabbari never received a fair trial. On Wednesday, Amnesty International said in a statement that Jabbari had been transferred to a prison where, according to a message from her mother on Facebook, she was set to be executed on September 30. But at the last minute, the execution was delayed for 10 days, the rights group said, ""possibly in response to the public outcry after her mother's post about her scheduled execution."" In the post, Jabbari's mother wrote that she could ""collect the body"" after the execution. Amnesty International said Jabbari was convicted of murder after ""a flawed investigation and unfair trial."" The United Nations and international human rights groups have taken up Jabbari's cause. A Facebook page dedicated to saving Jabbari from execution has been created, with more than 14,000 likes. The U.N. has said Sarbandi hired Jabbari -- then a 19-year-old interior designer -- to work on his office. Jabbari stabbed Sarbandi after he sexually assaulted her, the U.N. has said. Jabbari was held in solitary confinement without access to her lawyer and family for two months, Amnesty International said in a statement. She was tortured during that time. ""Amnesty International understands that, at the outset of the investigation, Reyhaneh Jabbari admitted to stabbing the man once in the back, but claimed she had done so after he had tried to sexually abuse her,"" the rights group said. ""She also maintained that a third person in the house had been involved in the killing. These claims, if proven, could exonerate her but are believed never to have been properly investigated, raising many questions about the circumstances of the killing."" The family of Sarbandi could forgive his killer and agree to stay the execution, an option available under Iran's Islamic penal code. Iranian Oscar winner Asghar Farhadi has joined scores of Iranian artists and musicians calling for a halt to the execution. In an open letter, Farhadi asked the victim's family to pardon Jabbari. Rights groups have criticized the Islamic Republic of Iran for a surge in executions under Hassan Rouhani, in his first year as President. According to the United Nations, Iran has executed at least 170 people this year. In 2013, Iran executed more people than any other country with the exception of China, the world's most populous nation. CNN's Reza Sayah contributed to this report.","Amnesty International says the hanging of Reyhaneh Jabbari has been delayed for 10 days .

"(CNN) -- Travelers along I-20 in South Carolina looked up in disbelief and amazement Saturday as white flakes fell from the sky. And when they looked ahead they saw red -- red taillights. The earliest-ever snow in Columbia and that area of the Palmetto State had traffic backed up for hours in several spots. ""(I) was just sitting and waiting, and not knowing (how much snow would fall) was the worst,"" Steven Crouch told CNN affiliate WIS. The station reported that it usually doesn't freeze in Columbia until November 10. Hundreds of customers were without power, WIS said. On Saturday, it only snowed a trace, according to the National Weather Service, but the slick conditions hampered travel. In other parts of the South, there was a lot more precipitation. Near Gatlinburg, Tennessee, there was 22 inches of snow, while areas around Asheville, North Carolina, received 5 inches. And man, was it cold -- at least for this time of year. It was a record low 41 in Daytona Beach, Florida, on Sunday. There was a hard freeze warning from Louisiana to North Carolina, and north to Ohio and Pennsylvania. Some parts of Florida were under frost advisories or freeze watches. The good news is, the cold spell should be short, CNN meteorologist Todd Borek said. Temperatures should moderate toward season averages beginning Monday, he said. Runners at the New York City Marathon are used to chilly temps, but the wind was terrible Sunday, with many gusts of more than 40 mph. One gust in Westchester County was recorded at 55 mph, the National Weather Service in New York said on Twitter. The culprit was a high-pressure system that was dragging air from Canada over the eastern half of the United States, Borek said.","It was 41 degrees in Daytona Beach, Florida, on Sunday morning .

"(CNN) -- Lawyers for George Zimmerman, the Florida man who was acquitted of second-degree murder in the killing of Trayvon Martin, plan to ask the state to reimburse Zimmerman for at least $200,000 of expenses incurred during his trial. Under Florida law, an acquitted defendant cannot be held liable for court costs or any charges while detained in custody, as long as a clerk or judge consents to the refund. The costs may include money spent for expert witnesses, travel expenses and fees for transcripts. ""We're probably going to ask for somewhere between $200,000 and $300,000,"" lead attorney Mark O'Mara said. But, O'Mara said, the chances are slim they'll receive anywhere near that sum. ""We're not going to get it. The case law here is quite limited. Even though we're going to ask for it, the amount that we'd most likely get is significantly less."" Such a request is fairly standard in the state. Casey Anthony, who was charged with murdering her 2-year-old daughter, filed a similar request after her acquittal in a Florida courtroom in 2011. While the final accounting is still being tabulated ahead of the formal request, the highest expense in the Zimmerman trial were the expert witnesses. ""We had to bring in four to five experts on the voice issue. That was as much as $75,000 to $100,000,"" O'Mara said. Transcripts ran approximately $20,000, he said. However, under state law, any attorney's fees would be exempt from such a refund. O'Mara estimated the fees he would ordinarily have charged run approximately $1 million -- fees that don't include the amount that would have been charged by co-counsel Don West, nor others on the team that put together the successful defense. ""I haven't gotten one penny in fees,"" O'Mara said. ""I do have an agreement with George that if he comes into money, I would get paid."" Despite being currently unemployed, Zimmerman could potentially get income through other sources such as writing a book, or any money resulting from a defamation lawsuit against NBC News for airing an inaccurate editing of Zimmerman's call to non-emergency dispatchers the night Trayvon Martin was shot and killed on February 26, 2012. In all, O'Mara estimated the total cost of defending George Zimmerman to be around $2 million. Zimmerman pulled over in Texas for speeding, given warning . Zimmerman was acquitted by a six-person jury in July on second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. The high-profile case sparked a heated nationwide discussion of race as well as debate over Florida's ""stand your ground"" law. Martin was an unarmed black teenager, and Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, called police after spotting Martin walking through the neighborhood. He followed Martin, against the directions of a dispatcher, and argued that he shot the 17-year-old after he and the teenager fought because he feared for his life. The prosecution said Zimmerman profiled Martin because he was black, followed him and shot him during a confrontation. TMZ: Zimmerman visits Florida gunmaker .

"(CNN) -- Inside the city limits of San Antonio, mounds of churned up earth are piled knee high as far as the eye can see. Fresh green grass has disappeared and the only evidence of any shrubs is the exposed roots protruding from the carnage. What looks to be the path of a devastating tornado in America's heartland is actually the result of a small group of feral hogs in the Lone Star state. Texas, along with many of the southern states, is facing a problem of ""Hogzilla"" proportions. From agricultural fields and farmland to golf courses and playgrounds, no property is off limits to these chubby eating machines. From 2 to 6 million feral hogs are wreaking havoc in at least 39 states. Texas is said to be home to over half of the country's feral hog population. Recently, I co-hosted a special series on invasive species featuring the devastating impact feral hogs are having on the residents and livestock of Texas. This ""pig explosion"" is affecting anyone who drives a car or drinks tap water. In other words -- everyone. The term, ""feral hogs,"" refer to either domesticated hogs that are now wild or Russian boars, or the hybrid of the two. Hogs have roamed the U.S. since the 1530s and were an important source of food for the early pioneers. It wasn't until the 1930s when the Eurasian wild boar was released into the Texas landscape that things began brewing for the perfect pig storm. Given their ability to adapt well to most environments and their breeding capabilities, a pair of hogs can quickly become hundreds. Sows can become pregnant at 6 to 8 months old and are capable of birthing four to six piglets per litter. In Texas alone the agricultural damage caused by hogs is estimated to be $52 million dollars annually. With millions of hog snouts rooting their way through the Southern states, the problem has grown from an agricultural and rural issue to a suburban nightmare. As witnessed recently in the Atlanta suburbs, a torn up yard or demolished sprinkler system is a common occurrence. Imagine driving your car into a 500-pound black boar or worse ... a group of them. Hundreds of pig-vehicle collisions occur every year. In some cases, severe injury and death happen. Along with costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in land, property and collision damage, another scary reality is the effect on water quality. Because hogs don't have any sweat glands they often wallow in creeks and rivers beds to keep cool. Defecating in and around these water sources produce high levels of bacteria. This same contaminated water is often used to irrigate agricultural fields that are growing your family's vegetables. Some reports estimate the total damage feral hogs cause annually in the U.S. to be over $1 billion. Whether we're talking millions or billions, the big question looms in everyone's mind: What can we do about it? Is an ""Aporkalypse"" inevitable? The first and most important step is to acknowledge and understand the problem at hand. The Invasive Species Council has made efforts to spotlight the problem both at the state and federal levels. With many shows highlighting hog hunting, even on prime time TV, the issue has been brought to the attention of the general public. That poses another question: Whose problem is it? Often people don't care about problems that aren't occurring in their own backyard. While there's no easy solution, there are ways of helping manage their numbers. Being a lifelong big game hunter, I fully support any legal method of helping lower the population of feral hogs. Hunting and trapping are two of the best solutions. I've hunted wild hogs in the swamplands of Florida. I've even hunted hogs in Texas at night. The only problem I see in hunting hogs is there are not enough hunters. Pigs are smart and typically more active at night. Hunting pigs is not as easy as one might think. And while hunting and trapping these destructive creatures can be very successful, hunters and trappers simply can't keep up with the population. Now the thought probably crossed your mind: How about we eat them? Sure, these pigs will never win any beauty pageant but they are wonderful table fare. Butchered into bacon strips and pork chops or barbecued on the spit, they are simply delicious. In my opinion, wild hog meat is just as tasty as common, domesticated pig. In fact, trapped hogs in Texas are often sold to independent buyers who sell these swines overseas to Asian markets. But in order to get them to the dining table we still need to knock them down first. Personally, I have witnessed the devastation on several visits to Texas while interviewing ranchers and wildlife officials. The severity of the situation hit home after I met a woman who demolished her pickup truck after it collided with a 300-pound boar. The southern states are the ones most affected by the wild hogs but that won't be the case for long as their population grows. It's obvious this is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. In the theatrical release of this summer's blockbuster hit ""World War Z"" Brad Pitt figured out how to save humanity from a virus. Texas could be in a world of hurt because of their pig population if they don't prepare for ""World War P.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Glastonbury festival held in Somerset, England every year is the world's biggest open air arts and music festival. A fan gets into the spirit of the Glastonbury music festival. It attracts around 140,000 music fans who spend between three and five days camping and listening to hundreds of musicians on Worthy Farm. The festival is famed for its mud-fueled mayhem and heavy rain. However, this year revelers managed to escape from the downpours with plenty of sunshine blazing, but with the occasional rain. Among the highlights this year were the newly reformed Brit-pop band Blur, 'The Boss', Bruce Springsteen, dance queen Lady Gaga and The Prodigy among many others. Past performers include rapper Jay-Z, David Bowie, Rod Stewart, Paul McCartney and Shirley Bassey. The festival was started by farmer Michael Eavis in 1970, the day after Jimi Hendrix died. Around 1500 people attended, paying less than two dollars in entry fees including free milk from the farm. Today tickets cost around $240. Each year many of the festival goers stay on an extra day to help volunteer in the cleaning up process which will see more than 1600 tonnes of rubbish removed from the site over the next three weeks. After the clear up, the site will return to a working dairy farm until next May when preparations for Glastonbury 2010 will begin.","The first Glastonbury Festival was held the day after Jimi Hendrix died in 1970.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Marine reservist Sgt. Andrew Paul Tahmooressi is enjoying his first day home Saturday in Miami, freed from a seven-month detention in Mexico in a weapons case that he claimed grew merely from his taking a wrong turn. His jailing drew widespread attention because he and his mother made an emotional plea for his release, echoed by such public figures as former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and television host Montel Williams, both of whom pressured Mexican officials on Tahmooressi's behalf. The Marine who served in Afghanistan said he was being wrongly prosecuted and was suffering post-traumatic stress disorder. ""I think he's thrilled,"" family spokesman Jonathan Franks told CNN on Saturday morning. ""It's setting in. They need a little bit of time to reconnect as a family,"" Franks said. A big, long hug . Tahmooressi boarded a flight from San Diego late Friday, shortly after his release. ""It is with an overwhelming and humbling feeling of relief that we confirm that Andrew was released today after spending 214 days in Mexican jail,"" his relatives said in a statement. It was an emotional reunion with ""big smiles"" and a big, lengthy hug between Tahmooressi and his mother when they saw each other Friday evening. ""Without question, it was one of the most powerful experiences of my life,"" Franks said, who was present for the mother-son reunion. ""Everybody was very excited."" ""These are people who guided by deep faith, and they're grateful. I'm not sure how much more eloquently you can put it,"" Franks said. Tahmooressi is in good physical condition, Franks said. ""Obviously he hasn't spent a lot of time outside. He hasn't had much access to a gym as he had in his prior life, but he looks great,"" Franks said. The Marine doesn't bear any ""ill will"" toward Mexico, Franks added. Making 'the right choice' Tahmooressi and his mother weren't making public comments Saturday. ""After a while, he will speak for himself,"" Franks said. ""I think it's going to be several days, some time next week."" Richardson said he was among those who pressed for Tahmooressi's release, and he visited the former Marine at Mexico's El Hongo federal prison last week. ""I think the Mexican judge made the right choice ... because of PTSD, on humanitarian grounds, (that) he should be released,"" Richardson told CNN on Saturday morning. ""He's a good young man,"" Richardson said. ""He served two tours in Afghanistan. He's suffered enough."" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said many U.S. officials and some Congress members worked through the Mexican legal process on behalf of Tahmooressi. ""We are pleased Mexican judicial authorities ordered Sgt. Tahmooressi released on October 31,"" Psaki said. Mexican Embassy: Respecting the law . Mexican officials said ""the legal process was carried out in strict accordance with the applicable legal framework and with full respect for the rights and guarantees of the U.S. citizen,"" the Mexican Embassy said in a statement. ""During the time of his detention, he received medical care and (accommodations) were made for him to receive personal visits,"" the embassy said. ""The Government of Mexico reiterates its commitment to fully respect the rule of law as well as the human rights of all those within its jurisdiction. That includes the right of foreign citizens to consular notification and access, as well as guarantees of due process."" Tahmooressi was held on weapons charges after his arrest March 31 at a checkpoint in Tijuana, Mexico. At the time, Mexican customs agents found three firearms in his truck, including a .45-caliber pistol, a pump shotgun and an AR-15 rifle. Mexico has strict federal laws on bringing weapons into the country. Since his arrest, Tahmooressi has maintained that he took a wrong turn on the California side of the border and accidentally crossed into Tijuana. The Mexican court said it found no cause to prosecute him on charges of carrying two firearms used exclusively by the military, possessing cartridges used exclusively by the military and carrying a firearm without a license . It also recommended he be treated for post-traumatic stress disorder. Some Mexicans' criticism . Some Mexican nationals, however, criticized Tahmooressi and said it was no accident he was caught with guns in Mexico. Fernando Benitez, an attorney for Tahmooressi, acknowledged how ""in any country there will be some very specific sectors of society that will be a little extreme in their views."" ""Mexico's not an exception,"" Benitez told CNN. ""However, most people that really got to know the workings of the case agreed that this young man has to come back home."" If the case went to trial, Benitez felt Tahmooressi would have won, the attorney said. ""You know, it was a complicated case, but it wasn't -- never felt we couldn't win it,"" Benitez said. On Monday, Benitez will try to reclaim the Marine's truck and weapons, said the lawyer who's based in Tijuana, Mexico. Mother pleaded for release . In May, his mother said he served with the Marines in Afghanistan, and had moved to the San Ysidro, California, area to get treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. ""He has unresolved, or untreated PTSD, and he cannot get the cognitive therapy behavior that veterans of America receive ... in a Mexico jail, where there is no such thing,"" Jill Tahmooressi said earlier this year. Paul Tahmooressi has described a suicide attempt by his son with a shattered light bulb after being punched, slapped, cursed at, deprived of water and food, and shackled to a bed with a four-point restraint. Conditions improved after media coverage of his plight, he said. Mexican prison authorities have denied the abuse allegations. CNN's Joe Sutton and Fidel Gutierrez contributed to this report.","NEW: Marine would have won case if it went to judgment, his attorney says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. has checked out of the Mayo Clinic, where he was being treated for bipolar depression, and is now back in Washington with his family, his chief of staff said Friday. The 47-year-old Jackson had not been on Capitol Hill since late May. His office said in early June that he was suffering from a ""medical condition,"" and -- after two other updates -- last month the Mayo Clinic released a statement indicating that Jackson was being treated for bipolar depression. Rick Bryant, the chief of staff in Jackson's congressional office, said the Illinois Democrat left the prestigious Minnesota medical facility and is back in the nation's capital. Jackson suffered from 'deep, deep depression' Asked whether Jackson will return to work when Congress returns from recess on Monday, Bryant said, ""We hope."" The congressman's father -- the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a well-known civil rights leader -- told The Huffington Post last month that when he visited his son in Washington in June, he learned the junior Jackson hadn't slept for three days. What the family thought was exhaustion, the elder Jackson said, was ""something much deeper, much broader, and it lasted longer."" The congressman's wife, Sandi, told the Chicago Sun-Times in August that her husband had his ""good days and bad days,"" with doctors at the Mayo Clinic increasing his depression medication to ""therapeutic levels."" She firmly denied that her husband attempted suicide or was getting help for alcohol and drug addiction. Jackson's illness comes as the House Ethics Committee is examining allegations that, in 2008, he or one of his associates offered to raise money for then-Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich in exchange for Jackson being appointed to the Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama after he was elected president. The congressman has maintained his innocence and pledged to continue to cooperate with authorities. As for Blagojevich, he was convicted last year on corruption charges in connection with efforts to profit from appointing the successor to the Senate seat. A day after visiting Jackson at the Mayo Clinic last month, longtime friend and former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy said he suspected that ""stress in (Jackson's) life, particularly because he's under investigation,"" may have set off his depression. Kennedy struggled with addiction and bipolar disorder and is a mental health advocate. ""Many of us have genetic predisposition to cancer, heart disease or, in this case, mental illness, but they often get triggered by environmental factors,"" said Kennedy, the son of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy. ""In mental illness, stress is an environmental factor and clearly, I think, has been a factor in his succumbing to this outbreak of his bipolar disorder."" Bipolar disorder is a treatable condition that affects parts of the brain controlling emotion, thought and drive, the Mayo Clinic says. Many Americans suffer from it, and it is most likely caused by a complex set of genetic and environmental factors, it says. Medical experts are still weighing whether gastric bypass surgery that Jackson underwent in 2004 for weight loss might have helped trigger his depression, his wife said. The Mayo Clinic said that type of surgery is increasingly common in the United States and can change how the body absorbs food, vitamins, nutrients and medications. What do we know about mood disorders?","Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. was last seen on Capitol Hill in late May .

"(CNN)  -- The girlfriend of former NFL star Steve McNair first shot him in his right temple, then fired three more shots at close range, most likely as he slept, police said Wednesday. Steve McNair, 36, spent 13 seasons in the NFL, the majority with the Tennessee Titans. She then sat on the couch next to his body, and killed herself so that she would fall into his lap, they said. ""The totality of the evidence clearly points to a murder-suicide,"" Nashville, Tennessee, Police Chief Ronal Serpas told reporters at an afternoon news conference. McNair, 36, and Sahel Kazemi, 20, were found fatally shot in a condominium in downtown Nashville on Saturday afternoon, authorities said. ""McNair was seated on the sofa and likely was asleep, and we believe that Kazemi shot him in the right temple, then shot him twice in the chest, and then shot him a final time in the left temple,"" Serpas said.  Watch police chief describe murder-suicide » . ""Kazemi then positioned herself next to McNair on the sofa and shot herself once in the right temple and expired. ... We do believe she tried to stage that when she killed herself, she would fall in his lap."" A trace of gunshot residue was found on her left hand, he said. Kazemi used a 9 mm handgun, Serpas said. McNair was married and had four children. Serpas said he had spoken with McNair's wife Wednesday to update her on the investigation. The police chief said Kazemi had become rattled over the last week, believing that McNair was involved with another woman. ""She had become very distraught and on two occasions told friends and associates that her life was all messed up and that she was going to end it all,"" Serpas said. He said Kazemi had seen another person leave the condo a few days before and was concerned ""whether or not her relationship was unraveling with Mr. McNair."" ""There was evidence that she was spinning out of control,"" Serpas said. He added that there was no evidence found at the condo indicating anyone else was there at the time of the deaths, which is believed to be after 1 a.m. Saturday. Dr. Feng Li, the assistant medical examiner who has been handling the case, told CNN earlier Wednesday that all evidence was ""indicating that she killed Mr. McNair and killed herself."" ""It's almost an assured thing. We have to be convinced otherwise,"" Li said.  See McNair's football bio » . The coroner said he will not finalize the ""manner of death"" on Kazemi's death certificate until he has final lab test results, which are a few days away. ""I have to have everything together, and then I make the opinion,"" he said. ""We want to be as thorough and as detailed as possible."" Li said Kazemi was found face-down in the condo with the gun underneath her. The autopsy indicates she shot herself once through her right temple. ""She was found on the feet of Mr. McNair, who sat on the sofa,"" he said. ""It's very hard for everybody involved,"" Li said. ""Our thoughts and prayers go to the families."" Earlier in the week, police said that on Thursday evening, Kazemi purchased the pistol found at the scene. Hours before the purchase, Kazemi was pulled over in a traffic stop and charged with driving under the influence. She was accompanied by McNair in a Cadillac Escalade he had purchased for her. McNair was allowed to leave the scene in a taxi after Kazemi was given a field sobriety test. On Friday night, Kazemi who worked as a waitress told a co-worker ""that she was thinking about ending it,"" Serpas said. Police found their bodies in the condo -- leased to McNair and his friend Wayne Neeley -- about 1:30 p.m. Saturday. The two had been dead for hours before Neeley, who had to use a key to enter the building, discovered the clothed bodies Saturday afternoon, according to police. Neeley then called his friend Robert Gaddy, who arrived at the condo and called police. Serpas said it is unusual for such a time gap, but ""not unheard of."" He said police do not believe the crime scene was tampered. McNair spent 13 seasons in the NFL, mostly with the Tennessee Titans, where he excelled on the field as quarterback. He was named the NFL's co-MVP in 2003 and spent his last two seasons with the Baltimore Ravens before announcing his retirement in April 2008. The Titans reached the Super Bowl in 2000, losing to the St. Louis Rams. McNair led the Titans in a dramatic comeback that day, with a final tying touchdown coming up a yard short. ""Any death is tragic,"" the Nashville police chief said, ""and the deaths we're talking about today are tragic to the families of all involved and tragic to our community.""","""The totality of the evidence clearly points to a murder-suicide,"" chief says .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of people are opting out of flying for Thanksgiving this year, but passengers who do book plane tickets for the holiday will still see jam-packed flights, the trade group that represents major U.S. airlines said Thursday. About 23.2 million travelers will fly during a 12-day period surrounding Turkey Day, a 2% drop from last year, according to a forecast by the Air Transport Association of America. Even though that translates to 37,000 fewer people flying per day over the holiday period, airlines are reducing capacity and limiting the number of seats available for sale to match the lower demand. Share your favorite holiday vacation spots . ""For the busiest holidays, it's always good counsel to book early and book often,"" said John Heimlich, vice president and chief economist for the association. ""Based on published airline schedules, these cuts are expected to continue through the winter."" The busiest air travel days for the Thanksgiving holiday period are expected to be Sunday, November 27, Monday, November 28, and Friday, November 18, the association said. The least traveled day is expected to be Thanksgiving Day itself, or November 24, Heimlich said. Experts advise flying on the holiday to avoid the worst crowds at the airport and in the sky. 5 tips for booking Thanksgiving flights . Heimlich attributed the overall drop in demand for airline seats to high unemployment, a drop in disposable income and high energy prices. Commenting on the overall state of the airline industry, the association warned that 2011 is shaping up to be worse financially than last year for the airlines, with higher costs outpacing higher revenues. Fuel was the largest driver of expenses, rising 38% for the first nine months of this year. Razor-thin margins mean carriers are able to keep less than a penny in profit for every dollar of revenue, Heimlich said. ""Given these facts and the commercial situation, it's not surprising that as the year has gone by we've seen a trend toward reduction of seating capacity.""","37,000 fewer people per day are expected to fly during the holiday .

"(CNN) -- Four young women died after a tractor-trailer crashed into a bus carrying members of a college women's softball team late Friday in southern Oklahoma, a law enforcement spokesman said. The bus, which belonged to North Central Texas College, was transporting its softball team back from a game, the school said. It was carrying 15 female students and one male coach. ""The semi departed the roadway to the left and traveled into the median and crossed the median, entering the southbound lane where it impacted the bus,"" said Oklahoma Highway Patrol Cpt.

The National Transportation and Safety Board was sending a team to investigate the accident, which occurred on Interstate 35 in the Arbuckle Mountains near Davis, about 60 miles from the main campus of NCTC and an hour south of Oklahoma City. Eleven students were taken to the hospital, as well as the driver of the tractor-trailer, Hampton said. Two of the injured were flown by air ambulance to the Oklahoma University Medical Center in Oklahoma City. Earlier, the highway patrol had reported that two semis were involved in the accident but later revised that to one truck. NCTC is a two-year school in north Texas.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- As diplomats in Beijing discuss reopening the investigation into a string of unsolved kidnappings of Japanese citizens by North Korea, the families of those abducted anxiously wait and hope. For years, they've been seeking answers in the mysterious disappearance of their loved ones. The bulk of the abductions took place nearly four decades ago and the families of those taken have endured the agony of uncertainty, never knowing what truly transpired. With talks between Tokyo and Pyongyang that took place on Tuesday in the Chinese capital, those left behind to wonder what happened to their disappeared relatives are hopeful that they will finally get some answers. Spate of abductions . According to the Japanese government, North Korean operatives kidnapped at least 17 Japanese citizens in the late 1970's and early 1980's, possibly dozens more. Some were kidnapped alone, while walking to and from school. Others were taken in pairs while out on dates, including a couple snatched from the beach after walking to see the sunset. In 2002, North Korea admitted to the kidnappings for the first time but allowed only five abduction victims to return home to Japan. Information on the remaining 12 was sketchy at best. One victim's story . One of those still missing is Yaeko Taguchi, who disappeared from Tokyo on June 12, 1978. The 22-year-old divorced single mother was working nights as a hostess at Tokyo's Cabaret Hollywood, which remains open 36 years later. ""When (Taguchi) disappeared, we thought she just quit and left,"" says general manager Sueji Kikuchi, who has worked there for over 50 years. ""Things like that happened a lot so we never would have thought that she had been abducted."" At the time, Kikuchi didn't know that North Korean operatives were canvassing the cabaret, a fact police later disclosed to Taguchi's older brother, Shigeo Iizuka. Ideal candidate . ""At the time, North Korea had a specific agenda, (and) abducted people that would further this agenda,"" Iizuka said. ""Yaeko was thought to have known everything that was needed to know about being a Japanese woman; she had experienced marriage and childbirth, and knew about cosmetics and feminine magazines and other trends at the time. At the time, being 22 years old, she had been singled out."" Iizuka didn't know the truth about his sister's abduction for nearly a decade. He and his wife adopted her son, Kouichi, and told him they were his real parents. They never mentioned Taguchi. Her daughter was adopted by another couple, and has never spoken publicly about the situation. ""I promised myself when her son turned twenty, I would tell him the truth,"" Iizuka says. Secret revealed . But in 1987, the bombing of a Korean airliner revealed the truth. 115 people died when Korean Air Flight 858 exploded in mid-air, and a North Korean spy, Kim Hyun-Hui, was arrested. She confessed to planting a bomb on the plane, and also revealed the biggest clue yet in Taguchi's disappearance. ""After the bombing, (Kim) testified that she was trained by a Japanese woman,"" Iizuka says. ""Police thoroughly investigated and found her teacher was my sister."" It was later revealed that North Korean agents abducted Taguchi and took her to North Korea by boat. ""I feel anger and hate I can't put into words,"" Iizuka says. ""Why would she be taken (to North Korea)? She was a hard-working single mother who never did anything wrong."" The Japanese government says North Korea claims Taguchi died in a car accident in 1986, but hasn't provided proof, according to her son. Alive or dead? ""The evidence given by North Korea was questionable,"" the younger Iizuka says. ""There is no clear proof that she's dead. There were no names on the documents submitted. ""There is no clear, accurate proof. North Korea said that she passed away on June 29th, 1986 but there are witnesses that say that she's still alive."" He believes his mother is still alive and is hopeful renewed talks in Beijing between Japan and North Korea could bring answers about his mother. But he fears the North Koreans won't be truthful and won't allow his mother to leave, because she knows too much about the secret training of North Korean spies. 'I just want to come home' Former abductees told Taguchi's brother and son she's still alive and they say she begged to go home, often weeping for her children. ""I just want her to come home to Japan as soon as possible,"" her son says. ""I haven't seen her since I was born. I only have an image in my head."" CNN has contacted North Korean embassies and missions in nine countries, but has never received responses to inquiries. North Korea has promised to look into the kidnapping issue before before failing to follow through, most recently in 2008.

"Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- Negative, expensive campaigns is something Sen. Kay Hagan is getting an education in this year. And something Hillary Clinton knows very well. Clinton campaigned Saturday for her fellow Democrat at a Charlotte rally of about 1,800 supporter. The former U.S. senator and secretary of state -- and widely presumed 2016 presidential contender -- used her appearance for Hagan to decry Thom Tillis, the Republican looking to unseat Hagan in November, as someone who will answer to big business, not raise the minimum wage and slash education funding. And unlike other appearances Clinton has made on the midterm campaign trail, the former first lady spent a portion of her speech Saturday decrying the level of outside spending in the Hagan-Tillis race. ""Elections come down often to who has got more money, who is pedaling more fear and who turns out,"" Clinton told an excited crowd. The former first lady later criticized the ""onslaught of out of state money and negativity that is coming in against"" Hagan. ""You have to prove them wrong,"" Clinton urged the crowd. Prove to them ""that no matter how much money has flooded into this state, North Carolina is not for sale"" -- the latter phrase having a mantra for Hagan supporters. There is a reason Clinton focused on this: The North Carolina Senate race is by far the most expensive in the country this year. So far, campaigns and outside groups have spent close to $80 million in the state. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Tillis has had $44 million of outside money spent on his behalf. Hagan has had $22 million. Tillis is backed by groups like Americans For Prosperity, Crossroads GPS and the Chamber of Commerce. Hagan has been supported by Senate Majority PAC, the National Education Association and AFSCME, a labor organization. The onslaught of spending likely won't stop soon, either. A spokesman for Hagan said he sees the total spent in the campaign jumping to over $100 million in the last 10 days of campaign. What key Senate race means for 2016 . This level of spending is something Clinton understands personally: According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Clinton's New York Senate race in 2000, which cost over $100 million, is the most expensive race ever (in 2014 dollar terms). Clinton did her part on Saturday to make sure that Hagan had enough money in the final days of the campaign. Before her speech -- which was free for those who attended -- the former first lady took part in a fundraising reception and photo line for the Hagan campaign. Organizers would not say how much that event raised, but pointed out that it was also used as a reward for active volunteers. Hagan, too, belied the amount of outside spending in the race, even though she is benefiting from some. She criticized ""out-of-state billionaires"" who are ""trying to buy this election."" ""I want you to help send a message loud and clear to my opponent and his special interest allies,"" Hagan said. ""I want it to be so loud that the Koch Brothers and Karl Rove, wherever they are, because we know they aren't in North Carolina, we want to tell them that North Carolina is not for sale."" What the outside spending has meant is near constant negative ads on televisions across the state. At a focus group of ten North Carolina moms earlier this week, the negative ads were one of many reasons that the women said they were tuning out the Hagan-Tillis race. ""All I get from all of those is don't vote for that person, because they are a bad person, vote for me,"" said one woman. ""Everything we are teaching your kids is ridiculous,"" said another, reflecting on the ads. ""We teach our kids not to bully and that is all they are doing.""","Hillary Clinton decries outside money in campaigns at an appearance in North Carolina .

"(CNN) -- Coaches at state universities in Maryland have a new financial incentive to make sure their players perform in the classroom as well as on the field . On Friday, the board of regents for the University System of Maryland voted to withhold bonuses from Division One coaches if fewer than half of their team players are on track to graduate. It does not apply to coaches who already have contracts. ""The concept is that based upon that current year, if the team fails academically, they can't get their bonus,"" says board member Tom McMillen, a former basketball player and former U.S. representative. He's been pushing for this since 2013, when he reviewed about 50 collegiate coaching contracts and found that only one, the University of Connecticut, tied academics to bonuses. UConn had just emerged from an NCAA post-season ban because so few athletes were on track to graduate. But McMillen said the school dropped the provision when then-basketball head coach Jim Calhoun was replaced by Kevin Ollie. CNN couldn't reach UConn for comment. ""We felt this would make sense to adopt systemwide,"" McMillen said. ""It was really sort of based on the Connecticut concept. We're not aware of any other system or group of schools that do it."" Four state universities within the Maryland system will be affected: The University of Maryland in College Park, Towson University in Baltimore, Coppin State University in Baltimore and the University of Maryland-Baltimore County. McMillen said the Athletic Department uses an NCAA point system called the APR -- for Academic Progress Rate -- to track each athlete's progress toward graduation. If that number falls below 50% for the team, the NCAA punishes a school with a post-season ban. Maryland will use that same system to withhold coaches' bonuses. ""The schools keep their own APR -- the school knows what the APRs are. They can forecast it even before the season is over. They know based on kids' grades,"" McMillen said. McMillen said he hopes it will force coaches to think before recruiting ""one-and-done"" basketball players who often bring a year of success to a team and then leave for the draft. One-and-done players can hurt the APR score. He also says this additional oversight is important in light of the revelations at the University of North Carolina, where it was revealed last week that rampant academic fraud existed for nearly 20 years. ""The lesson from North Carolina ... it's very troublesome that they would not know what's going on,"" McMillen said. ""All these coaches and (athletic directors) to not know what's going on is pretty surprising. ... So much lack of oversight. Maryland is saying, wait a minute, there's going to be a lot of oversight here. Oversight is the name of the game.""","At four state universities in Maryland, bonuses for coaches will be on the line .

"(CNN) -- The rapid evolution of mobile technology has placed quite a burden on our brains. Nowadays, attention to even the most pressing of matters can be interrupted at any moment by a familiar buzzing in the pocket -- a friendly nudge to ""pay attention to me!"" that many find virtually impossible to resist, even while driving on busy roads. These frequent and unplanned interruptions, coupled with growing expectations for immediate responses, challenge our cognitive control system at its very core. Cognitive control is our ability to focus on accomplishing a task in the context of competing demands. This increasingly taxed ability is what has allowed humans to achieve remarkable feats, such as developing languages and building complex societies. Special series: Our mobile society . Although data are still lacking on the direct impact of mobile technology on cognition, there is extensive evidence showing that our brains are exquisitely sensitive to external interference by both irrelevant distractions and multitasking. This ""noise in the system"" erodes our performance on a wide spectrum of cognitive activities, including the ability to recall details in our lives. In other words, an overload of ""noise"" can wear down our memory. For example, we found that a simple task that intervenes while you are holding a piece of information will degrade your ability to remember it. This is because the memory network in your brain that is responsible for remembering is disrupted by the interrupting task and has to be reactivated. This is why we often consider multitasking a myth, and feel it is more accurate to think of it as rapid task switching. Likewise, we found in another experiment that even having your eyes and ears open and exposed to normal visual and auditory environmental stimuli can diminish the details of visual memories when you try to recall them. The negative impact is greater for those with undeveloped or impaired cognitive control, such as children and older adults, and is exacerbated by the presence of neurological or psychiatric conditions like ADHD or Alzheimer's disease. There is no doubt that we have to be careful about the influence of unending streams of interference on our minds. We should make more informed decisions about how best to interact with the technologies in our environment. When we are engaged in something that requires high-quality attention, especially if it is time sensitive, we should attempt to conduct ourselves in a manner that is most appropriate for how our brains function: in focus mode. Just because all of this marvelous technology exists does not mean that we have to use it all at the same time. We are not slaves to it, obliged to respond whenever it calls. Turning off mobile notifications and making an effort to use only one high-tech device at a time is a way to stretch our cognitive resources. While this is not always feasible, we should be mindful to do so. Despite all the very real concerns, mobile technology can be harnessed to improve our minds. There are ongoing efforts by cognitive science laboratories and companies to develop cognitive assessment and brain training software that will function on mobile phones and tablets. This field is still in its infancy, but early signs are encouraging. For example, one day we might be able to design apps that allow people to probe their own cognitive abilities (processing speed, memory, decision-making, etc.) at any time during the day and track these abilities over the years, transmitting the results from their smartphones to a health care provider if desired. This real-time data will be more powerful than what we currently obtain by using questionnaires and cognitive snapshots during stressful visits to the doctor's office. Over time, with growing databases across the population, you can compare yourself to any of your cohorts. Such tools that measure our biological signals can help advance our understanding of our bodies and aid doctors and scientists in their efforts to combat illness and diseases. In addition, we might be able to play immersive apps that incorporate the best video game mechanics into brain training programs to enhance cognition, perhaps allowing people to correct neural deficiencies and even delay the development of dementia. Of course, this potential needs to balance against any unforeseen negative effects. For now, it's exciting to speculate on the promises of what mobile technology can offer.

"(CNN) -- In this election season, Republicans and Democrats have been touting the importance of family and hard work that make America a land of opportunity. Mitt Romney has talked about his father's love and rise from odd-job laborer to successful businessman. President Barack Obama has spoken of how his grandparents worked industriously to go to college, buy a house and raise their children. While triumphant stories of middle-class families make for good campaign speeches, the truth is far less heartening. America's policies to support workers and families are worse than any other country in the developed world and hardly better than some in the developing world. Take, for example, family leave policies. Until 1993, Americans had no guaranteed leave time from work whatsoever. If you needed to take time off to care for a dying family member, there was not much you could have done to stop employers from firing you. With the passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), Americans were guaranteed 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year. However, because it is unpaid, workers who do not have sufficient income cannot take advantage of the leave. Opinion: The true difference between Obama, Romney . In addition, the law only applies to workers who have been with a current employer for more than a year and who work at companies with more than 50 employees. Even if workers could afford it, fewer than half of those without a high school education are covered and eligible to take unpaid leave. Likewise, when it comes to policies affecting new parents, America has no federal law mandating paid maternity leave. There are only a handful of other countries that also do not guarantee new mothers paid leave, the wealthiest of which is Papua New Guinea. In 2011, Papua New Guinea had a GDP of nearly $13 billion, while the United States had a GDP of $15 trillion. Our GDP is more than 1,000 times that of the next richest country with no federal paid maternity leave. No wonder some believe that the U.S. has ""the most family-hostile public policy"" in the developed world. We fall short of our status as an advanced nation in other ways, too, like in the amount of vacation time that employers are legally required to give to employees every year. Nearly 160 countries offer paid vacation days to workers, with many countries providing two weeks or more. The U.S. offers none. What about sick days? Again, we are far behind numerous other countries. The U.S. government does not mandate any minimum amount of paid sick leave for workers. This puts us alone among similar advanced nations. We have only unpaid sick leave for those covered under FMLA protections, and then it's up to individual companies to determine their own polices toward sick leave. In our capitalist society, the task of providing necessary worker protections and family support has largely been left out of the hands of the government. Benevolent employers took it upon themselves to provide benefits to workers. But this model of ""welfare capitalism"" has greatly diminished in recent years. It's time for our government to re-evaluate its inaction. Today, the family structure is changing rapidly in our country. More than 70% of women with children younger than 18 are in the work force. More and more, both parents have to work full time to support a middle-class family. Traditional models of balancing work and family commitments are badly out of date. Opinion: Republicans rick being the party of mean . America has always been proud of its tradition of -- and belief in -- limited interference in the private sector. But our labor policies, especially as they apply to working families, are in dire need of updates. While the lack of federal work-family policies might be cheap and convenient for employers, there is no way that it's any good for families in the 21st century. Instead of just talking about helping families, politicians need to implement family-oriented policies to help working mothers and fathers, and those who need to take more than a few days off to help care for a sick child. Whoever gets elected in November needs to take a hard look at the facts. Our federal family policies certainly make America unique -- but not in the way we want. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Josh Freedman.","Republicans and Democrats say that family and hard work are critical .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Despite attempts by the authorities to censor coverage, millions of people across mainland China have watched warily over the past few days as thousands of Hong Kongers have occupied the heart of their city calling for greater democracy. For many the verve and passion of this student-led revolt has been captivating to witness. But others are less impressed. ""I think the 'Occupy Central' movement is the Hong Kong version of so-called street politics and color revolutions we've seen in other countries,"" Chen Zuo'er, who helped facilitate the handover of Hong Kong to China from Britain, told CNN Wednesday, as China marked National Day -- the foundation of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949. ""It's very dangerous. It's an obviously illegal movement."" Chen says the protest is bad for Hong Kong's reputation. ""It has caused great harm to Hong Kong in the past few days. Democracy and the rule of law are the pillars of economic prosperity and social stability in Hong Kong. 'Occupy Central' has attacked both pillars,"" he said. Illegal demonstration . China itself has labeled the demonstrations ""illegal."" Some analysts claim the protests have been the most significant since the former colony's handover from Britain to China in 1997. But not everyone in China knows about the occupation of Hong Kong's central districts -- the beating heart of this Asian financial hub. Beijing's censors have been blocking reports, including CNN's, in the mainstream and social media. But those who know, like Chen, are watching warily, worried that any clashes or incidents between protesters and police -- as we witnessed on Sunday when the authorities resorted to using tear gas -- could lead to bloodshed or trigger a harsh crackdown. Chen was posted to the city in 1994 as a member of the preparatory committee for the formation of Hong Kong as a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China. He was China's point-person in the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG), in charge of negotiating with British side over the 1997 handover of power. He now heads the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, a think-tank based in Beijing. 'Gullible' protesters . While Chen praised the passion of the young protesters, he questioned whether they'd been misled. ""The passion of Hong Kong's young people is commendable -- they care about current affairs and politics, care about the future of Hong Kong and China,"" he said. ""But they tend to be gullible and excitable as their class boycott and peaceful sit-in became 'Occupy Central.'"" Chen accused ""some people"" of manipulating the protest movement. ""Some adults -- I mean those with beards and wrinkles -- suddenly show up in front of the youth to tell them what to do, what not to do, what should be done, what should be their goal,"" he said. ""We're all shocked. As I've read in Hong Kong media, those adults -- would they let their own children lie on the streets? What are they doing after receiving illegal funding? These are the questions posed by Hong Kong people online that I've read."" Chen declined to give specifics, simply saying ""just read what is out there in the Hong Kong media."" Chinese crackdown . Would China would consider sending People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops on to the streets of Hong Kong if the protest persists for a long time? ""The past few days the central government has already stated many times,"" he answered tangentially. ""We believe that the Hong Kong SAR government has the ability to handle well the illegal acts of the Occupation Central. We fully believe so."" The retired vice minister insisted that China's decision to allow ""universal suffrage"" in the 2017 election is already a significant progress towards democracy. ""If you study the decision by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, you will find it comparable to universal suffrage in many other countries during various periods of time. It's one person, one vote and every vote counts the same. It takes some Western countries 200 years to achieve. But after resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong, it took China only 20 years to achieve this in the Chief Executive election,"" he said. But many ordinary Hong Kongers insist they want full universal suffrage, rejecting Beijing's decision to allow only Beijing-vetted candidates to run for the 2017 election for chief executive. Will China be open to changing the elections system in the future to make it freer? ""I'm not a prophet,"" he replied. ""I think Hong Kong's political system will become fairer, more democratic and more open. ""One country, two systems"" is a fundamental national policy. No matter how 'Occupy Central' becomes, it won't change shake this policy. I believe it will be thoroughly implemented into the future."" Meantime, Chen sees no room for China to back down from its stated position. ""I know the plotters of Occupy Central,"" he said. ""They launched this illegal action with the central government as its target. They demand that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress will rescind its decision on universal suffrage. However, I think that is futile. Impossible."" Many political observers have compared Occupy Central to Tiananmen in 1989, when the Chinese army brutally crushed the six-week-long protest in central Beijing. What is Chen's take? ""They are not comparable,"" was his only reply.","Protests ""a very dangerous, obviously illegal movement,"" says Chen Zuo'er .

"(CNN) -- Securing the release of American prisoners Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller from North Korea was not cost-free. It may also be an omen of the return of recurring efforts by U.S. administrations of both parties to negotiate deals with Pyongyang that inevitably fail. The United States supposedly does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea. After all, the arms proliferating, dollar counterfeiting, nuclear-armed dictatorship, which torpedoed a South Korean ship in 2010, hasn't accounted for all of the foreign nationals it kidnapped abroad to train its spies, and occasionally threatens America and its allies with annihilation. But that hasn't stopped a string of senior U.S. diplomats from visiting Pyongyang over the past three administrations. The most recent denizen was U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who on Saturday brought home the two Americans imprisoned by the regime for alleged speech and faith-related activities that wouldn't get a second look in the civilized world. While Clapper's trip may have been ""last-minute,"" as the Obama administration described it, the efforts to arrange it probably went on for months -- and are emblematic of an unfortunate approach to North Korea and its Chinese allies that spans Republican and Democratic administrations -- especially in their final years. Washington and Pyongyang both have agendas beyond what is visible today. Is North Korea being magnanimous in releasing Bae and Miller before their trumped-up prison sentences ran out, or might it want something in return? In fact, it has already acquired something: the appearance of legitimacy. The autocrats who maintain North Korea's totalitarian rule through fear -- and the young leader, Kim Jong Un, who even had his uncle executed -- relish any opportunity to show how they can make representatives of vastly more powerful nations come to Pyongyang and kiss their proverbial ring. Previous visitors in this vein have included then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, former President Jimmy Carter, former Vice President Al Gore, and various representatives of then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The North Korean government knows more about the U.S. political cycle than many American political scientists. It saw that the final two years of the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations were fruitful for dealing with presidents and secretaries of state desperately trying to burnish their legacies. Under President Clinton, aid to North Korea from Washington and Seoul spiked beginning in 1999, and included efforts to build nuclear power plants for the North Koreans. Under President Bush, Rice announced in 2007 a breakthrough whereby Pyongyang would give up its nuclear program in exchange for aid. As some predicted, North Korea took the aid but kept the nuclear program. It now likely hopes for a repeat of sorts. North Korea no longer depends on foreign handouts for its survival. By some accounts, its economy is better off than ever, thanks to expanded trade with China -- much of which is supposedly banned by U.N. resolutions. But Pyongyang would still welcome further sanctions relief and loves to be courted diplomatically, which makes it look strong. Courtship of North Korea also invariably involves obeisance to the notion that China will pressure its neighbor into behaving -- and perhaps even surrendering its nuclear weapons program. This is a diplomatic truism that just isn't true: Beijing has always normalized trade with North Korea rapidly after any disruptions in the wake of North Korean nuclear tests or other belligerent acts. But it seems only Pyongyang and Beijing are in on this joke played on American and allied diplomats -- and China's unelected government itself cherishes the legitimacy it gets from being seen as the regional diplomatic linchpin. That is why Beijing has also been promoting multilateral talks with North Korea. The way out of this is to stop believing that romancing Pyongyang will advance U.S. interests. North Korea has violated numerous arms agreements with the United States or other parties. Pyongyang will not be sweet-talked out of its nuclear arsenal or other provocations. Washington can end the cycle of North Korea taking Americans hostage by declaring U.S. passports invalid for travel to North Korea. Furthermore, the United States and its allies should pivot to a program of putting nonviolent pressure on the North Korean regime. Washington should tell the truth about China's support of Pyongyang, increase aid to defectors who try to pierce the curtain of censorship that keeps North Koreans in the dark and punish any company or bank that does business with the regime. Putting the United States at the same table as lawless thugs isn't just morally repugnant -- it's ineffective. The free world should devote more effort to a better form of diplomacy that makes life difficult for its opponents.","Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller released by North Korea .
Agreement may be sign of more deals to come, says Christian Whiton .

"(CNN) -- In the painkiller world, oxycodone and naloxone seem like strange bedfellows. Oxycodone is a powerful painkiller, while naloxone is used to reverse painkiller overdose. On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration approved a drug combining the two, called Targiniq ER. The drug's maker, Purdue Pharma, said the combination is intended to ""alleviate pain while also introducing a new method by which to help deter misuse and abuse."" Oxycodone is one in a group of powerful painkillers -- called opioid analgesics -- that include hydrocodone, morphine and hydromorphone. It provides pain relief by binding to receptors in the brain that dull the sensation of pain. So why marry it with naloxone? Simply put, naloxone can unseat oxycodone on those same brain receptors, blocking its ability to provide pain relief. In the case of Targiniq, it happens only when the pill is crushed. If the pill remains intact, naloxone lies dormant, allowing oxycodone to do its work. Approval of an abuse-deterrent painkiller such as Targiniq would seem welcome, considering the rampant use of the drugs in the United States. The United States consumes 83% of the world's oxycodone and 99% of its hydrocodone, according to a 2010 International Narcotics Control Board report. Forty-six people die each day from prescription painkiller overdoses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. Stephen Anderson, an emergency room physician who sees opioid overdoses on a weekly basis, said Targiniq limits the common abuse delivery routes -- such as crushing, dissolving and injecting pills, or crushing and snorting them. ""Well done to the manufacturer for placing some built-in pharmacological protections,"" said Anderson, past president of the Washington chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians, in an e-mail. ""It won't stop orally ingested overdose deaths, but will limit some of its 'street marketability.' "" And abuse-deterrence seemed to work with another of Purdue Pharma's painkillers, OxyContin: A difficult-to-crush version of the drug was introduced in 2010. ""Before that, OxyContin was the most commonly diverted and abused drug,"" said Caleb Banta-Green, an opioid overdose researcher and former senior science adviser to the Office of National Drug Control Policy. ""After the formulation changed, nobody liked it because they couldn't abuse it."" According to the New England Journal of Medicine, before 2010, OxyContin had been considered a primary drug of abuse for about 36% of people surveyed. Twenty-one months after the introduction of the abuse-deterrence version, only 13% abused it. What impact Targiniq's approval could have on oxycodone abuse remains to be seen. Targiniq's approval ""will better enable the FDA to balance addressing this problem with meeting the needs of the millions of people in this country suffering from pain,"" said Dr. Sharon Hertz, deputy director of the FDA's Division of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Addiction Products, in a statement. The FDA said the drug should be prescribed as a last resort, for patients who have exhausted all other attempts to relieve their pain. Still, experts on addiction said they fear that Targiniq could still be easily abused. ""Naloxone is only active if injected or squirted up the nose,"" said Andrew Kolodny, chief medical officer of the Phoenix House, an alcohol and drug abuse treatment provider. ""That means a patient who chews Targiniq will get the entire dose all at once and the naloxone will have no effect. ""When the pills are swallowed, they are as addictive and dangerous as pure oxycodone."" The concern is that people who abuse or misuse opioids (also called opiates) will simply find another route to a high. ""In a sense it's playing a game of whack-a-mole, because if people are addicted to opiates, they will find an opiate,"" said Banta-Green, who's a senior research scientist at the University of Washington's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute. ""This (drug approval) could and will likely help, but it doesn't fix the inherent problem that people addicted to opiates will continue to use them."" FDA aims to tighten control of hydrocodone .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge has ordered the Obama administration to release 28 videotapes purportedly showing forced feedings and other confinement measures of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay facility in Cuba. Judge Gladys Kessler ruled Friday the tapes can be released with modifications -- such as blurring faces -- to address the government's concerns over identifying guards, uniforms, and written materials on walls. ""Given what is already available to the public and known to the detainees, it simply is not plausible to argue that release of the videos will give rise to an additional probability of harm by encouraging the development of FCE [forced cell extractions] countermeasures,"" Kessler said in the ruling. Lawyers for a Syrian man held at Guantanamo since 2002, whose approved release is still pending, were lobbying for the release of the videos ahead of a hearing scheduled for Monday. Abu Wa'el Dhiab, 43, has been on numerous hunger strikes while in detention. He and his lawyers are seeking a preliminary injunction preventing detention facility officials from forced cell extractions [FCE], and placing him in a so-called restraint chair used for forced feedings. U.S. Navy nurse won't force-feed Guantanamo detainees . The method is designed to provide liquid nutrition and medicine via a tube inserted in the nose directly into the stomach. Several media organizations -- including the Associated Press, NPR, The New York Times and Dow Jones -- had also filed a separate brief urging the release of the tapes, which show forced feedings of Dhiab and others. The Justice Department had expressed concern about national security or other sensitive information being inadvertently revealed in open court and requested a closed hearing, but Kessler strongly dismissed the arguments and denied the request. ""This Court has full faith in the ability of counsel and the court, acting together, to handle in an efficient and appropriate manner, all the classified and protected information,"" Kessler wrote in a Thursday ruling. ""Moreover, a reasonable amount of delay and logistical burdens are a small price to pay for the virtues of judicial transparency."" The government will likely appeal, meaning it's unlikely the videotapes will be released anytime soon. The case is Dhiab v. Bush (1:05-cv-1457).","Videos show forced feedings at Guantanamo Bay .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Many Latinos say they know how Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates felt during a recent arrest because they believe police often racially profile Hispanics, too. Gates, a noted African-American scholar, has said he was arrested at his home in large part because of his race. Police say he became disorderly when asked for identification after a report of a possible break-in. ""Professor Gates' case resonates with us because he is a prominent academic at a very prominent institution, but it is a reality that occurs on these streets every day,"" said Vicente Alba-Panama of the National Congress for Puerto Rican Rights. Latinos are affected the same way that African-Americans are, Alba-Panama said. ""In this country, when you talk about racial or ethnic problems it is always discussed in terms of black and white and other communities are excluded, such as the Latino community,"" he said. A 2004 Gallup Poll found that 67 percent of African-Americans and 63 percent of Latinos believe they are the victims of police discrimination. Among whites that figure fell to 50 percent, according to the survey. Police say they often have to make split-second decisions while staying safe. ""First, when officers arrive, they have to think of their own safety,"" said Anthony Miranda, executive chairman of the National Latino Officers Association of America. ""Secondly, they think about public safety and from there they should make a decision. The problem is that in the discussions we are having is that officials abuse their authority."" Gates was arrested July 16 and accused of disorderly conduct after police responded to a report of a possible burglary at his Cambridge, Massachusetts, home. Gates had just returned from an overseas trip and had to force his front door open because it was jammed. A passer-by notified police of a possible break-in. Police said Gates became belligerent when asked for identification. The charge was later dropped, but the incident sparked a national debate about racial profiling and police procedures. President Obama added to the controversy last week when he said at a news conference that the Cambridge police had acted ""stupidly."" The arrest led Cambridge officials to create a commission made up of national experts that will evaluate police practices and make recommendations to reduce improper procedures. Obama had a beer at the White House on Thursday evening with Gates and the officer who arrested him, Sgt. James Crowley, so they could discuss the issue. The two men said afterward they planned to meet again privately.","Latinos affected the same way that African-Americans are, activists say .

"(CNN) -- Sixty-one percent of Americans polled, who watched President Obama's prime-time speech, told CNN that they support his policy towards Syria. Since some surveys showed as much as two-thirds opposition to military action against Syria in the days before the speech, the poll suggests that he did what presidents rarely do: change people's minds, if only temporarily. Read the speech . How did he do it? In only 15 minutes, President Obama made his points, simply and straightforwardly. Anyone arguing a controversial case in the court of public opinion can learn from what he said and how he said it: . Identifying with the audience. Addressing a war-weary public, President Obama began by saying that he had ""resisted calls for military action"" in Syria before ""Assad's government gassed to death over a thousand people."" The message: The terrible event that changed my mind should change yours, too. Opinion: Obama's speech won't sell Americans on Syria . Telling a story. President Obama told how the world community declared chemical weapons ""off limits, a crime against humanity and a violation of the laws of war."" His story began with the deadly use of gas in the trenches in World War I and continued with the Nazi use of poison gas in the Holocaust. Bringing it home. Having made the human rights case, President Obama explained why chemical weapons threaten Americans. If Assad isn't punished, ""our troops would again face the prospect of chemical warfare on the battlefield."" Terrorists could get these weapons and use them against civilians. Iran could be emboldened to build nuclear weapons. Invoking the American system. Some opponents warn he's willfully starting a new war. Others call him indecisive because he delayed military action. President Obama said he's taking the debate to Congress, even though he maintains he doesn't have to, because ""our democracy is stronger when the president acts with the support of Congress."" Obama seeks support for attacking Syria while pursuing diplomacy . Answering questions. Like the FAQs on a website, much of the speech answered questions that President Obama said members of Congress and private citizens have asked him, such as ""Won't this put us on a slippery slope to another war?"" President Reagan also made a point of answering questions that people had asked in their letters to him. In his address to a Joint Session of Congress after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush answered questions, as did Winston Churchill in his radio talks during World War II. Offering hopeful news. Towards the end of a speech that could have been completed several days earlier, President Obama discussed the latest developments surrounding the Russian proposal that Syria turn over its weapons to international authorities. Yes, the transition sounded choppy, but listeners care more about encouraging news than elegant rhetoric. Opinion: Speech aims to keep heat on Syria . Appealing to American patriotism. President Obama said America is ""different"" because we right wrongs when we can. Answering the common criticism that he doesn't believe in ""American Exceptionalism,"" he concluded, ""That's what makes America exceptional... Let us never lose sight of that essential truth."" With down-to-earth arguments and a lofty conclusion, last night's speech was a model of how to turn an audience around, point by point. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of David Kusnet.","David Kusnet: Barack Obama's Syria speech changed minds with its masterly execution .

"Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Ron Barber, one of the last remaining lawmakers whose reelection fate has yet to be decided, has filed suit in federal court asking for 133 disqualified ballots to be counted as his contest with Republican Martha McSally heads to a recount. ""We are talking about 133 Southern Arizona voters who lived up to their responsibility â€” they registered to vote and then showed up to vote,"" Barber attorney Kevin Hamilton said in a statement out Monday. ""We are asking the court to ensure that every lawful vote is counted. That's what America is all about."" Barber is trailing McSally, a retired Air Force colonel, by just 161 votes, a margin slim enough to trigger a recount when the votes are certified by the secretary of State, which is expected Dec. 1. But his campaign has been working feverishly over the past few weeks to find and gather evidence of ballots they say were illegitimately thrown out. They submitted with the lawsuit sworn affidavits from the voters in question outlining the issues they faced trying to cast their ballots. The reasons their votes were discarded range from signatures not lining up with their registrations to election officials failing to direct voters to their proper polling places. Barber's campaign tried unsuccessfully last week to delay the canvass of votes in the two counties that make up the district, Pima and Cochise, hoping to buy time to continue to root out other votes that may have been wrongfully discarded. But with the campaign's requests denied, Barber's options for ensuring those 133 ballots are included in the final count have narrowed. His lawsuit is seeking a restraining order to prevent the secretary of State from certifying the election results until the ballots in question have been counted. Barber holds the seat once held by his former boss Democrat Gabrielle Giffords. McSally, meanwhile, is continuing with business as though representative-elect. She spent last week in Washington D.C. at freshman orientation with other newly elected lawmakers from across the nation.","Rep.

"(CNN) -- Two veteran California sheriff's deputies were killed in a shooting rampage in two counties that began Friday morning when one deputy was shot in the forehead while confronting a suspicious vehicle, authorities said. The first officer was Sacramento County Deputy Danny Oliver, 47, who with his partner engaged the male and female suspects in a Motel 6 parking lot in Sacramento, said Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones. The suspects fired several rounds, and Oliver wasn't able to return fire, though his partner did as the suspects fled the scene shortly before 10:30 a.m. (1:30 p.m. ET), Jones said. Oliver was a 15-year officer with a wife and two daughters, Jones said. The suspects fled to nearby Placer County, where two deputies were shot, authorities said. One of them later died, the California Highway Patrol said on Twitter. Placer County Sheriff Ed Bonner said it was ""an incredibly difficult day"" as he identified the deceased deputy as 42-year-old Michael David Davis Jr., who had served in law enforcement since 1996 -- the last 10 years as a homicide investigator. His death came 26 years later to the day his father, a Riverside County sheriff's deputy, was killed in the line of duty. Davis leaves behind a wife and four children. Before heading to Placer County, one of the suspects shot a motorist in the head while the pair tried to hijack his car, Jones said. The motorist's condition wasn't immediately known, Jones said. The motorist fought the carjacking, and ""by his falling back (into his car), that could explain why the suspect was unable to carjack that vehicle,"" the sheriff said. The suspects carjacked a different vehicle, a red Ford F-150, authorities said. At some point, police received a tip that the suspects changed their clothes, Jones said. The suspected gunman was later arrested at a home in Auburn, CNN affiliate KCRA reported. The female suspect was apprehended earlier, but details were not immediately available. KCRA identified the male suspect as 34-year-old Marcelo Marquez, citing Placer County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Dena Erwin. In Sacramento, Oliver was shot at ""relatively close range as they were approaching the vehicle, and he was not able to return fire or anything,"" Jones said. Oliver's partner doesn't know whether he hit the suspect, Jones said. ""We don't know what the motive is,"" Jones said of the rampage.

"Venice, Italy (CNN) -- George Clooney, long considered Hollywood's most eligible bachelor, married British human rights attorney Amal Alamuddin Saturday in a private ceremony in Venice, Italy, his publicist, Stan Rosenfield, told CNN. Clooney arrived by motorboat at a star-studded bash at the Aman Canal Grande Venice resort, housed in the 16th-century Palazzo Papadopoli. ""George, auguri!"" Venetians could be heard offering their best wishes as Clooney waved. ""Auguri!"" Celebrities, paparazzi and the world's media have been congregating in Venice for the widely anticipated nuptials. The actor and his then-fiancÃ©e were photographed Friday cruising the sun-dappled canals of Venice ahead of their big day. Clooney, 53, and Alamuddin, 36, looked happy and impeccably glamorous as they were carried around the city in a motorboat appropriately named ""Amore,"" or ""Love,"" passing bemused tourists in gondolas as they went. The bride-to-be was dressed in a stylish black-and-white dress, while Clooney wore a sharply tailored gray suit and white shirt with dark sunglasses. The first celebrity guests to arrive were also caught on camera in the city famed for romance, notably actor Matt Damon, American Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and supermodel Cindy Crawford. ""I guess this is, as Dean Martin put it, 'That's Amore,' the land of love,"" said a tourist visiting Venice from Canada, referring to the late crooner's signature song. ""Yes, my heart is broken but I'm excited,"" his partner said with a smile. ""He has made the right choice,"" an Italian woman said. ""Because Venice is one of the most beautiful cities in the world."" It's not been confirmed exactly how the wedding weekend will play out. But a notice from the city authorities said that because of George Clooney's marriage the city hall area will be closed on Monday from 12 p.m to 2 p.m. local or later if necessary -- presumably for a civil ceremony. Paparazzi throng canal side . Clooney revealed earlier this month at a celebrity charity event in Tuscany, Italy, that he and Alamuddin would be tying the knot in Venice. According to People magazine, Clooney was receiving a humanitarian award at the black-tie gala, and said during his acceptance speech, ""I met my lovely bride-to-be here in Italy, whom I will be marrying, in a couple of weeks, in Venice, of all places."" Plenty of paparazzi, cameramen and photographers were on the docks facing the Aman Canal Grande. Others were going up and down the Grand Canal on taxi boats. Power couple . The nuptials of Clooney and Alamuddin come hot on the heels of the long-awaited marriage of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie last month. The Hollywood power couple went for a low-key ceremony at their estate in France, in which each of their six children had a part to play. Clooney and Alamuddin seem set to make more of a public splash with their event, although since they became engaged in the spring, they've been largely protective of their relationship. When a Daily Mail report claimed that Clooney and his Lebanese future mother-in-law Baria were at odds, Clooney blasted the publication with a first-person piece in USA Today, and then refused to accept the Daily Mail's subsequent apology. CNN's Erin McLaughlin reported from Venice, Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London, Ray Sanchez wrote and reported in New York, Rachel Wells reported from Los Angeles.

"Washington (CNN) -- Transportation Security Administration chief John Pistole said Thursday he will resign at the end of the year, ending his run as the longest-serving administrator of the government agency entrusted with keeping terrorists off planes, trains and other means of transport. Pistole, 58, who was the FBI's deputy director before joining the TSA more than four years ago, made the surprise announcement to employees at a town hall meeting, which was broadcast to TSA facilities nationwide. He has been nominated to become president of Anderson University, a private Christian university in central Indiana where he earned his undergraduate degree in 1978. During his tenure, Pistole became a forceful advocate of ""risk-based security"" in which the government sought to mitigate risks by taking certain precautions and of the TSA's PreCheck program, which employed that philosophy to reduce checkpoint lines. But risk-based security also factored into his most public misstep. In 2013, Pistole announced the TSA would allow small knives and certain other banned items onto aircraft, saying their risk had been mitigated by locked cockpit doors. The change would have brought the United States into alignment with other countries that allow such items. The knife announcement met with an instant and furious response from flight attendants, pilots, passengers and lawmakers. The TSA pulled back the plan shortly before it was to take effect and later abandoned the idea altogether. TSA drops plan to allow small knives on planes . On Thursday, some members of Congress and employee groups lined up to give accolades to Pistole. U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, ranking member on the House Committee on Homeland Security, cited Pistole for his work on the PreCheck program and for his decision to allow airport screeners the right to bargain collectively. The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents 45,000 airport screeners, said Pistole's efforts had led to ""advances in safety, working conditions, and morale."" Pistole became administrator in June 2010. In a statement Thursday, Pistole thanked TSA employees for their work. ""I could not be more proud of all that our employees have accomplished together, particularly what they have done to help enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of transportation security while improving the passenger screening experience.""","NEW: Pistole is nominated to be president at his alma mater, Anderson University .

"Ottawa (CNN) -- Speaking from Ottawa on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said last week's deadly shooting there was an act of terrorism, and the United States is taking steps to counter extremist groups including ISIS online, which has sought to recruit and radicalize Westerners to its cause. ""There are a great many avenues here, all of which are being structured within the confines of an overall strategy,"" Kerry said of U.S. efforts, ""But we will leave no effort untested with respect to our efforts to shut down the ability of these people to propagandize, to lie, to deceive, and to have whatever influence they may be able to have on young minds."" Both Canada and the United States have seen dozens of their citizens leave North America in recent months to join militant groups on the battlefield in Syria. Just last week, three teenagers from Colorado were stopped from leaving the United States with the intent of joining ISIS, law enforcement officials said. And the terror group has featured fighters with North American accents in recent propaganda videos. The U.S. and Canada also share concerns about the prospect of more so-called ""lone wolf"" attacks like the one in Ottawa last week. The shooter, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was only the latest in a string of young Western men, often converts to Islam with criminal backgrounds, who have become radicalized by extremist messaging and who sought to commit attacks. Just a few days before Zehaf-Bibeau opened fire at a war memorial and Parliament Hill, another Canadian man rammed his car into two Canadian soldiers, killing one of them. And following the Ottawa attack, an American man, Zale Thompson, attacked four New York police officers with a hatchet before he was shot dead. New York police said Thompson was a self-radicalized convert to Islam, and they categorized the assault as a terrorist attack. The ability of groups like ISIS to influence and recruit Westerners online is one of the capabilities the U.S. and Canadian governments hope to disrupt. During his visit, Kerry also laid a wreath at the National War Memorial where Zehaf-Bibeau gunned down army reservist Cpl. Nathan Cirillo on Wednesday, before continuing on to a nearby Parliament building where he ultimately was shot and killed. Kerry's trip, happening the same day Cirillo was laid to rest, gave the Obama administration another opportunity to express solidarity with the Canadian people in the aftermath of the attack. ""President Obama, the State Department and our entire administration pledge to work even more closely with your leaders at every level in order to deter and prevent terrorist attacks,"" Kerry said. Kerry also had a message for ISIS and other terrorist groups. ""The question that our adversaries want us to ask is 'Is there nowhere safe?'"" Kerry said. ""And that is a question to which we firmly reply: No. ""There is nowhere safe for those who would pervert the teachings of a great religion, murder the innocent, betray their neighbors, and line up on the side of such pernicious groups as (ISIS) and al Qaeda."" This is Kerry's first trip to Canada as secretary of state.","Secretary of State Kerry is on his first official trip to Canada .

"(CNN) -- Two members of a banned Chinese doomsday cult were sentenced to death Saturday for the brutal murder of a woman in a McDonald's restaurant in May, Chinese state media reported. Zhang Fan and Zhang Lidong were among five members of the Church of Almighty God, or ""Quannengshen,"" tried on murder charges in August over the killing in Zhaoyuan, Shandong Province, the state-run Xinhua agency reported. Three fellow cult members, Lyu Yingchun, Zhang Hang and Zhang Qiaolian, were sentenced to life, 10 and seven years in prison respectively for their roles in the attack. The four Zhangs were related, according to the report. A court statement said the victim, a 37-year-old woman named Wu Shuoyan, was attacked after refusing to give her phone number to the group, who were allegedly attempting to recruit new members. Zhang Fan and Lyu called her an ""evil spirit,"" before Zhang bludgeoned her head with a chair, then jumped on her and trampled her head, the statement said. Zhang Lidong bashed the victim's head with a mop hard enough to break it, and stomped on her face and head, while Lyu kicked her waist and prevented McDonald's staff from intervening, the court statement said. IN DEPTH: 'Eastern Lightning,' the banned religious group that has China worried . Linked to kidnappings, violence and extortion, the Church of Almighty God has been on a list of 14 banned religious groups issued by China's Ministry of Public Security since 1995. Founded in the 1990s in Henan Province, the group believes that Jesus has been reincarnated as Yang Xiangbin, the wife of the group's founder, Zhao Weishan. The couple fled to the United States in 2000, Xinhua reported. The group, also known as Eastern Lightning (""Dongfang Shandian""), preaches that the righteous are engaged in an apocalyptic struggle against China's Communist Party -- which it refers to as the ""great red dragon."" Belonging to a tradition of heterodox, quasi-Christian Chinese religious movements, the cult was estimated as having between several hundred thousand and one million members, according to Emily Dunn, an Asian studies academic at the University of Melbourne who wrote her doctoral thesis on the group. In August, Chinese state media reported that police had arrested nearly 1,000 suspected members of the group, including nearly 100 ""backbone members."" The report said those arrested were responsible for ""numerous"" suicides and murders, including those of their own family. In 2012, hundreds of members were rounded up after the group publicly proclaimed the end of the world was imminent. In a statement provided to CNN in June, Hong Kong-based members of the group responsible for its English-language website said it was ""very natural"" for the Chinese Communist Party to blame the group for the McDonald's death because the party slandered and then suppressed those that disagreed with it. ""They always find some excuse in advance and fabricate things and slander them,"" said the statement. READ MORE: The future of Christianity in China .

"(CNN) -- I'm obviously not the only one disappointed in Barack Obama. I thought he would be another Reagan in at least one respect: He'd be a great communicator. Listening to his speeches in 2008, I thought that this man could connect. He had energy and vision, hope and strength. So what happened? Somewhere along the way, disturbingly early in his first term, he fizzled as a communicator. It's not that he didn't do good things. He brought the American economy back from the brink of another Great Depression, and (by comparison with our counterparts in Europe) we are doing extremely well. Jobs are back, with unemployment steadily falling, and the stock market has soared, thus underpinning the retirement hopes of millions who rely on equity portfolios to sustain them in their old age. We have discontinued pursuing ""wars of choice,"" although it may take generations to recover from the mistake of invading Iraq, which will cost the American taxpayers two trillion bucks -- with health care for veterans taxing our children and grandchildren for years to come. Obama withdrew somewhat precipitously from Iraq, putting too much faith in the Shia-led government in Baghdad and giving ISIS an opening. He may have done this in part out of frustration over the Shia-led government's inability to provide legal protections for American troops that would have remained. But in truth, he handled the situation pretty well in the end, as ISIS is sputtering out, slowly but surely. Indeed, ISIS was always a ragtag (if singularly vicious) group surrounded by natural and powerful enemies, including Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Hezbollah in Lebanon. They were a flash in the pan, though a painful one. As for Ebola, this seems now under broad control, with the number of cases declining. Ebola was always a greatly exaggerated fear, though obviously a cause for concern that requires vigilance. But this was the ISIS and Ebola election, with panic at high levels on both fronts around the country. And it was widely perceived that Obama was not reacting in a strong way to these threats, even though -- in my view -- he was actually doing quite a lot on both fronts behind the scenes. His mantra has famously been ""don't do stupid stuff,"" and this has largely been a good and rare thing, even if critics pounce on this as a sign of his being a wimp. George W. Bush was no wimp, but look where that got us! He made the worst foreign policy decision in recent history when he invaded Iraq, setting in motion waves of instability that it will take a generation to quell and subsidize. Health care has, of course, been the main focus of ""hope and change"" for Obama, and yet he was also defeated in this midterm election by Obamacare; denouncing it became a mantra for his political enemies. Yet apart from its initial rollout problems, Obamacare has been a measured success, allowing large numbers of previously uninsured American to have access to health care. The rollout problem was not just the result of too much interest in the program, though there certainly was that. It was a flawed website that couldn't handle the demand, and it was a management failure not to have sufficiently tested the system before it went online. But the state-run insurance exchanges have largely been a success: Even Mitch McConnell has been forced to support the way the exchange has worked in Kentucky, although he doesn't support the benefits of this program for people in other states! One would have thought the considerable positive effects of Obamacare, including the widely reported reduction in health care costs, would have helped Democrats. But that didn't happen. Let's face it, Obama did a lousy job of making the success of his health care program understandable to the wider public. He also did a lousy job of consulting with Republicans about this program before it was passed, and he seems curiously disinterested in actually talking with the American people about his successes, although he will occasionally give a speech and, in what seems like a bored way, recite his accomplishments. The problem is, I suspect, that he doesn't believe in himself. He isn't willing to buy his own story. There must be many reasons for this. Richard Falk, in a good article in Foreign Policy last summer, notes that, in fact, Obama has never felt confident in separating from the macho rhetoric of Bush. He has spoken repeatedly about America's right to act on its own in the world, saying (for instance) in one speech at West Point: ""I believe in American exceptionalism with every fiber of my being."" What he offers is, according to Falk, a ""watered down neoconservertive global agenda""-- but doesn't really seem to believe what he's saying, as he walks every assertion like one this back in due course. It's clear enough from his actions in Iraq and Afghanistan that he actually wants the U.S. to exert less, not more, military presence abroad, and to work with coalitions and within the confines of international law, like any other civilized nation. We are not the only country in the world, however much we like to imagine we are. It's crucial that we work in partnership with other countries. What better time to do this than now, when much of the industrialized world seems very much anti-authoritarian and democratic? We should consider Europe and Japan, India, Israel, and most countries in Latin America our natural allies in the movement toward a peaceable world, where economic stability and human rights are respected. I will dare to hope that, in the waning years of his presidency, Barack Obama might actually begin to communicate with the American people about his real dreams for a better world. Not doing stupid stuff is fine. But it's not everything. And he knows that already.","Jay Parini: Many impressed by Obama in 2008 let down. What changed about him?
He's done much: Brought down unemployment, saved economy, brought health care reform .

"(CNN) -- Nearly one in four people worldwide is Muslim -- and they are not necessarily where you might think, according to an extensive new study that aims to map the global Muslim population. Nearly two out of three of the world's Muslims are in Asia, stretching from Turkey to Indonesia. India, a majority-Hindu country, has more Muslims than any country except for Indonesia and Pakistan, and more than twice as many as Egypt. China has more Muslims than Syria. Germany has more Muslims than Lebanon. And Russia has more Muslims than Jordan and Libya put together. Nearly two out of three of the world's Muslims are in Asia, stretching from Turkey to Indonesia. The Middle East and north Africa, which together are home to about one in five of the world's Muslims, trail a very distant second. There are about 1.57 billion Muslims in the world, according to the report, ""Mapping the Global Muslim Population,"" by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. That represents about 23 percent of the total global population of 6.8 billion. There are about 2.25 billion Christians, based on projections from the 2005 World Religions Database. Brian Grim, the senior researcher on the Pew Forum project, was slightly surprised at the number of Muslims in the world, he told CNN. ""Overall, the number is higher than I expected,"" he said, noting that earlier estimates of the global Muslim population have ranged from 1 billion to 1.8 billion. The report can -- and should -- have implications for United States policy, said Reza Aslan, the best-selling Iranian-American author of ""No God but God."" ""Increasingly, the people of the Middle East are making up a smaller and smaller percentage of the worldwide Muslim community,"" he told CNN by phone. ""When it comes to issues of outreach to the Muslim world, these numbers will indicate that outreach cannot be focused so narrowly on the Middle East,"" he said. ""If the goal is to create better understanding between the United States and the Muslim world, our focus should be on south and southeast Asia, not the Middle East,"" he said. He spoke to CNN before the report was published and without having seen its contents, but was familiar with the general trends the report identified. The team at the Pew Forum spent nearly three years analyzing ""the best available data"" from 232 countries and territories, Grim said. Their aim was to get the most comprehensive snapshot ever assembled of the world's Muslim population at a given moment in time. So they took the data they gathered from national censuses and surveys, and projected it forward based on what they knew about population growth in each country. They describe the resulting report as ""the largest project of its kind to date."" It's full of details that even the researchers found surprising. ""There are these countries that we don't think of as Muslim at all, and yet they have very sizable numbers of Muslims,"" said Alan Cooperman, the associate director of research for the Pew Forum, naming India, Russia and China. One in five of the world's Muslims lives in a country where Muslims are a minority. And while most people think of the Muslim population of Europe is being composed of immigrants, that's only true in western Europe, Cooperman said. ""In the rest of Europe -- Russia, Albania, Kosovo, those places -- Muslims are an indigenous population,"" he said. ""More than half of the Muslims in Europe are indigenous."" The researchers also were surprised to find the Muslim population of sub-Saharan Africa to be as low as they concluded, Cooperman said. It has only about 240 million Muslims -- about 15 percent of all the world's Muslims. Islam is thought to be growing fast in the region, with countries such as Nigeria, which has large populations of both Christians and Muslims, seeing violence between the two groups. The Pew researchers concluded that Nigeria is just over half Muslim, making it the sixth most populous Muslim country in the world. Roughly nine out of 10 Muslims worldwide are Sunni, and about one in 10 is Shiite, they estimated. They warned they were less confident of those numbers than of the general population figures because sectarian data is harder to come by. ""Only one or two censuses in the world ... have ever asked the sectarian question,"" said Grim. ""Among Muslims it's a very sensitive question. If asked, large numbers will say I am just a Muslim -- not that they don't know, but it is a sensitive question in many places,"" he said. One in three of the world's Shiite Muslims lives in Iran, which is one of only four countries with a Shiite majority, he said. The others are Iraq, Azerbaijan, and Bahrain. Huge as the project of mapping the world's Muslim population is, it is only the first step in a Pew Forum undertaking. Next year, the think tank intends to release a report projecting Muslim population growth into the future, and then the researchers intend to do the whole thing over again with Christians, followed by other faith groups. ""We don't care only about Muslims,"" Grim said. They're also digging into what people believe and practice, since the current analysis doesn't analyze that. ""This is no way reflects the religiosity of people, only their self-identification,"" Grim said. ""We're trying to get the overall picture of religion in the world.""","There are about 1.57 billion Muslims in the world, according to the report .

""I can confirm the Justice Department now has an open investigation into the Saginaw shooting,"" said Mitchell Rivard, spokesman for Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez of the Civil Rights Division. He spoke just one day after the Justice Department declined to comment on the case. Prosecutors and state police have already begun an investigation into the shooting death of Milton Hill. Hill had been had been arguing with officers in a parking lot next to a shuttered Chinese restaurant when he was shot, in full view of passing motorists and while he was holding some sort of knife. Saginaw County Prosecutor Michael Thomas said that the squad of police confronting him opened fire ""because apparently, at this point in time, he was threatening to assault police."" Saginaw Police Chief Gerald Cliff said Hall was ""known to be an assaultive person"" with ""a long history"" of contacts with law enforcement, ""not only with police from our department, but with the county."" Hall's cousin, Mike Washington, acknowledged Hall had been jailed for minor offenses like vagrancy in the past, but, ""He was not violent.""

"(CNN) -- A story told about Marine Gen. John Allen while commanding troops in Iraq describes his ability to inspire the loyalty. A mortar shell landed near a mess hall where Allen was eating, sending a young soldier under the table for cover. Allen, who remained upright during the attack, bent over and said to him, ""Son, you're not going to win the war from down there."" Allen may be tempted to find cover under a mess hall table this week as he has been entangled in the sex scandal that ended the career of Gen. David Petraeus, who he followed as commander of international troops in Afghanistan. Petraeus pillow talk: 'A spy agency's worst nightmare' An investigation into ""flirtatious"" e-mail exchanges between Allen and Jill Kelley, the woman whose complaint about anonymous, harassing e-mails uncovered Patraeus' affair with Paula Broadwell, has put Allen's promotion as NATO commander on hold. The married father of two daughters did not have an affair with Kelley, who is also married, according to a senior official close to the general. What we know so far . ""Allen has never been alone with her,"" the official said. ""He does everything with his wife."" Allen, who has a habit of replying to every e-mail he gets, never wrote about sex although he may have said ""thanks sweetheart,"" in casual e-mail conversation, the official said. Allen's stellar career in the U.S. Marines has made it hard for those who know him to write him off because of the controversy. Allen became the first U.S. Marine to command the International Security Assistance Force - Afghanistan and United States Forces when he took over from Patraeus in July 2011.

""He has faith in General Allen, believes he is doing and has done an excellent job at ISAF,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday. ""His leadership has been instrumental in achieving the significant progress that ISAF, working alongside our Afghan partners, has made in bringing greater security to the Afghan people in ensuring that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for terrorists,"" Defense Department spokesman George Little said. Fran Townsend, who served as Homeland Security Adviser in the last Bush administration, called him ""a competent, respected, admired leader of troops."" Allen's military career began when he graduated with honors from the Naval Academy in1976. He returned there in 1988 to teach in the political science department, earning the ""military instructor of the year"" award in 1990. Timeline of the Petraeus affair . He became the first Marine to be appointed commandant of midshipmen, the second highest post at the Naval Academy, in 2002. When Allen was promoted from colonel to brigadier general in 2003, he was made principal director of Asian and Pacific Affairs in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. He held the position for nearly three years. He served in Iraq as commanding general of the 2d Marine Expeditionary Brigade from 2006 to 2008. He championed the ""Sunni Awakening"" strategy that organized and paid former insurgents or sympathizers who turned against al Qaeda. Opinion: 5 things we've learned from Petraeus scandal . Allen was posted in Tampa, Florida, as deputy commander the U.S. Central Command from July 2008 until June 2011, when he took over the Afghanistan command. It was in Tampa that Allen met Jill Kelley, who was already a friend of Patraeus.

"Paris (CNN) -- A jewelry heist on one the world's most prestigious jewelry stores has been foiled, and both would-be thieves are in police custody after an attempted escape amidst a flurry of security forces, according to police, eyewitnesses and French media. Two robbers entered the landmark Cartier jewelry store located near the Champs Elysees in Paris on Tuesday evening, according to police spokesman Luc Poignant speaking to CNN affiliate BFMTV. While exiting the jewelry store, the thieves fired on police forces, says Poignant, who returned fire on the pair of robbers. A police chase ensued after the pair of robbers jumped on a scooter and left the scene, followed by police. The two robbers then holed up in a nearby hair salon, where a local shop owner tells BFM that a hostage was taken. The suspects surrendered late Tuesday, walking out of the salon with their hands in the air, according to an eye-witness speaking to BFM TV.

"Washington (CNN) -- While Florida Gov. Rick Scott and former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist took aim at each other during a bitter debate on Thursday night, viewers participated alongside the candidates, reacting in real-time using Microsoft Bing Pulse technology. The pattern was clear from the beginning. Democrats and independents tended to stick relatively close together in their sentiment, strongly agreeing when Crist spoke and strongly disagreeing when Scott spoke. Overall, Republicans participants tended to stay more toward the middle, voting more neutrally. Not surprisingly, Democrats and Republicans voted in extreme opposite directions throughout the debate. When Crist attacked Scott's personal fortune, Democrats and independents strongly agreed with him. ""If you're somebody like Rick Scott, and you have a private jet, and you fly 30,000 feet above people all the time, or you live in an oceanfront mansion, you're out of touch, and you're not feeling what people that are watching tonight are feeling at home,"" said Crist. But when Scott blamed Crist for the loss of more than 800,000 jobs, saying he is out of touch because he grew up with wealth, Democrats strongly disagreed more than at any other point in the debate. Strong points of agreement for Republicans occurred when Scott explained his response to Ebola and when he discussed the action he took during the Treyvon Martin case. But when Scott attacked Crist, calling him a ""divider"" and a ""mudslinger,"" he only had a slight bump from his fellow Republicans. When it came to gender, men and women were almost in dead lockstep, voting nearly identically with very little variation throughout the night. In total, 186,000 votes were tallied on Bing Pulse. Democrats nearly outnumbered Republicans in the real-time voting 3-to-1.","Viewers reacted in real-time using Microsoft's Bing Pulse technology .

"(CNN) -- Tuesday marked the last day of the Hajj, the annual pilgrimage that sees over two million Muslim pilgrims journey to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. It is one of the most celebrated events in the Islamic calendar, and one of the world's largest public gatherings. Handling a crowd of that magnitude hasn't always been easy, especially in light of public health worries and ISIS fears. To ensure such a feat goes off with minimal disruption, Saudi Arabia's authorities have had to go high-tech. The crowd . Any event that draws crowds a million strong faces the risk of stampedes. Hajj pilgrims have not always been exempt from such a fate. The worst incident occurred in 1990, when 1,426 pilgrims were trampled to death. A similar event took place in 2006, when 363 people lost their lives. Since then, the Saudi government has used live crowd analytics software CrowdVision to manage the throng. ""It spots patterns of crowd behavior that indicate potential danger such as high densities, pressure, turbulence, stop-and-go waves and other anomalies,"" Fiona Sterns, CrowdVision's co-founder, told the BBC. Back in a central control room, police and military personnel monitor the live data feeds provided by the software, which lets them see in real-time where the crowds are thickest. The traffic . Transporting two million people at once has the potential of setting new records in gridlock. To combat this, authorities employ 15,000 public buses to help move the masses between the holy sites. Like the crowds, the buses' movements are also tracked by wireless monitors to help authorities grasp where traffic jams hold up the procession, and make adjustments accordingly. The government has also invested in several long-term public transport initiatives to take some pressure off the roads. The Al Mashaaer Al Mugaddassah Metro was completed in 2011, and ferries pilgrims between Mecca, Mount Arafat, Muzdalifah and Mina -- all required stops on the Hajj. The railway line was designed to shuttle 72,000 passengers an hour. Construction has also begun on a four-line metro system for the city of Mecca. Public health . While various health crises -- namely MERS and Ebola -- have cast a shadow over this year's proceedings, organizers employed a medical army to address any health issues that might arise. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this year there were 180 ambulances on standby, as well as 22,000 health care professionals, 141 health centers, 25 hospitals with 5,250 beds, and 19,000 units of varying blood types. Officials also banned pilgrims from Ebola hot zones -- namely Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. ""WHO has been closely coordinating with the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia to ensure that preparedness measures are in place,"" says Rana Sidani, a WHO spokesperson. The security . The rise of ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in the region put added pressure on Saudi Arabia this year to increase security measures during the Hajj. ""I would not put it past ISIS to try to disrupt the Hajj and I think Saudi authorities are well aware of that possibility,"" said Fahad Nazer, a terrorism analyst at JTG Inc and a former political analyst at the Saudi embassy in Washington, told The National. To safeguard against the possibility of attack, officials installed thousands of CCTV cameras throughout the country, focusing on the holy sites, and employed facial recognition technology. They also employed 60,000 security troops. ""These forces will be stationed in Mina, Arafat and Muzdalifah to ensure the safety of pilgrims and enable them to perform their rites with ease and comfort,"" Major General Osman Al Mahraj, director of general security, told the Saudi Gazette.","Tuesday marked the last day of the Hajj, the annual pilgrimage that draws over two million Muslim pilgrims .

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. VBS.TV is the broadband television network of VICE. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe that this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Viewer discretion advised. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- The first time I heard anything about people living in the sewers in Colombia was back at the beginning of the '90s. The sewage system running under Bogota's streets was filled with packs of kids living waist-deep in human waste and taking in copious amounts of glue and crack in order to cope. This was at the height of Colombia's Dirty War, and the whole reason street kids had moved into the sewers in the first place was to get away from the violence above ground. But then the paramilitary death squads who had chased them off the street started coming into the pipes and shooting them or dousing them in gasoline or raping them. The sewer kids became a fairly big humanitarian story in the media for a while, with networks in America and Europe sending in TV crews to cover it and folks setting up charities abroad. Then, as happens with news stories, it fell off the radar, and I guess people kind of thought the problem had been resolved, if they thought of it at all. But what had actually happened was, about six months after all the stories aired, the death squads went in, armed with the whereabouts of the sewer-kid hot spots, and carried out massive reprisal killings. There was some talk in the government about cracking down on the death squads, but by all accounts, soldiers and off-duty cops made up a good part of most squads. So the situation just stagnated while the world turned its attention elsewhere. See the rest of Sewers of Bogota at VBS.TV . When we went into the sewers and started talking to people, nobody wanted to be anywhere near our camera. Having heard stories about the last time cameras came down, they were all sure that the police would figure out where they were hiding from our footage and come in to beat the (expletive) out of them (the fact that they were all cracked out of their skulls probably didn't help with the paranoia either). We took great pains to obscure the locations of their homes, but the only reason any of them talked with us was because we went down with Jaime Jaramillo. We had mixed feelings about Jaime, or ""Papa Jaime"" as he prefers to be called, when we met him. He was constantly mugging for the camera and repeating the same well-rehearsed speeches about the kids' living conditions (""Their only food is trash, their only music the honking of the city bus ...""), calling us at our hotel when he's on the local news, etc. The thing is, though, he is seriously one of the only people in the country who's done anything about the situation in the sewers. We all snickered at the meditation tapes and the Evel Knievel jumpsuit, but once we got down into the pipes, not only did all the kids know and trust him, they ran to him like he was made out of crack.","VBS goes underground and meets kids who are living in sewers to escape violence .

"(CNN) -- It cuts through plastic! It burns holes in walls! It ... tells time? Like something out of a James Bond film, it's a watch -- equipped with a laser. Its inventor, Patrick Priebe, built it during downtime from his full-time gig creating props and modestly describes it as a ""tiny watch made of garbage."" Still, Priebe's laser watch has attracted its share of attention for being an entertaining, if mildly dangerous, bit of technology. (It will burn skin if the wearer isn't careful.) On a YouTube video, the German tinkerer activates the laser and pops a handful of balloons, lights a few matches and burns through a compact-disc case. The video has picked up more than 700,000 views since Priebe posted it five days ago -- not bad, though not as much as his Spider-Man ""Webshooter"" (2.1 million views) or his laser cannon prototype (1.3 million). Priebe, who runs a firm called Laser Gadgets, said he made the watch out of ""leftovers."" ""I found a piece of leftover tubing, and I put it on my wrist and I realized it looked like a watch already,"" he said from his home near Cologne. After molding the tubing a bit more, ""all I had to do was file down the edges to make the time module fit and cut something out for the laser module on the side, and it fit right away. It's just my style, putting things together without a plan."" The laser watch has been compared to a James Bond device, but Priebe says it wasn't inspired by a particular Bond film -- not even ""Goldfinger,"" with its famous scene of the villain aiming a laser at Bond's crotch. Instead, it was a Nintendo game of ""GoldenEye,"" the video game based on the 1995 Pierce Brosnan Bond movie. ""I'm not really a Bond fan,"" Priebe said, admitting that he prefers science fiction. Priebe, a former lab technician, is a now a full-time prop builder who's constructed pieces for the TV show ""Warehouse 13,"" among other projects. He also makes money from YouTube views and been caught off-guard by the interest in the laser watch. He likes to personally answer YouTube comments and e-mail queries, and has gotten backed up with both. Incidentally, if you're interested in buying the watch -- you budding Dr. Evil, you -- too bad. It's not for sale, Priebe says. ""There are some limits,"" he said. ""I always say I don't make weapons. I just make toys.""","Inventor attaches laser module to a timepiece .

"(CNN) -- Imagine being alone in your house. It's the middle of the night and suddenly, the lights go on. Without you switching them on. And then they go off. And a minute later, they are back on. The wife of Jeff Hagins, co-founder of SmartThings, gets this magic all the time. Her husband likes to show off how he can remotely control devices in his home -- including the lights. But the idea of smart homes goes beyond showing off. ""It's a peace of mind thing, you can check if all the doors are locked or find out about a water leak,"" Hagins says. He says his company can make homes cheaper and greener to run. The system helps to save energy by cutting down waste -- such as switching lights off when motion sensors suggest nobody is around. Huge market . The future looks promising for the smart industry. A NextMarket report sees the U.S. market growing sixfold from $1.28 billion in 2014 to nearly $7.8 billion in 2019. Smart locks sales alone will grow from $66 million to nearly $1 billion in just five years, the report suggests. Tech giants are jumping on board with their offering. Apple has announced its HomeKit service, which will allow home owners to control all connected devices in their homes. Google bought Nest, the company behind smart termostats that track users habits to heat or cool the house before they even realize they'd like the temperature to change. Home automation company Belkin is foreseeing a world where people control everything with one app in their phones. ""Most people already use their smartphones as alarm clocks, so now they can start making their coffee before leaving the bed,"" says Kieran Hannon from Belkin. The company makes smart light switches, plugs and light bulbs, and has also partnered up with makers of kitchen devices to allow users to put their dinner to cook while on the way home from work. All the data . But with all the magic of connected homes comes a great concern about potential data misuse. Intimate information about people's way of living would be incredibly valuable to companies wanting to target the right people with their products. Tony Fadell, the founder of Nest gets this question a lot -- cespecially since Google didn't hesitate to pay $3.2 billion for his company. Google is already using its users data to make money -- tracking what people search for and using that information to for targeted advertising. But Fadell says his company will never allow customers' data to flow to advertisers. ""People are inviting our products to their homes,"" he says. ""The trust is very important."" In the case of SmartThings, people have to specifically opt-in to share their data with outside companies. ""We don't own the data, our customers do,"" Hagins says. He says there are situations when users want their data to be shared. If a house gets broken in, a home security app could automatically alert the police. Less scary scenario sees a gardening company tracking the moisture levels in a lawn, making sure the sprinkling system is switched on and off at right time. Hackers, welcome . Loosing a cell phones is annoying. Loosing a cell phone that controls nearly everything in your house can be a disaster -- like leaving your front door wide open to anyone to come in. A research by AVTest recently exposed the main gaps in security, such as the lack of encrypted communication, which leaves the systems vulnerable to viruses and malware. Hagins envisions a future where anyone can buy smart home apps just like they buy mobile phone apps. But that also means anyone can build these apps without any regulation. When Apple announced its vision of hooking up smart home devices with Bluetooth and Wifi in June, it also said it would not make its own smart home products. Instead it will partner up with established makers and equip their product with Apple chips. The company said it will require each partner to follow the same security standards as other Apple products. As it steps up its efforts to become part of the smart home market, Apple announced it will reveal more details on its ""Made For i"" conference in China. As the AVTest predicts, security is likely to be the trump card in the industry.","The smart industry is making millions, with the U.S. market predicted to reach $7.8 million by 2019 .
However potential data misuse is still a concern for many users - Google is already using the data of its users to make money .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Puzzled zookeepers in northern Japan have discovered the reason why their attempts to mate two polar bears kept failing: Both are female. A 4-year-old polar bear sent to impregnate a female polar bear at a zoo in Kushiro was found to be female as well. The municipal zoo in the city of Kushiro in Hokkaido brought in a polar bear cub three years ago. They named it Tsuyoshi, after the popular baseball outfielder Tsuyoshi Shinjo, and waited until it reached reproductive age. In June, the zoo introduced Tsuyoshi to its resident bear, an 11-year-old female named Kurumi, and waited for sparks to fly. But much to the disappointment of zookeepers, Tsuyoshi never made any amorous advances toward Kurumi. Earlier this month, zookeepers put Tsuyoshi under anesthesia to get to the bottom of the matter. That's when they made their discovery: Tsuyoshi is a female. Still, the Kushiro zoo plans to keep Tsuyoshi because he -- or rather, she -- has become immensely popular with visitors. ""I have rather mixed feelings, given the need for breeding, but Tsuyoshi is an idol for Kushiro,"" Yoshio Yamaguchi, head of the Kushiro zoo, told Japan's Kyodo news agency. Tsuyoshi will even keep her name. ""We will not be changing it to 'Tsuyoko' since it is loved by citizens (by the current name),"" Yamaguchi said. ""Ko"" is a common suffix for a Japanese female name. Meanwhile, Tsuyoshi's ""brother,"" who was adopted by another zoo, has also turned out to be female, Kyodo reported. -- CNN's Chie Kobayashi contributed to this report .","Zoo introduced polar bear cub to its resident bear and waited for sparks to fly .

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- Governors of several Venezuelan states have warned that recent oil spills and other contamination could be polluting local drinking water. But President Hugo Chavez counters that the officials' criticisms and media reports on the water controversy are propaganda in the political battle against him. ""If it isn't war, it is media terrorism. This is very serious. It is an attack on the physical and mental health of a people, of a community. This is a crime,"" Chavez said this week, saying authorities should prosecute those responsible. On Thursday, Venezuela's attorney general said a court had issued an injunction requiring media to ""act with extreme responsibly"" and present evidence when broadcasting information about the country's water, saying that past reports on contamination were presented without proof in order to cause panic. ""They have no technical evidence. They are doing it to foster negative opinions, not to help the population. If you say something is happening and it is untrue, what can you generate? Conflict and chaos,"" Attorney General Luisa Ortega said. Critics say the government should analyze what could be causing drinking water problems, rather than investigating those who have expressed concerns. ""There have been a wave of attacks from the national government. ... What worries us is not only that they are not recognizing the problem, but that they want to censor the people who denounce it,"" said Edison Duran, general director of the Movement for Water Quality. ""The government, unfortunately, treats any denouncement of anything wrong as a political attack, and disqualifies it as a media campaign."" Monagas Gov. Jose Gregorio Briceno has argued that federal officials aren't being forthcoming about what could be a serious risk to the population. The governor has said public health is his primary concern. ""I would prefer that the people are healthy, that no one is sick, that no one has cancer or any kind of illness, instead of being irresponsible,"" he told CNN affiliate Globovision. Briceno has been at the center of the political and environmental controversy over the water supply since last month, when an oil pipeline ruptured in the Guarapiche River, which runs through his state. Federal officials have said Venezuela's state oil company has cleaned up 95% of the oil that flowed into the river, and the water in the area is safe to drink. But the governor repeatedly expressed concerns over the drinking water supply, and another rupture emerged in public view -- this time within the ranks of Chavez's United Socialist Party of Venezuela. Last week, party leaders expelled Briceno ""for willing, serious offenses derived from unethical and counter-revolutionary positions,"" state media reported. Two opposition governors in other states have also expressed concerns about water in recent weeks. ""We call on the national government to declare an emergency in the whole water system because ... there is no guarantee that the water going to the homes in the center of the country is drinkable,"" said Henrique Salas Feo, governor of Carabobo state, alleging that drinking water from a reservoir was contaminated. In Zulia state, Gov. Pablo Perez said an oil spill in neighboring Colombia had contaminated a lake. But Chavez maintained that the officials' concerns and media reports have no credibility. ""It's a disgrace. It is a great lie,"" he said. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet in Atlanta and journalist Osmary Hernandez in Caracas contributed to this report.","President Hugo Chavez calls claims of contaminated water ""media terrorism""

"(CNN) -- No, some guy named Daniels on Facebook didn't win the Powerball lottery. And, no, he's not really giving anyone $1 million of his winnings. But that didn't stop a doctored photo claiming just that from becoming possibly the most-shared image in the site's history. In the photo, posted on the social-media ubersite Thursday night, a grinning man identified as Nolan Daniels holds up a Powerball ticket with the correct numbers for the massive $588 million jackpot awarded Wednesday. The caption that went along with it was the stuff of get-rich-quick daydreams: ""Looks like I won't be going to work EVER!!!! Share this photo and I will give a random person 1 million dollars!"" And share they did. By Monday morning, more than 2 million people had clicked in hopes of a windfall. The problem, of course, being that the numbers on the ticket were out of sequence -- a tip-off that the image had been doctored. And it didn't help when the two holders of actual winning tickets were found. Neither ticket belonged to Daniels, although one winner, like Daniels, is from the Phoenix area. The photo, which is the only publicly shared item on Daniels' page, had gotten more than 27,000 comments by Monday morning. More than three days after the original post, some commenters were still oblivious to the hoax. ""You have given a lot of people hope at a wonderful time of year, what a kind and generous thing to do!"" one user wrote. ""Merry Christmas to you and your family!"" But most had taken a harsher turn, ranging from ""Ha! Ha! You got us"" to angrier fare. ""What a JERK ... this is FAKE!!!!"" someone wrote. ""All I can say is KARMA!!!!"" The story first gained traction on social media, then took off when the Savannah (Georgia) Morning News published an article Friday on the activity surrounding Daniels' Facebook page. A man claiming to be Daniels' brother then left a comment on the Morning News' site, discrediting the accuracy of the photo. ""Even though most knew it was fake, people hang onto the most slim opportunities for some luck, some hope ...,"" wrote Derek Daniels in the post. ""I hope people were able to shake it off. I'm sure the vast majority did. The idea of someone winning and then sharing in a second lottery is touching. Too bad ... this wasn't the case."" The Morning News contacted Derek Daniels, who told the newspaper his brother Nolan is a 35-year-old software engineer. He thinks his brother was just seeking attention, according to the paper. ""I think he craves the love from people,"" he said Saturday in a follow-up article published by the newspaper. ""He did this to make himself feel better."" Nolan Daniels did not immediately respond to a message on Facebook on Monday seeking comment for this report. Among the comments on his Facebook photo were at least dozens that recounted stories of personal hardship, from people with disabilities to tales of children diagnosed with terminal diseases. That, Derek Daniels said in his post, may be where a prank went too far. With 2 million-plus shares, the image may be the most-shared item in the eight-year history of Facebook. A photo of President Barack Obama hugging his wife, Michelle, posted after his re-election victory last month, received 581,000 shares. And Facebook's most-shared item last year was a New York Times photo gallery of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. It was shared about 600,000 times.

"(CNN) -- Momentum is mounting against the NCAA, the century-old body that governs college sports. A federal judge has just heard one case calling for revenue from TV deals to be shared with student athletes and she will likely take on two more landmark suits this year that seek something even bigger -- a free market in college sports. At the same time, Northwestern University is appealing a ruling that would allow football players to unionize. Here are five things you need to know about what just happened and what's coming. The end of some of the biggest traditions? National championships. Age-old rivalries. Larger-than-life game day atmospheres. That's what's at stake, according to NCAA President Mark Emmert, who described a doomsday scenario if college athletes are paid, when he testified in the case brought by former UCLA basketball star Ed O'Bannon. Emmert said many school leaders have told him they would not want to pay for athletes. Instead they might opt out of Division I sports into Division II where there is less money for coaches, facilities and scholarships. Schools that did stay in D1 would likely have to cut less popular sports to afford to pay athletes, he said. And the schools that chose to pay would probably never play the schools that chose not to pay -- preventing a true national championship and putting an end to traditional rivalry games that are fan favorites, Emmert said. But that idea is rejected by one of O'Bannon's lawyers, Bill Isaacson. ""The millions of sports fans who watch these games and everyone at the networks that broadcasts them knows that the games will continue to be played,"" he said. Corporate sponsorships are everywhere . It's the one thing that all sides seem to agree about: Commercialism is all over college sports with corporate branding and endorsements rife. O'Bannon's lawyers showed slide after slide of athletes in corporate-sponsored ads or near logos. They're arguing that student athletes who currently get no money should get some of the revenue they help to generate -- either before or after graduation. But if O'Bannon's side won, both sides agree it could open the door for college athletes in every sport -- not just the revenue generators of football and basketball -- to make money from endorsement deals and product branding. Emmert, on the stand, said he was disturbed by the level of corporate sponsorship, but said the schools set the rules, and that they need the money to support larger-than-life programs. ""It's not something I'm personally comfortable with,"" Emmert said. ""It's certainly not where I would prefer the rules be drawn."" Internal disputes and slips . Even within the NCAA there appears to be disagreement over the way athletes are treated, and O'Bannon's lawyers sought to make hay from some apparently contradictory discussion. ""The notion that athletes are students is the great hypocrisy of intercollegiate sports,"" wrote Wallace Renfro, former NCAA vice president, in one e-mail. They presented another internal document saying the ""law may also be on the student-athlete's side"" when it comes to the use of their names, images and likeness. And then there were the verbal slips during testimony. Emmert used the term ""full-time athletes"" instead of ""full-time students."" And Neal Pilson, a former CBS executive called to the stand by the NCAA, called Alabama's football team ""the strongest possible school in terms of pro football."" On a more serious note, everyone seemed to admit that schools simply don't stick to the 20-hour-a-week rule that is supposed to limit time devoted to sport. Something even bigger lying in wait . If Judge Claudia Wilken rules in favor of O'Bannon, there will likely be an appeal, but it could still count as a legal precedent for now. Soon, Wilken could also hear the ""big one,"" filed by sports attorney Jeffrey Kessler, who's arguing for a free market in collegiate sports similar to the NFL and NBA. The Kessler suit is the best current chance college athletes have of being paid the big bucks, through salaries or signing bonuses. Picking a college could begin to look like the NFL or NBA draft, with 17- and 18-year-olds coming out of high school with million-dollar contracts to play ball. ""My instinct is more in the hundreds of thousands, but if there is a Reggie Bush, someone who would essentially be a first draft pick if there was a draft, maybe it would be close to a million,"" said Michael McCann, director of the Sports and Entertainment Law Institute at the University of New Hampshire. ""I think that would be an exception to a rule, if there's some star."" The main difference between the O'Bannon and the Kessler cases: O'Bannon would put a smaller amount of money into the pockets of more players. Players band together, so do schools . NCAA reformists are coming to each other's aid. For example, Ed O'Bannon's lawyers filed 1,000 pages of exhibits and documents to help students make their case in the Northwestern union appeal. And Kessler is working closely with the College Athletes Players Association -- the group behind the Northwestern union attempt. But the other side is mobilizing too. In the Northwestern case, eight other schools -- including powerhouses Stanford and USC -- filed a brief in support of Northwestern's attempt to stop the union. And, even if the athletes win in the courtroom, the decision will be left to the schools, which are likely to listen to fans. A recent poll by the Saint Leo University Polling Institute showed that 66% of Americans don't think athletes should be paid with more than scholarship money. Paying college athletes would hurt traditions, NCAA chief Emmert testifies .","It's a summer of lawsuits and legal hearings for the college sports governing body .
The key issue is whether student athletes should get more than scholarships .
The NCAA says rivalries, competitions and traditions could all be in jeopardy ."
"(CNN) -- First-term Illinois Republican Sen. Mark Kirk said ""no frickin' way am I retiring"" in an interview with Roll Call published Friday morning, instead clearly signaling his intentions to run for reelection in 2016. His statement comes amid speculation that his health and staff turnover might cause him to step down after his first term. His chief of staff Erik Elk has said he will join the private sector, while other top staffers have joined newly elected GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner's team. And a debilitating stroke in 2012 has caused the senator to occasionally rely on a wheelchair. ""With all this rehab, for me just to walk was a huge effort,"" Kirk told Roll Call. ""I had to re-learn how to walk again after the stroke. And all the rehab and all the effort shows the mental determination times 10 to keep serving."" But Kirk also said that attacks from the left highlighting his previous health problems might actually help his campaign efforts. ""That would not be taken well by the people of Illinois who would not like that kind of attack,"" he said.
