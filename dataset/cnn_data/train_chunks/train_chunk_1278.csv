"Bike helmets are the latest product to get the ‘smart’ upgrade. A team of students has devised a helmet with built-in sensors and smartphone functionality to provide data after a crash. The so-called ‘black box’ helmet can also call emergency services, talk to the cyclist and provide hands-free calling. Scroll down for video . Students at Oregon State University and Intel have devised a 'smart' bike helmet (shown) that collects data during a crash. The 'black box' has accelerometers and sensors to work out what happened. It also records the rider's distance, speed and direction at all times . The helmet was devised by students at Oregon State University in partnership with Intel. Its potentially live-saving features include accelerometers, speakers, a microphone and an LED headlamp. Together the features provide the rider with information while cycling, or data in the event of an accident. In the event of a crash the helmet will also talk to the rider and ask if they are okay. If they say ‘yes’ or fail to respond, emergency services will be contacted on their behalf. Using a synced smartphone as well, the rider can be put through a few quick medical tests to see if they might be badly hurt. All of the data from the crash can then be studied after to understand what happened. The helmet syncs with an app that can provide medical questions to the rider after a crash or call emergency services by asking the rider questions via a speaker (shown above the LED headlamp). And the helmet can also play music or allow for hands-free calling . Inside the 3D-printed outer shell is a regular bike helmet (shown). The product is only in the prototype phase at the moment so no potential release date or price has been announced . - Bluetooth radio . - Magnetometer . - Gyroscope . - Two accelerometers to detect a sudden impact . - Communications hardware to call pre-set emergency contact number . - Above-the-ear speakers . - Microphone . - LED headlight . The helmet syncs with an Android app on smartphones to transfer data. This includes distance, speed and the direction a rider has taken. The main feature, though, is to know what happened after a crash. ‘If my kids get into a crash, we will never know what happened,’ said Abhay Dharmadhikari, a technologist and architect in the Device Development Group for Intel, to Intel Free Press. ‘Did they hit their heads? Did they get really injured? Because when they come back [after biking] they just say “I got hurt,” so we aren’t really sure how bad it was. ‘Could we build something that would help us understand; [and] if a crash happens, the helmet can act like a black box?’ In addition the technology built into the helmet, such as the microphone and speakers, it has other functions too. For example, the speakers can be used to play music without covering the rider’s ears or for hands-free calling. The circuitry is stored in the back of the helmet (the white section in the image above). The technology built into the helmet, such as the microphone and speakers, has other functions as well. For example, the speakers can be used to play music without covering the rider’s ears or for hands-free calling.

"A potential match fixer has been caught on film suggesting he could arrange a yellow card during a World Cup game for more than £41,000 and a penalty for £81,000. Football agent Henry Chukwuma Okoroji was caught telling an undercover reporter that he could fix games and organise certain outcomes during the tournament which starts in Brazil later this month. It comes just days after the National Crime Agency (NCA) investigated allegations that a friendly between Nigeria and Scotland had been targeted by criminal syndicates. Plot: A Nigerian football agent has claimed that he could arrange a yellow card for £40,000 and a red card for £80,000 during this summer's World Cup . Speaking from a hotel room in Milan, Italy, the businessman and his associate, only known as Joe, told the reporter a list of prices he would have to pay for . different outcomes, including a a red card. He said a yellow card would set them back 50,000 euros (£40,660) and a penalty 100,000 euros (£81,370). In an attempt to enhance their credibility, the pair also invited Lazio and Nigerian footballer Ogenyi Onazi to the meeting, however there is no suggestion he was involved any fixing plot. Speaking to The Sun's undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood, Okoroji said he had already recruited two Nigerian players for this summer's tournament and was planning to fly to Brazil to oversee his scams during the tournament. The agent said: 'Hundred per cent, two players. It's left up to you people what you want to do. You will pay for a yellow or a red card or a penalty.' After making the offer, Okoroji rang a prominent Nigerian player and claimed he had agreed to take part in the fix. But Okoroji said: 'The player cannot come because of his career, which is true. These things you cannot speak on the phone because they are monitoring, all agents, are monitoring his calls. Okoroji claims he was a professional footballer and got into match-fixing after he was approached as a player. During the conversation with the paper, he also said he could speak to a senior figure in the Nigerian Football Federation to influence squad selection for forthcoming tournament. Duped: Lazio player Ogenyi Onazi was prompted into coming to the meeting in a bid to enhance the agent's credibility. He is not thought to be involved in the plot . A spokesman for the NCA, who are now said to be investigating the claims,  said: 'The . NCA will from time to time provide operational detail necessary for . public reassurance purposes.' 'It . does not routinely confirm or deny the existence of specific operations . or provide ongoing commentary on operational activity.' The tournament begins in two weeks and England's first game is against Italy on June 13. Last week an investigation was launched over claims of attempted match-fixing for the World Cup friendly between Scotland and Nigeria. In April 13 professional footballers were arrested in connection with alleged spot-fixing and another six . rearrested over the claims. Despite the allegations, England are confident . the game at its highest levels is clean of the scourge of match-fixing, a . survey conducted by international players' union FIFPro has revealed. Over . 1,500 players from eight countries - England, Scotland, Finland, . Greece, Hungary, Italy, Romania and Slovenia - submitted responses to a . questionnaire that tested their knowledge about the extent of fixing, . approaches to fix matches, sharing inside information and betting rules. There have been a series of arrests . following suspected attempts to fix matches in the lower English . football leagues in recent months. There have also been allegations of . illicit activity in cricket.

"Italy's European Championship qualifier with Croatia at the San Siro was suspended after 75 minutes as Croatia fans threw flares and fireworks on to the San Siro pitch, leaving the stadium covered with smoke. The referee marched the players down the tunnel with the score at 1-1 as the smoke continued to grow and riot police attempted to restrain the Croatian supporters. UEFA are expected to launch an investigation into the incidents at the San Siro in the coming days. The players were off the field for 10 minutes before they returned to the pitch after emergency services extinguished and removed the flares.

Speaking on ITV4, former Croatia boss Slaven Bilic said: 'It's (crowd trouble and flares being thrown) a big problem, not only in Croatia but definitely there.' Croatia and Italy are now level on 10 points at the top of 2016 European Championship qualifier Group H, with Norway just one behind. The game itself was a pacey first-half which only slowed with the interruptions for the flares. Italy were ahead after only 11 minutes when Candreva picked up the ball on the edge of the box and fired a low shot into the bottom left-hand corner of the net. But Croatia responded just four minutes later. It was a blunder which led to the equaliser, as veteran goalkeeper Gianliugi Buffon let Perisic's shot go under his gloves and into the back of the net. Unfortunately for Croatia, their play slowed once Luka Modric was taken off after 28 minutes with an injury. The visitors were impressive, however, and enjoyed the bulk of possession at the San Siro on Sunday night. Southampton's Graziano Pelle came on to make another appearance for Italy but he was unable to find a winner for the home side.

"As the warmer months approach, experts warn that Australians are risking giving themselves food poisoning by ignoring expiry dates and storage or cooking instructions on food labels. Alarming statistics show that only just over half of 1200 Australians surveyed always comply with used by dates and less than half of the consumers abide by best before warnings. Dr Michael Eyles, council chair of Food Safety Information Council which was commissioned to do the Newspoll survey, described the results as disturbing. Ignoring cooking instructions creates a particularly high risk of food poisoning from goods with egg products (left) poultry and minced (left) or cubed meats . ‘Frightening is not too strong a word to describe other results, including that only a third (33 per cent) of people always read and comply with storage instructions and a meagre 14 per cent always read and comply with cooking instructions,' Dr Eyles elaborated. While an astounding 86 per cent of people surveyed don’t always read and comply with cooking instructions which is: ‘far too high and creates a serious food poisoning risk, especially for poultry, minced or cubed meats, or egg products,’ Dr Eyles said. Dr Eyles said following storage instructions was essential with perishable food . ‘Refrigerate after opening’, ‘keep frozen’ or ‘refrigerate under 4°C’ must be followed or food poisoning bacteria will grow quickly,’ he warned. 86 per cent of people surveyed don’t always follow cooking instructions while only three in 10 use insulated bags to carry their refrigerated goods home from the shops . Only three in 10 people use insulated bags to carry their refrigerated goods home from the shops . Storage of food in the correct temperature was also an issue with only three in 10 people using insulated bags to carry their refrigerated goods home from the shops. Dr Eyles hoped other shoppers would follow the lead of the smart consumers who had the foresight to take coolers when shopping their cold items. ‘Refrigerated food can warm quickly into the temperature danger zone (5° to 60°C) where food poisoning bacteria can grow,’ he said. ‘This is especially risky for foods that won’t be cooked again such as sliced deli meats, pate, prepared salads, cut fruits and soft cheeses.’ The good news is that more than eight in 10 (83 per cent) of surveyors said the last time they bought refrigerated items it took less than 30 minutes to get the food from the store to their fridge with nearly everyone else getting the food home in under an hour.","About half of 1200 Australians surveyed always comply with expiry dates .

Riley Fox was in his neighbour’s garden with five other children when the animal, believed to be a Rhodesian Ridgeback-pitbull cross, clamped its jaws around his face. Pictures taken after the attack in Widnes show the little boy with gaping holes in his cheek and deep cuts around his eye and mouth. His father Tony, 28, said: 'If it had bitten him a couple of inches lower it would have ripped his throat out.' Riley Fox was in his neighbour’s garden with five other children when the animal called Mac (right), believed to be a Rhodesian Ridgeback-pitbull cross, clamped its jaws around his face . The child was attacked last week by the dog called Mac - which has since been put down. His mother Sam, 22, was at another neighbour’s house having a cup of tea at the time of the attack. Mr Fox said: 'All the kids were playing together. Everyone’s doors were open because it was so warm. 'Then all of a sudden people could hear screaming. The dog had hold of Riley’s head and was ragging him about. Pictures taken after the attack in Widnes show the little boy with gaping holes in his cheek and deep cuts around his eye and mouth . 'One of the neighbours was dragging the dog off him. He was covered in blood. They were holding towels up to Riley’s face, three of them were soaked in his blood.' He added: 'When I got back it was just horrific - his cheek was hanging off his face, his eye and lips were all sliced open. He very nearly lost his eye.' Mr Fox added that they waited 25 minutes for an ambulance to arrive, when his son was taken to Alder Hey Children's hospital in Liverpool where he underwent emergency surgery. He said: 'When they were treating him they found a piece of the dog’s tooth in his face.' Mr Fox said his son was due to start school next month and had been very brave. He said: 'We don’t want him to have a complex about dogs. His nan and grandad used to have a big German Shepherd so he’s grown up with dogs.' The dog’s owner has since apologised and the dog has been destroyed. He said: 'He was at work, it was a relative who should have been keeping the dog under control.' He added: 'There should be a register for these dogs and they shouldn’t be allowed around kids.' Cheshire Police said they were investigating the attack.","Riley Fox was .

"A prominent Los Angeles superior court judge, who is black, has filed a complaint against the UCLA Police Department for excessive force after he was roughed up during a routine traffic stop. David Cunningham III, 60, was leaving an L.A. Fitness in Westwood on Saturday morning when he was pulled over by campus police for not wearing his seat belt. In his complaint, Cunningham claims that he was in the process of buckling his belt after paying a parking attendant when a UCLA police cruiser stopped his Mercedes. David Cunningham III, 60, has filed a complaint against UCLA police after he claims they used excessive force when they arrested him on Saturday morning for not wearing his seat belt . When Cunningham reached into his glove box for his vehicle registration, Officer Kevin Dodd told him ‘not to move,’ and when a bottle of prescription pills Cunningham uses for his heart fell out of his vehicle, the officer accused him of being a drug dealer, NBC4 reports. Then, after telling Officer Dodd he needed to step outside of the car to look for the proof of insurance and registration the officer demanded, Cunningham claims he was ‘pushed up against a patrol car, handcuffed, and told he was under arrest.’ Cunningham's lawyer, Albert Douglas, claimed that Cunningham has not filed a racial discrimination suit against campus police, but did acknowledge the possibility of race being a factor in the incident. ‘He lost his cool,’ Douglas told the L.A. Times. ‘He began yelling about police brutality and about being a 60-year-old man slapped in handcuffs in the back of a patrol car for not wearing a seat belt. A crowd was gathering and he demanded they call a watch commander.’ Cunningham has not filed a racial discrimination suit against campus police, but his lawyer did acknowledge the possibility of race being a factor in the incident . A police sergeant was called to the scene and, after arriving ten minutes later, ordered Cunningham to be released. The police department has issued a response acknowledging that Cunningham was pulled over and handcuffed, but had no further comment regarding the incident. Cunningham is a prominent voice in L.A. judicial circles and was also the former president of the Los Angeles Police Commission, a civilian-led group that oversees the LAPD.","David Cunningham III was pulled over by police on Saturday morning for not wearing his seat belt .

"Real Madrid's relentless drive to dominate football for the next decade shows no signs of abating. Far from resting on their Champions League laurels they are about to sign 18-year-old Marco Asensio from Mallorca, snatching him from Barcelona in the process. The Spain Under 19 midfielder is a Barça fan and looked destined to switch to the Nou Camp in the summer but amid suggestions Barcelona wanted to pay in instalments, Real  have since stepped in with a firm £3million  offer to grab him from their rivals. VIDEO Scroll down for Marco Asensio scores with a cheeky chip during Spain U19s training . Marco Asensio (right) jostles for possession as the Spain Under 19 team play Germany in a friendly . Asensio (centre) will spend the rest of the season on loan at Mallorca before joining up with Real . The player was also being monitored by Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea. 'I have decided to go to Madrid and I am happy with my decision,' he said on Sunday night after appearing for Mallorca against Sporting Gijon. The player will stay at Mallorca until the end of this campaign on loan. Real will take him back at the end of the season but Mallorca will be able to take another Real  youth teamer on loan in his place as part of the deal. The skilful left-footed midfielder is so highly rated by Real  that they have included a clause in his contract that for an extra 800,000 euros (£635,000) they can take him in January and fast-track him straight into their first team squad if they are hit by injuries between now and the closing of the winter transfer window. The move is not just a success for Real  but another failure for Barcelona who looked close to signing the player in the summer only to miss out six months later. Asensio was called up to Spain's Under 19 last month and is expected to be fast-tracked to the Under 21 team as they rebuild after their failure to reach the U21 European Championship. Sergio Canales' move to Real did not work out and he is now at Real Sociedad under David Moyes . Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has the option to bring midfielder Asensio to the club in January . He must now work to ensure his dream move doesn't end as Sergio Canales' did. He was signed by Madrid in similar circumstances in January 2010 from Racing Santander. He stayed there until the end of the season and joined Real the following summer. But the 19-year-old failed to develop at Madrid where first-team chances among so many big signings were few and far between. Jose Mourinho picked him in his first game in charge, against Mallorca, but he soon fell out of favour and injuries also became a problem. Aged 23, Canales is now at Real Sociedad under David Moyes. Real hope this time the boy wonder will fulfil his potential and not have to leave Madrid to do so.","Marco Asensio is a Barcelona fan and seemed set to join from Mallorca .

"Fearsome: But a study shows that Japan's samurai . warrior caste was brought down by a fashion for lead-based make up . among their women . The fierce Samurai warriors of Japan feared no-one and lived in the hope of dying as heroes in battle. But in the end they were done for by ... make-up. Researchers have found that children of the samurai class suffered severe lead poisoning because of the cosmetics used by their mothers and grew up deformed, disabled and backward. These handicaps left them unable to cope with political crises, leading to instability that led to the eventual downfall of their feudal system, the study claims. Tamiji Nakashima of Japan's University of Occupational and Environmental Health studied the bones of Samurai children and adults to discover their cause of death. Based on chemical and X-ray analysis, the bones of the children in the study contained levels of lead dozens of times higher than both the male and female adults, the researchers told Germany‘s Der Spiegel magazine. 'The median value for the children three years of age and under was over fifty times higher than that of their mothers,' it said. White facial powder used by the women was the cause. 'During the Edo period, cosmetics became popular and the vogue was usually introduced by actors, courtesans and geisha, through prints and popular literature, and by beauticians who helped establish fashions,' the researchers said. 'The white face powders used in those days were made from mercury chloride and white lead. Lead levels in the bones of adult women were roughly double those of men in the study. 'And their breast milk was likely highly-contaminated, leading to the very severe lead levels in the youngest children. 'The high lead concentrations in the samurai children of the Edo period may have left them intellectually incapable of dealing with the final political crisis between 1853–1867, resulting in the downfall of the Shogunate. 'A ruling class afflicted with brain damage isn't a recipe for success. As samurai were the ruling class, severe political insecurity could develop when highly lead-contaminated samurai children grew up.' Modern geisha's parade in Tokyo: But the fashion for pale make-up made with lead and mercury begun by their forebears in the Edo period meant women from the upper echelons contaminated their children causing the youngsters to suffer a range of ill-effects that led to learning disabilities and behavioural problems . According to the World Health Organisation, lead causes a variety of ill effects, and is particularly harmful to children. Too much lead damages the nervous and reproductive systems, causes high blood pressure and anaemia, and accumulates in the bones. Although lead poisoning was among the first known environmental hazards, from ancient times right up until relatively recently people were fond of its diverse uses and believed they could minimise the risk. Many believed that limiting exposure would limit the danger to health, without realising that everyday low-level exposure to it made them vulnerable to chronic lead poisoning. The Romans used lead extensively in building aqueducts from about 500BC to 300AD, despite Julius Caesar's engineer Vitruvius reporting that 'water is much more wholesome from earthenware pipes'. It is even thought lead poisoning may have contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire. Throughout the Middle Ages, the metal continued to be widely used for a range of applications, but it wasn't until the Industrial Revolution that lead poisoning became common in the work setting. The introduction of lead paint for residential use in the 19th century increased childhood exposure to lead; for millennia before this, most lead exposure had been occupational. Toxicity in children from lead paint was finally recognised in 1897 and France, Belgium, and Austria banned white lead interior paints in 1909; the League of Nations followed suit in 1922. However, in the U.S., laws banning lead house paint were not passed until 1971, and it was phased out and not fully banned until 1978. The 20th century saw an increase in worldwide lead exposure levels due to the increased widespread use of the metal. From the Twenties, lead was added to petrol to improve its combustion and lead from exhaust fumes persists today in soil. The levels found today in most people are orders of magnitude greater than those of pre-industrial society.  Due to reductions of lead in products and the workplace, acute lead poisoning is rare in most countries today. However, low-level lead exposure is still common. It is especially harmful to the developing brains of foetuses and young children, with it interfering with the metabolism of calcium and Vitamin D and causing irreversible effects including learning disabilities, behavioural problems and mental retardation. At very high levels lead poisoning causes convulsions, coma and, eventually, death. Dr Nakashima's team studied the bones of children who lived as far back as 400 years ago during Japan's Edo period, when the country was ruled by a series of shoguns who presided over a feudal system upheld by the Samurai caste. After sampling the lead in their rib bones and taking X-rays of some of the youngsters' long arm and leg bones they found children with enough lead in their systems to cause severe intellectual impairment. Those under three were the worst off, with a median level of 1,241 micrograms of lead per gram of bone - more than 120 times the level thought to cause neurological and behavioural problems. With global lead pollution much lower in the before the beginning of the industrial revolution, Dr Nakashima's researchers surmised that the contamination must have been caused by the make-up worn by women of the Samurai caste. His study showed that the women of the era had far higher levels of lead in their bones than men, and this contamination was passed on to youngsters while nursing. Their analysis of the bones of those who didn't make it adulthood suggested that many who survived their childhood probably suffered from severe intellectual impairment, LiveScience reported. 'We assume that facial cosmetics were one of the main sources of lead exposure among the samurai class because they were luxuries at that time,' Dr Nakashima told LiveScience. 'The lower class people (farmers and fishermen) did not have the luxury of using cosmetics and the laws strictly prohibited [them] from using cosmetics because they were workers.'","Samurai women's fashion for lead-based facial cosmetics affected their children through breast milk .

"When an octopus needs to make a quick escape, it propels itself through the water at speeds of up to 25mph (40km/h). Inspired by these superfast, underwater movements, researchers from Greece have developed a robotic version of the tentacled creature. Complete with webbed arms and a streamlined head, the robotic octopus travels at half its 14-inch (360mm) body length every second. Scroll down for video . The robotic octopus was developed by the Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas in Greece. Early experiments used thin, silicon arms to propel the robot through water, but the team has since added ‘webs’ (pictured) to increase speed. It now travels at half its 14-inch (360mm) body length per second . It was developed by the Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (Forth) in Greece. Early experiments used thinner, silicon arms to propel the robot through water, but the team has since added ‘webs’ between these arms to increase speed. The octopus uses a number of methods to explore the ocean. One method is similar to walking, or crawling, along the sea bed using rows of suckers on the underside of each arm. To move through water faster, the sea creatures expel trapped water  through their funnels. This propels the octopus in the opposite direction, at speeds of up to 25 mph (40 km/h). The octopus changes direction by pointing its funnel in different ways. The eight-armed robot was presented at the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems. The research was led by Dimitris Tsakiris was a finalist for two different best paper awards at the conference in Chicago earlier this month. According to the team’s tests, the robotic octopus swims at just over 3.9 inches (10cm) per second when fitted with silicon arms only. However, adding webs between these arms increases the speed to 7 inches (18cm) – or half its body length - per second. In addition, the robot’s efficiency - the ratio of the energy exerted compared to the resulting speed – is improved with the webs. A video of the robot reveals these speed differences, and shows the robot octopus crawling through the water in a tank. The octopus (stock image) uses a number of methods to explore the ocean. One method is similar to walking, or crawling, along the sea bed using rows of suckers on the underside of each arm. To move through water faster, the creatures expel trapped water through their funnels, to reach speeds of up to 25 mph (40 km/h) It also shows the robotic octopus carrying a ball, swimming in the sea, and being followed by small fish. As a result, the researchers claim the robot could be used to monitor fish numbers and underwater environment, in a more discreet way. ‘The eight-arm robot is inspired by the morphology and outstanding locomotor capabilities of the octopus,’ explained the researchers in their paper. ‘Underwater experiments demonstrate a novel mode of underwater propulsion by combining various patterns of sculling movements of the arms and web, and the efficiency of the swimmer, especially with the addition of the web, in terms of the attained velocities, the generated propulsive forces and the cost of transport.’ The paper is named 'Multi-arm Robotic Swimming With Octopus-Inspired Compliant Web'. According to the research team’s tests, the robot octopus swims at just over 3.9 inches (100mm) per second when fitted with silicon arms only. Adding webs increases the speed to 7 inches (180mm) – or half its body length per second.  A video of the robot also shows it carrying a ball in its arms (screengrab pictured)","Robot was built by the Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas .

"Just how regularly is Earth struck by asteroids? If your answer is ‘not very often’ then this interactive map might change your mind. Created by Simon Rogers, for MailOnline, the incredible animation below lets you scroll and zoom around the world as meteorite impacts from recorded history unfold before your eyes. Meanwhile, in an effort to mitigate against another devastating impact in future, a Nasa contest seeking the public’s help to track incoming space rocks has entered its next phase. This interactive map made by Simon Rogers using CartoDB shows where asteroids have impacted on land since January 1009 AD. Water impacts, which make up the majority of impact events, are not included . The map was created by data journalist Simon Rogers, and shows where asteroids have impacted over the last thousand years. An asteroid is a large chunk of rock left over from collisions or the early solar system. Most are located between Mars and Jupiter in the Main Belt. A comet is a rock covered in ice, methane and other compounds. Their orbits take them much further out of the solar system. A meteor is what we call a flash of light in the atmosphere when debris burns up. This debris itself is known as a meteoroid. Most are so small they are vapourised in the atmosphere. If any of this meteoroid makes it to Earth, it is called a meteorite. Meteors, meteoroids and meteorites normally originate from asteroids and comets. Scrolling around the world, you can see where some of the biggest hotspots are. And it also highlights how vulnerable our planet is to asteroids. Nasa estimates that just 1 per cent of the millions of asteroids in our solar system have been found. But, although you can see recorded impacts on land in these animations, most asteroids that encounter Earth either explode in the atmosphere or land at sea. This means the vast majority are unrecorded and, as we don't know the location of every asteroid in the solar system, we're not sure when one will next it. The potential for an asteroid to wipe out life on Earth has been highlighted recently by Nasa and other agencies. In late April, an organisation of former astronauts known as the B612 Foundation announced that we are hit by asteroids more often than thought. They found 26 instances of explosions larger than nuclear bombs, mostly in the upper atmosphere, that had occurred since 2000. A previous map made by Rogers (above, click and hold to move) shows the sizes of asteroid impacts around the world over about 4,000 years, although this map does not have the time-lapse functionality . Barringer Crater in Arizona, pictured, is the largest impact crater in the United States. It is 0.737 miles (1.186 kilometres) across and is believed to be about 50,000 years old. It is thought to have been formed by a meteorite about 165 feet (50 metres) in diameter . This followed an announcement by Nasa in March that they would begin crowdsourcing ideas to track and monitor asteroids. Known as the Asteroid Grand Challenge, the series of contests offer $35,000 in various awards to people who can develop algorithms to identify asteroids. Last Friday, the competition passed part of phase one’s goal of developing an algorithm. 422 from countries – from Argentina to Zimbabwe – submitted their algorithms to Nasa. On 19 May the next phase of the contest takes place, tasking contestants with submitting their algorithms for analysis. Nasa is planning a total of 10 contests this year. This illustration shows the approximate size comparisons of two asteroids. On the left is the estimated size of the meteorite that caused the Barringer crater with a diameter of 165 feet (50 metres), while on the right is the Chelyabinsk meteor with diameter of 55 feet (17 metres) that fell over Russia last year . ‘For the past three years, Nasa has been learning and advancing the ability to leverage distributed algorithm and coding skills through the Nasa  Tournament Lab to solve tough problems,"" the lab's director, Jason Crusan, said in a statement. ‘We are now applying our experience with algorithm contests to helping protect the planet from asteroid threats through image analysis.’ The algorithms will not only identify asteroids but, it is hoped, discern their size and shape. This will enable Nasa to decide if they pose a significant threat to Earth or not. According to the B612 Foundation, we need to detect city-killer asteroids decades in advance if we hope to deflect them away from our planet. Methods of deflecting asteroids have not yet been tested, but using impactors to alter their trajectory or ‘space tugs’ to pull them out of Earth’s path have been suggested.","Data journalist Simon Rogers has created an interactive asteroid map .

"A fleet of kamikaze spacecraft could be used to defend Earth against asteroid strikes. The robotic vessels would change the direction of any threatening space rock to prevent it from crashing into the planet. The prediction came as the UN discussed plans for an international asteroid defence network. Scroll down for video... The United Nations will be leading international efforts on plans to defend the Earth from asteroids . Elements of the plan, introduced last . week, have now been approved by the United Nations and could be . implemented as early as December. The plan aims to create an International Asteroid Warning Network so countries can share what they know about asteroids. It . will also organise groups of scientists’ from various space agencies to . think up ways in which smaller asteroids can be diverted away from . Earth. A meteor, or asteroid fragment, that exploded over Russia in February injured more than 1,000 people. Scientists estimate there are a . million asteroids big enough to destroy New York, and that an object big . enough to threaten civilisation comes along once every few million . years. The veteran Nasa astronaut Tom Jones . advocates defending the planet by using ‘a fleet of robot spacecraft to . slam into the asteroids’ to deflect them. Other options include using a ‘gravity tractor’ to tow asteroids off course and pummelling them with paintballs. The option of blowing them up,  as in the Bruce Willis film Armageddon, is likely to be the last resort. But Sergio Camacho-Lara, of the UN . Office for Outer Space Affairs, said: ‘The asteroids are there. It’s a . question of finding them before they find us.’ Professor Richard Crowther, of the UK Space Agency, said: ‘It is always good to rehearse these things well in advance.’ The worry is specifically on smaller asteroids – those that are more than 450 feet across but smaller than 1 kilometre (0.6 miles). More than 1,600 people were injured by the shock wave from the explosion, estimated to be as strong as 20 Hiroshima atomic bombs, as it landed near the city of Chelyabinsk . Nasa claims astronomers have detected . more than 10,000 asteroids with orbits that could potentially bring . them closer, or in contact, with Earth since 1995. Around 9 per cent of these are believed to be around 3,000 feet long, according to reports in The Atlantic. The most threatening of these, . predicted to strike only once every 700,000 to 100 million years, could . desolate the planet. This impact would be similar to that caused by the asteroid thought to have killed . off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. A 60-foot asteroid damaged around 4,000 buildings in Russia when it exploded over the town . of Chelyabinsk earlier this year. Yet, objects this large are said . to only plummet to earth once every 100 years or so. Rocks around 460ft long, that would have 300 megatons of force, hit every 30,000 years. Existing telescopes were unable to warn of the Chelyabinsk meteor, which released 440 kilotons of explosive energy and injured more than a thousand people. The first that most space agencies heard of the impact was through Twitter and Facebook. ‘Because near-Earth asteroid searches have focused almost exclusively on large objects with global destructive potential, 99 per cent of the objects big enough to level a major metropolitan area remain undiscovered,’ the group said in a statement. ‘As technology improves and hundreds of thousands of new asteroids are found, the global community will likely be confronted by one posing a worryingly high probability of striking Earth.’ Last month the U.S. and Russia signed an agreement to develop technology that could one day lead to weapons being used to destroy asteroids hurtling towards Earth. Entitled the 'Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Russian Federation on Cooperation in Nuclear - and Energy-Related Scientific Research and Development', the document provides the legal framework needed to expand cooperation between U.S. and Russian nuclear research laboratories. Nasa claims astronomers have detected more than 10,000 asteroids with orbits that could potentially bring them closer, or in contact, with Earth. Around nine per cent of these are believed to be around 3,000 feet long, according to reports in The Atlantic. This graphic shows the orbits of all the known Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs), numbering over 1,400 as of early 2013. These are the asteroids considered hazardous because they are fairly large (at least 460 feet or 140 meters in size), and because they follow orbits that pass close to the Earth's orbit . The most threatening of these, predicted to strike only once every 700,000 to 100 million years, could desolate the planet - similar to the asteroid believed to have killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. However, as Douglas Birch from the The Center of Public Integrity, explains: 'Even smaller rocks between 460 and 3,170 feet wide can flatten cities or wreak havoc.' The theory has also been used in science fiction films, for example, in the 1998 blockbuster film Armageddon, an asteroid the size of Texas threatens earth and a team of astronauts, led by Bruce Willis, fly towards it and blow it up.

"England squeaked past the 10 men of Estonia and here, Martin Keown gives his verdict on what they did well and where it went wrong. Jack Wilshere is praised, Danny Welbeck and Leighton Baines come in for criticism... but there is encouragement for goalscorer Wayne Rooney. JACK THE LAD'S ENGLAND'S MIDDLE MAN . There was a lot of rotation in the midfield diamond, but Jack Wilshere needs to become the main man in the holding role. VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Wilshere say he is still learning his deeper role for England . Jack Wilshere drives England forward but would be better in the holding midfield role . It used to be a defensive position but players like Andrea Pirlo have made it so technical. Jack is our most technically gifted player so it makes sense for him to play there. On Sunday evening he was fluid in attack and was involved all over the pitch, as his touch map (right) shows. He also had more touches (66) in the opposition half than in his own (36). That’s fine against 10-man Estonia but there needs to be a balance. Too much rotation and the midfield becomes a carousel that better teams will exploit. UP THE PACE TO BREAK DOWN 10 MEN . When you are playing 10 men, you need to move the ball more quickly to work your opponents across the pitch. England should have tried to restrict themselves to two touches before moving it on. Estonia never looked isolated and that is more our fault than their ability. WELBECK HAS TO BE MORE SELFISH . Sometimes Danny Welbeck is too honest for his own good. He’s such a willing runner for the team but I’d like to see him be more selfish. It’s difficult with two up front but most of his good work was done out wide, away from that central position where can do the damage. Danny Welbeck down after being fouled - sometimes he needs to stop running and stay in a central position . Wayne Rooney misses a chance to double England's lead in added time - but he did earlier score the winner . ROONEY'S OUR LEADER - DON'T HAMMER HIM . I don’t think we should be too harsh on Wayne Rooney. He missed some good chances but he is our captain and scored an important goal. Playing abroad is always a test, especially with a young team, and Rooney is our leader. BAINES NEEDS TO PLAY WITH MORE FREEDOM . Leighton Baines needs to take the handbrake off. For Everton he is such a creative force but in an England shirt he loses that freedom. On the opposite flank Calum Chambers may have given the ball away, but he kept going even when things went wrong. Baines needs to show more because his attacking instincts make him the player he is for Everton. Leighton Baines (centre), reacting to a decision given against him, plays with less freedom for England .","Jack Wilshere is England's most technically gifted player .

"Eight women badminton players have been thrown out of the Olympics in disgrace for deliberately trying to lose their games. Yesterday’s mass disqualification is unprecedented at an Olympic Games and followed uproar among 16,000 spectators, who booed their disgust at the players in the Wembley Arena on Tuesday night. Four pairs – two from South Korea and one each from China and Indonesia – went to extraordinary lengths to avoid winning. Scroll down for video .

World doubles champions Yu Yang (front) and Wang Xiaoli, of China, watch as the shuttlecock yet again lands int he net . The players had all qualified for the . quarter-finals of the women’s doubles and were accused of trying to . manipulate the draw by losing so they would be matched with easier . opposition in the next round or avoid playing their teammates. Amid shameful and embarrassing scenes, . players were deliberately serving into the net or hitting the . shuttlecock over the court’s lines. The longest rally in one set lasted . just four shots. As a furious backlash grew, Lord Coe, head of London 2012, described the players’ actions as ‘depressing and unacceptable’. The spotlight will be on the Chinese, who dominate world badminton but have been accused of manipulation before. Petya Nedelcheva, a Bulgarian player . who was on an adjacent court at the time of the first match, said . Chinese players routinely tried to avoid playing each other.

"The vibrant sounds and smells of Botswana had been calling me back since I first visited the Okavango Delta area in 2011 - the year after I won Olympic gold in the skeleton at the Vancouver Olympics. I was in Botswana filming a survival reality TV show and after it was over I stayed in touch with Robert Barber, one of the guides who had helped train us for the show. He kept telling me amazing stories of the incredible areas of Botswana that I should come back and visit one day. I couldn't resist, and three years later he ended up putting together a personalised safari for me and my fiance, Craig. Amy Williams and her fiance Craig take time for a happy snap while on safari in Botswana . Rob has been guiding safaris in Botswana and throughout Africa for over 10 years. He and his partner Charlotte Bennett-Diver run Golden Africa and they specialise in getting to the core of why people go on safari and what they want to experience. Rob called me one evening and said: 'Right Amy, I'm taking you on a journey, not a holiday.' At Maun airport in northern Botswana - the 'gateway to the Okavango Delta' - Rob and Charlotte loaded us up in their open-sided game-viewing vehicle, I switched off my phone and let the journey begin. Our first destination was Meno A Kwena, in the Kalahari. This quirky, intimate camp run by David Dugmore and his son Daniel sits on top of a 90ft-high cliff, looking down on to the Boteti River at exactly the point where animals come to drink. We were greeted by five bull elephants drinking in the river, with a couple of zebras roaming around close by, and a hippo seeming to watch over all of them from the middle of the river. Williams (left) always wanted to return to Botswana after filming survival TV show Alone In The Wild in 2011 . With a gin and tonic in our hands, we watched a beautiful sunset with the wildlife below. I never realised how alive the bush of Botswana could really be. Meno A Kwena bush camp in the Kalahari, which sits on the top of a 90 foot clifftop and looks down on wild animals of the region as they gather for water . As we awoke the next morning to the sounds of birdlife surrounding us, hot water arrived for our brass bucket showers. These showers are perfectly positioned overlooking the river, giving the most incredible experience of showering while an elephant wanders by 150ft away on the other side of the river. After a hearty breakfast we were off. Rob took us out to the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans, the last remnant of an ancient lake. We arrived at the most incredible setting. As far as the eye could see was endless salt pan. That night, we slept out under the stars, with a view of the milky way all the way to the horizon. In the morning, on our way back to Meno A Kwena, I was excited to hear Rob say he could see some meerkats coming out of their burrow. Meerkats take lots of time to warm up in the early sunshine. We spent quite some time watching them slowly emerge to start their day of foraging. Before leaving Meno A Kwena, Rob took us on a walk with the Khoi San bushmen. The bush is their home, and they gave us a really interesting insight into it. They showed us how they set traps for food, how they make fire, and some of the interesting ways they entertain themselves. They have what I can only describe as a fast-paced version of rock, paper, scissors. We continued our journey to Rob's favourite area within Botswana, Khwai in the north-eastern Okavango Delta. A vehicle cuts a lonely figure on the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans, the last remnant of an ancient lake . I vividly remembered Rob mentioning this area three years previously for being a wildlife paradise - and our drive there showed me he was not wrong. What will always stick in my mind is the magical sight of 12 giraffe silhouettes in the road with the sun setting behind them. We were staying at Machaba Camp run by Chris Kruger, a veteran of the Botswana safari industry. It looks like something from the style pages of a glossy magazine, with all the homely warmth of a country manor, and set in the most beautiful surroundings on the Khwai River. Machaba is also incredibly eco-friendly. It recycles everything and has a practically non-existent footprint, while remaining very luxurious - a perfect balance for me. Williams took a walk with the Khoi San bushmen, who offer a remarkable insight into living off the land . Machaba is situated among the trees at the edge of Khwai River. There is nothing more peaceful and relaxing than having meals while watching elephants drinking, and nothing more thrilling than watching a male and female leopard wandering along the river bank on the other side. Just incredible! The wildlife that Rob had raved about in Khwai did not disappoint. During our three nights there we saw a big male lion hunting a large warthog, a beautiful female leopard waking after a day's sleep, three honey badgers, a pack of wild dogs on the hunt, and a hyena den with five cute youngsters. The next stop in our journey was a real treat for me. Rob wanted to take me back to near where we had been filming three years ago. This time I was going to be horse riding at the quite wonderful African Horseback Safaris camp, Macatoo, where they have 48 of the best looked-after horses I have ever seen. A family of giraffe gather alongside the majestic Khwai River in Botswana . Rides at Macatoo are more adventurous in the mornings than the afternoons, and we took the opportunity to get some speed up in the open floodplains. It is quite incredible to approach buffalo, giraffe, elephants and zebra (my favourites!) on horseback. Macatoo is set in a beautiful area right in the heart of the Okavango Delta, and is only accessible by light aircraft or helicopter. While I was riding, Rob took Craig off for gamedrives, boat cruises or fishing. Every meal was taken out under the beautiful African starry night sky, and all the staff were so welcoming and friendly. We really felt at home here and were very sad to leave. From Macatoo, we flew off to Kasane in the very north of Botswana and then crossed the mighty Zambezi to reach the final destination in our journey, Livingstone, on the Zambian side of Victoria Falls. On our first morning in our very spacious room at Sussi & Chuma lodge, upstream of Victoria Falls, we woke up to the sounds of the Zambezi River. A leopard lazes on a branch - also in the area Williams saw honey badgers, wild dogs and a hyena den . After so much activity and travelling, I was looking forward to a relaxing morning. I went off for a spa treatment overlooking the river and fell asleep in no time. I was ready for this. And it was heavenly. Rob surprised us at lunchtime with a trip into Livingstone, and before we knew it we were being whisked off in a helicopter for a scenic flight over Victoria Falls. It is very easy to see from that perspective why it is one of the seven natural wonders of the world. It is breathtaking. The date happened to be Friday the 13th, and a full moon was due. Late in the afternoon, Rob took us for a walk around the falls and, after exploring for some time, we were surprised to find a small table set up with snacks and champagne. We sipped and nibbled away as the moon rose in the east behind a small cloud bank and created the amazing effect of a rainbow in the spray of Victoria Falls. It was surreal and amazing all at the same time. Elephants get their feet wet in the Okavango Delta . Back at Sussi & Chuma we were waited on like royalty. The food was spectacular in taste and presentation. The staff set up a private dinner for us at the edge of the Zambezi River with a fireplace and yet more champagne. We ate to the sounds of hippos grunting in the distance, the flowing water and the crackling of the fire. It was wonderful. On our last full day, Rob took us to Livingstone Island which sits at the very top of the falls. Here we had a very traditional brunch of eggs Benedict and tea, while being a matter of feet away from the edge of the waterfall. Victoria Falls are a mile wide and Livingstone Island sits about halfway along the top. We were guided to the edge of the falls and given the most incredible view over the brink, looking the 360ft down into the gorge. There is so much spray that there are rainbows all over the place. Winter Olympics gold medallist Williams sets off for glory in Vancouver 2010 and beaming with her gold medal . Before we left Botswana, we headed into the Mosi-Oa-Tunya national park for a walk to find rhinos. This didn't take long as the park is very small and rangers follow the rhino around 24 hours a day, to protect them from poachers. Being so close to such a huge animal on foot, was both exciting and terrifying all at once. We saw seven different rhino, including one very cute baby with its mother. It was also heartening to know that I was contributing in a small way to the value of the rhino as a tourist attraction, rather than as a medicine. Rob and Charlotte had introduced us to a different way of taking a holiday. Our trip to Botswana was, in fact, not just a holiday but a journey full of experiences. We will go back on safari to Africa again one day because I know I will have to feed the piece of my soul that Africa has claimed.

"The AA revealed that traders have caused three steep rises in the cost of petrol this year alone . Speculators and ‘shady middle men’ are driving up petrol prices, a damning report reveals today. As the scandal of alleged price-fixing by major oil companies deepens, the AA reveals how traders are hitting fuel prices – causing three steep rises this year alone and increasing the cost of filling up a family saloon by £5. Few of the traders’ names – including Glencore, Cargill, Gunvor and Trafigura – are known to consumers outside the oil industry, but their effect on Britain’s 33million motorists and the wider economy is profound. They buy huge quantities of petroleum on the open market and store it until the price goes high enough to make them a handsome profit, at which point they sell. Industry experts say motorists have been fleeced by an average of at least £2,000 each and probably much more over the past decade because of the alleged price-fixing now under investigation. But watchdogs should also ‘shine a bright light’ on the activities of speculators chasing ‘inflated short-term profit’, says the AA. The row comes after European Commission investigators raided the London offices of oil companies Shell and BP on Tuesday as part of a price-fixing investigation. The AA says a major international report highlights how the oil markets in Europe had been hijacked by middle-men whose actions increasingly determine the price paid at the pumps. The respected International Energy Agency says: ‘Increased European reliance on trading houses and third-party suppliers may also leave a growing share of European supply in the hands of market participants with a different set of incentives than those of refiners.’ Tory MP Robert Halfon, who has called for an investigation into alleged cartels and market manipulation in the oil market for the past three years, said there must be a full inquiry. Traders such as Cargill buy huge quantities of petroleum and store it until the price soars and then sells . Traders, like Glencore, are not known to consumers but have a profound effect Britain's 33million motorists . The Daily Mail has chronicled the scandal over several years – highlighting in November 2009 how tankers full of oil were parked off the UK coast waiting until the price went up. Now, says the AA, the middle men, or ‘third party suppliers’, have their own tanks to keep the fuel in storage until the price goes up, making the trade ‘less visible’. AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said consumers needed to be assured that the ‘middle men’ were playing fair by the rules – but there was no way of knowing. He added: ‘The EU and competition watchdogs should shine a bright light on the spivs, shady middle men and speculators driving up prices by operating in the shadows of oil giants like BP and Shell. ‘They are just the tip of the iceberg. There are a lot of companies operating in these markets of whom most British consumers have simply never heard. UK petrol consumption fell to a record low this year and the AA said the 'warning signs couldn't be clearer' 'They include Glencore, Cargill, Gunvor, and Trafigura. 'Their trades in unleaded, diesel and oil . are reported daily in the markets. Their activities have a huge impact . on the prices paid at the pumps. But who are they? 'What exactly do they . do and how do they do it? Consumers have a right to know.’ AA head of public affairs Paul Watters added: ‘The latest swing in petrol prices is the third 8p to 10p-a-litre “price shock” in 12 months, adding up to £5 to the cost of filling a typical fuel tank – from £66 to £71. ‘It is clear that, if petrol and diesel wholesale price movements were transparent, families and businesses would have ten to 14 days’ notice of the next price shock – and hopefully the reason for it.’ UK petrol consumption fell to a record low this year, with 69 per cent of AA members cutting back on car use or spending. ‘The warning signs couldn’t be any clearer,’ the association said. The AA’s own fuel price report said: ‘These investigations are a significant development, perhaps a turning point, in getting to the bottom of what drives the price of fuel on UK forecourts.’ Trafigura’s initial response to calls was ‘no comment’, but when given the full outline of the report, a spokesman said he would seek further clarification. Cargill and Glencore did not want to comment.","AA revealed traders caused three steep rises this year alone .

Few of the traders' names, including Glencore, Cargill, Gunvor and Trafigura, are known to consumers, but have profound effect on motorists in Britain .
The Serious Fraud Office last night confirmed it was the ‘appropriate authority to investigate allegations of price-fixing’ and would make a decision on a full investigation in due course. It follows calls from Mr Halfon for UK authorities to begin their own probe. He said: ‘We can’t depend on Europe to sort out allegations of oil fraud.’"
"Anthony Marshall, who served time in prison last year for looting the estate of his multimillionaire philanthropist mother Brooke Astor, has died aged 90. Marshall, a decorated World War II veteran who later became a diplomat and Broadway producer, died on Sunday morning in New York, his attorney Kenneth Warner said. Warner didn't have information on the cause of death, but Marshall had suffered heart problems for years and he was granted medical parole last year after doctors said he had Parkinson's disease. His wife Charlene announced his death in the New York Times on Monday in a cryptic obituary that failed to mention his socialite mother, who passed away in 2007 at the age of 105, or his two adult sons, Philip and Alec, who testified against him in his trial in 2009. Death: Anthony Marshall, pictured with his mother Brooke Astor (center) and wife Charlene (right), at the Plaza Hotel in 2002, has passed away, aged 90. He served time in prison last year for looting his mother's estate . Marshall, who was Astor's only child, was convicted in October 2009 of exploiting his mother's dementia to loot her $200 million fortune in the final years of her life. Prosecutors said that after her Alzheimer's diagnosis, he bought himself lavish gifts, including a $920,000 yacht, with her money. He also took valuable artwork off her walls and engineered changes to her will that gave him control of most of her estate, including millions previously earmarked for her favorite charities. Brooke Astor had married Vincent Astor, a descendant of one of America's first multimillionaires, and gave away eye-watering sums of money to the St Regis Hotel, the New York Public Library and the Metropolitan Art Museum, as well as other charities. She received the nation's top civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and was a fondly regarded fixture in the city's society set. But she was left to spend her last days in allegedly heart-breaking conditions - she was forced to live on pureed peas and oatmeal, while she slept in her own urine at her Park Avenue apartment, according to Marshall's son Philip. Left behind: He is pictured with his wife Charlene in court in 2009. Charlene announced his death in a New York Times obit on Monday - but made no mention of his mother or his two sons from a previous marriage . Philip brought a guardianship case against his father in 2006. The allegations of physical neglect were never substantiated, but they led to the criminal case over Astor's finances. His trial plunged jurors into a world of Park Avenue apartments and sprawling estates. Witnesses included Astor friends Henry Kissinger and Barbara Walters. Locked up: Marshall, pictured in his mug shot, was granted medical parole last year after a fall . Marshall's lawyers said he had the legal power to give himself gifts with his mother's money, and he believed she wanted him to have them. The defense lawyers also argued that Astor was lucid and acting out of love when she altered her will to benefit her son. Jurors disagreed and found Marshall guilty of grand larceny and scheming to defraud. He was sentenced to one to three years in prison - but years of appeals and legal wrangling off his sentence for years. In that time, Marshall urged a judge to spare him a prison sentence. He described in court papers an often sad, if privileged, childhood. He painted his father - Astor's first husband, New Jersey state Sen. J. Dryden Kuser - as an alcoholic who pushed the pregnant Astor down a flight of stairs. After they divorced, Astor married stockbroker Charles Marshall, who virtually banished her son to a series of boarding schools and summer camps, Anthony Marshall claimed. But he could not get out of the prison sentence and, following the delays, he started serving time in June 2013. He was granted medical parole two months later, with a state parole board finding that he was suffering from debilitating and permanent, though not terminal, illness. The board asked whether he had regrets about the events leading to his imprisonment, according to a transcript. 'Well, regrets, yeah,' he said. 'Naturally.' He told parole commissioners he was unable to stand up or walk for long. While he said he was fuzzy about the date and how long he'd been in prison, he said his memory overall was 'fair'. Estranged: His wife Charlene made no mention of his twin sons Alec (left) and Philip (right) in his New York Times obituary on Monday. Both men testified against their father in his 2009 trial . Sentenced: Marshall, who was a U.S. ambassador, is pictured with his wife Charlene in New York Criminal Court in June 2013, when he started his prison sentence. He was released in August 2013 . But when asked whether he recalled the allegations that led to his conviction, he didn't hesitate. 'I remember it,' he said according to a bedside interview with the parole board. 'All too well.' At the time, he told the board he 'loved' his mother and 'found her to be an extraordinary person.' 'We had lots of things in common, particularly a sense of humor, and we went on lots of trips together,' Marshall continued, singling out their frequent summer vacations in Italy. As well as his declining health, the parole board also considered the $14.5 million in restitution he had paid for stealing from his mother to fund a Maine estate and 55ft yacht, among other luxuries. The Astor family made their money in the fur trade in the 1700s. Marshall's step-grandfather, John Jacob Astor, was the wealthiest passenger to die on the Titantic, where he was last seen smoking a cigarette on the top deck. Final years: Marshall's son accused his father of neglecting Astor (pictured left in 1991 and right in 2002, when she was 100) and leaving her to sleep on a urine-soaked bed. The allegations were never substantiated . While his obituary, for which his wife paid, fails to mention his two sons,  it speaks of his fondness for his stepchildren, Arden, Inness and Robert - 'particularly his stepson Robert with whom he formed an everlasting and most loving bond'. It continues: 'During the course of his life, he helped countless young people get their own start in life by introducing them to those who could provide internships or jobs or sometimes he would write a check to tide one over until they could make it on their own. And then he relished in their success.' It lists other achievements including working as a 'talented wildlife photographer... an early conservationist, author of seven books and a highly respected three-time United States Ambassador.' He also served his country as a young Marine, and earned a Purple Heart, before working as a decoder at the State Department, Consulate General to Turkey and then for four decades with the CIA and the U.S. Ambassador to Madagascar, the Seychelles, Trinidad and Tobago, and Kenya. 'Tony had the tenderest of hearts, a brilliant mind and an outrageous sense of humor. It was my honor to love and be loved so tenderly by Tony for more than 25 years,' his wife Charlene wrote.","Tony Marshall was convicted of swindling his mother out of millions after she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in the last few years of her life .

Knight, . 49, was shot at a pre-VMA party hosted by Chris Brown at 1Oak in . West Hollywood in the early hours of Sunday August 24.

"Hearing: Lori Douglas faces losing her job as a Manitoba associate chief justice after her lawyer husband posted sexually explicit photos of her online . A divorce lawyer has told a court how he liked to take sexually explicit photographs of his wife, a senior judge, and post them on an adult dating website. Jack King, from Winnipeg, Canada, has already admitted placing the photos online and harassing a black client to have sex with his wife, Lori Douglas, saying she was seeking an interracial affair. He was last year fined CAD$13,650 ($13,400 / £8,630) by the Law Society of Manitoba after pleading guilty to professional misconduct but kept his licence to practice law. But Ms Douglas still faces losing her job as a Manitoba associate chief justice. Mr King, who has previously . described his behaviour as 'disgraceful', yesterday told a Canadian . Judicial Council inquiry: 'I think it was around 100 to 150 photos. 'A lot of it was weather-related. If it was warm outside, if it was sunny outside, one could be outside naked.' Both . Mr King and Ms Douglas claim that he posted the explicit photos on . adult website DarkCavern.com without her knowledge in 2003 and that she . had no idea he was asking men to have sex with her. The images reportedly showed a naked Ms Douglas posing with sex toys and performing sex acts. Mr . King told the hearing that his wife may not even have been aware that . he kept the photos, which he stashed away in an envelope at the bottom . of his sock drawer. He said: 'I did not tell her that they were there. I deduced that she did not know that they were there.' The scandal started when Mr King represented computer programmer Alexander Chapman in his divorce case. Mr . Chapman said his attorney then sent him explicit photographs of his . wife, as well as links to where they were posted on the adult website in . an ad seeking black or Hispanic men for sex. 'I . wanted to puke,' Mr Chapman said two years ago. 'They were disgusting. I . felt sick because I couldn't believe my lawyer was saying this to me.' Seeking compensation: Alexander Chapman said his divorce lawyer Jack King sent him explicit photographs of his wife, as well as links to where they were posted on an adult website in an ad seeking black or Hispanic men for sex . Mr . Chapman said Mr King spent numerous weeks trying to lure him into . having sex with his wife. He claimed he met the couple - but never took . it any further. He said: 'As a black guy I'm really sad that he looked at me as a sex object.' After . his divorce was finalised in 2003, Mr Chapman told Mr King's law firm - . Thompson Dorfman Sweatman - and was paid CAD$25,000 ($24,500 / £15,800) by his lawyer in . compensation. But Mr . Chapman broke that settlement and went public with the scandal in 2010, . claiming he was 'discouraged by the administration of justice in . Manitoba' in 2003 and seeking CAD$67million ($65.7million / £42.4million) in compensation. After Mr King's disciplinary hearing last year, his wife now faces four allegations, reports the Montreal Gazette. She is accused of sexually harassing . Mr Chapman; failing to disclose the situation when she was interviewed . for judicial appointment in 2005; failing to disclose the full facts to . an inquiry; and that the photos have undermined her ability to act as a . judge. Ms Douglas denies all the charges.","Jack King last year admitted placing photos online and harassing a black client to have sex with his wife .

"Wandering around foreign streets with your head buried in a map or eyes fixated on your phone could be a thing of the past with a GPS jacket that can guide you to your destination. The new wearable technology - called Navigate - does all the navigating itself, and could prove useful for tourists who miss the sights by stopping to read a map or check their smartphone. The jacket works by directing the wearer with subtle vibrations, indicating when they need to turn left or right to get to their desired destination. The GPS jacket looks like any other, but has fantastic advantages for tourists . Could the jacket signal the end of maps and even using our smartphones? The frequency and intensity of each vibration changes based on the intended instruction: soft left, merge left and hard left each differ in body placement and intensity. The Navigate frees up travellers' eyes, so their eyes can be focused ahead, taking in their surroundings as well as being aware. Three cities have been programmed so far - Paris, New York and Sydney - with the French capital being its latest launch, with a blazer-style jacket comes in a red-black-grey combo. Three cities have been trialled so far, Paris, New York and Sydney . Wearable Experiments hope they have got the technology/fashion balance just right with their offerings . To create the jacket, electronic circuits with LEDs were sewn into the sleeves . Billie Whitehouse, co-founder of Wearable Experiments who are designing the jackets, said: 'Our quest to explore the human experience of travel has taken us all over the world, from Hong Kong to the Netherlands to our most recent trip to Paris. The wearer programs their destination using a custom-made mapping app that connects wirelessly to the jacket. As the wearer walks, drives or cycles, the LEDs in the jacket's sleeves light up to warn them they are approaching a turning. Each sleeve is fitted with five lights and the number of lights decrease the closer they get to a turning. When they need to make the turn, the sleeves ‘tap’ them on the shoulder. If the turning is on the left, the left shoulder of the jacket vibrates to tell them to turn, and vice versa if the turning is on the right. 'In our travels, we kept asking ourselves how we can ease the stress of navigating an unfamiliar path without interfering with the experience of discovering a new place. 'These jackets give you the most authentic experience in your city of choice. No longer do you need to be hunched over a map or a smartphone. Now you can experience [travel] as a traveller rather than a tourist.' The hardware for this is embedded in the jacket, and once synced with the Navigate App, and the destination is entered in, it will guide you through to your final destination. The jackets are made to fit in with the current fashion trends, so you won't be left looking obvious as you power your way onward. With the Navigate, haptic vibrations are built into a full physical language, allowing the technology to communicate critical information without interrupting your connection to what you see in front of you.","Wearable Experiments have trialled jacket in Paris, New York and Sydney .

"Adrian stole the show during West Ham United's 9-8 penalty shootout victory over Everton in the FA Cup third round on Tuesday night. The match finished 2-2 after extra-time before Adrian's shootout heroics - the Spaniard saved Steven Naismith's spot-kick before nervelessly slotting home the winning penalty after Toffees goalkeeper Joel Robles had struck the woodwork. Amazingly, Adrian was only signed as back-up to Jussi Jaaskelainen at Upton Park in June 2013. After arriving on a free transfer from Real Betis, the 28-year-old took until the end of 2013 to displace Jaaskelainen as West Ham No 1 - but he has excelled between the sticks since. Here, Sportsmail looks at the 10 best bargain-buy goalkeepers (costing £1.5million or less) in the history of the Premier League... West Ham United goalkeeper Adrian strokes his winning penalty past Everton stopper Joel Robles . Adrian celebrates after sending West Ham through to the FA Cup fourth round . He saved Steven Naismith's penalty earlier on in the dramatic shootout . Shay Given - £1.5m (Blackburn Rovers to Newcastle United) His career may not have gone quite as planned since leaving Newcastle United, but ask anyone on Tyneside about Shay Given and they will rave about a goalkeeper who was quite simply brilliant for the Magpies - and that despite him having previously turned out for Sunderland during a loan spell. Then-Toon boss Kenny Dalglish had been so impressed by Given at Blackburn Rovers that he decided to spend a modest £1.5million to bring the Republic of Ireland international to St James' Park in 1997. In the almost 12 seasons Given spent at Newcastle he kept 91 clean sheets in the Premier League, in spite of the fact he was playing behind a usually dreadful back four, and represented the club in the Champions League, UEFA Cup, as well as the FA Cup final to defeat to Arsenal in 1998. Shay Given signed for Newcastle United from Blackburn Rovers for just £1.5million in 1997 . Given manages to prevent Chelsea's Joe Cole from scoring during a Premier League match in 2008 . Peter Schmeichel - £505,000 (Brondy to Manchester United) When Sir Alex Ferguson describes a transfer as the 'bargain of the century', then you know someone has been a success - and that was exactly what he said about Peter Schmeichel's move from Brondy to Manchester United in 1991. Although Schmeichel arrived the season before the launch of the Premier League (in 1991), his performances for Man United throughout the 1990s ensure he thoroughly deserves a place on this list having cost just £505,000. With 11 major trophies won during his time at Old Trafford, Schmeichel's period at the club represented one of almost total domestic domination. The Great Dane kept 113 clean sheets for the Red Devils in the league and, if you include later transfers to Aston Villa (free) and Manchester City (free), he averages a shutout every 0.42 Premier League matches - a quite remarkable record. A player who effectively redefined the role of the goalkeeper. Peter Schmeichel signed for Manchester United from Danish side Brondy for £505,000 in 1991 . Schmeichel (centre) celebrates with team-mates after winning the 1999 Premier League title . Joe Hart - £600,000 (Shrewsbury Town to Manchester City) It is frightening to think that Joe Hart is still only 27 years old due to what he has already achieved in the game. After arriving at Manchester City from Shrewsbury Town for £600,000 in May 2006, Hart spent time on loan at Tranmere Rovers, Blackpool and Birmingham City before eventually supplanting Given as the Sky Blues' No 1 in 2010-11. Despite a couple of lapses in form since - leading to him being dropped twice - Hart has amassed 207 Premier League appearances, become England's undisputed first-choice keeper, won four major titles and kept more than 75 clean sheets. Not bad for someone who hasn't even turned 28 yet... Joe Hart moved to Manchester City from Shrewsbury Town in May 2006 . Hart dives to make a save during Man City's Premier League match with Tottenham Hotspur this month . Mark Schwarzer - £1.5m (Bradford City to Middlesbrough) Mark Schwarzer is now 42 and yet he is still going strong having just moved to Leicester City - his fourth Premier League club after Middlesbrough, Fulham and Chelsea - on a free transfer. Although a household name now, when the Australian moved to the North East from Bradford City in 1997 for £1.5m he was largely unknown. But Schwarzer would soon establish himself as one of the most consistent goalkeepers in the English top flight. Schwarzer amassed 93 clean sheets in 366 Premier League matches for Middlesbrough, winning the League Cup with the club in 2004, before excelling at Fulham. A further 56 clean sheets arrived in 172 appearances for the west Londoners - plus he reached the UEFA Cup final with Boro and then the Europa League final with Fulham. Certainly not a bad CV, you know. Mark Schwarzer swapped Bradford City for Middlesbrough in a deal worth £1.5m in 1997 . Friedel (left) throws Champagne over manager Steve McLaren following Boro's 2004 League Cup triumph . Brad Friedel - Free transfer (Liverpool to Blackburn Rovers) Another goalkeeper who is still plying his trade at the top level at the tender old age of 43, Brad Friedel will go down as one of the great Premier League goalkeepers - both for his sheer longevity and his ability between the posts. Having played 25 times for Liverpool in the Premier League, the American was allowed to leave Anfield to join up with Blackburn Rovers - then in the First Division - on a free transfer in 2000. A mammoth 77 clean sheets followed in 262 top-flight appearances for Rovers as Friedel regularly helped the Lancashire club fight off the threat of relegation. Friedel would then move to Aston Villa - where he would play ever single league games over his three seasons in Birmingham - and Tottenham Hotspur, setting a record for the most consecutive Premier League appearances in history (310 matches). An extremely under-rated goalkeeper. Brad Friedel moved from Liverpool to Blackburn Rovers on a free transfer in 2000 . Friedel throws the ball out of the Rovers goal during a Premier League match with Chelsea . David James - £1.2m (Manchester City to Portsmouth) With a record 170 clean sheets from 572 Premier League appearances, David James - due to the fact he has played for five different top-flight sides - was always going to make this list. Having already performed excellently for Liverpool (72 clean sheets), Aston Villa (21), West Ham United (18) and Man City (20), James left the North West for the south coast and signed for Portsmouth for just £1.2m in 2006. Big-spending Pompey were determined to be successful and recruited an England international who still intended to play on. During his four years at Portsmouth, James added another 39 clean sheets and won an FA Cup. A brilliant signing. David James signed for Portsmouth from Manchester City for £1.2m in 2006 . James jumps and but cannot stop Sporting Braga's Luis Aguiar (not seen) from scoring . Carlo Cudicini - £300,000 (Castel di Sangro to Chelsea) Having been recommended to then-Chelsea boss Gianluca Vialli by Lazio goalkeeper Luca Marchegiani, Carlo Cudicini arrived at Stamford Bridge in 1999 for a fee of £300,000. Although never capped by the Italy national side - largely due to the presence of Gianluigi Buffon - Cudicini eventually overtook Ed de Goey as Chelsea's No 1 goalkeeper. He was even voted the Premier League goalkeeper of the season in 2002-03 during an ITV poll. However, injury problems that had dogged him during his time at Lazio returned in 2003-04 and, when Jose Mourinho spent big money to bring in Petr Cech in 2004, Cudicini found himself as the best goalkeeper sitting anywhere on the bench in world football. Despite this, Cudicini still managed 142 Premier League appearances during nine years at Stamford Bridge before moving to Tottenham, where he played another 19 top-flight matches. Carlo Cudicini arrived at Chelsea from Castel di Sangro for £300,000 in 1999 . The Italian keeper runs out to try and claim the ball during a Champions League game against Stuttgart in 2004 . Jussi Jaaskelainen - £100,000 (Vassan Palloseura to Bolton) Another old-timer still trying to get back into the first-team picture at West Ham following Adrian's elevation to No 1, Jaaskelainen spent 15 years are Bolton Wanderers before moving to East London. Having arrived in Lancashire for just £100,000 from Finnish side Vassan Palloseura in 1997, Jaaskelainen went on to keep 89 clean sheets in 379 Premier League matches for Bolton as they finally established themselves as top-flight regulars having endured years as a yo-yo club. Another 19 clean sheets have followed at Upton Park since his free transfer in June 2012 and, although he is now second choice, Jaaskelainen is still very much trusted by Sam Allardyce.

Jaaskelainen throws his body in the way of a shot from Birmingham City's Mikkael Forssell in 2003 . Thomas Sorensen - £500,000 (Odense BK to Sunderland) The second Dane on the list, Thomas Sorensen has played for three different Premier League clubs and kept 109 clean sheets - putting him 12th on the all-time Premier League list. Having joined then-First Division Sunderland from Danish side Odense BK in 1998 for just £500,000, Sorensen established himself as the Black Cats' No 1 and went on to keep 36 clean sheets in 136 top-flight games for the North East club. A further 46 shutouts have followed as Aston Villa, and most recently at current club Stoke City, with the 38-year-old serving as a worthy deputy to Asmir Begovic at the Britannia Stadium right now.

Tim Krul - £200,000 (ADO Den Haag to Newcastle United) Newcastle are a club who have made some awful signings down the years, but goalkeepers is one department they almost always seem to get right - and Tim Krul is no exception. The Dutchman arrived at the club when he was just 17 in 2006 from ADO Den Haag and made an extremely-impressive debut against Palermo in the UEFA Cup that season. Loans to Falkirk and Carlisle United followed so that Krul could gain some first-team experience before he returned to St James' Park in 2009. With Krul and long-servant Steve Harper battling for first-team duties during Newcastle's season in the Championship, the former eventually gained No 1 status two months into the Magpies' first season back in the top flight in 2010-11. Since then, 37 shutouts have followed in 134 appearances - not to mention his World Cup quarter-final penalty shoot-out heroics for Holland in 2014 - and he has become one of the most sought-after goalkeepers in the Premier League right now.

"Kirk Kerkorian, known as one of the 'godfathers' of Las Vegas, celebrated his grandson Julian's Bar Mitzvah on Saturday . No expense was spared for the coming of age of former MGM mogul Kirk Kerkorian's grandson who celebrated becoming a man on Saturday with a $450,000 James Bond-themed Bar Mitzvah. Julian, whose parents are Kerkorian's daughter Linda and Ross Hilton Kemper celebrated his special day with the glitzy event at the Beverly Hills Hotel in L.A. A host of stars have been boycotting the hotel due to the anti-gay stance of owner the Sultan of Brunei, but that wasn’t a problem for pop stars Iggy Azalea and Nick Jonas who both performed at the bash. Jonas’ performance went off without a hitch, but the same could not be said for the Australian rapper who treated the room full of 13-year-olds to a sneak peak after her pants split at the crotch. The rip appeared as she was belting out lyrics from her Jennifer Lopez collaboration Booty, turning away from the audience and ferociously shaking her hips. In video footage the wardrobe malfunction, the audience can be heard screaming once they realized what had happened to the Fancy hit-maker. Once the rapper realized what had happened she attempted to cover it up by strategically placing her hands and modifying her dance routine. The event was certainly an extravagant affair with lots of 007-related touches including a casino and fancy flower displays. Scroll down for video .

"A police officer has been ordered to get rid of his noisy cockerel after it enraged neighbours with its early morning wake-up calls. Police officer Geraint Rees lives with his wife Cerys and children Seren, aged six, and Taran, aged four, near Pontypridd, in South Wales, where their garden is full of fruit and vegetable patches, several hens, two rabbits and their cockerel Bomper. But since the bird began to crow just over a year ago, PC Rees has received a number of letters from the council with the most recent saying he must get rid of the cockerel or he could face prosecution. PC Geraint Rees with his children, Seren, six and Taran, four, has been told he must get rid of his noisy cockerel, Bomper or he could face prosecution . The police officer has been ordered to get rid of his noisy cockerel after enraging neighbours in  with his early morning wake-up calls in in Church Village, near Pontypridd, South Wales . The family was first made aware of the complaints last year after somebody told the council the cockerel had woken them up at 4.30am. Most councils advise cockerel owners that they are at risk of falling foul of noise officials. Following this, PC Rees built a breezeblock house to keep the bird in overnight to stifle the noise, but despite this working for a while, the Rhondda Cynon Taf council got back in touch earlier this year and then issued him with a noise abatement notice in June. PC Rees built a breezeblock house to keep the bird in overnight to keep the noise down, but Rhondda Cynon Taf council got back in touch earlier this year and issued Geraint with a noise abatement notice in June this year . PC Rees said: 'Having Bomper and the other animals is a great way to teach our children about nature and where food comes from. 'We've even taken Bomper to the local primary school to teach the children about farm animals - it's heartbreaking to think we could lose him. 'It was purely by accident that we got Bomper. We were sold chicks, which we thought would grow up into hens, but one grew into a cockerel. 'It's heartbreaking for our children to think they could lose him, and we were also hoping to breed him in the future.' Police officer Geraint Rees lives with his wife Cerys and children Seren, aged six, and Taran, aged four, near Pontypridd, in South Wales, along with several hens, two rabbits and their cockerel Bomper . The police officer has now launched a Facebook group called 'Save the Church Village Cockerel' to try and keep Bomper. He said: 'Because I didn't get rid of the cockerel within 14 days of the notice, the council has now said it's in the process of completing a prosecution file, which could take me to court. 'I feel the goalposts have been moved however because originally we were told the cockerel noise was keeping people awake in the early hours and following all the work and expense we've gone to in order to rectify the problem, the council is now saying the noise is a nuisance all day long. 'Bomper is our pet and we really don't want to give him away – we'll fight this to the end.' A Rhondda Cynon Taf council spokesman said: 'We are investigating complaints in relation to noise pollution. 'No charges have been brought at this time and the case remains very much ongoing.' This is not the first time residents have complained about noisy animals waking them up in the early hours. In April this year, chicken breeder Helen Rogers, 57, was summoned to Fareham Magistrates' Court accused of breaching a noise abatement notice on three occasions. Villagers in Hambledon, in the South Downs National Park in Hampshire, said her cockerel woke them at 3am and went on 'incessantly' until 11pm, starting a chain reaction of crowing.","Geraint Rees has been told he must get rid of his noisy cockerel, Bomper .

"The bells of St John's Church have been ringing since the first half of the 18th century, when German composer Handel donated them in exchange for the church's organ. They have been a part of daily life in Keynsham near Bristol, ever since, but they may be silenced after almost 300 years, because one person thinks they are too noisy. A petition by local residents urging the church to keep the bells playing has prompted talks between the frustrated resident and the vicar of the 13th century Anglican church, Reverend Stephen M’Caw. Threat of silence: The bells of St John's Church in Keynsham near Bristol may be forced to stop ringing after one resident complained that they are too noisy . Historic: The church had an organ when it was built in 1250, but German-born composer Handel swapped it in the 18th century for a peal of bells because he liked the 'mellow tones' The  Grade II listed church was built in 1250 and had an organ until Handel, a Baroque composer famous for his operas and oratorios, is said to have swapped it for a peal of bells in the 18th century - simply because he liked its mellow tones . Some of the bells were made by the Bilbie family from nearby Chew Stoke. An inscription on the smallest bell says: 'I value not who doth me see, For Thomas Bilbie casted me, Althow my sound it is but small, I can be heard among you all.' The petition against the single complaint, which is growing strength, asks the church to take 'no action'. It describes the bells as 'a valued local tradition and need to be retained to reach the proposed extensions to the town'. Reverernd M'Caw, who wants to come to an agreement with the aggrieved party, said: 'At the end of the day, we want to be good neighbours to everyone. There is a wonderful community spirit here in Keynsham' he said. 'Our churches are a key part of it and celebrating and enhancing that spirit is very important to us.' Campaigner, Nick Dewfall, 52, a sports coach, said: 'I’ve lived in Keynsham most of my life and everyone I’ve spoken to likes the bells regardless of whether they go to church or not. 'The church is 700 years old so bell ringing isn’t new and tends to have a positive association, plus the bells aren’t constantly ringing.' Fed up: The complaint is said to have been made in the Old Vicarage Green, which is 300m away . The complainer is said to live near the church in Old Vicarage Green, a development of retirement flats 300m away from the church. But none of the occupants spoken to have owned up to being the voice of protest. Pam Redwood, 67, who has lived there for 14 years, said the place used to have a 'nice community spirit' but recently people had started to disagree over things like parking. She added: 'Don’t buy a house near the church if you don’t like the bells, simple as that.' Bernadette White, 69, said: 'They used to go off a lot more - before I even got up in the morning - but they haven’t as much for the last few week since somebody complained. 'If they were right on top of me I might feel differently, but I don’t mind them at all.' Campaign: Around 70 local residents have signed a petition urging for the church not to take action . Retired Edward Kirkland, 67, added: 'Surely there are more important things in this world to worry about than church bells. 'They are lovely. They don’t just ring them, they play hymns and songs and they really are lovely. I don’t see why they should stop because one person complains.' Bath and North East Somerset Council said its environmental health department had not received any complaint about the bells. Two years ago church leaders at the All Saints’ Church, in Wrington, North Somerset, 17 miles away were given a noise abatement notice after a newcomer complained about their bells. Reverend Nicholas Maddock was told by North Somerset Council environmental health officers not to switch off bells between 11pm and 7am or face prosecution. The switching off caused fury among residents, many of whom said they relied on the chimes to know the time. Messiah composer: George Frideric Handel . George Frideric Handel was born in Germany in 1685 and, despite being told not to meddle with instruments by his father, he developed a propensity for music in his childhood. In 1712, he decided to settle permanently in Britain following a number of visits and popular performances. He then became a naturalised British subject, with the backing of Queen Anne, in 1727 and would go on to complete one of his most famous compositions, Messiah, in London in 1742. When he arrived, he travelled around the country, visiting various schools and churches, including St John's in Keynsham, to perform his oratorios or simply listen to music. But his time in Britain was mainly based on writing Italian opera for the British stage, which came with a mixed success. Between 1711 and 1739, more than 25 of Handel's operas were premiered in the Haymarket (now the Her Majesty's) theatre. But after losing money on his productions, he turned his attention to oratorios, an area where he had already received royal approval. One of his four Coronation Anthems, Zadok the Priest (1727), composed for the coronation of George II of Great Britain, has been performed at every subsequent British coronation, traditionally during the sovereign's anointing. Handel composed more than forty operas in over thirty years, and since the late 1960s, with the revival of baroque music and historically informed musical performance, interest in Handel's operas has grown. After his death in 1759, he was buried in Westminster Abbey. Talks: Reverend Stephen M'Caw , who is believed to be setting up a meeting with the frustrated resident, said: 'At the end of the day, we want to be good neighbours to everyone'","Bells at St John's Church in Keynsham were installed nearly 300 years .

"It was billed as 'All Back To Ours' - a closing ceremony that owed its theme to the Glasgow tradition of extending a good night out at someone's house after closing time.

She probably wouldn't get the luxury of singing seven interrupted songs in a row at an after-hours Glasgow tenement party but she was afforded that privilege at Hampden, Scotland's most iconic sporting venue, as the city celebrated a memorable 11-day sporting festival and passed the Commonwealth Games baton over to the 2018 hosts, the Gold Coast in Kylie's native Australia.

"Confidential personal data on hundreds of thousands of Britons is being touted by corrupt Indian call centre workers, an undercover investigation has discovered. Credit card information, medical and financial records are being offered for sale to criminals and marketing firms for as little as 2p. Two ‘consultants’, claiming to be IT workers at several call centres, met undercover reporters from The Sunday Times and boasted of having 45 different sets of personal information on nearly 500,000 Britons. Big business: About 330,000 people are employed in India's call centres, in an industry worth around £3.2 billion a year. (File picture) Data included names, addresses, and phone numbers of credit card holders, start and expiry dates as well as the three-digit security verification codes. The information – much of which related to customers at major financial companies, including HSBC and NatWest - would be a goldmine for criminals, allowing fraudsters to syphon thousands of pounds from bank accounts within minutes. IT consultant Naresh Singh met the undercover reporters in . a hotel room in Gurgaon, a town near Delhi, carrying a laptop full of data. He told them: ‘These [pieces of data] are ones that have been sold to somebody already. This is Barclays, this is Halifax, this is Lloyds TSB. We’ve been dealing so long we can tell the bank by just the card number.’ He said that much of the data would be less than 72 hours old, adding: ‘They would just have got the credit card and not only credit cards, that would be debit card as well.’ Other information being hawked around by unscrupulous workers . was sensitive material about mortgages, loans, insurance, mobile phone . contracts, Sky Television subscriptions,  according to The Sunday Times sting. The data would enable direct marketing companies to target customers more effectively. Call centres are a £3.2 billion industry in India, with an estimated 330,000 people employed by them. Many British companies have outsourced . services to the India, but a public backlash over the use of foreign . workers has seen some withdrawn. Action: Richard Bacon MP has warned of the growing problem of data insecurity and called for the Government to investigate . Spanish bank Santander, which owns Abbey, announced last year it would no longer use Indian call centres. Indian . authorities say their efforts to combat corruption have been hampered . by the unwillingness of companies, keen to avoid negative publicity, . reporting data losses. The Government is now being called on to take action against widespread reports of data insecurity. Conservative member of the Commons’ public accounts select committee, Richard Bacon MP, said this was not only a matter for the organisations involved but also the authorities.

"England have ended a Commonwealth Games top of the medals table for the first time since 1986, thanks in no small part to the inspiration of tomorrow's stars. The likes of Sir Bradley Wiggins, Louis Smith and Mo Farah drove the narrative ahead of Glasgow, yet they were overshadowed - or in the latter's case absent - as new talent came to the fore. From 16-year-old Claudia Fragapane's four golds in the artistic gymnastics to fellow teenagers Siobhan-Marie O'Connor and Ben Proud in the pool, the success of young English talent has been heartening with the Rio Olympics fast approaching. Send off: Glasgow waved goodbye to the Commonwealth Games with an spectacular closing ceremony . VIDEO Glasgow see out 'outstanding' Commonwealth Games . Overshadowed: Star names such as Bradley Wiggins had driven the narrative ahead of the Games in Glasgow . Glasgow bore witness to a number of surprise successes, but there was, of course, more glory in sports we have become accustomed to. Like London 2012, England shone in the cycling, winning a host of gold medals on road and track despite Wiggins only managing silver in the 4,000 metres team pursuit. The Brownlee brothers' dominance of triathlon continued, with Alistair and Jonathan securing a one-two in the men's event before winning the mixed team relay with women's gold and bronze medallists Jodie Stimpson and Vicky Holland. At Hampden Park, England impressed despite the absence of 'Super Saturday' stars Farah and Jessica Ennis-Hill. Greg Rutherford was the only remaining cast member and did his bit, following up his Olympic long jump title of two years ago by leaping to Commonwealth gold. Dominance: Jonathan Brownlee, Jodie Stimpson, Vicky Holland and Alistair Brownlee celebrate winning gold . England took 27 athletics medals in all - more than any other nation - as a new crop of up-and-coming sprinters emerged, such as Adam Gemili, Jodie Williams and Matthew Hudson-Smith. More impressive still was the swimmers' success, given the disappointment of London 2012, where they managed just three medals - none of which were gold. England claimed 28 medals, including 10 golds, with the likes of Proud and O'Connor leading the way. Only 19, Proud took gold in the 50m butterfly and 50m freestyle at Tollcross, while fellow teenager O'Connor clinched an incredible six medals, including gold in the 200m individual medley. There was also, of course, two podium-topping performances from Fran Halsall, while in the diving Jack Laugher, just 19, won golds in the 1m springboard and synchronised 3m springboard before star turn Tom Daley weighed in with one of his own from the 10m platform. In the gymnastics, Strictly Come Dancing star Smith made the pre-event headlines but was outshone by others. The gymnasts excelled at the SSE Hydro, where the diminutive Fragapane became the first English woman to win four golds in a single Commonwealth Games and two-time Olympic medallist Max Whitlock won three golds, a silver and a bronze. Like 21-year-old Whitlock, weightlifter Zoe Smith has been on the scene since London 2012, but these Games represented the breakthrough moment, with her back-flip after winning 58kg gold one of the enduring images of Glasgow 2014. Breakthrough moment: Zoe Smith lifts 92kg in the snatch element of the women's weightlifting competition . In the ring, there were English golds from Olympic champion Nicola Adams, Savannah Marshall, Scott Fitzgerald, Antony Fowler and Joe Joyce. There was gold too in the badminton, judo, shooting, lawn bowls, squash and table tennis, as well as medals in the hockey, wrestling and powerlifting. Such success saw England's athletes comfortably pass their pre-Games medals target range of 130-145. The 142 medals haul from Delhi four years ago was overhauled, as was the 165 won in Manchester in 2002.

"By the time Kylie Minogue sang to a packed-out Hampden Park at last night’s closing ceremony, Usain Bolt had left. He was vaguely en route to his next glitzy assignment: a run on Copacabana Beach. There is no criticism intended in that observation. But however pleased we were that Jamaica’s superman had called in, sprinkling his particular brand of stardust, he was not the only reason why the 20th staging of the Commonwealth Games was a success. No, Glasgow 2014 will live in the memory - if readers north of the border will forgive me - for its  London fervour. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Glasgow see out 'outstanding' Commonwealth Games . Celebrity name: Usain Bolt won gold at the Commonwealth Games but there were plenty of other stars . I don’t think it is fantastical to say that the 2012 Olympics awakened in the British a deep mass desire to watch sport en masse with a warm, celebratory air. Look at the depth and spirit of the crowds as the Tour de France snaked its way through England last month. So it was here. Stadiums were largely full, even for heats. The weather, which began scorchingly hot but turned depressingly wet, was barely a deterrent. Yesterday in near-apocalyptic conditions, folk huddled under umbrellas and banged the hoardings as a fabulous cycling road race unfolded. The usual debate every four years is whether this funny amalgam of countries and territories thrown up by a shared history can gather to play games together for much longer. That is a question that has faded here over 11 days of sport, and that is a significant tribute to what Glasgow has done. How different from when the last time the Games came to Scotland, in Edinburgh in 1986. Thirty-two African and Caribbean countries stayed away in protest at Britain’s links with South Africa. In 1986, the stars were Daley Thompson, Lennox Lewis, Steve Redgrave, Steve Ovett, Steve Cram, Linford Christie and Adrian Moorhouse. Was the 2014 roster up to snuff by comparison? Big shoes to fill: Can the class of 2014 replicate the success of the likes of Linford Christie (pictured) and Daley Thompson . We cannot yet be entirely sure. That depends who trains on, but in many spheres the competition was strong (there are two billion people in the Commonwealth), if not uniformly on the track. The withdrawal of Mo Farah through illness was a major blow to the credibility of the athletics  programme. The absence of Jessica Ennis-Hill and the pretender to her throne, Katarina Johnson-Thompson was another. However, we were still treated to several good races and a wonderful men’s 800m between the two outstanding performers in the world, David Rudisha of Kenya, the Olympic champion and world record holder, and Botswana’s Nijel Amos, who ran him down. Still, Rudisha came out with credit, such was the grace with which he took defeat. The Bolt show was fun as far as it went. He only ran in the 4x100m relay, but everyone who was in Hampden on those two nights will, when husky-voiced, tell their grandchildren they saw the great man in the flesh. Big moment: Spectators crammed in Hampden Park to watch the Jamaican relay team win gold at the Games . VIDEO Glasgow see out 'outstanding' Commonwealth Games . On the subject of Hampden, what a triumph it was as an athletics track. It housed 44,000 people after a conversion that cost £14million. A serious question: do we need to spend so much money building white-elephant stadiums around the world when we could adopt the Hampden model? There are other fine memories from these Games. All 4ft 6in of little Bristolian Claudia Fragapane announcing herself as the heir to Beth Tweddle. Her splendid floor routines made her the first English woman - she is 16 - to win four gold medals at one Games since Joyce Cooper in the first in 1930. Jodie Williams ran cleanly to take a fine silver medal behind the statuesque Jamaican Blessing Okagbare. That augurs well for Rio 2016. Other English talents to emerge were Tin-Tin Ho, a 15-year-old table tennis player, Siobhan-Marie O’Connor, an 18-year-old swimmer, and Matthew Dixon, a 14-year-old diver. For England, the Games were a triumph. With 174 medals, including 58 golds, England surpassed Australia for the first time since Edinburgh 28 years ago. Scotland, importantly as hosts, had their most successful Games: 53 medals, including 19 golds. Ditto Wales, with 36 in all, five of them gold. Roll on Rio. Spectacular send off: Glasgow waved goodbye to the Commonwealth Games with an incredible closing ceremony at Hampden Park on Sunday evening . Let us not forget the little heroes who make the Commonwealths what they are. Did anyone represent this spirit of these Games better than the crowd who roared Rosefelo Siosi, of the Solomon Islands, on his final three laps of the 5,000m because he was running slower than a drunk coming out of a Saltmarket pub? The saddest moment of the Games came from weightlifting, where a Nigerian girl of just 16 tested positive for diuretics and masking agents. It is no exaggeration to call it a form of child abuse. But at Hampden last night we celebrated all that is best about these Games. Next stop four years from now, the Gold Coast. Hence Kylie. It was almost all over when the little lady sang.

"Barcelona took a reported £3million hit in the Alexis Sanchez deal because the Arsenal forward preferred a move to the Emirates.

"Brendan Rodgers has hit out at England’s treatment of Daniel Sturridge, blaming them for the Liverpool striker’s thigh injury. Sturridge was injured last Friday in a training session he had asked to sit out, less than 48 hours after playing 89 minutes of England’s 1-0 friendly win over Norway. That meant he missed Monday’s 2-0 win over Switzerland in a Euro 2016 qualifier and is now out for a further three weeks. Rodgers is furious his star striker was not given more rest. WATCH Scroll down for Brendan Rogers: Sturridge didn't get proper recovery with England . Daniel Sturridge is out for three weeks after getting injured during training on England duty . Daniel Sturridge's thigh strain in camp with the national team could have been avoided, says Brendan Rodgers . Daniel Sturridge shows his skills in training for England against Phil Jones just before going down injured . ‘We’re disappointed because we feel it’s an injury which could have been prevented,’ the Anfield boss told TalkSport. ‘Clubs work differently to international teams. It’s the recovery strategy. When we look at our players here, we look at them individually, in terms of what their needs are.’ Had Sturridge been involved in a Liverpool game rather than an England match last Wednesday, he would have only been required to do light running and stretching on what is regarded as the ‘second recovery day’. However, with England facing a crucial trip to Switzerland, it is believed boss Roy Hodgson wanted to maximise his time with the players and involved Sturridge in the session despite the 25-year-old expressing concerns. Daniel Sturridge played in the friendly against Norway at Wembley, which England won 1-0 . Daniel Sturridge could be out for up to two weeks but should return for the Merseyside derby . ‘Some players are very fast, they will have a second day, active recovery, whereas other players can work on that second day,’ added Rodgers. ‘When you’re a type of player like Raheem Sterling or Daniel Sturridge, you need to recover them differently. ‘From what I’ve seen, Sturridge sprinted with the ball for nearly 50 yards to shoot and that’s when he pulls up. That’s where the issues are.’ Liverpool could be without Sturridge for fixtures including the Merseyside derby on September 27 and the Champions League game in Basle on October 1. Rodgers added: ‘The players go (away on international duty) and tell the associations how they work. Of course, it’s always up to the manager. ‘And on that second day for us, the sessions are only low to moderate intensity in small spaces, or you get injuries. If you ask most players, the second day is when they really feel it, although some are different. Roy has probably been led by (England’s) sports science department. ‘But you can’t throw a blanket over all the players. One recovery programme doesn’t fit them all. Luis Suarez needed to do extra work on his second day of recovery. It is about maximising availability.’ The international break has severely hit Liverpool, with Emre Can suffering an ankle twist during Germany’s Under 21 win over Romania that will keep him out for up to six weeks, while Joe Allen jarred a knee during Wales’s 2-1 win over Andorra. The FA must compensate Liverpool up to £200,000 — three weeks’ of Sturridge’s wages. They are aware of Liverpool’s concerns and have discussed the matter with the club.","Daniel Sturridge was injured while on international duty with England .

"Council bosses were forced to apologise today after a mother-of-two was handed a parking ticket while breastfeeding her baby daughter in her car. Antonia Charlesworth, 27, was driving home from a shopping trip in Queen Street, Blackpool, when her five-month-old daughter started screaming to be fed. She pulled over and began to breastfeed her baby - without realising she had actually parked in a taxi rank. Shocked: Antonia Charlesworth (pictured with her five-month-old daughter) was handed a £35 parking ticket while breastfeeding her daughter in Blackpool. She said the incident had left her feeling 'humiliated' Scene: The 27-year-old was driving home from a shopping trip in Queen Street (pictured) when her daughter started screaming to be fed. She pulled over and began to breastfeed - without realising she had parked in a taxi rank . However, she then spotted a parking warden approach her car, before checking her tax disc and taking photographs of the vehicle. Realising she had pulled into a taxi rank, Ms Charlesworth quickly apologised and offered to move her car - but she was then handed a £35 ticket. Today, the mother, whose two-year-old daughter was also in the vehicle, said the incident had left her feeling 'humiliated'. 'I asked him if he could do the decent thing and allow me to finish feeding my baby or at least allow me to move my car,' she said. 'But he refused and instead started taking photographs of my vehicle, which I think would have included me. Response: Bosses at Blackpool Council (pictured) apologised today and agreed to revoke the parking ticket . Ms Charlesworth's five-month-old daughter was 'screaming because her feed had been interrupted.' 'All with my breast exposed and in front of passers-by,' Ms Charlesworth said. Blackpool Council, which runs a Breatfeeding Welcome scheme to encourage new mothers to feel confident about breastfeeding in public, apologised today and agreed to revoke the ticket. 'We are very sorry this unfortunate situation has arisen,' said a council spokesman. 'We strongly support breastfeeding and as a gesture of goodwill agree to waive the penalty notice.' But the spokesman added that the ticket had been issued correctly - and the warden had behaved in a 'professional' and 'courteous' manner. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Breastfeeding Network, which offers support and information for new mothers, said: 'Breastfeeding is a normal part of life. 'We hope that breastfeeding mothers and their babies will be treated with the same respect as everyone else.'

"Marijuana has long been accused of affecting memory and thinking ability. But new research has found it may actually help with the effects of brain ageing. U.S. researchers say that extremely low levels of the compound THC, the active ingredient in the drug, may slow or halt the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. Lighting up: At the low doses studied, researchers found the benefits of THC in delaying the progression of Alzheimer's outweighed the risks of memory impairment . At the low doses studied, the therapeutic benefits of THC appear to outweigh the associated risks of THC toxicity and memory impairment, they found. The research could lead to drugs being developed to treat the disease from related compounds that are safe and legal. Professor Chuanhai Cao, lead author of the study and a neuroscientist at the Byrd Alzheimer’s Institute in Florida, explained that THC decreases the amount of amyloid beta in the brain. Amyloid beta is one of the factors that leads to Alzheimer’s and researchers are currently attempting to create drugs that could help stop the production of this protein. Devastating: There are currently 800,000 people with dementia in the UK . Professor Cao said: ‘THC is known to be a potent antioxidant with neuroprotective properties. This is the first report that confirms THC decreases levels of the amyloid beta protein, protecting against the progression of Alzheimer's. Dr Neel Nabar, who co-authored the study said: ‘While we are still far from a consensus, this study indicates that THC and THC-related compounds may be of therapeutic value in Alzheimer’s disease,’ He continued: ‘Are we advocating that people use illicit drugs to prevent the disease? No. 'It’s important to keep in mind that just because a drug may be effective, it doesn’t mean it can be safely used by anyone. 'However, these findings may lead to the development of related compounds that are safe, legal, and useful in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.’ This week the results of another study found marijuana could be used for medical purposes. European researchers suggested marijuana could also treat schizophrenia, and may be much more effective than other drugs by having fewer side effects. An ingredient found in pomegranates could help slow the onset of Alzheimer’s and curb some of its symptoms, a study has found. University of Huddersfield researchers found that punicalagin - a chemical compound found in the pomegranate fruit - can inhibit inflammation in specialised brain cells known as micrologia. (It is inflammation that leads to Alzheimer's disease getting progressively worse.) The painful inflammation that accompanies illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis and Parkinson's disease could also be reduced, the study found. Dr Olumayokun Olajide, the lead author of the study, is still working on how much pomegranate is required to be effective, but says regular consumption of the fruit is still beneficial. He said: ‘We do know that regular intake and regular consumption of pomegranate has a lot of health benefits - including prevention of neuro-inflammation related to dementia.'","Low levels active ingredient, THC, may slow or halt disease progression .

"Two young drivers who killed a grandmother while racing their cars in a suburban street should expect lengthy jail terms, a judge has said. Mary Byrne, 51, was in a minicab outside her home when it was hit by a car driven by Joseph Robinson, who was racing his friend Thomas Healey. A court has heard the taxi carrying Mrs Byrne was pulling onto the driveway of her house in Bradford, West Yorkshire in April last year when it was hit by a BMW. Joseph Robinson (left) has admitted causing death by dangerous driving after killing a grandmother in an accident while he was racing his friend, Thomas Healey (right), who has been found guilty of the same offence . Mrs Byrne . was thrown through the window of the taxi, which then struck her as it . spun around from the impact. She died later that afternoon. BMW driver Robinson, 22, pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving after initially denying the charge. Healey, . 21, who the court heard briefly stopped his Ford Focus before fleeing, . was found guilty of the same offence this week following a trial at . Bradford Crown Court. The court heard his Ford was able to slow down and avoid striking the vehicles. Mary Byrne died after a BMW crashed into a taxi dropping her off outside her home in Bradford, West Yorkshire . Prosecutor . Tim Capstick said: 'What [Healey] did was to see what had occurred in . front of his eyes, and having witnessed this road traffic collision this . defendant was to simply turn his vehicle round and drive away from the . scene.' The court heard the two vehicles were seen travelling at speeds of between 70 and 80mph before the crash. Witnesses said at one point they veered onto the wrong side of the road, and at another, the BMW nearly lost control. The . Ford was so close behind the other car it was almost touching its rear . bumper, and another driver had to brake to avoid a collision, the court . heard. Mr . Capstick said Healey attended a police station after the crash and told officers the BMW had overtaken him 'driving like an idiot'. Healey . said he was trying to catch up with the car to get the registration . number when he witnessed the accident and panicked and drove off. But Mr Capstick said witnesses had told how the Ford had been in front of the BMW some of the time. It took the jury of six men and six women only one hour to reach its unanimous verdict. Healey, . of Bradford, gave no reaction to the jury's decision, but there were . cheers from members of Mrs Byrne's family, who sat in the public . gallery. Healey has been bailed until his sentencing date is fixed and he was immediately disqualified from driving. Robinson, also of Bradford, will be sentenced at the same time. It emerged during a hearing this week that Robinson was already on bail for an offence of aggravated vehicle taking involving his father's car at the time of the crash. After . the jury's verdict, Judge John Potter told Healey: 'You can expect a . significant custodial sentence and you have to be prepared for that.' Photos taken after the incident show the marks made by the speeding cars and floral tributes left to Mrs Byrne . Outside the court, Mrs Byrne's family spoke of their ordeal in the 14 months since her death. In a statement, they family said: 'Lads of this age should not be able to drive high-powered cars like those. It was only going to be a matter of time before they killed someone. 'They drove for 2.1 miles before the . crash, that was a big game of Russian roulette they played with a lot of . people's lives that day. 'They have been in the community, living their lives every day while we have been grieving for mum and not being able to grieve for her properly because of knowing the only people suffering over this were us.' In the months before the trial, her family . have been raising money for the road safety charity Brake and now hope . to help others who suffer as a result of . dangerous driving.","Joseph Robinson and Thomas Healey raced cars through Bradford last year .

"Ruling: Sir James Munby, pictured, President of the Family Division of the High Court, revealed the girl was initially against having an abortion but she later changed her mind . A girl of 13 with the intellect of a child half her age has had an abortion - after becoming pregnant by a 14-year-old boy, it has been revealed today. The teenager was 14 weeks pregnant and had been described by a psychiatrist as 'very damaged and impaired'. At first she was against having an abortion but she later changed her mind, a judge has revealed. The details emerged in a written ruling . by Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division of the High Court - . and the most senior family judge in England and Wales. It followed an earlier . hearing in the Family Division of the High Court. Sir James said he had been asked to decide whether the pregnancy should be terminated. The judge said evidence had been prepared on the basis that the teenager was opposed to a termination. But when the hearing began she was 'wavering' and by the end she had wanted a termination. He said the 'preponderance of evidence” pointed to a termination being in the girl’s best interests and said he had, in any event, concluded that a termination was in her best interests. He added that the youngster’s pregnancy had been terminated. Sir James said the teenager was the subject of on-going family court care proceedings. And he said there would have been 'very little chance' of her being able to keep the baby. A 'damaged' 13-year-old girl had an abortion after becoming pregnant by a 14-year-old boy. Details of the case was revealed following a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court, pictured . He said a psychologist had assessed the girl as having the comprehension of a seven-year-old and the vocabulary of a six-year-old. A psychiatrist said the girl understood that termination meant the death of her baby but did not have a full understanding of what pregnancy involved.

"Rolf Harris’s daughter sent him an email asking what she would inherit and comparing his £11million fortune to ‘winning the lottery’, his trial heard. The e-mail was shown to jurors at Southwark Crown Court after Bindi Nicholls took the stand to defend her father, insisting he did not indecently assault an underage girl. But she said the message, which was released by the judge today after being shown to jurors last week, was being taken out of context - and denied 'helping' her 84-year-old father for any other reason than to tell the truth.

The email referred to her relationship with Harris' 90-year-old brother Bruce, saying: 'This is important stuff! 'When . you are gone we are all left with the aftermath of people fighting over . stuff, I'm left with Bruce and Elaine (and you know how they feel about . me!) and I'm alone with it all. 'Do you want to write letters to . people you care about... do you want to give people things before you . go? How do you want to be remembered?

The email was shown to jurors last Monday, and was released to the media today after approval by the judge in the trial. Later the jury heard from character witnesses including former TV star Rosemarie Ford, who said Harris never acted inappropriately. Former Crimewatch presenter Sue Cook added that Harris should not be accused of lying after he forgot a game show appearance in the 1970s in Cambridge - because she could not recall being in the programme either.

"Clegg clamp-down: The Deputy PM wants a new tax on Britain's richest . Nick Clegg last night demanded a swingeing new tax on the rich to help ease the financial squeeze being suffered by the less well-off as austerity measures bite. The Deputy Prime Minister said Britain’s wealthiest should be made to contribute more to the ‘economic war’, which has been made worse by the double-dip recession. He said an extra ‘time-limited contribution’ from the rich would be seen as fair given the scale of Britain’s financial problems. Without it, he suggested, Britain could suffer a breakdown in ‘social cohesion’ as seen during last summer’s riots. But Chancellor George Osborne hit back today warning such a move could drive away the rich needed to help Britain's economy grow. Calls for a new tax to soak the rich are also likely to antagonise the Tory Right, who argue that cutting taxes is the best way to boost growth and persuade the well-off to pay more. The Liberal Democrat leader gave little indication of where he thought the new tax should be levied, although he suggested it would be in addition to the party’s existing proposal to levy an annual ‘mansion tax’ on homes worth more than £2million. In an interview with the Guardian he said the prolonged nature of the battle to tackle the deficit left by Labour called for exceptional measures. He said: ‘If we want to remain cohesive and prosperous as a society, people of very considerable personal wealth have got to make a bit of an extra contribution. ‘In addition to our standing policy on things like the mansion tax is there a time limited contribution you can ask in some way or another from people of considerable wealth so they feel they are making a contribution to the national effort? ‘What we are embarked on is in some senses a longer economic war rather than a short economic battle.’ Scroll down for video . Rift: Chancellor George Osborne warned on a visit to the north-east today that Clegg's plans would harm Britain . Mr Clegg said it was vital for the Government to ‘really hard-wire fairness into what we do in the next phases of fiscal restraint’. He added: ‘If we don’t do that I don’t think the process will be either socially or politically sustainable or acceptable.’ On a visit to the north-east today Chancellor George Osborne said he had already taken steps to ensure the UK’s highest earners pay more but insisted it was vital to hang on to entrepreneurs who would fuel the economic recovery. Mr Clegg has called for those of 'very considerable' wealth to contribute more to turning around Britain’s financial fortunes. But during a visit to Sunderland, the Chancellor said: 'I am clear that the wealthy should pay more which is why in the recent budget I increased the tax on very expensive property transactions. 'But we also have to be careful as a country we don’t drive away the wealth creators and the businesses that are going to lead our economic recovery.' Return of the Laws: Mr Clegg says he wants disgraced David Laws back in Government despite Mr Laws resignation over his expenses . This morning, Susan Kramer, the Lib Dem treasury spokesman in the House of Lords, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We can’t give a free ride to people. If . we’re going to be a coherent society everyone has to carry a share of . it.' She added: ‘At the very upper end income tax probably doesn’t work effectively… a wealth tax is a very interesting way to go.’ In a gloomy assessment, Mr Clegg said it was now clear that what once appeared to be a ‘short, sharp economic battle’ was ‘clearly turning into a longer term process of economic recovery and fiscal restraint’. He said this would involve ‘sacrifices over a longer period of time, a longer period of belt tightening as a country’ – making it essential that the rich are seen to be playing their part. Mr Clegg said details of his new tax proposals would be unveiled at next month’s Lib Dem conference. Forced vote: Nick Clegg's Lib Dems have refused to support David Cameron's proposed boundary changes following the collapse of the Lords reform . He suggested the tax was likely to target ‘very high asset wealth’. Changes to the top rate of income tax have been all but ruled out following the Coalition’s controversial decision to reduce it from 50p to 45p earlier this year. Mr Clegg also gave the strongest hint yet that David Laws is set to return to Government in the forthcoming reshuffle. Mr Laws was forced to quit his post as Treasury Chief Secretary after less than a month following revelations about his expenses. But he has continued as an informal adviser to Mr Clegg, particularly on economic matters and is now tipped to return as a minister in the Cabinet Office. Mr Clegg said: ‘I have never made any secret of the fact that I want to see David Laws back in Government.’ Mr Clegg also urged David Cameron to force a vote on proposed boundary changes, which the Lib Dems have refused to support following the collapse of the Government’s plans for Lords reform.","Deputy PM says Britain's wealthiest should contribute to 'economic war'

"It was a strong look for a damp Wednesday morning. But as Pippa Middleton power-walked her way up the Kings Road this morning in top-to-toe black, she looked every inch the businesswoman on a mission. Earlier this week the younger Middleton girl had stepped out in town wearing a rather more relaxed jeans and jumper combo. Clearly today she meant to make her mark. The Duchess of Cambridge's sister, who paid a visit to upmarket West London restaurant Aubaine, dressed to impress in a long-line black Sefanel coat with that 90s nipped-at-the-waist, single-breasted style sister Kate seems to like so much too. Power brunch: Pippa looked sharp for a morning visit to West London restaurant Aubaine . Lady in black: Pippa accessorised her all-black outfit with her monochrome Aspinal Marylebone tote and £151 Givenchy sunglasses . Underneath was a simple black Cleopatra cashmere bell-sleeved Shift dress by Cashmere by Tania, £470, which she matched to suede Russell & Bromley boots. A touch of luxe was brought by her very covetable Aspinal handbag - the £795 Marylebone tote, which is, of course, sold out - apologies to avid (and wealthy) Pippa fashion followers. A surprise bargain flourish came with Pippa's necklace, the £15 Andrea from Accessorize, sold out but being reintroduced in a slightly different take later this month. It is not clear who Pippa was meeting today, but given the number of professional pies she has her finger in - newspaper columnist, magazine contributing editor, food writer, author, party planner - it could have been to talk about any one of a thousand ventures. Yesterday it was revealed that the Pippa effect was still going strong, after a pair of £150 boots she wore twice in January sold out in just 12 hours, just as the Aspinal tote had done before it. The suede boots, made by independent Somerset-based brand Seven Boot Lane, disappeared from shelves within a day of Pippa's appearance in them - and have now attracted a growing waiting list, with more expected in-store on the 24 January. What a gem: Pippa wore the Andrea statement necklace, Accessorize, £15, which has now sold out - but a similar one will be in store later this month . Speaking to MailOnline Seven Boot . Lanes founders Sebastian and Mais Edwards said: 'It's an absolute . delight to have Pippa Middleton wearing Seven Boot Lane. 'Alice has always been a popular boot but the impact of Pippa wearing them has been extraordinary. 'The . boot sold out online in about 12 hours - overnight basically - and . nearly half the orders we have taken came from overseas, particularly . the U.S. 'When someone with Pippa’s influence is wearing your product it opens up a whole new audience, all over the world. 'Because . she dresses in a way that is effortlessly stylish, people find her . looks to be very accessible and therefore they trust the brands that she . wears. Bag lady: Pippa carried the £795 Marylebone tote, which also sold out after Pippa stepped out carrying it . Old favourite: Pippa's coat is by Sefanel and cost £295 when it was released last season. Pippa was previously spotted wearing the coat last November for an evening event . Lady who lunches: Pippa looked chic in navy and white as she spent the afternoon out and about in London earlier this week - carrying the same Aspinal tote . Sell out!

"War of words: Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said Nick Clegg should be ousted to ensure they don't fail badly in 2015 . The Liberal Democrats were plunged . into turmoil yesterday as Vince Cable’s closest political ally suggested . Nick Clegg should step down to prevent a rout at the next election. In a devastating intervention, Lord . Oakeshott said the party needed to overhaul its policies and leadership . in the face of dire opinion poll ratings. Lord Oakeshott, the party’s former . Treasury spokesman, said: ‘We have lost over half our market share – if . you like to put it that way, if we had been Sainsbury’s – since the . election, and any business that had done that would be looking very hard . now at both its strategy and its management to see how we get some of . that back because otherwise we are going to lose a large number of seats . at the next election.’ And in a clear shot at Mr Clegg, he said elections were ‘not just about the message, they are also about the messenger’. He said many Lib Dems found it . ‘difficult’ to be in a coalition and suggested Mr Clegg had to work . harder to drive the party’s values home. He added: ‘We do have... very good . policies which are popular. But on things like the banks, sorting them . out, like taxing the wealthy, we have to fight very hard not just to put . the message across but to get it implemented in government.’ Lord Oakeshott was sacked by Mr Clegg . after criticising the Government’s failure to tackle bank bonuses. But . he remains a close ally of the Business Secretary Vince Cable who is . emerging as the most likely candidate to replace Mr Clegg if he quits or . is forced out before the next election. At odds: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg Nick Clegg (left) has a plan for a new tax on the rich, but it is opposed by Chancellor George Osborne (right) Differences: The Cabinet colleagues have shown a united front in the Commons since the coalition Government was formed, but they disagree over a new tax for the rich . There was no suggestion that Lord . Oakeshott was acting on behalf of Mr Cable, and senior Lib Dems last . night dismissed his intervention as ‘one man’s views’. And last night Mr Clegg said: ‘For as . long as I have been in politics you always have back seat drivers who . end up making endless comments about people who actually have to lead . and make decisions and take responsibility.’ But the intervention was another . setback for the Deputy Prime Minister whose attempt to relaunch his . leadership with plans for a wealth tax have already fallen flat. Criticism: Senior Conservatives John Redwood (left) and Bernard Jenkin (right) have attacked Mr Clegg's proposal . Lord Oakeshott’s comments highlight . mounting concern within Lib Dem ranks about the impact of the Coalition . on the party’s poll ratings. Recent polls have put the party on . just 10 per cent of the vote – less than the UK Independence Party. If . this level of support does not improve, the party stands to lose 47 of . its 57 seats at the next election. Earlier this summer 69-year-old Vince . Cable fuelled speculation about his ambitions by refusing to rule out . succeeding Mr Clegg, saying: ‘I don’t exclude it – who knows what might . happen in the future?’ Under the Lib Dem constitution  a leadership . contest would be triggered if Mr Clegg chooses to call one or quit. Otherwise it requires Mr Clegg to lose a vote of confidence among his . MPs or to face a call to resign from 75 constituency associations. Many observers believe Mr Clegg will . quit before the election – possibly at the party’s 2014 conference – . unless the polls show major improvement. Vince Cable is five times more popular with voters than his party leader, according to a new poll. The YouGov survey found that the Lib Dem Business Secretary enjoys more support among both Lib Dem voters and the wider public. Asked which of six senior ministers they respected the most, 17 per cent said Mr Cable, compared to just three per cent for Mr Clegg. William Hague topped the poll with 22 per cent, David Cameron scored 12 per cent and the Chancellor George Osborne won just one per cent support. Among Lib Dem voters, 51 per cent said they supported Mr Cable, compared to just 19 per cent for their party’s leader. The findings will encourage those within the party who believe its best chance of survival is to install Mr Cable as leader before the next election. The poll also highlights the sense of betrayal among many former Lib Dem voters. Among those who voted Lib Dem in 2010 but say they will not do so again, just one per cent said Mr Clegg was ‘strong’, and just four per cent agreed that he ‘sticks to what he believes in’. Among this group 28 per cent said they respected Mr Cable, compared to just two per cent for Mr Clegg. ANALYSIS by ALEX BRUMMER . The call by Nick Clegg for an emergency wealth tax to help pay the nation’s bills looks like a throwback to the 1970s when then Labour Chancellor Denis Healey threatened to squeeze the rich ‘until the pips squeak’. Instead of raising extra income, Healey’s attacks on the wealthy stifled economic growth and jobs creation and sent capital scurrying overseas. It is, of course, deeply frustrating that some of the super-rich, like the comedian Jimmy Carr, seek to avoid paying tax by using complex schemes designed to keep Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC) at bay. But the answer to that problem is to bring in simpler and lower taxes, with fewer loopholes. Out of sync: Nick Clegg¿s proposals fly in the face of modern tax policy . The consequence of imposing surcharges or super-taxes on the rich is presently to be seen in France. Since President Hollande came to power promising to raise the top rate of income tax to 75 per cent, more than half of France’s most wealthy individuals have indicated that they intend to move overseas or shift their money out of the country. Hollande’s grotesque policy error has become Britain’s gain as many of the French wealth creators are setting up home in London as tax exiles taking advantage of the UK Government’s special scheme for non-domiciles and lower tax bands. Clegg’s proposals fly in the face of modern tax policy. All the evidence suggests that the higher the marginal tax rate, the smaller amount of revenue it produces. Wealth taxes act as a disincentive to work and wealth, and lead the individuals targeted to look for clever ways to avoid paying, move overseas or stop working altogether. 'Grotesque': More than half of France's most wealthy individuals have indicated that they intend to move overseas because of President Hollande's tax policies . The work of Professor Arthur Laffer of Southern California, author of the famous Laffer curves, demonstrates that if income taxes are slashed the incentives to work become greater and more wealth is created. Lord (Nigel) Lawson’s adoption of this tax-cutting principle as part of the Thatcherite economic reforms produced a flood of new income for the Exchequer. Of course it is not Clegg’s responsibility to design the nation’s tax system.In the much-derided March 2012 Budget one of the Chancellor’s biggest reforms, to be implemented next April, was to cut the 50 per cent emergency rate of income tax – imposed by Labour before it left office – to 45 per cent. Labour has sought to portray this decision as a tax break for millionaires. The reality is that studies, carried out by the Treasury, show that above 45 per cent people resent paying their taxes, seek to avoid or try to persuade their employers (if they work for big companies) to move them overseas. The result is a loss of tax revenue rather than a gain. Moreover, because the 50 per cent rate is levied on a  PAYE basis, and is deducted directly from pay packets, it largely hits senior management both in the private and public sector rather than the super-rich. Senior managers are also the principal victims of the removal of personal tax allowances for those earning over £100,000, capital gains tax, inheritance tax and high rates of stamp duty on their homes. Osborne is already seeking to capture extra income from high-wealth individuals by abolishing the loopholes that allow ownership of some of the most expensive homes in Britain to be shifted offshore out of the range of HMRC. Closing these loopholes has become a priority and is a much more efficient way of ensuring that the real millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share.","Lord Oakeshott warns elections are 'not .

He has so far posted nine photos and has gained more than 120,000 followers. In addition, he has more than 405,000 followers on Twitter and nearly eight million on Facebook. The former athlete is believed to have watched his side triumph over Kentucky 44-40 at Papa John's Cardinal Stadium in the comfort of his own Louisville home. The team is now bound for a bowl game. In October, Ali's Parkinson's disease - from which he has suffered for 30 years - was said to have deteriorated so much that he could barely speak or leave the house. The rumors grew after the star was deemed to ill the Hollywood premier of a film about his life. His condition had already meant he had not been able to take part in the production of the movie. At the time, his brother Rahman, 71, who attended the screening of I Am Ali in Hollywood, told The Sunday People: ‘I have not been able to talk to my brother about this because he is sick.

Alongside the image, he wrote: 'Don't believe the hype. Feeling great earlier today at @BoarsHeadResort. #AliSelfie.' His daughter, Hana, 38, and half-sister Maryum, 46, also spoke out to deny rumours the star was unable to speak, bedridden and close to death. They simply said he was 'doing fine'.

Feeling good: He wrote: 'Don't believe the hype. Feeling great earlier today at @BoarsHeadResort. #AliSelfie' His famous line that he would 'float like a butterfly, sting like a bee' came in the build-up to that fight, after which he declared himself 'The Greatest'. He held the belt until 1967, by which time he had converted to Islam and named himself Muhammad Ali, when he was stripped of the title for refusing to fight in Vietnam. He made a comeback and in 1974 knocked out George Foreman in the eight round of the Rumble in the Jungle to become world champion for the second time. He held the title for four years before unexpectedly losing to Leon Spinks in 1978, but defeated him in Las Vegas months later. Nicknamed the Louisville Lip for his wit, Ali remained active for several years after his diagnosis and made a moving appearance at the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Games where he lit the flame. However, the sporting icon, who retired from boxing after suffering several strokes, was seen looking particularly thin and frail at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony. Donning a white suit and trainers, he was helped across the stage by wife Lonnie. In February 2013, Ali's brother Rahman said the former boxer was so crippled by the degenerative brain condition that has afflicted many ex-boxers, he might not survive until the summer.

Above, Ali/Clay shouts defiantly at ringside critics . Powerful: Ali, still known as Clay, punches Doug Jones, at Madison Square Garden in New York in 1963 . He also claimed the family had been barred from seeing Ali, who is estimated to be worth more than £50million, and could only speak to him on the phone. Mr Rahman said his brother was ‘a prisoner in his own home’ and he is being gravely mistreated by his wife because ‘she is more interested in Ali's money than his well-being’. However, Ali’s daughter May May said she had spoken to her father that morning and he was fine, watching the Super Bowl at home in Arizona wearing a Baltimore Ravens jersey.

"Sick: Leslie Cunliffe (in sunglasses) is being deported back to Britain from Australia . A British rapist who carried out a horrific sex attack likened to The Silence of the Lambs will be deported from Australia to the UK, officials confirmed today. Leslie Neil Cunliffe, 63, will be . sent back to Britain even though he has spent his entire adult life . abroad and raised a family in Australia. Cunliffe  posed as a policeman to kidnap a 21-year-old woman, then gagged, blindfolded and bound her. He . then drove her to a sound-proofed dungeon where he . strapped a fake bomb to her. Later he cut off her clothes and raped her. He demanded a one million Australian dollar ransom from her family during the May 1999 attack in Geelong, near Melbourne. Australian police compared the squalid shed where he imprisoned the woman for seven hours with a 'dungeon' from the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs, which starred Anthony Hopkins. Described . as ‘the worst of beasts’, detectives said Cunliffe’s ‘bizarre and . horrendous’ crime was among the worst they have ever witnessed. Cunliffe, who holds a British passport, served 12 years in prison in Australia for the rape before being freed on April 16 last year. But officials today confirmed he lost an appeal against the Australian Department of Immigration's decision that he should be deported to the UK, and will be sent back despite not having lived here for more than 40 years. The Australian authorities have cancelled his visa on 'character' grounds under a provision in their Immigration Act that allows them to expel people convicted of serious offences. The taxpayer now faces a bill for tens of thousands of pounds to provide Cunliffe with housing and benefits. A father-of-two, he left Britain in . 1967, but never took Australian citizenship after his arrival at the age . of 19, allowing the Australian government to deport him after he . breached his parole conditions following his release in April. Cunliffe has been placed in an immigration detention unit while arrangements are made to remove him. A department spokesman said: 'The Federal Court dismissed Mr Cunliffe's appeal against the ministry's decision to cancel his visa so now he continues to be an unlawful non-citizen. 'He remains in immigration detention until arrangements can be made for his deportation.' Australian Federal Court Justice Julie Dodds-Streeton made the ruling at a hearing in Melbourne. The spokesman gave no indication of how long it would take to deport Cunliffe, but said arrangements would be made 'as soon as possible'. Shed of horrors: Leslie Cunliffe dragged his victim into this shed, raped her and forced her to call her parents begging for money . Cunliffe's . deportation echoes the case of convicted pedophile Robert Excell, who . after serving 40 years behind bars in Australia was deported back to . Britain because of ill health. Child . rapist Excell, who was once deemed so dangerous by Australian . authorities they vowed never to release him, had sex offences dating . back to 1965, when he raped a seven-year-old boy. He emigrated to Australia aged ten but never became a citizen. After his release from a Perth jail in 2005 authorities ruled he was to be deported back to Britain. Convicted murderer and serial rapist . Simon Wilson, who had lived in Australia since he was two, was sent back . to Britain in January 2008 after being released on licence from a life . sentence for killing an elderly woman with up to 100 punches. Three months later he attacked and tried to rape a frail 71-year-old woman in Camden, north London. Paedophile Raymond Horne was removed to Britain in March 2008 having served a 12-year prison sentence for 14 sex offences. He lured two homeless boys, aged 13 and 15, to his flat while volunteering for a charity. Horne had moved to Queensland from . Britain in 1952, but never became an Australian citizen and on his . release the authorities revoked his visa.

He repeated that in his remarks on Saturday . but did not say whether the alert had triggered any attempt by the crew . members to disengage the autopilot as part of a last-ditch attempt to . abort landing and re-gain altitude. The pilots did not issue a distress call. Sumwalt . stopped short of saying there was anything unusual about a so-called . 'instrument approach' to the airport using autopilot. But . he said the NTSB would be looking closely into 'UPS's instrument . approach procedures' and how it typically went about guiding a large . cargo hauler to touchdown on Birmingham-Shuttleworth's Runway 18. That's . the runway the UPS jet was approaching when it crashed and Sumwalt said . the investigation would include a flight test at the airport in a UPS . A300. 'We haven't ruled anything in, haven't ruled anything out,' he said. The aircraft went down less than a mile from the end of Runway 18 at Birmingham's airport before dawn Wednesday. UPS has identified the victims of the crash as Capt. Cerea Beal, Jr., 58, of Matthews, N.C., and First Officer Shanda Fanning, 37, of Lynchburg, Tennessee. Investigation: NTSB board member and spokesman Robert Sumwalt during grid search of crash site at a field north of the site at Birmingham International Airport . Landing on the runway can be tricky for pilots, an expert said, particularly those flying big jets like the twin-engine UPS cargo carrier. Sumwalt said the plane was being flown by the captain — who had 8,600 hours of flight experience, including 3,200 hours in an A300 — but investigators don't know whether Beal or Fanning had ever before landed on Runway 18. 'We're going to do our best to find out,' he said. Sumwalt said investigators will analyze the airplane's weight to determine whether it should have attempted a landing on the runway, the shorter of two runways at Birmingham Shuttlesworth International Airport. With a large hill and trees at one end, the runway lacks the electronics for a full instrument landing. That forces pilots to make key judgments about altitude while aiming a descending aircraft at a runway that's 5,000 feet shorter than the airport's main runway, which was closed for maintenance work at the time of the crash. Some pilots simply avoid landing on Runway 18 when possible, said veteran commercial pilot Ross Aimer. 'When I heard they were using Runway 18 it caught my attention because of that hill,' said Aimer. 'It's sad, but it didn't surprise me.' Aimer, a retired United Airlines captain, is now chief executive of Aero Consulting Experts, a firm based in Los Angeles. Black box found: NTSB investigators work around the tail section of the UPS cargo plane . Resting place: A wooden cross by a church is shown near the wreckage of a UPS Airbus A300 cargo plane that crashed on the north side of the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport . Kevin Hiatt, president . and chief executive officer of the Flight Safety Foundation, an . Alexandria, Virginia-based international watchdog group, told Reuters in . an interview on Thursday that a 'full instrument' landing was not . highly advisable at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth. The airport can be tricky to land at because it is nestled among hills and that is especially true of Runway 18, said Hiatt. Hiatt, a former Delta Airlines pilot, said he had touched down on the runway many times himself. 'It . is not a full instrument landing. You have to visually fly into that . runway,' he said. 'Sometimes it takes nuance to land there. You have to . realize that hill is there or you could come in too low.' The crash occurred shortly before dawn in rainy conditions as low-lying clouds hung over Birmingham. So far, Sumwalt said there was nothing to indicate the crash was caused by engine failure or any mechanical issues. He . also said the runway lights were examined and found to have been . 'within one one-100th of a degree of being properly aligned' at the time . of the crash. UPS has . identified the dead crew members Cerea Beal Jr., 58, of Matthews, North . Carolina, and Shanda Fanning, 37, of Lynchburg, Tennessee. As . a standard part of any accident investigation, Sumwalt said the NTSB . was looking into the physical and mental well being of Beal and Fanning . in the 72 hours before the accident. Beal, . the captain of the downed aircraft, had about 8,600 hours total flying . experience, including more than 3,200 hours in the Airbus A300, . according to the NTSB. Destroyed: National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Investigators examine debris of a UPS A300 cargo plane after it crashed on approach at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport in Alabama . Crushed: Part of what appears to be one of the airplane's engines is caked in dirt . Blaze: Flames rise from a UPS Airbus A300 cargo plane which crashed near the airport in Birmingham, Alabama  on Wednesday . The . NTSB previously said a preliminary investigation didn't reveal any . evidence of engine failure before the plane struck trees about one mile . away from the end of the runway. It crashed into the bottom of a hill . less than a quarter mile after hitting the trees. The . A300, which weighs about 172,700 pounds when empty, was at the end of a . 45-minute flight from Louisville, Ky., to Birmingham when it went down. A flight summary from flightaware.com, which tracks airplanes, shows . the aircraft made a descent in steps, which Aimer said is a 'dive and . drive' method common on runways with the same navigational guidance as . Runway 18. Sumwalt said . the aircraft went down during its first landing attempt. Sumwalt said . investigators have not found any problems with the runway's lights or . navigation system, which typically provides pilots with information . about their lateral position but not about their altitude, unlike those . on runways where pilots can land using only instruments. Tragic: Fire crews investigate where a UPS cargo plane lies on a hill at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport after crashing on approach . A postal inspector officer looks over the debris of an UPS Airbus A300 cargo plane after it crashed on approach in the early hours of Wednesday . National Weather Service records from . the morning of the crash show the plane would have descended through . overcast conditions to only a few clouds at 1,100 feet. Within seconds . after the plane hit a tree and at least one turbine sucked in wood, the . twin-engine plane crashed. It . hit the base of that large hill mentioned by Aimer, who said he had . landed on Runway 18 about a half-dozen times, including on some flights . as a cargo pilot. Located . near the southern tip of the Appalachian foothills, Birmingham's airport . is nestled in a low spot between Red Mountain to the south and hills . that lie at the northern end of Runway 18, which is 7,000 feet long. The . main runway is 12,000 feet long and runs east and west, meaning pilots . don't have to negotiate the rough terrain. The . NTSB said the longer runway was closed for maintenance work on its . lights early Wednesday, leaving the shorter runway as the only path to . the ground. Runway 18 is an approved runway with a valid approach, Aimer . said. 'It is definitely legal, but it I had a choice I'd use another runway first,' he said. Fatal crash: Two pilots died when the plane went down in the early hours of Wednesday . Disaster: What appears to be parcels are strewn across a field after a UPS cargo plane came down shortly before dawn in Alabama . A . key task for investigators will be determining why the UPS jet was low . enough to hit trees. The impact sheared off pieces of the aircraft and . sent them crashing onto two homes along with large pieces of limbs. Keenen . Brown, 17, said he witnessed the crash while getting ready for work . before dawn. Brown, who lives with relatives across the street from the . crash site, said it was unusual to see such a large aircraft attempting . to land on the runway. 'I . saw the sky turn orange and I looked up and I saw it in the air on . fire,' Brown said. 'I watched it hit the ground and dirt flew up. This . whole area just shook.' Aimer said the flames could have been shooting from the plane after it struck the trees.","Investigators have not found any problems with the plane .

"Michael Gove said the King James Bible is 'has helped shape and define the English language' The Education Secretary has run into his second public funding row in a week after he was today forced to deny that his plan to send every school in Britain a copy of the King James Bible - at a cost of £377,000 - has run into trouble over funding. The Prime Minister had reportedly told Michael Gove that while he supported the idea, he should avoid using taxpayers' money, according to sources. It follows Mr Gove's suggestion that a replacement for the Royal Yacht Britannia should be commissioned using taxpayers' money to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. The Education Secretary . has yet to find a private sponsor for his project, with some . Whitehall sources reported as saying he has been told he cannot . distribute the book until he does so. But Mr Gove said talks were under way . with a number of individuals and organisations that might 'share some of . the burden' - but the taxpayer would underwrite the cost. 'The taxpayer is there to underwrite . the costs but we are in conversation with a number of individuals and . organisations that may share some of the burden,' he said. Mr Gove said the Bible was the most 'important book written in the English language' and had major cultural and historical significance. He said a 'low cost' deal had been struck with the publisher to provide the Bible - a move he described as a 'powerful and potent' way of highlighting the historical significance of the anniversary. The Bibles will be sent out to more than 20,000 schools to mark the 400th anniversary of it translation. It has been claimed thousands of copies may already have been printed and will be left in a warehouse without the funding, but Department for Education said it did not know if the copies had yet been printed, or where the copies might currently be stored. And they said the aim was to distribute the Bibles to schools at Easter, so the timetable had not been affected by the lack of a sponsor and they would be distributed even if no sponsor is found. A senior education department source told the Guardian enough public money was available for the scheme to go ahead, but No 10 had merely indicated that 'sponsorship was desirable'. But Whitehall sources said Mr Gove was told that it would be wrong to spend nearly £400,000 on the project at a time when the government was in negotiations with teaching unions over cuts to their pensions. Mr Gove's plan would see 20,000 schools receive a copy of the King James Bible . A Department for Education official said in a statement: 'The Prime Minister was clear in his speech in December about the importance of the King James Bible, and marking this important anniversary. ‘The Prime Minister supports the plan to send a copy to every school. We continue to seek philanthropic sponsorship.' The third official translation of the . Bible into English, also known as the Authorised Version, was . commissioned by the Protestant King James I in 1604. It was completed by 54 scholars . working on Hebrew and Greek manuscripts in Oxford, Cambridge and . Westminster. It became the official version used by the Church of . England and was spread around the world along with the British Empire. But its popularity has also endured . because of the poetry and the majesty of its language, with many of its . original phrases entering popular conversation. Among the most famous coinages in its 66 books are 'the powers that be', 'the apple of his eye' and 'the writing on the wall'. Mr Gove said: ‘It‘s a thing of beauty, and it‘s also an incredibly important historical artefact. It has helped shape and define the English language and is one of the keystones of our shared culture. And it is a work that has had international significance’. The 400th anniversary of the publication of the Bible was in 2011.In a speech in December, Mr Cameron celebrated the importance of the King James Bible giving three reasons for its relevance. He said: 'The King James Bible has bequeathed a body of language that permeates every aspect of our culture and heritage. 'Second, just as our language and culture is steeped in the Bible, so too is our politics. 'Third, . we are a Christian country. And we should not be afraid to say so. Let . me be clear: I am not in any way saying that to have another faith – or . no faith – is somehow wrong.' Government ministers have always been careful to avoid controversies surrounding religion with Tony Blair's former communications chief Alastair Campbell famously once declaring: 'We don't do God'. But Mr Gove said: 'It's a thing of beauty, and it's also an incredibly important historical artefact. It has helped shape and define the English language and is one of the keystones of our shared culture. And it is a work that has had international significance'. When the scheme was announced the National Secular Society suggested that the Department for Education could put a message on its website and save 'tens of thousands of pounds'. NSS president Terry Sanderson said: 'It's not as if Bibles are in short supply in schools. But if Mr Gove intends to go ahead with this, will he also please ensure that a copy of On the Origin of Species is sent out on Darwin Day? 'This book is much harder to find in schools and would be in line with his policy of promoting science and evidence-based education. I'm sure that he could write an excellent foreword to this too.' Richy Thompson, campaigns officer at the British Humanist Association, added: 'Either the Government is funding this initiative itself at a time when it is making severe cuts elsewhere, or the Church is finding it but using the Government as a vehicle through which to promote Christianity - both are unacceptable.'","Gove's second funding row in a week after suggesting the state should pay for a new Royal Yacht .

"A 9-year-old Kansas girl died this week due to a brain-eating amoeba. Victim Hally Yust died on Wednesday, Fox4KC says, and had been exposed to the Naegleria fowleri amoeba. Yust's obituary said she played multiple sports and hoped to play college basketball. 'As a giver, caretaker, sister, daughter, and friend, Hally was the light to the world and a blessing to all,' her obituary said. She is survived by her parents and three siblings. Scroll down for video . Victim: Hally Yust, pictured, died this week because of a brain-eating amoeba . The Kansas Department of Health and Education (KDHE) said in a news release that the victim had been in several bodies of fresh water. The source of the amoeba was not identified, the agency said. The KDHE said the amoeba led to primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), which can reach a swimmer's brain through his or her nose. 'Naegleri fowleri can be found in freshwater environments around the world, but infection causing PAM is extremely rare,' the agency said. 'From 1962 to 2013, there have been 132 cases reported in the United States, with 34 of those cases occurring from 2004 to 2013. 'Most cases have occurred in southern-tier states. The risk of infection is very low, but increases during the summer months when water temperatures rise and more people participate in water-related activities.' Active: Hally Yust, pictured, enjoyed sports, including waterskiing . Robert Moser of the KDHE said in the release 'It is important for the public to know that infections like these are extremely rare and there are precautions one can take to lower their risk – such as nose plugs.' Yust's family said in a statement to Fox4KC that Hally 'loved life and part of her great joy was spending time playing in the water. Her life was taken by a rare amoeba organism that grows in many different fresh water settings. We want you to know this tragic event is very, very rare, and this is not something to become fearful about. 'We hope you will not live in fear of this rare infection that took our daughter’s life.

"A 14-year-old boy has been left with the body of a 110-year-old in India because he has a rare disease which makes him age eight times faster than normal. Ali Hussain has seen five of his siblings die from the same condition called Progeria which is known to affect just 80 people worldwide. Two of his brothers and three of his sisters have died from the disease in Bihar, the poorest state in India. Scroll down for video . Sufferer: Ali Hussain, 14, of Bihar, India, has Progeria which makes his body age eight times faster than normal.  The rare condition is known to affect only 80 people in the world, but has killed five of his siblings . Progeria causes rapid ageing and . sufferers of the genetic disease are prone to arthritis, eye problems, . heart disease and baldness. Sufferers are not expected to live much beyond the age of 14 - but despite the grim prognosis Ali has refused to give up hope. ‘I very much want to live and I hope there is medicine for my condition out there. I’m not scared of death but my parents have suffered a lot,' he said. 'I’d love to live much longer for them. I don’t want to burden them with any more pain.’ Ali’s parents Nabi Hussain Khan, 50, and Razia, 46, are first cousins and were the product of an arranged marriage 32 years ago. Illness: Ali's genetic condition effectively has the body of a 110-year-old because of the rare condition . Child victim: Ali Hussain is held by his mother Razia, 46. She has had eight children and six of them have suffered from Progeria . Their children Rehana, Iqramul, Gudiya and Rubina have all died from Progeria between the ages of 12 and 24. A fifth child, a boy who died within 24 hours of being born, is also thought to have had the rare condition. Nabia and Razia, who have had eight children in total, do have two healthy daughters - Sanjeeda, 20, who is married with two children of her own. Their youngest daughter Chanda, 10, also does not have Progeria. When their first daughter, Rehana, was born in 1983 they had no idea anything was wrong at first. It was only after her second birthday when she couldn’t eat or walk properly did they visit a doctor. But the doctor was baffled and he sent them home with some medicines. Progeria was so rare and poorly documented that most doctors had never heard of it. Family victims: Nabi Hussain Khan, 50, (left) with his wife Razia, 46, (right) and their children. Sanjeeda, now aged 20, (back, centre) does not have Progeria . Nabi Hussain Khan, 50, and his wife Razia, 46, have had eight children and six of them have suffered from Progeria. Two years later when their son Iqramul was born,and showed the same symptoms, the family went back to the doctor. But again, they were not offered any tests or possible diagnosis. Nabi, who works as a gatekeeper at a factory earning 2,000 rupees - or £20 - a month said: ‘We never heard of the word Progeria, the doctors never mentioned it. They were stabbing in the dark; they were as clueless as us. 'If a doctor had perhaps told us that our children were suffering with some kind of genetic problem and we were connected we would’ve stopped having children. But nothing was said.’ Nabi and Razia carried on having children hoping they would conceive a healthy boy or girl eventually. Their wish was granted when they had Sanjeeda. In 1995, after years visiting different doctors, a consultant in Kolkata finally diagnosed four of their children with Progeria and broke the devastating news that there was no cure for ay of them. ‘The diagnosis didn’t help,’ Nabi added. ‘People were sure there was a cure. No one in our community believed there was nothing that could be done. 'Neighbours and extended family tormented us for not getting them help, they couldn’t understand a disease with no cure.’ Life was made unbearable for the five children growing up with Progeria and they were mocked in school and called names like ‘big-eyed boy’ and ‘Patlu’ meaning skinny. Eventually they all stopped going to school. Ali, who weighs just 1st 8lbs, said: ‘None of us have had a childhood, we were confined to our homes. 'We had each other but that was it. We had no life. When we did go to school we were pushed and shoved, called names, kids tried to harm us. We can’t do much physically either; our lungs are so small we get breathless easily. Illness: Ali is fed by his mother. Progeria causes rapid ageing and sufferers of the genetic disease are prone to arthritis, eye problems, heart disease and baldness . ‘I would love to be a normal person who can play, go to school, do some sports, take some risks. Sometimes I get depressed but most of the time I make the most of the life I have.’ Ali is now the family’s only surviving Progeria sufferer. When his brother Ikramul died four years ago he was devastated. ‘Iqramul was my best friend,’ he said. ‘I was very young when my other siblings died, so it were just Ikramul and I for a long time. 'He was very strong and didn't pay any attention to the bullies. When he died I cried for weeks and couldn't eat but then I realised I’d be doing him a huge injustice if I crumbled. I have no one now, no friends, but I have to stay strong.’ Victim: Ali, 14, who weighs just 1st 8lbs, is not expected to live more than a few years longer . Ali and his parents are now supported by a Kolkata-based charity called SB Devi Charity. Pediatrician Dr Chandan Chattopadhyay, from Kolkata, introduced the family to the organisation and now they help Ali pay for his medical needs. Ali spends all of his time with his mother and sisters, Sanjeeda, 20 and Chanda, ten, and he believes there’s no one else like him in the world. But when told about the famous annual Progeria Reunion, run by the Sunshine Foundation, he would love to attend. ‘It’s very lonely living this life, especially since my siblings have gone,' he added. 'I don’t know if there’s anyone else like me. I’d like to be in the company of other people like me again. And I know my brother would be proud of me for doing so.’","Ali Hussain, 14, has Progeria which makes his body age eight times faster than normal .

"UKIP's success in the May European elections has coincided with a surge in donations to the party . Donations to Ukip have exceeded those to the Liberal Democrats for the first time. Ukip was given more than £1.4million in the three months to June – a three-fold increase on the previous period - compared to the Lib Dems’ total of £1.2million. Most of the Ukip total was accounted for by a single donation from Yorkshire entrepreneur Paul Sykes, who gave the party just over £1million. The donation figures may be seen as reflecting the parties’ respective political fortunes over recent months. While Ukip romped to victory in the European Parliament elections, the Lib Dems saw their number of MEPs slashed to just one. Ukip said the figures were testament to the fact that Ukip was ‘replacing the Lib Dems as the third party of British politics’. Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: ‘We have got a long way to go in terms of our fundraising but we are getting there. ‘To overhaul the Lib Dems for the first time is another symptom of a very real change that is taking place in British politics.’ Overall the figures showed the Tories outperforming Labour in fundraising in the run up to next year’s General Election. The Conservative Party reported raising £7,185,709 in donations, nearly half of all the money raised by all political parties over the three month period. Among the biggest Tory donors were Barrie Pettman, a publisher Michael Gooley, a former SAS officer who set up travel company Trailfinders. Both donated £500,000. The Tory total was nearly double the £3.7million raised by Labour in the same period. Of that one union, Unison, accounted for nearly a fifth with a single donation of more than £680,000. Property developer Sir David Garrard gave the party £629,000. Tory analysis of the figures suggested Labour had received some £34million from the unions under Ed Miliband – the equivalent of £741,000 a month. Around one third of the £34million came the Unite union, led by ‘Red’ Len McCluskey. Union donations in that period account for 70 per cent of all Labour’s funding. Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘The figures are jaw dropping. Apparently it costs £1,000 an hour to hire your own very Labour leader. ‘Union bosses like Len McCluskey have siphoned off £34 million from their members' pay-packets, and funnelled it into Labour’s election war chest - a truly staggering amount. ‘And we all know what payback they want from weak Ed Miliband: more wasteful spending, more taxes, and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.’ Nick Clegg's Lib Dems earned less in donations in the three months to June than UKIP, for the first time ever . Labour said the Tories were being ‘bankrolled by a small pool of big money donors’. A spokesman said another £2 million had been raised by the . Tories from donors who attended private dinners with David Cameron and other senior ministers - taking the total to £5 million this year. Donations from individuals or companies linked to hedge funds or other asset management companies totalled some £1.6million in the second quarter of this year. Shadow cabinet office minister Jonathan Ashworth MP said: ‘When millions are flowing in from hedge funds and exclusive groups of donors, is it . any wonder David Cameron stands up for the privileged few? ‘Millionaires and hedge funds have been given a tax cut while hardworking families suffer from a cost-of-living crisis. David Cameron is leading an out-of-touch, hollowed-out party which has no answers to the major challenges our country faces.’ Mr Sykes was a Tory donor who quit the party in 1994 over John Major’s approach to Europe – before offering to fund rebel Eurosceptic Tories in the 1997 election. He then shifted to Ukip before returning to the Tories for the 2005 election. His fortune is estimated at some £650million. The donations came from his company, the Highstone Group Ltd. The figures were released by the Electoral Commission, which collates donation details. The Scottish National Party raised £1.1 million – the vast bulk in a single donation from Stagecoach boss Brian Souter.","Ukip was given more than £1.4million in the three months to June .

"David Cameron said the use of chemical weapons in Syria crossed a 'red line' for Britain and its allies . There is 'growing evidence' that the Syrian government has committed war crimes against its own people by using chemical weapons in the country’s brutal civil war, David Cameron warned today. If it is confirmed Syrian forces had used the weapons, the regime of beleaguered President Bashar al Assad would have crossed what the Prime Minister called the ‘red line’ opening the way for  Britain and its allies to intervene in the two-year conflict. Mr Cameron said he did not think it was 'likely' that UK troops would be sent in to Syria, but vowed to send a 'very clear warning' to the government that the 'appalling actions' would not be tolerated'. It is understood that Britain has obtained samples from inside Syria that have been tested by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down, Wiltshire. Further samples of hair and soil suspected of containing the nerve agent sarin and to have been used in an attack near the city of Aleppo 13 days ago are said to have been also passed to scientists. Intelligence gleaned by both the UK and US indicated there is evidence that Assad’s forces had used the weapons and in particular sarin, officials said. Barack Obama has previously said the use of chemical weapons would be a 'red line' for the US to intervene. Mr Cameron said: 'There is growing evidence that we've seen of the use of chemical weapons, probably by the regime, it's extremely serious. 'This is a war crime and we should take it very seriously.' He said the government was being 'careful not to make the mistake sometimes made in the past' by rushing claims into the domain domain, seen as a reference to Tony Blair's claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Mr Cameron told BBC Breakfast: 'We're trying to consider the evidence with our allies, make sure that we can verify it, but this is extremely serious and I think what President Obama said was absolutely right, t that this should form for the international community a red line for us to do more.' Today two Syrian officials denied the government has used chemical weapons against rebel forces, saying the regime had no need for them. Syrian official Sharif Shehadeh called the U.S. claims 'lies' and likened them to false accusations that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction ahead of the U.S. invasion of that country. Scroll down for video . Blast: A shell explodes in the Syrian city of Daraya today. The strategically placed town near Damascus has reportedly been captured by government forces after five weeks of fighting . Injured: A video posted on Facebook and YouTube appears to show victims of a Syrian regime assault on Aleppo foaming at the mouth suggesting the use of sarin gas . Graphic: The video was posted on the Facebook page of British-trained doctor Niazi Habash, who treated some of the Aleppo victims . Britain has led calls for the international community to step up its support for rebel forces battling to overthrow Assad. But this week there were warnings . that British nationals joining the fighting in Syria were being . radicalised by violent Islamist groups and could launch terror attacks . when they return home. Mr Cameron added: 'I’ve always been keen for us to do more, we’re working with the opposition, we want our allies and partners to do more with us to shape that opposition, to make sure we’re supporting people with good motives, who want a good outcome to put pressure on that regime so that we can bring it to an end.' He insisted he did not 'want to see' British troops sent in to Syria, but said a clear message had to be sent to the Syrian government. 'I don’t want to see that and I don’t think that is likely to happen but I think we can step up the pressure on the regime, work with our partners, work with the opposition in order to bring about the right outcome. 'But we need to go on gathering this evidence and also to send a very clear warning ot the Syrian regime about these appalling actions.' Claims: U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said intelligence sources . had confirmed the use of Sarin gas by the Syrian government during a . press conference in Abu Dhabi today . It comes after both the US and Britain went public last night with claims that chemical weapons had been used. A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘We have . limited but persuasive information from various sources showing chemical . weapon use in Syria, including sarin. This is extremely concerning. 'Use of chemical weapons is a war . crime. We have briefed our allies, partners and the UN on this . information and we are working actively to get more and better . information. '(Bashar) Assad must cooperate with . the international community and prove that his regime has not committed . this horrific crime, allowing unrestricted access for the UN and OPCW . (Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons) to investigate on . the ground in Syria.' The British claims came minutes after . US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said US intelligence had concluded . with ‘some degree of varying confidence’ that Assad’s forces have used . chemical weapons on a ‘small scale’. He added: 'The intelligence community has been assessing information for some time on this issue and the decision to reach this conclusion was made within the past 24 hours.' US Secretary of State John Kerry . suggested Assad’s forces had ‘launched’ two chemical attacks. No . information was made public on what quantity of chemical weapons might . have been used, or when or what casualties might have resulted. White House sources stressed that more information was needed and the current assessments were not enough. Warning: U.S. President Barack Obama has said that the use of chemical weapons in Syria would be a 'game changer' while Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said . the West will pay a price 'in the heart' of Europe and the U.S. for . their alleged backing Islamic fundamentalists . Washington called for a UN investigation but former presidential candidate John McCain said the West should intervene. ‘What I worry about is that now... that Bashar Assad has crossed the red line that the president has . established and we don’t take action,’ he said. ‘Iranians, Hezbollah, . others in the region will be paying close attention.’ The CIA believes Syria has had a . chemical weapons programme for years. There is grave concern in the UK . and US that its stockpile of chemical weapons – approximately 1,000 . tons, stored in 50 towns – could fall into the hands of Al Qaeda to be . turned on Western targets. The Foreign Office called on Assad to cooperate with international bodies to prove he had not sanctioned their use. In an escalation of the war in . Afghanistan, the RAF has carried out unmanned drone missions against the . Taliban from British soil for the first time. The Reaper drones are controlled from . RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire. The Ministry of Defence said they had . supported ground troops with ‘armed intelligence and surveillance . missions’. No information was made public on . what quantity of chemical weapons might have been used, or when or what . casualties might have resulted. President . Barack Obama has said the use of chemical weapons would be a . 'game-changer' in the U.S. position on intervening in the Syrian civil . war, and the letter to Congress reiterates that the use or transfer of . chemical weapons in Syria is a 'red line for the United States.' However, the letter also hints that a broad U.S. response is not imminent. There have been four reports in recent months of  chemical weapons being deployed by the Assad regime. Syria . is thought by the CIA to have a large stockpile of chemical weapons . thought to include sarin and mustard gas that can be deployed using . aircraft, ballistic missiles and artillery rocket. Destruction: Parts of the northern Syrian city of Aleppo have been destroyed during the bitter civil war. The aftermath of a separate assault by the Syrian regime on the city is pictured . 10-year-old Syrian refugee Bashar al-Zalfi waves the victory sign in front of a wall with the colors of the revolutionary flag, and Arabic reading, 'Syria, don't worry, we will return,' in Mafraq, Jordan . Both the rebel forces and Assad's regime have accused each other of using them and there have been reports from iside Syria of containers, possibly conatining Sarin, being dropped from the air. Fears have grown in recent months for the safety of the stockpile. It is also believed that Syria has attempted to develop more toxic nerve agents. And Syria's president al-Assad warned . the West will pay a price 'in the heart' of Europe and the U.S. for . their alleged backing Islamic fundamentalists in his country's civil . war. UK Foreign Secretary William Hague revealed last week that a soil sample taken from Khan al-Assad had tested positive for a chemical agent. Earlier this week UK foreign secretary Mr Hague said that the UK will try and tear up an EU arms embargo next month so that weapons can be supplied to Syrian rebels and said that both Britain and France want to be able to 'take urgent action' should future atrocities take place. The UK will send 34 vehicles, including five armoured 4x4s and 20 sets of body armour to those seeking to overthrow dictator Bashar al-Assad. The Obama administration opposes directly arming Syrian opposition fighters, in part out of fear that the weapons could fall into the hands of Islamic extremists. Sarin . is a more sophisticated successor to Zyklon B which was used by the . Nazis in the extermination of millions of Jews in Hitler's death camps. It is like some farm pesticides but does not occur naturally and cannot occur naturally. Saddam Hussein used it in the late 80s against Kurdish rebels and it was behind the death of the entire population of Halabja. United Nations agents destroy chemical weapons stockpiled by Saddam Hussein in 1998 . It is so toxic that a drop the . size of a pin prick is enough to kill and it is heavier than air so it . hovers close to the ground maximising casualties. Fumes . from the colourless, odourless liquid last longer the warmer the . environment so the constant 25°C on Tokyo's subway provided the perfect . condition. Sarin . attacks the vegal nervous system and victims die within minutes either . through respiratory failure or a heart attack as they choke on their own . mucus or saliva.","No 10 said Britain had obtained 'limited but persuasive information'

"The Burberry show is literally the only time of the year I wish spring and summer would just b***** off out of the way so we could fast forward to winter again. Christopher Bailey's sumptuous collections, at once classic and quirky, are always alluring, and that's without the beautiful location in Kensington Gardens, the epic soundtrack (this year pounding piano and piercing lyrics by Ed Harcourt, Paloma Faith and Rhodes) and the stellar front row (Harry Styles, cute as a Burberry button in forest green suede trench, was the highlight). Oh yes - and the models, always the cream of the fashion week crop, including longtime Burberry family member Cara Delevingne along with Suki Waterhouse, Jourdan Dunn, Charlotte Wiggins and Malaika Firth. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Prints: Geometric prints, florals and a dash of Apache on the runway at Burberry. Plus: bags are oversized again, yes! Back to the clothes though, and THAT . blanket coat... Bailey sent out all his models wearing wool blanket . ponchos, knitted in muted yellows, reds and blues, patterned in a sort . of Bauhaus Mondrian-inspired geometric way, or with Apache-style zig . zags. Each one was . monogrammed with the initials of the model who wore it (indeed, front . row fodder Cat Deeley, who named it as her favourite piece from the . show, had her eye on Cara Delevingne's). Wandering Eye - Ed Harcourt . Raise Your Love - by Rhodes . Only Love Can Hurt Like This - by Paloma Faith . There were blanket coats, too, equestrian blanket scarves, relaxed trenches and trench coat ponchos. Elsewhere, . bold nature-inspired prints were emblazoned on dresses and silk . scarves, silk cotton organdy dresses were handpainted, while flowers were painted on buttersoft shoes. The show, called The Bloomsbury Girls, took inspiration from the British decorative art of the Bloomsbury set and Charleston, the country home and meeting place for the writers, painters and intellectuals who formed the group. It was an explosion of rich, yet natural, colour: elderberry, cameo pink, blackcurrant, slate blue, antique rose, russet red ink blue, bottle green, burnt amber, olive, amethyst, larch yellow, camel, black amethyst... the list goes on.

"A couple celebrated a wedding day moment to remember - after getting married on 11/12/13 - at 14:15. Philip Broughton and Fiona Wiltshire picked the date and time to set up a unique numerical progression on their special day. And the occasion went without a hitch, despite some initial reservations from the registrar. Groom Philip, 60, said: 'When we tried to book for quarter past we were told we had to choose 2pm or 2.30pm. So we went for 2.30pm and planned to turn up early. Auspicious: Philip Broughton and Fiona Wiltshire picked the date and time to set up a unique numerical progression on their special day . 'It wasn't until five weeks ago when we were speaking to our registrar and she asked us about the time that we got it sorted. Once we explained she said it wouldn't be a problem. 'We'd like to thank the registrar for being so understanding and letting us do it.' Bride Fiona, 47, said: 'It's one you won't forget. We wanted to get married in December and it was Phil's idea to do it today. Some guests did raise an eyebrow when we said but most of them only noticed when we pointed it out.' Ian Hulme, the best man, was behind the idea of the quarter past two ceremony. He said: 'As soon as they told me the date I said you should have it at that time. It's just obvious isn't it?' The ceremony and reception, for 65 people, was held at Best Western Hotel Smokies on Ashton Road in Oldham. Thankful: The couple, from Norton Moss, were delighted that the registrar agreed to hold their wedding at the slightly unusual time of 2.15pm . When asked about pre-wedding jitters, the groom said: 'I wasn't at all nervous until this morning but I do have a jippy tummy now. It's alright for Fiona, because she has to get ready and get her hair done, so she's occupied, I've just got to wait around. And I've gone and forgot my book! 'Last night I stayed in the room Fiona and the bridesmaids will be getting ready in and was threatened with serious injury not to look at the dresses.' Fiona added: 'I'm relieved now we've had the service. I wasn't really nervous before but I'm just relieved everything has gone without a hitch.' Philip, originally from Ardwick, and Fiona, from Newton Moss, first met five years ago through their passion for ballroom dancing and got engaged on Christmas Day last year. Philip said: 'We just got on really well straight away.' The couple have decided to put off their honeymoon until next year. Philip said: 'Home.

"While most of the UK continues to be deluged by rain - the early signs of spring have already made an appearance in one Devon town. Keen gardener Brian Rickard saw the first daffodils in his Plymouth, Devon, flowerbeds bloom in time for Christmas. The bright yellow flower made an appearance despite the town enduring 128.8mm of rain already in December - surpassing its monthly average for this time of year of 118.8mm.

Everybody who goes past is amazed. 'We always seem to have the first out. People are always saying ""how on earth do you do it?"". 'We don’t do anything at all. We just planted them and left them. I think it is because we are in a sheltered valley. He added: 'These are in the front garden, which is south facing so it’s a bit warmer.' Three girls spot early daffodils as they walk to the pub for Christmas lunch in Westward Ho!, North Devon . Brian, 73, a retired university technician, said neither he, nor his wife Mary, knew what variety the bulbs were. 'I haven’t a clue,' he said. 'It’s team work. Mary does the weeding and I do the planting and digging. 'It does cheer you up, seeing daffodils at Christmas.' Although normally planted in Autumn, daffodils develop their roots over several months before flowering in the spring. Mr Rickard's daffodils were not the only ones to flower two months early. More daffodils were spotted in Westward Ho!, Devon.","Brian Rickard saw the first daffodil bloom in his Plymouth, Devon, garden .

"It was an accolade previously held by the Duchess of Cambridge. But today, as Kim Sears cheered Andy Murray to fourth round victory at the Australian Open showcasing yet another affordable gem, it was clear she has earned the title Queen of the High Street. Despite having her own successful company painting animal portraits - not to mention a boyfriend worth millions - Kim always looks to the high street for her courtside outfits. But with her glossy hair, expensive highlights and that darn Mulberry bag we've been coveting for over a year now, she makes absolute bargain High Street buys look anything but. Kim Sears looked chic courtside today wearing a £129 printed Hobbs dress - on sale at Asos for £77 - and fitted denim jacket with Pandora bracelets, £55, at her wrists . Kim has managed to keep her trusty Mulberry Willow handbag looking immaculate over the course of a year - it's a fashion conundrum. Does she every put it down? Her £1,350 Mulberry Willow has proved to be a real favourite. She has been carrying it since last year and her fondness shows no sign of abating (we're wondering how she has kept it looking so new - does she have  multiple, like the Queen and her Launer bags, or Kate and her nude L.K.Bennett pumps? It's a conundrum we would love to solve: answers in the comments section below). Kim turned up at the Rod Laver stadium to support her boyfriend of eight years as he took on French hope Stéphane Robert. He may have beat the Frenchman in straight sets, but it was no easy ride - Murray fought hard to win, taking him through to the quarter final - and another step closer to picking up the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup for the first time.

Kim has attended all of Andy's matches in Australia so far - but has still had time to work on her tan... yes, we are a little bit envious . Murray will next face the winner of the Federer Vs Tsonga match, which is underway now. And while it is often pointed out that Kim Sears is a loyal girlfriend to Murray, it is clear from the tennis ace's comments that the two are very much a team. Murray recently praised Miss Sears’s ability to gauge when he needs company and . when he wants to be alone as ‘fundamental’ to their relationship. He said: ‘Kim sees all of the emotions when I win or lose a match, she can tell how I’m really feeling.’ And he says that Kim helps him from a business perspective too. After banking nearly £20million in . prize money, Murray admits to feeling ‘vulnerable’ when bombarded by . people wanting to do deals, so he relies on ‘savvy’ Miss Sears to spot . those trying to leech on to him.

"In the light of recent news that a British firm had created a 230 calorie Full English breakfast that you can drink, MailOnline felt duty bound to try it out. Our verdict? It may be low fat, low cal and have what the firm describe as a 'powerful, distinctive and appealing' taste... but it looks like vomit. Yes. If you were thinking of stocking up on these as a post-Christmas party hangover cure, think again. It's the sort of drink that could prompt a full-scale relapse if you're feeling a bit delicate. Trial run: The firm's flavour kitchen has produced a batch of the liquid fry up drink to gauge reaction and understand whether it will be a commercial proposition . Proof is in the pudding: Bosses at Fuel admitted that whether people like the taste of the fry up drink very much depends on personal taste - and we would agree . Duty called though, so I gave the drink a sniff. Thankfully, it has barely any aroma, and the faint whiff it does have is not at all unpleasant. Think of the smell of a piece of chewed up toast - kind of sweet, and a bit carby. But as the pale orange liquid rippled out of the mouth of the container into the cup, I watched in horror as foul-looking bobbly bits bumped and flowed over the carton's rim. My stomach convulsed with every one. It reminded me of the time my twin sister got car sick after eating a bag of Hula Hoops and the resulting rubbery clusters pinged and bounced around the back seat. That all-too-vivid memory coupled with the sensation of the vomity bobbles as they clung to my lips on the way in was enough to set off my sensitive gag reflex, which had sprung to attention as soon as I opened the carton. Tasty treat: The liquid fry up is being developed as the perfect and fast breakfast on the go for the chisel-jawed action man. Right, reality bites as the drink is poured into a cup for tasting . The drink, which did taste essentially like a fry-up milkshake, had no chance. Its cloying, meaty sweetness clung to the back of my tongue. It was one of the most unwelcome things I have ever had in my mouth, and I have eaten everything from lamb's testicles and tongue to mealworms and grasshoppers. Let's be fair though. I am neither the target audience nor the most ideal guinea pig. The liquid fry-up and I were never destined to be culinary soulmates. I like poached eggs with grilled vine tomatoes, a few slices of avocado and sourdough toast for my breakfast. I would never eat or drink anything that contained mystery ingredients, anything with a chemical compound I couldn't pronounce (unless it was a Haribo Tangfastic), or anything with an even remotely 'meal replacement' vibe. So what did one of my, ahem, less fussy colleagues, James - dubbed Human Dustbin by peers - make of the liquid fry-up? For starters, despite saying it looked 'f****** disgusting', he downed the whole cup. Already way ahead of me. But although he has got a stomach of iron and seemed not to flinch at the bobbly bits, in a rare moment of self-control, he refused to go back for more. 'It’s not often that I’d turn down the offer of a full English breakfast – but this is probably one of those times,' he said afterwards. 'With the consistency and appeal of a soggy bowl of cornflakes, the drink is sweet, filling and good for those on a diet – because one mouthful is plenty.' I asked him if it turned his stomach. 'No, but then not a lot does,' he said. High praise there then... but, ever eager to give products a fair trial, I sought out another victim sorry, I mean guinea pig, to test the fry-up. Victim #2, Karl, was less diplomatic. If that's possible. 'It tastes like sweet, milky sick,' he said (a man after my own heart). 'It looks like has tiny bits of satsuma floating in the top, and has a nasty oily sheen to boot. Ugh.' A third victim admitted that it wasn't the best thing they'd ever drunk, but it 'definitely tasted of bacon and eggs', 'wasn't that bad' and they would 'definitely down it to get through to lunch'. A win! With that though, the rest of the liquid fry-up had to go the way of the bin. Maybe the chisel-jawed action men it's targeted at will like it better than we did. Sorry chaps! Tucking into a full English breakfast . is a favourite for millions... but now a British firm claims to have . captured all the flavours in a drink, with a third of the calories. In . the mix are the tastes of two rashers of streaky bacon, one grilled . Cumberland sausage, a poached egg, two fried tomatoes, baked beans, . mushrooms, brown toast, salt, pepper and brown sauce. Fuel, . behind more recognisable breakfast drink flavours such as chocolate and . latte, insists the ingredients have been distilled rather than pulped . into a runny gloop. As a . result, each 330ml carton has about 6g of fat and 230 calories. Even a . relatively modest fry-up would clock up 37g of fat with 618 calories. Fuel . co-founder Barney Mauleverer said: ‘It will not be for everyone, but . for people who do like the flavour notes of a fry-up, I think it’s . great. If it gets a positive reaction, then it will go into production.’ The . company already has Fuel liquid breakfast cartons on the shelves of the . likes of Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s, which come in less alarming . chocolate, strawberry or caramel latte flavours. Just . as busy Britons have given up on eating breakfast at the kitchen table . in favour of cereal bars munched on the daily commute, so the new drinks . could take the place of bacon and eggs. Mr Mauleverer said his team have . tested more than 500 fry up combinations to develop what they believe is . a powerful,  distinctive and appealing taste. ‘We have taken about six months, testing hundreds of recipe combinations to get to this point,’ he said. Breakfast time: Scientists have extracted infusions of flavours from a real fry up and added them to a milk base . Taste test: 'Frygella' gives the breakfast potion a try . ‘What . we have done is extract infusions of flavours from a real fry up, . rather than blending up bacon and sausages which turns in to a bit of a . lumpy mush. ‘The flavours have been mixed with a . milk base, where we have added protein, fibre and vitamins. It is a bit . like the clever techniques used by Heston Blumenthal to make his ice . cream.’ At the moment, the . firm’s flavour kitchen has produced a batch of the liquid fry up drink . to gauge reaction and understand whether it will be a commercial . proposition. ‘If people like it, we will take it on to the next level,’ he said. ‘The drink has a good level of protein, but we are not selling this as a muscle-building product.' Rather the idea is that it is sufficiently tasty and filling that it will carry someone through until lunch.

"A porn star can barely talk after a brutal beating, allegedly at the hands of her MMA fighter boyfriend at their Las Vegas home.Christy Mack is in hospital and Jon Koppenhaver, known in the ring as War Machine, is wanted by police. There was allegedly a third person involved in the fracas who also sustained injuries, but police have not revealed that person's identity.

I can't believe what I found and can't believe what happened. 'I'm so heart broken...in all ways. I will always love you.' TMZ reports that Mack is 'in very bad shape' after the attack and can barely speak from her injuries. A representative for the porn actress told TMZ that Mack's friends and relatives are offering a $5,000 reward to anyone who can provide clues as to Koppenhaver's whereabouts. Welterweight Koppenhaver, who appears on the FOX show Ultimate Fighter, has been released from his contract with MMA tournament group Bellator.

"A City financier who was made a Tory peer on Friday had given the party more than £330,000 just weeks earlier, it emerged yesterday. Michael Farmer’s latest donation is believed to take the total value of his gifts to the Conservatives close to £7million. His appointment sparked a cash-for-honours row, with critics claiming wealthy donors were able to buy places in the legislature. Hedge fund manager, Michael Farmer, was given a peerage by the Prime Minister last week - just weeks after handing the party more than £300,000 . Now the latest Electoral Commission figures have revealed that Farmer – who was appointed as the Tories’ co-treasurer in 2012 to help raise money – had donated £333,500 himself between April and June. Mr Farmer is known in the City as ‘Mr Copper’ after he made £100million in the international metal markets. He now runs the hedge fund Red Kite Capital Management. As well as donating several million pounds to the Tory party, the committed Christian has also given money to the think-tank set up by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith – the Centre for Social Justice, which works to defend the family unit. David Cameron has been accused by Labour of standing up for 'the privileged few' after taking millions of pounds from wealthy City donors . Of his political donations, Mr Farmer has previously said: ‘You can call me a City fat cat if you want, but I’m not giving away my hard-earned money for fun. 'I’m giving it away because I want to fund something I genuinely believe: that Cameron and the Tories will be a far better Government for the country than Labour.’ Last week the father-of-three said he was ‘greatly honoured’ to have been nominated by the Prime Minister to become a Conservative peer. He said he was looking forward ‘to working and supporting the Government in the House of Lords, in particular in its important long-term work for the economy, and in its ongoing reform of our welfare and educational systems’. Analysis by the Electoral Reform Society found that of the 21 new peers appointed by the three main parties, six were donors, while 16 had previously held some form of political position. Katie Ghose, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said: ‘These appointments further cement the impression that to get into the House of Lords, all you have to do is write a fat cheque to a political party or be a party hack.’ The appointment of Mr Farmer and his fellow new peers – including former M&S boss Sir Stuart Rose and The Apprentice star Karren Brady – boosted the numbers in the Lords to some 850. Other donors elevated to the Upper Chamber included jewellery tycoon Ranbir Singh Suri, dubbed the King of Bling, who gave more than £300,000 to the Tories either personally or through his firm. The Conservatives have strongly defended the appointment of Mr Farmer, describing him as a ‘worthy recipient’ of a peerage. Tory sources pointed out Mr Farmer’s philanthropic work and sponsorship of a successful academy school in south London. A Conservative Party spokesman added: ‘All donations to the Conservative Party are fully and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission and published on their website.’ Donations to Ukip have exceeded those to the Liberal Democrats for the first time. The party was given more than £1.4million in the three months to June – a three-fold increase on the previous period – compared to the Lib Dems’ total of £1.2million. Most of the Ukip total was accounted for by a single donation from Yorkshire entrepreneur and former Tory donor Paul Sykes, who gave the party just over £1million. It comes after Ukip reported its membership numbers had surged to nearly 40,000 during the European elections, meaning the party now has nearly as many members as the Lib Dems, who reported more than 43,500 members in their latest figures. The donations may be seen as reflecting the parties’ respective political fortunes over recent months. While Ukip romped to victory in the European Parliament elections in May, the Lib Dems saw their number of MEPs slashed from 11 to one. Ukip said the numbers were testament to the fact that the party was ‘replacing the Lib Dems as the third party of British politics’. Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: ‘We have got a long way to go in terms of our fundraising but we are getting there. ‘To overhaul the Lib Dems for the first time is another symptom of a very real change that is taking place in British politics.’ The figures were released by the Electoral Commission. They also revealed the Conservative Party has raised £7,185,709 in donations, nearly half of all the money raised by all political parties over the three month period – and almost double the £3.7million raised by Labour.","Michael Farmer was among 12 new Conservative peers announced last week .

Photographer Masatsugu Ohashi captured these images of the tiny animals, also known as Russian flying squirrels, on the Japanese island of Hokkaido.

"A man is being questioned on suspicion of plotting terrorist attacks after a late night raid at a Cornish curry house. The 26-year-old was held on Monday night when officers from South East Counter Terrorism Unit moved in on the Balti King Indian restaurant in small town of Hayle, Cornwall. Police sources say the arrest related to activities over the internet in connection to terrorism in Syria. The suspect -  a Bangladeshi national - is being quizzed on suspicion of preparing for an act of terrorism under Section 5 of the Terrorism Act. Anti-terror police moved in on Balti King Indian restaurant in Hayle, Cornwall last night and arrested a man . Officers remained at the scene this morning, while locals in the quiet seaside town spoke of their shock . Locals in the normally quiet seaside town said the streets were full of police this morning. Business owner Paul Triggs said: 'I'm totally horrified. There was a huge amount of police activity. 'Obviously the police van was parked outside and we didn't really know what was going on because we hadn't heard anything. We've just come in this morning to open up the shop and been told what's going on next door. His wife Gemma added: 'It's somewhere in Cornwall where you don't expect anything like this to happen.' Bini Barnes, 43, who manages a shop next to the Balti King learnt of Monday night's arrest as she arrived at work the next morning. She said: 'I didn't know anything until I turned up to work. The police told me it wasn't about bomb-making or anything like that. They said it related to the internet somehow. 'I'm completely gobsmacked, it seems unreal. Living in Hayle, you don't expect this sort of thing to happen on your doorstep. 'I don't know how many police were here overnight, but there have been loads more this morning. There's been at least two vans and we have seen loads of people walking between the vans and the restaurant. The Balti King's website states: 'The Balti King Indian restaurant has been established for over 10 years in Hayle. We serve the best quality Indian and Bangladeshi food, in a contemporary atmosphere.' Paul and Gemma Triggs, who work near the restaurant, said they were shocked by the police activity . Officers said the probe is related to 'overseas conflicts' and is not linked to any suspected plots in Britain . Police have reassured locals in Hayle, famous for its three miles of sandy beaches, that there was no threat to their safety. A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'Officers from the South East Counter Terrorism Unit (SECTU) working alongside officers from the Devon and Cornwall Police conducted a warrant in Hayle, Cornwall, on Monday, November 3. 'A 26-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of preparing for an act of terrorism, under Section 5 of the Terrorism Act. 'The man, who was arrested in Hayle, is being questioned by officers from the SECTU at a police station in the Devon and Cornwall area. 'This arrest relates to an investigation by the SECTU and officers would like to reassure residents that the police activity is in relation to conflicts overseas and is not linked to any immediate threat to local communities or anywhere else in the UK.' The raid took place in the small seaside town of Hayle, Cornwall as part of a terrorism investigation . The Balti King Indian restaurant - where the man was arrested - has been in the town for around 10 years . Superintendent Jim Pearce, West Cornwall commander, told a press conference: 'I can tell you that we worked with officers from the South East counter terrorism unit, we assisted them in a pre-planned warrant to arrest a male under section five of the terrorism act. 'This was a low key arrest, proportionate to the circumstances. The person in our custody needs to be interviewed and we need to discuss the investigation that is in hand. 'It doesn't involve local people, or any body in the UK. There is no threat to the local community. 'I can understand that local people have concerns but I would like to reassure them that the investigation is not locally based, it is overseas.' The arrest comes after a 21-year-old man, a 32-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman were arrested by anti-terror police in three seperate probes all linked to Syria last month. Officers searched two properties in Bedfordshire, two in west London and one in Hackney, north east London after raids over the last three weeks. Four terror suspects were also charged with plotting to kill policemen and soldiers in London drive-by shootings earlier last month. Tarik Hassane, 21, Suhaib Majeed, 20, Nyall Hamlett, 24, and Momen Motasim, 21, all from London, appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court amid tight security as they were charged with an Islamic State-inspired gun plot. It was alleged to have been formulated following a fatwa by a senior ISIS terrorist.","Bangladeshi man arrested in raid in small seaside town of Hayle last night .

Inside the school, a group of excited children presented Edward with a large card they had made and signed themselves. Yesterday, to mark the occasion of Edward's birthday, Buckingham Palace yesterday issued a charming new portrait of the Earl of Wessex, the title he was granted on his marriage, his wife, Sophie, the Countess of Wessex and their two children The Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and James, Viscount Severn.

The couple will later accompany the Queen and other senior royals to the Commonwealth Observance Service at Westminster Abbey. The Queen’s youngest child, Prince Edward, turns 50 today.  In honour of his birthday FEMAIL round up ten facts you may not know about Prince Charles’ little brother...1. Edward was born on 10 March 1964 and is the third son and youngest child of The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. 2. The prince completed his A-Levels in History, English Literature and Economic and Political Studies in 1982, and then decided to take a gap year. During his time abroad, he worked as a house tutor teaching English and History at the Collegiate School in Wanganui, New Zealand.3. Prince Edward currently holds 4 degrees: his BA in History from Cambridge, and 2 honorary degrees. He has also been awarded The Earl of Wessex a degree by both The University of Victoria awarded and the University of Prince Edward Island. As Chancellor of the University of Bath, he holds an honorary doctorate in Law.4. In 1986, after graduating, Prince Edward decided to embark on a career in theatrical productions. He has a successful run working at two companies, including Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Theatre Company. In 1993, Edward formed his own company Ardent Productions. Prince Edward also tried his hand at a military role and started training as an Officer Cadet in the Royal Marines in 1986. He didn’t take to military life and left the Marines in January 1987.5. Prince Edward met his wife, Sophie Rhys-Jones at a tennis event in 1993. Sophie was standing in for sports personality, Sue Barker, and had to pose for promotional photos with Edward for the event, leading to the start of their relationship.6. In June 1999, the couple of six years were married at Windsor Castle. The couple requested that guests didn’t wear evening dress or hats as they wanted a low key affair. However, the Queen Mother did wear a lavender hat. Princes William and Harry, and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie attended, but the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, was not invited.7. Edward’s full title is ‘HRH, Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, Viscount Severn’. The title of Earl of Wessex was given to him by The Queen, on his wedding day. The last person to hold that title was Harold II, who died at the Battle of Hastings, 1066. Prince Edward is now 7th in line to the throne.8. In 2002, Edward and his wife both quit their private jobs in order to support The Queen during her jubilee. The Prince is currently involved with over 79 organisations, many in aid of charities that provide opportunities for young people.9. Edward has become heavily involved with the Duke of Edinburgh Award ever since achieving the Gold Award himself in 1986. After the passing of both his parents, it is intended that Prince Edward will be granted the title of Duke of Edinburgh. 10. The Prince became a father for the first time in November 2003. Despite birth complications, the Prince and his wife welcomed Lady Windsor into their family. The couple had their second child a year later, a boy, James, Viscount Severn. In . recent years Edward, often cited as the Queen’s favoured son, has . become something of the quiet man of the British monarchy, conducting . 258 engagements last year with little fanfare. He . is also considered the successor to his father’s Duke of Edinburgh . Awards scheme and been handed the plum role of International Trustee and . Chairman of the International Council. This has resulted in him becoming one of the most well-travelled members of the royal family last year. In . 2013 he conducted 87 engagement overseas, bettered only by his wife - . who carried out 95 - and Prince Charles, who also clocked up 95 jobs but . undertook two lengthy foreign tours on behalf of the British . government. The couple were in Barbados and Jamaica only last week. It is, perhaps, seen as a reward for years of quiet service after being forced to give up his chosen career.

Tim and Lady Helen Taylor,  first cousin once removed of Queen Elizabeth II, arrive at Bagshot Park . After leaving university, Edward famously joined the Royal Marines but dropped out of training within months. He . decided to pursue a career in entertainment, starting off as a . production assistant for Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Really Useful Theatre . Company but also produced the ill-fate It’s A Royal Knockout in 1987. In . 1993 he formed his own company, Ardent Productions, but was accused of . profiting out of his position by making a series of royal documentaries . The . company made a series of losses until, in 2001, one of his own film . crews invaded his nephew, Prince William’s privacy, while he was . studying in Scotland by secretly filming him, causing a public – and . private – furore. The . following year it was announced that he and his wife, whose own PR . business had been similarly dogged by controversy, would give up their . business interests to concentrate on their royal duties. Friends, . however, say Edward, who is now eighth-in-line to the throne, is happy . and relaxed in his new role as a dutiful son and now father. He and his wife tried for several years to start a family and suffered the devastating loss of an ectopic pregnancy. One . friend said: ‘It really is lovely to see Edward and Sophie sitting down . on the floor playing with their children. They are such hand-on parents . and totally unstuffy. Louise and James were much longed-for children . and are the centre of their world.’ Earlier . this year it was revealed that Louise, the Queen’s youngest . grand-daughter, had undergone surgery to correct a severe squint she had . since birth. This latest portrait shows the surgery appears to have been successful. Bagshot Park, Surrey, the home of the Earl and Countess of Wessex .

Balotelli, though, could be on his way were any definite interest to materialise. Liverpool flop Mario Balotelli (right) looks set to remain on Merseyside with the club yet to receive an approach . Rickie Lambert (right) has struggled to break into the Liverpool first team but will not go out on loan . The club are yet to receive any approach for the Italian, despite reports in his homeland that Greek side Olympiacos had offered to take him on loan. Liverpool are also still in the market for an experienced goalkeeper but their pursuit of a new No1 to replace Simon Mignolet will wait until the summer. Manchester City’s James Milner remains their top outfield target and they are confident that the lure of guaranteed first-team football will see him move to Merseyside. Meanwhile, Fabio Borini’s £14million price-tag makes him too expensive for any potential suitors, while talks are ongoing with Lille over releasing loanee Divock Origi this month, although that would cost Liverpool £5m. Manchester City midfielder James Milner (front) remains Liverpool's top outfield target during the window . Everton failed with a late bid for Bayern Munich’s Xherdan Shaqiri. Sportsmail can reveal that the Toffees attempted to bring the Switzerland winger to Goodison Park before he agreed to join Inter Milan. The 23-year-old instead heads to the San Siro on loan before completing a £12m move at the end of the season. Everton boss Roberto Martinez will now redouble his efforts to bring in reinforcements in a bid to save his side’s season. Everton failed with a late bid for Bayern Munich midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri who joined Italian giants Inter Milan . Blackpool pair Dom Telford and Mark Waddington have rejected the club’s offer of £200-per-week deals. As a result, chairman Karl Oyston has told them they will be sent to play with the youth team unless they accept. This has alerted a host of Championship clubs and their scouts will be in attendance should the highly rated pair turn out for the youth side against Oldham on Saturday. Mark Waddington (pictured left) and Dom Telford have rejected Blackpool's offer of £200-per-week deals . West Brom will listen to offers for record signing Brown Ideye, as well as striker Victor Anichebe. Ideye arrived for £10m from Dynamo Kiev in the summer but has failed to impact – scoring just once in the Premier League - and could now be headed out of The Hawthorns. Anichebe, meanwhile, has found first-team opportunities limited this season and, after just four goals in 18 months since his £6m arrival from Everton, his days at the club look to be numbered. West Brom will listen to offers for striker Brown Ideye who joined the club from Dynamo Kiev for £10m . Wolfsburg sporting director Klaus Allofs has distanced his club from a £23m move for Chelsea’s Andre Schurrle, although there is interest. World Cup winner Schurrle has fallen out of favour under Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge and they would be keen to cash in on the player who cost them £18m when he signed from Leverkusen in 2013. Wolfsburg could be holding out for a lower price. Bundesliga side Wolfsburg could be holding out for a lower price to sign Chelsea forward Andre Schurrle . Tottenham are keen on a loan deal for PSG midfielder Adrien Rabiot.

"Beatrice did her bit for festive goodwill last night as she attended a party launching a fashion collaboration to raise money for charity. The princess wore black leather-trim jacket, skater skirt and studded slippers for the Mayfair event, which was to launch of a pair of shoes set to raise funds for a human trafficking campaign. The party was held Beulah, a fashion brand label beloved by other royals including the Duchess of Cambridge which donates a percentage of all its profits to charity. Benefit bash: Princess Beatrice at the Beulah and French Sole party . The event marked a collaboration with shoe brand French Sole that sees the launch of a £185 velvet grey ballet shoe with blue trim, from which 25 per cent of profits will go to support the United Nation's Blue Heart campaign. With . the money raised the brands say they hope to 'help to support victims . of trafficking, raise awareness of the problem and inspire the powerful . decision-makers to effect change.' Beulah's founders Lady Natasha Rufus Isaacs and Lavinia Brennan . are long-standing friends of the Royals, and indeed have seen their . clothes worn by both Beatrice and Eugenie as well as the Duchess of . Cambridge, who famously wore a £540 Beulah dress on her Far East tour in . 2012. The pale blue silk chiffon and matching headscarf, worn for a visit to a mosque in Kuala Lumpur, earned her plaudits from fashion observers and was later reissued and went on sale in Harvey Nichols. Friends in high places: Beulah founders Lavinia Brennan and Lady Natasha Rufus Isaacs with Beatrice . Other . celebrities have worn Beulah's styles, including Tess Daly, who wore a . red silk dress on Strictly Come Dancing last weekend, and opera singer .

Launched . in 2011, Beulah London state that they wish to help provide a . sustainable livelihood to those that have escaped the sex trafficking . trade. The founders launched . the ethical label after working together in the Delhi slums with women . and girls who had been forced into prostitution. 'With . each beautiful garment that you buy there is an equally beauftiful . change happening somewhere else in the world, something that Beulah like . to call the butterfly effect.,' they say.

Beulah founders Natasha and Lavinia say: 'Beulah London traces its origins back to 2009, when the two of us had a life transforming opportunity to work in Atulya, an aftercare home in Delhi slums. 'Having witnessed the harrowing effects of human trafficking and sex trade, we felt moved to raise awareness of this important issue. With no formal training in fashion, we hit on an idea of launching an ethical fashion label with a transparent supply chain, focused on timeless and effortless elegance. Beulah London was launched in 2011, helping provide a sustainable livelihood to those that have come out of sex trafficking. 'For each beautiful garment that we make, there is an equally beautiful change happening somewhere else in the world – we like to think of it as our ‘butterfly effect’: A small change at one place in a complex system having a large effect elsewhere. 'The term ""Beulah"" itself is symbolic of our philosophy, representing the journey of each woman out of darkness and despair, into a new life of hope and restoration. Fan: Katherine Jenkins wearing a Beulah scarf earlier this year . 'As a young business we are at the start of a challenging journey. Driven by our twin passions for positive social change and designing beautiful fashions, we believe that we are on the right path. 'Each Beulah garment purchase comes with a canvas bag that has been produced by the victims of trafficking in India through a project based in Kolkata, Freeset. Added to this, certain items in our main collections have been produced through a project in Delhi, Open Hand, by women who have escaped trafficking and the sex trade, including some who are HIV positive and widowed. 'Where you see the Beulah butterfly logo, you know that the product has either been made by women who have been trafficked, or been produced specifically to raise awareness or funds for its victims. The Beulah effect comes alive through every small purchase you make, helping break the chains of poverty in some of the world's most marginalised communities.'","Princess Beatrice at launch of Beulah's collaboration with French Sole .

"Designer Sophie Tweed-Simmons has revealed that she refuses to let images of herself be retouched before they are shown to the public. In an age when almost every photo featured in the pages of the world's favorite fashion magazines has been subject to at least a few photoshop tricks and tweaks, the 22-year-old insists that people should be able to see her exactly as she is, without any unrealistic enhancements. Speaking to Yahoo Style, the designer, who admits to changing dress sizes on a regular basis, confessed that size eight is her 'happy place', adding: 'I like eating cookies and food. Scroll down for video . Natural beauty: Sophie Tweed-Simmons refuses to allow her photos to be retouched . On the up: The 22-year-old's first fashion collection, Sophie x The Style Club, is aimed at women who are 'average sized' 'I don't want to kill myself': While the designer admits she likes the treadmill as much as she likes 'eating cookies and food', she believes everything should be done in moderation . 'I like the treadmill, but I don't want to kill myself.' Posing in a stunning set of images for the fashion site, the designer insisted that none of the photos, which were taken in New York City, should undergo any 'cosmetic' alterations. And it's not just this shoot on which Sophie has taken such a stance. Indeed after completing her first photoshoot for her fashion range, Sophie x The Style Club, the burgeoning fashion star noticed that the images had later been retouched - and she promptly sent them back and asked them to be returned to their former natural glory. 'My legs looked too good,' she recalls. Sophie is just as straight-talking when it comes to her own perceptions about her body, having spent much of her adolescence living life in the spotlight - and learning to cope with all of the unwanted publicity. 'We went on a family vacation, and I was wearing a thong bikini like my favorite celebrity, Sofîa Vergara,' she explained, 'And someone took my picture. 'As a 17-year-old girl, I had to see my butt on the cover of [a newspaper] with the headline 'Gene Simmons plus-size daughter'. It made the global news circuit. 'I grew up a chubby kid and into a curvy girl. I was OK with it, but the world wasn't. I have cellulite, stretch marks, and freckles, and that's fine with me.' Au naturel: Sophie has had to cope with her fair share of publicity, including being referred to as 'plus size' when images of her in a bikini aged 17 were published. Despite that, she insists that natural is always best . Daughter of blank: The rock heiress first embarked on her fashion career because it allowed her to break free from her famous family name . 'I want to give girls confidence': Sophie's fashion label doesn't discriminate by size, and she hopes that her designs will suit all women, no matter what their shape . Having faced her fair share of the spotlight before reaching the age of 18, beginning when she first starred in her family's reality series, Gene Simmons: Family Jewels, at the age of 11, Sophie admits she was eager to step away from the shadow that both of her parents had cast and make a name for herself as a designer. 'When I'm singing, I'm Gene Simmons's daughter,' she said. 'When I'm acting, I'm Shannon Tweed's daughter. With fashion, I'm just me. I'm not just ""daughter of blank"".' That said, Sophie confesses she was happy to trade on her well-known name to a certain extent - provided she could use it to help her make a change within the industry. 'I felt like I really had the chance to give girls confidence with affordable clothing,' she added. 'If you have a platform, you should use it.' Free spirit: While she admits that she used to find her father, KISS legend Gene Simmons, a bit 'crass', Sophie reveals that she now embraces that same blunt attitude . Up close and personal: Sophie, who is a size eight, admits that many of her favorite designers' clothes don't fit her . And it's not just her parents' creative talents that Sophie has inherited. The designer admits that, while she was often embarrassed by her father's over-the-top and in-your-face behavior when she was a child, now she sees it as a blessing. 'When I was little, I'd think: ""Can't you just be nice?""' she said of the 65-year-old rocker. 'He taught me that there's being nice and then there's lying. It's better to be blunt and un-liked than shade the truth. I appreciate people who are honest.' Her straight-talking attitude no doubt helped when it came to making a name for herself within the fashion industry, marking her out from those designers who only cater to the small, select group of women who can fit into their clothing. 'I'm not a high-fashion model, and I'm not plus size,' Sophie says of her own body. 'Which is weird for fashion, but not for life. Putting your best booty forward: Earlier this year, Sophie admitted to MailOnline that many of the designs for her collection were 'based around my butt' RIsing star: Sophie is used to being in the spotlight, having first risen to fame age 11 when she starred in her family's reality series Gene Simmons: Family Jewels . Family ties: Sophie is incredibly close with both her father Gene (C) and her mother, former Playmate of the Year, Shannon Tweed (L) 'A lot of designers that I love don't fit me. I wanted to do cuts that would be flattering to girls who have some shape.' Earlier this year, Sophie, who is based in Los Angeles, revealed to MailOnline that her first 18-piece collaboration with The Style Club was tailored to suit her own body type - particularly in the derriere. 'The cuts of the pieces are all flattering,' Sophie explained. 'All the waistbands are elastic, which I prefer. Essentially, the collection is based around my butt... 'We don't want to limit who buys the collection based on sizing; the cuts will look good on everyone. 'We want our shoppers to be part of the process with us. So give us feedback and tell us what's working on your body. Just because it works on my butt doesn't mean it works for everyone.'","The size eight 22-year-old has her own fashion label, Sophie x The Style Club, which is aimed at women who are 'average sized'

"A retired policeman who swapped his panda car for a beaten-up old tractor to travel 8,000 miles  to the northern tip of Norway has completed his epic journey. Peter Matheson averaged just 10mph in his 1972 Massey Ferguson, and was hit by fourteen punctures as he braved mountain ranges and gale force winds along some of Europe's most spectacular roads. He is raising funds for the Tom Bowdidge Foundation - in memory of a 19-year-old who died of stomach cancer - and Unicef. Retired policeman Peter Matheson poses with his companion Amber the Labrador in front of the 1972 Massey Ferguson tractor that took them to Europe's northern tip and back . Mr Matheson stepped out to take this picture of his tractor and caravan, which averaged just 10mph during the 8,000 mile journey, in front of the stunning scenery of Honningsvg, Norway . Former lawman Peter Matheson poses next to the caravan in which he has lived for six months during his epic journey to the tip of Norway in a vintage tractor . Way to go: Mr Matheson set off at the height of a balmy summer in August on a route which took in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland . Mr Matheson was raising funds for the Tom Bowdidge Foundation - in memory of a 19-year-old who died of stomach cancer - and Unicef . Mr Matheson arrived back home in John O'Groats, Scotland on Saturday after six months on the tractor nicknamed Annie, with his Labrador Amber and a caravan in tow. Although he started in the height of a balmy summer in August, Mr Matheson - who celebrated his 51st birthday on the epic trek - encountered some truly terrible weather in northern Europe between October and January, and, at some points, even feared for his life. The father-of-one - who towed a caravan on the journey arrived back at John O'Groats, said: 'For me, the best part of it was easily the people. 'Until you do something like this, you don't know how many good people there are. 'It is bad news that makes the news and on this trip, I was all about the good news.' Trusty: The vintage 1972 Massey Ferguson named Annie averaged just 10mph and suffered 14 punctures along the 8,000 mile journey .

The trusty old tractor gets a lift on the back of a lorry as it returns home to John O' Groats in Scotland . Cause: Mr Matheson back home with fellow supporters of the Tom Bowdidge Foundation which was set up in memory of a 19-year-old who tragically died of stomach cancer . Bonkers? Mr Matheson said most of the people he encountered along the way asked if he was mad . He added: 'The thing everyone asked me was 'are you completely bonkers? Even if they couldn't speak English, they could ask that. 'And my response always was 'I think everyone should do at least one mad thing in their life' and 'you only have one life, live it'.' But he does admit he had to learn some things the hard way. 'On one occasion, not far into the journey, I was hit by a massive storm and I was going along the road and a lorry was coming the other direction and I thought to myself 'he's not for slowing down' and sure enough, it threw water up in the air and completely drenched me and I got a mouthful of dirty water. 'That's what I call learning the hard way.' One another occasion, he was driving through a Norwegian mountain range during gale force winds and had to cross a bridge, which had a sheer drop on both sides. Mr Matheson, who now lives in Scotland, added: 'It was a horrible, horrible day. 'When I got there, there just wasn't room to turn and this bridge was straight up and straight down, so I put the tractor in gear, gritted my teeth and just went for it and thought 'well, if it's my time, it's just my time'.' He added: 'Aside from that, -20°C weather was a real low point. 'But for every low point, there were so many high points, like the Northern Lights - which I think everyone has to see - and they all involve some great people.' The retired policeman pointed to the brakes on his tractor failing just before he met a man who made snow ploughs, who offered to fix the problem, as well as realising early one morning he had parked up in pitch black darkness during the previous night, after suffering some problems, outside a tractor repair centre.

'It was too painful to walk and I went from being in good shape to doing nothing and just eating in front of the telly.

"Significant blow: David Cameron, pictured in New York, had tried to take the sting out of the vote . More than 100 Conservative MPs condemned the Government last night for not bringing forward an EU referendum Bill. A total of 130 MPs, including 12 Labour rebels and DUP members, backed an unprecedented motion expressing 'regret' that last week's Queen's Speech did not include legislation paving the way for a referendum. In all, 114 Tories – more than half the party's backbenchers and one in three of its MPs – backed the amendment. Ministers abstained on the issue, in . which Tory backbenchers were allowed a free vote. The vote was the most . significant on Europe since October 2011, when 81 Tory MPs revolted in a . bid to call for an in/out referendum. Backbencher Peter Bone, one of the leaders of last night's revolt, said MPs had simply voted to reinforce . the Conservative Party's position and claimed Labour would now have to . make its position clear. But the scale of the Tory rebellion . was a significant blow for David Cameron, who had tried on Tuesday to . take the sting out of the vote by unveiling draft legislation, to be . adopted by a Conservative MP and backed by the leadership as a Private . Member's Bill. The Liberal Democrats have refused to . countenance a Government Bill, arguing that talk of an EU referendum in . 2017 is causing uncertainty for business leaders. Scroll down for video . 'Hypocrite': Tory MPs brandished a 2010 leaflet, right, featuring Mr Clegg, left, promising an EU referendum . Nick Clegg, however, standing in for . Mr Cameron at Prime Minister's Questions, surprised MPs when he said it . was a question of 'when, not if' to hold an in/out referendum. The Prime Minister, on a visit to the . US, accused both Mr Clegg and Labour leader Ed Miliband of 'burying . their heads in the sand' over Europe and defended his handling of the . referendum debate. Speaking in New York he said his . pledge to hold an in/out referendum by December 31, 2017, was a 'very . clear, popular and right position which is in the national interest'. He . added: 'The other parties have got to make their mind up.' In the Commons, Mr Clegg was . condemned as a 'hypocrite' by Tory MPs having promised an in/out . referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, the last major transfer of powers from . Britain to Brussels, when it was signed by Gordon Brown. Rebels: David Cameron's three-day trip to the U.S. has been over-shadowed by Tory infighting over Europe . The Deputy Prime Minister dismissed . Tory calls for the Lib Dems to allow a Government Bill paving the way . for a vote on remaining in the EU, which Mr Cameron has vowed to hold if . he wins the next election. 'Get me out of here': Nadine Dorries declared she wants to stand on a joint ticket with UKIP . Mr Clegg insisted the Coalition had . already legislated to guarantee a referendum if there was a significant . transfer of powers to Brussels. But he then went further, suggesting . that an in/out referendum was inevitable: 'By the way I think it's a . question of when, not if, because the rules are bound to change.' Aides suggested later that Mr Clegg . believed an in/out referendum would have to be held when countries in . the eurozone agreed a new treaty to allow them to integrate more . closely, even if that meant no new powers being transferred from Britain . to the EU. However, Mr Cameron accused the other party leaders of trying to ignore the fundamental changes going on in the EU. 'The single currency is driving a . massive process of change in Europe and so as a result Britain needs to . get its stance with respect to this massive change right,' he said. 'There are various responses you can . make – sticking your head in the sand and pretending nothing has changed . and just carrying on and accepting everything that comes out of . Brussels. 'This is not a sensible approach - . although it does seem to be the approach some in British politics seem . to take – or you can say Europe is changing, Britain needs to be a part . of forging that change. 'Just as the eurozone countries come . together and do more things together, so those countries outside the . eurozone need to work out how they're going to make their relationship . work with Europe. Rebel: Conservative Nadine Dorries said it is 'important that the Right unites' over Europe . 'It makes sense at the end of that to . give British people the proper choice, which is not just do you back . this new treaty, but do you back Britain being in this reformed . organisation or coming out of it?' Mr Cameron dismissed talk of a 'rebellion' in the Commons, pointing out it was a free vote. George Osborne hailed the draft . legislation on an EU referendum. He said: 'Labour cannot answer the . simple question: do they rule out offering an in/out referendum?' Tory grandee Edward Leigh said: 'I've . been arguing for a referendum for 20 years. Only yesterday our Prime . Minister became the first party leader to actually draw up a real Bill. 'This is not just a paper promise, the sort of thing that Nick Clegg wriggles out of.' But at a meeting of Conservative MPs, . Foreign Secretary William Hague was urged by arch-Eurosceptics to hold . an EU referendum before 2017.

"If you are an ardent One Direction - or if you have one in your family - you will likely have bought the CDs, the posters, the sticker books and the T-shirts... but the glasses? In proof that there really are no limits to the merchandise they can peddle to their fans, the 1D boys have released a collection of glasses in association with Vision Express. Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson are not known to wear spectacles themselves - but nevertherless have been deemed qualified to design a range of girls' glasses for the High Street optician.

Signed: The 'Niall' is a pair of purple and violet glasses printed with the autographs of the 1D band members . One for the fans: The glasses bear the name of the band with a picture of a heart alongside. This style is called Little Things after one of the boys' hit songs . The glasses, which retail at £131 (£40 if you have an NHS voucher) come in seven different styles and are named after band members - Niall has two different frames named after him - or 1D song names, with the band's tracks One Thing, Little Things and Young used as names for three of the styles. One of the styles is named Mullingar, after Niall Horan's hometown in County Westmeath, Ireland. The range, aimed at girls from age six to 11, comes in standard black or brown, with a splash of colour provided by a lavender pair - and some bear the boys' autographs.

"It is pouring with rain in Kensington Gardens as designer-clad stars emerge from limousines and dash into the gleaming glass marquee where the Burberry Prorsum show is about to begin. Inside though, it felt like the brightest of summer days as the British design house showed its SS14 collection to a full – and star-studded - house. With Sienna Miller, Harry Styles, Naomi Harris, Suki Waterhouse and Paloma Faith watching from the front row, Christopher Bailey showed a feminine, genteel collection – he described it as ‘tender’ - replete with Victorian lace in soft macarón hues of mint and rose, mauve and lavender, gentle shapes that borrowed just enough from the archives, the occasional graphic print in black and white or a splash of red, and a (sometimes liberal) sprinkling of bling. Scroll down for video . Round of applause: The petal-strewn finale of Christopher Bailey's blockbuster show at Burberry Prorsum in Kensington Gardens . Ever the innovator with fabric, . Bailey discovered a factory in the North of England that still had . Victorian lace machines in full working order – and he used them to . create featherlight pencil skirts and dresses in pale pistachio, cream . and the faintest whisper of mauve. But, this being Bailey, he also took . this most traditional of fabrics and breathed modern life into it, . tinting it black and white stripes or turning it into a trench-inspired . shirt dress. Pencil skirts . prevailed, coming in that beautiful Nottingham lace, baby soft cashmere that draped at the hips and gathered into a twisted knot at the front (office wear for those too wealthy to work) as well as vivid monochrome . stripes – which was paired with a spot shirt set surely to take over from the heart print . as the piece that makes it to the mainstream ( I spotted at least 20 people wearing THAT heart shirt at the show today). Thanks . to Bailey’s love of Scottish cashmere, the Burberry girl will be kept . warm next spring with baby soft, slouchy cardigans in grey, mint and . pink. Outerwear was softer in general. Light cashmere overcoats in pale grey or white, a single-breasted coat in dusky pink. The trench in its most traditional form - beige, gabardine, belted - was entirely absent. Instead, Bailey said, he wanted to introduce the elements of the trench . but in a gentler way. That . meant stripping out the lining, using softer fabrics, softer shapes, and more generous . cuts that enveloped and cocooned the figure rather than necessarily cinching it. Sorbet: Bailey plumped for a hugely pretty palette with sugary shades of pistachio, lemon, candyfloss and delicate almond dominating . Always soulful, haunting, epic. Playlist was: Benjamin Twine, by George Ezra. Man On The Moon by Jake Bugg. When We Were On Fire (The Mahogany Sessions) by James Bay. Budapest by George Ezra. Bailey does the hard work so we can download and discover them. 'I wanted this idea of everything being much more soft, . much more gentle,' he said after the show. 'I liked the idea of taking out all the linings, all . but the most essential part of the trench. I liked the idea of taking the traditional trench coat, the iconic . Burberry trenchcoat but then reimagining it with these soft, fluid . fabrics. So we used a lot of double-faced cashmeres, we used a lot of . silks, so that everything had a very natural flow. 'Fabric is the . DNA of our brand,' he added. 'Thomas Burberry, our founder, invented gabardine, and . it's something care about greatly. We have a whole team of people and . all they do is work through the innovation, craftsmanship and . construction of fabric. 'Everything was soft and feminine and had that sense of kind of wrapping yourself in things. 'There was kind of tenderness, a vulnerability.' The colour palette - those dusky pinks and greens, palest yellow, sugary soft hues, were borne of Bailey's love of the English rose - hence the thousands of petals that rained down on the catwalk during the finale. 'I wanted the colours to be soft and gentle, like sugared flowers,' Bailey said. 'We've . been talking about this English rose and the breadth and depth of the . colours. We tried to distill that, so there's a powderiness to the . colours as well as them just being pastel.' Trench detail was borrowed and used elsewhere. A . deep sage coat-dress had a scoop neck that echoed the traditional lapel . of the trench, a mint-green filigree shirt-dress used trench detailing at the . back and trench lapels; Cara D walked in a transparent trench cape dotted with dusky pink . beading. Elegant: Jourdan Dunn walked the runway in a draped skirt and sheer mint blouse . Sweet: Pink once again proved a popular choice and looks set to be a huge hit next summer . Embellished: Cara D modelled a cape in clear plastic embellished with gems down the runway . Pals: Harry Styles, in leopard print Burberry shirt, watches friend and long-time Burberry model Cara Delevingne walk the runway in dusky rose lace . The . mood was certainly gentler than previous seasons (especially given that . last season PVC pencil skirts were the look of the season). It was, . said Bailey, meant to be warm, soft and a little bit romantic. ‘I . wanted the show to be gentle, to feel enveloping,’ he said afterwards. ‘I wanted it to have a real crafted feeling, something that . felt you were really cocooned and protected. It was very feminine, . gentle and soft. But there was a sassiness and a sexiness underneath, . and I like that idea of strength and fragility.’ Cara Delevingne walked, as did . Jourdan Dunn. It is, Bailey agreed, important to have those big names . walking. In truth though, Cara has been part of the Burberry gang long . before she was the ‘model of the moment'. 'We . have always loved Cara,’ Bailey said fondly, as the lady herself leapt around backstage . wearing a balaclava and giving out bearhugs. ‘She’s part of the Burberry . family. 'We have worked with Cara for many, many years,' he added. 'She's someone I'm very close to. We have a wonderful relationship. I just adore Cara, she's beautiful. Soft with underlying sassiness: Cocooning overcoats, delicate lace, macrame and silk. Trench coats had lining stripped out, softer material was used . Graphic: Despite a genteel colour palette and the softness of lace elsewhere, Bailey made sure to maintain his trademark sassiness with cheeky prints . Snappers: Alexa Chung, Poppy Delevingne and Jamal Edwards take in the graphic prints that shot through the pastels . Romantic: A softer aesthetic at Burberry today - in contrast to the rubber skirts of last season - though there was a sense of sassiness too. 'Both fragility and strength.' said Bailey . From left: Alison Mosshart, Paloma Faith, Sienna Miller, Harry Styles and Suki Waterhouse . It's one of London Fashion Week's . biggest draws and this season's outing from Burberry proved to be no . exception. The cream of London's style set - as well as heavy hitters from around the world - turned out to see the latest effort from Christopher Bailey at the Kensington Gardens show. Among the biggest of the big names was US Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who joined Topshop supremo Sir Phillip Green and socialite Olivia Palermo on the front row. Celebrities paying Bailey the compliment of wearing Burberry to the show included Sienna Miller, who wore a black felt dress from the A/W13 collection and One Direction singer Harry Styles who plumped for a daring £395 leopard print military shirt. Donna Air also turned out in Burberry, choosing a stylish crocodile pencil skirt and a soft nappa leather tank. She was joined by actress Gabriella Wilde, the half-sister of Prince Harry's girlfriend Cressida Bonas, and 21-year-old model, Suki Waterhouse. Rounding off the stellar front row was Alexa Chung, model Arizona Muse and flame-haired singer Paloma Faith who was resplendent in - of course - a chic Burberry skirt. Fashion on the Burberry FROW: Paloma Faith,Sienna Miller, Harry Styles and Suki Waterhouse seemed to be enjoying themselves as they waited for the show to begin . Stylish: New York socialite Olivia Palermo was elegant in a black jacket and skirt while Anna Wintour was her usual fashionable self in delicate duck egg blue . Burberry fans: Sienna Miller (above) has appeared in Burberry fashion campaigns while Harry Styles - who recently wore the much-loved heart-print shirt - chose a £395 animal print shirt . Golden girl: It girl and erstwhile TV presenter Donna Air had a ringside seat at Burberry . Feeling blue: Burberry girl and actress Gabriella Wilde . Bradley's girl: Model Suki Waterhouse looked thrilled as she enjoyed Burberry from the sidelines . English Rose: British model Cara Delevingne with classic sleek hair . An edgier version of the classic English rose was Christopher Kane's beauty vision at Burberry and lead stylist Neil Moodie was the man asked to provide it. 'Christopher Bailey’s inspiration for the collection is English Rose distressed,' explained the hair guru. 'This is why I decided to blow dry the hair in a classic sleek - but not poker straight - as would be expected of an English Rose. I then texturised and mattified the hair with Moroccanoil products to give it an edgy, distressed look.' Moodie began by preparing wet hair with a Moroccanoil treatment before adding the brand's Frizz Control to make sure hair stayed beautifully smooth. 'Next, I applied Moroccanoil Hydrating Styling Cream before blow drying the hair to ensure the movement created by the blow dry held and to give it a more luxury finish,' explained Neil. Luckily for those who want to recreate the look, it's one that works with any hair type. 'For thick hair, I blowdried it with a natural centre parting,' adds Neil. 'For long hair, I created some movement by flicking the ends under in a natural way.' Once the hair was dry, it was divided it into sections and finished with Moroccanoil Luminous Hairspray and Moroccanoil Volumising Mousse to add texture and create a matte finish.' Neil added: 'Before the models went on to the catwalk, the hair was tucked into the coats, and few stray sections were released at the back and side.' Beauty was created by Wendy Rowe using Burberry and introducing the Spring/Summer colours and Burberry nails.","Christopher Bailey's blockbuster show featured lace made using original Victoran machines in Nottingham factory .

"Microsoft’s attempt to rival Apple’s iPad with its own tablet may fall short due to malfunctions. Consumers who purchased Microsoft’s new Surface tablet are voicing frustrations about the product’s faulty Touch Cover screen. A number of early buyers of the gadget, including several tech writers and developers, have reported issues of the screen splitting and exposing an internal wire after just a few days of use, the Guardian reports. Damaged goods: Microsoft Surface Touch Cover coming apart at the seam . Damaged goods: Another Surface tablet with a torn screen . 'My touch cover, in the middle at the join to the screen is peeling, like the top layer has come loose and is ruffling up,' one Surface buyer wrote on a forum for the product. 'Worried its going to get worse as I use it more.' The defect appears to be the same in each case -- the Surface’s cover, which has a built-in keyboard, comes apart at its seam. It is unclear whether the screen problems are due to a bad batch or are part of a bigger issue with the gadget that will become more apparent as more people use the Surface tablet over a longer period of time. The fact that consumers in both the U.S. and the U.K have reported the same issue with the Surface’s screen suggests that it is not isolated to a single manufacturing batch, the Guardian notes. Consumer complaint: Surface buyer shows the peeling side of his new product . Users have also reported issues with the tablet’s sound, according to Geeky Gadgets. Microsoft would not comment on the number reports of the problem the company had received. 'Microsoft makes every effort to ensure our customers receive a high quality product,' the company told CNET.

"When Kate and William prepared to attend the Royal premiere of a film chronicling the remarkable life of Nelson Mandela yesterday evening they could not have known the significance the evening would come to hold. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were the very image of elegance as arrived on the red carpet yesterday, Kate in her bespoke ivory Roland Mouret gown and a £19.99 Zara necklace; William in black tie. But as the two watched the film, alongside the Zindzi Mandela, daughter of the South African leader, news came in that 95-year-old Mandela had died peacefully at home. Kate arriving: The Duchess of Cambridge stunned in Roland Mouret at the Royal Film Performance as she walked the red carpet before hearing the news that Mandela had died . The gown by French designer Roland Mouret may . have been long sleeved but it featured a thigh-high split which showed . off her legs as she walked the red carpet . Before the announcement: Kate was joined at the premiere by her husband Prince William, enjoying an evening off from parenting duties . For Kate, who has grown accustomed to living her life on the world's stage, this was a moment she could not have prepared for, but she handled it with dignity. Smiles turned to tears as the news spread throughout the theatre and a night that was to have been a celebration of this great leader's life was suddenly marked with tragedy. The ashen-faced duchess maintained her composure as William paid tribute to this great leader and his extraordinary achievements, expressing his condolences to the Mandela family. Clearly distressed by the news, a subdued Kate and William left the premiere shortly after the film had ended, sadness etched on their faces as they were driven away from the theatre in London's Leicester Square. Mandela's daughter Zindzi was informed of the passing of her father but insisted the screening go ahead. Fellow audience members were not told until after the movie when the film's producer, Anant Singh, got up on stage and announced . the 'sad news'. Mandela's death was announced as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge sat down to watch the screening of Long Walk To Freedom . Stunned: William and Kate leave the film premiere of Nelson Mandela's biopic shortly after being told he had died . Kate pictured in her car leaving the film premiere in Leicester Square after being told of Mandela's death . Poignant: The Royals were seen leaving the premiere after hearing the news of Mandela's death. Prince William had told reporters: 'I just wanted to say it's extremely sad and tragic news' The news, which was revealed on television in an address to the nation by South Africa's current president, Jacob Zuma,  was then passed on to stunned guests after the credits had rolled. A two minute silence was then held in the West End cinema. Speaking from the Odeon Leicester Square, Prince William said: 'I just wanted to say it's extremely sad and tragic news. 'We . were just reminded what an extraordinary and inspiring man Nelson . Mandela was. My thoughts and prayers are with him and his family. It's . very sad.' The Royal couple looked ashen-faced . as they walked down the stairs into the foyer. Shortly after they left, . shocked members of the audience began emerging from the cinema, in . silence at first. Speaking . before the screening of Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom, Ms Mandela said . her father was doing well, when asked about his health. She said: 'My father is fine. He's 95 years old and he is pretty frail. We are hoping to see more of him.' Speaking to the Mail before the . screening, Zindzi said of the film: 'It's something that makes me feel . really proud, what my family went through and the role my father played . has been recognised. It is a reward [for him].' 'When we document our history in this . manner we do it not just for ourselves but also for the future . generations, young people that my father is really passionate about.' Some in the audience burst into tears, while others sat in stunned silence, according to witnesses. The . cast, whose after-show party was promptly cancelled, were too upset to . speak. In the foyer, security men surrounded Naomie Harris, who plays . his wife, Winnie, as she walked slowly past, head down and close to . tears. The Duchess of Cambridge meets Nelson Mandela's daughters Zenani (left) and Zindzi at the Royal Premiere of Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom in London shortly before they learned of her father's death . John Battersby, 65, a . South African journalist who knew Mandela personally and wrote the . afterword to his authorised biography said: 'My daughter told me just . before the announcement. 'Apparently . he died half an hour before the film started. My phone was buzzing in . my pocket but I just thought ""who is calling me in the Mandela . premiere?"" In the protection of the darkness I shed a few tears. 'He was brilliantly portrayed in the film, what came through was the dignity.' His daughter Anna said: 'I think it's very fitting that we were all here paying tribute to him at the moment of his passing.' Starring British actor Idris Elba, . 'Mandela' follows the iconic anti-apartheid leader’s extraordinary life . from childhood through to his 27-year imprisonment on Robben Island and, . finally, his inauguration as the first democratically elected President . of South Africa in 1994. Another British actress, Skyfall’s Naomie Harris, plays the politician’s controversial wife, Winnie. The . film itself, which has been 16 years in the making, has received mixed . reviews from critics, but Elba, who is best known for his role as a . detective chief inspector in the hit TV series Luther, has been praised . as ‘towering’ and ‘Oscar-worthy’. Speaking . on the red carpet last night he told Mail Online: 'Everyone knows who . Mandela is, everyone has an idea of what he sounds and looks like. I . worked really hard to pull in all the elements, from the sound of his . voice to the way he walks. I don't look anything like him but it was . really important the audience got a sense of who Mandela is because the . likelihood is that we will never meet him in person. The death of former South African president Nelson Mandela was announced during the UK premiere of a film about his life . On Wednesday his daughter, Makaziwe . Mandela, insisted he was ‘still with us, strong, courageous’ but . admitted for the first time that he was on his 'deathbed’. 'Even . for a lack of a better word... on his deathbed he is teaching us . lessons - lessons in patience, in love, lessons of tolerance,’ she . added. 'Every moment I get with him I'm amazed. 'There . are times where I have to pinch myself that I come from this man who is . a fighter even though you can see he is struggling, but the fighting . spirit is still there with him.' Zindzi . Mandela, speaking before the start of the film, said: 'It's something . that makes me feel really proud, what my family went through and the . role my father played has been recognised. It is a reward [for him]. 'When . we document our history in this manner we do it not just for ourselves . but also for the future generations, young people that my father is . really passionate about. 'He has seen clips of the film and said he saw [Idris] that he thought it was him.' She . added: 'When my 11 year-old grandson saw the movie last week I asked . him what did he thought and he said 'the dude who played grandad when he . talks he kind of reminds me of him'. 'I said: 'What about the lady who play big mammy? [Winnie Mandela]. He said: 'That chick, I think she's hot!'' Each . year the Royal Film Performance is staged to raise funds for the Cinema . and Television Benevolent Fund, which supports industry employees and . their families in times of hardship. As well as the film’s director and cast, the Duke and Duchess will meet a selection of the film’s trustees and beneficiaries. Also . benefitting from this year’s event is The Nelson Mandela Children’s . Fund, which works with the disadvantaged youth of South Africa.

"Genetic clues: The Stone Age caveman had black hair, dark skin and blue eyes contrary to given understanding of racial transformation . His piercing blue eyes are in striking contrast to his dark complexion and hair. It means this 7,000-year-old caveman holds the clue to man’s genetic evolution. His remains were discovered 5,000ft up in the mountains of north-west Spain in 2006. Experts were astonished to find the ancient hunter-gatherer, given the name La Brana 1, had a combination of African and European genes. Results from an analysis of DNA taken from a tooth show he had dark – possibly black – hair and skin with deep blue eyes, the online edition of the journal Nature reports. The mixture of African and European traits implies that the racial transformation of modern humans was still in progress long after they left Africa, with changes in eye colour coming before alterations in skin tone. Study leader Professor Carles Lalueza-Fox, of the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona, said: ‘The biggest surprise was to discover that this individual possessed African versions in the genes that determine the light pigmentation of the current Europeans. 'Even more surprising was to find that he possessed the genetic variations that produce blue eyes.’ La Brana 1 shows genetic similarities to Scandinavians and also shared a common ancestor with people who lived in Siberia more than 20,000 years ago. His was one of two unusually well preserved male skeletons unearthed from the La Brana-Arintero cave system near Leon. The scientists focused first on La Brana 1's DNA because it was in better condition. They hope in due course to piece together the genome of the other man, La Brana 2. Both individuals have been dated to around 7,000 years old. They lived in the Mesolithic period, which ended 5,000 years ago with the development of agriculture and livestock farming in the Middle East. Discovery: The remains of the 7,000-year-old man were found 5,000ft up a mountain in north-west Spain . Despite La Brana 1's dark colour, the research revealed genetic similarities with Scandinavians from Sweden and Finland. He also shared a common ancestor with people who inhabited the Upper Palaeolithic site of Mal'ta, near Lake Baikal, Siberia, more than 20,000 years ago. DNA from one of the Siberians, a boy, last year revealed links with native Americans. 'These data indicate that there is genetic continuity in the populations of central and western Eurasia,' said Prof Lalueza-Fox. La Brana 1's genome hints at some of the changes that occurred in humans as a result of switching from a hunter-gatherer existence to farming. He would have been unable to digest lactose in milk or to cope with the starchy food that became the mainstay of later Neolithic farmers. Transformation: This is an artists impression of the man's face based on DNA from his tooth . Tests: So-called La Brana 1 was found alongside another - La Brana 2 - which scientists hope to examine shortly . Farming is thought to have driven changes in the human immune system as a result of exposure to bacteria and viruses from animals. But a number of DNA variants conferring resistance to infection in modern Europeans were already present in the hunter-gatherer. This suggests they did not arise as an adaptation to farming, but had a more ancient origin. The mixture of African and European traits implies that long after modern humans left Africa their racial transformation was still in progress, with changes in eye colour coming before alterations in skin tone. Writing in Nature, the scientists concluded: 'Our results indicate that the adaptive spread of light skin pigmentation alleles (genetic variants) was not complete in some European populations by the Mesolithic, and that the spread of alleles associated with light/blue eye colour may have preceded changes in skin pigmentation.'","Remains discovered 5000ft up mountains of north-west Spain .
Findings suggest racial transformation happened later than thought .
Man, dubbed La Brana 1, also shows similarity to Scandinavian DNA ."
"It is the role no father would wish upon his daughter. But for Bill Roache, who today walked free from court following a trial for sexual assault, having his daughter Verity play the part of his rock and constant supporter for every day of the ordeal no doubt gave him enormous comfort. Verity, Roache’s 32-year-old daughter from his marriage to his second wife Sara, hardly left her father's side during the trial at Preston Crown Court. She was a daily presence, walking shoulder to shoulder with her 81-year-old father, a comforting hand frequently laid on his back. Scroll down for video . Rock: Verity Roache, 32, an interior designer, has been by her father's side throughout his trial, which today saw him walk free from allegations of sex crimes dating back to the 1960s . Supporting role: Verity has been a constant presence during the trial, which saw Roache describe himself in the witness box as 'peaceful and gentle', not the 'cold and calculating' man his alleged victims described . Team Roache: As usual the Coronation Street actor arrived at Preston Crown Court with his son Linus and his wife Rosalind Bennett (together far left) as well as other son James, daughter Verity and her partner Paddy (right) On the few occasions widower Roache, who was today cleared of seven sex charges dating back to the 1960s, has been seen out in his hometown of Wilmslow, Cheshire, Verity has been by his side, head held high, unwavering in her support. A source told the Sun during the case: 'Verity has really been there for her dad. She adores him and has been a tower of strength. As far as he is concerned she is his rock. 'Thanks to her support, he is focused and determined to prove his innocence.' Roache counted on support not just from Verity, but from his actor sons Linus, 49, from his marriage to Anna Cropper, and James, 27, from Roache's marriage to his second wife, Sara, who died suddenly in 2009 at the age of 58. Standing by: On day 12 of the trial Verity offers her father much-needed support . Loyal: Verity never strayed from her father's side in the days of the trial, and even accompanied him on the few outings into town he had over the past month . Support: Bill flanked by son Linus and daughter Verity on day 11 of his trial for historical sexual offences . Close knit: Not just Verity but the whole of the Roache clan were fiercely supportive of their father . Back in 2010, when Roache's sons Linus and James made guest appearances on Coronation Street, the soap in which Roache has starred for more than 50 years, he commented that he would like his daughter Verity to join them. 'My daughter Verity is an interior designer. But we are hoping she will come into the Rovers as an extra,' he said in an interview at the time. But while Roache's sons have a public profile, Verity's life is rather more private. She studied History of Art at St Andrew's University in Scotland where she was a friend of Prince William before becoming an interior designer and founder of Abigail & Winston, an upmarket design store listed with an address on Notting Hill's Ledbury Road but registered in Verity's name from a different address in Wilmslow. Its website is under construction, and little more can be found about the site online. Verity also worked for a time with society interior designer Nicky Haslam. Quiet life: Verity has a Twitter account but is not a prolific user of the site . Solidarity: Two of the followers of Verity's Twitter account . She has an account on Twitter under the handle @verityroache, illustrated with a background picture of her family some years ago showing a happy scene of Verity as a little girl with her mother and father, and what looks to be her younger brother James. But Verity is not an active user of the site and, while she follows the usual mix of news site accounts and famous names, had at the time of printing only sent out 34 tweets and had 146 followers. Two of those followers give a glimpse into the ordeal the Roaches have been through over the past few weeks: they are accounts set up to help clear the name of the falsely accused. Student days: Verity, who studied History of Art at St Andrews University, with father Bill and mother Sara, who died in 2009 at the age of 58 . Verity is clearly as fiercely loyal as she is private. She remained by her father's side today as he left court, saying he was keen to 'get back to work' as Ken Barlow on Coronation Street. The actor, who has appeared in the soap since its first episode in 1960, admitted 'there are no winners' after he was cleared of rape and indecent assault at Preston Crown Court. There were cheers and clapping when the jury unanimously cleared him of all six charges, leaving him open to return to the ITV soap. Roache always maintained his innocence and blamed hysteria after the Jimmy Savile scandal for 'money-grabbing' women who falsely accused him of sex offences.

"Exploring the Grand Canyon usually involves a map, walking boots – and a lot of stamina. But, thanks to Google, even the laziest  among us could soon become the most intrepid of travellers – and all without leaving the  comfort of our sofa. The internet giant is using its Street View  cameras – mounted for the first time in a backpack – to showcase the US attraction’s most popular hiking trails. Scroll down for video . Google Canyon View: Google operations manager Steve Silverman stands along the canyon wall wearing the Trekker backpack camera as the search giant begins to photograph the Grand Canyon for its Street View service . Beautiful and wild and soon to be online: The . view from the South Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park. Google is . using a nearly 40lb, backpack-sized camera unit to . showcase the canyon's most popular trails . Google and its street-view cameras . already have taken users to narrow cobblestone alleys in Spain using a . tricycle, inside the Smithsonian with a push cart and to British . Columbia's snow-covered slopes by snowmobile. Now they have mounted street-view onto a backpack to showcase the Grand Canyon's most popular hiking trails. On Monday it mapped the ten-mile Bright Angel Trail along the Arizona canyon’s South Rim. Each 40lb backpack contains 15 . five-megapixel cameras, which are positioned to give a 360-degree view, . an on-board hard drive, and enough battery to run for a day. The images will then be stitched together and should be available in a few months. It's the latest evolution in mapping technology for the company, which has used a rosette of cameras to photograph thousands of cities and towns in dozens of countries for its Street View feature. With a click of the mouse, Internet users are transported virtually for a 360-degree view of locales they may have read about only in tourist books and seen in flat, 2D images. 'Any of these sort of iconic, cultural, historical locations that are not accessible by road is where we want to go,' said Ryan Falor, product manager at Google. Google announced the trekker earlier this year but made its first official collection of data this week at the Grand Canyon, with Mr Vincent among the first to use the device. Technical: Google product manager Ryan Falor works with the Trekker along the Bright Angel Trail . The camera worn by Steve Silverman captures images every 2.5 seconds with 15 cameras that are 5 megapixels each . After a nearly 10-mile trek going from 6,900ft in elevation to 2,400ft, he hiked back up from Phantom Ranch, which can be 30 degrees warmer than at the rim, through the South Kaibab Trail and also gathered data on other trails. The so-called trekker captures images every 2.5 seconds with 15 cameras that are 5 megapixels each, from the rest areas, the steep switchbacks, the change from juniper trees to scrub brush and the traffic that moves aside as a courtesy to mule riders. The GPS data is limited, so Google must compensate with sensors that record temperature, vibrations and the orientation of the device as it changes, before it stiches the images together and makes them available to users in a few months, Mr Falor said. The backpacks aren't ready for volunteer use, but Google has said it wants to deploy them at national forests, to the narrow streets of Venice, Mount Everest and to ancient ruins and castles. 'It's going to be hard to beat this': Mr Silverman only vaguely alluded to the rival service recently launched by Apple, which has dropped Street View from it's iPhone range . Useful: One Grand Canyon visitor said being able to view the terrain ahead of time, gauge the difficulty of the hike and know just how wide the path is would benefit those considering a trip . The move to capture the Grand Canyon . comes after Apple chose to drop Google Maps from its mobile operating . systems and opted to use its own mapping program that was derided for, . among other things, poor directions and missing towns. Steve . Silverman, operations manager for Google, didn't directly address the . competition, but nevertheless told the Associated Press: 'It's going to . be hard to beat this.' Google announced the Trekker this summer but this week's trip to the Grand Canyon marked its first official collection of data using the device. The backpack-mounted device, pictured right, captures images every 2.5 seconds with 15 cameras that are 5 megapixels each. Around the Grand Canyon, GPS data is limited, so Google must compensate with sensors that record temperature, vibrations and the orientation of the device as it changes . A removable hard drive on the trekker stores the data gathered. Images will then be stitched together and made available to users in a few months . The backpacks aren't ready for volunteer use, but Google has said it wants to deploy them at national forests, to the narrow streets of Venice, Mount Everest and to ancient ruins and castles. 'You’ve seen our cars, trikes, snowmobiles and trolleys—but wheels only get you so far. There’s a whole wilderness out there that is only accessible by foot,' Google said in June. 'Trekker solves that problem by enabling us to photograph beautiful places such as the Grand Canyon so anyone can explore them. 'All the equipment fits in this one backpack, and we’ve already taken it out on the slopes.' Google launched its Street View . feature in 2007 and has expanded from five U.S. cities to more than . 3,000 locales in 43 countries. Teams and volunteers have covered more . than 5million miles with the Street View vehicles on a scale that other . companies haven't approached, said Mike Dobson, president of . Telemapics, a company that monitors mapping efforts. 'You could safely say that it's a standout, well-used application and they don't really have any competition,' he said. Hikers that were on the Grand Canyon trails when the data was gathered will have their faces blurred - an attempt by Google to ensure privacy. The company came in for fierce criticism in Europe and Australia after it emerged that it had scooped up and stored information transmitted over unsecured wireless networks while capturing images for Street View. A removable hard drive on the trekker stores the data gathered at the Grand Canyon. Tourists looked at the trekker strangely this week, as if it was something from outer space. Sharon Kerfoot, a first-time visitor from Alberta, Canada, said being able to view the terrain ahead of time, gauge the difficulty of the hike and know just how wide the path is would benefit those considering a trip to the Grand Canyon. She and a group of friends headed down the same path as Vincent but on mules, not foot. 'I think it's an excellent idea to give people a broader perspective on what they're getting into,' she said. What the images won't tell visitors is how much water they should carry down the trails, how to prepare for temperature changes, what type of food to bring and how much, and how best to protect the natural resources, park spokeswoman Maureen Oltrogge said. 'Stitched together with other information out there, the technology could be valuable,' she said.

"An acid attack victim who was horrifically scarred in a random attack wept with joy after having cosmetic surgery to restore her eyebrows. Naomi Oni, 21, had acid hurled over her face, head and body as she made her way home to Dagenham after her shift at Westfield's Victoria's Secret store last December. The acid burned off the skin on her face and scalp and left her temporarily blinded. She lost her eyelids, eyebrows and some of her hair in the assault. Joy: Naomi Oni, 21, said today it 'feels so good' to have her eyebrows back after her face was badly damanged in a random acid attack . Since then, surgeons have painstakingly . rebuilt her features including taking skin from the back of her ear to . make new eyelids for her. But her eyebrows remained permanently damaged. Before the incident, Naomi described . herself as a 'girly girl' who would spend three hours getting ready to . go out in the evening. Having already suffered so much from the attack, knowing her eyebrows would never grow back was yet another blow to her confidence. Now, ten months on, her skin has healed enough for her to have her eyebrows restored. Naomi had a sophisticated semi-permanent make-up treatment that tattoos on the eyebrows as individual hairs, mimicking the effect of real brows. Delicate technique: Semi-permanent make-up expert Debra Robson pencils in the brow before using the tattoo needle to ensure the shape is right . The cosmetic procedure was carried out by the expert Debra Robson LDN clinic on Harley Street. Debra Robson said she had loved . working with Naomi. She said: 'We recreated Naomi’s brows with my FAME . technique, which builds up the brow at microscopic level, hair by hair. 'First we pencilled in the brow and got the correct shape for Naomi’s face. 'When she was happy with the shape, we . began to build up her brows and as you can see from the pictures, the . results were perfect. 'The key is to simulate the appearance of the natural hair – so that you can see the individual hair strokes in the new brow. 'Colour is implanted into the skin – it is very sophisticated form of cosmetic tattooing.' Debra . Robson, who also worked with Katie Piper after her acid attack, also . specialises in scar and skin camouflage and areola reconstruction – for . breast cancer sufferers who have undergone mastectomies. Naomi's semi-permanent brows will last between nine months and a year before she requires a top-up. She says: 'They are beautiful – I’m so pleased I had it done.' Pioneering technique: Debra Robson has developed a technique to draw on hairs individually to mimic real brows. She uses a similar technique to recreate areola on women who have had mastectomies . Now, in her first public appearance since . February, when she movingly described on breakfast show This Morning how . her life was turned upside down when she was doused in sulphuric acid, Naomi . reveals on camera the extent of her suffering - and how she has managed . to rebuild her life. Naomi faces further intricate laser surgery as doctors strive to lessen . the impact of her scars and reconstruct her face, using the same . methods used on Kate Piper. She said: 'It has been very difficult to come to terms with. 'My doctors have been brilliant but it will take years of laser surgery to repair my face. 'There is only so much you can do at any one time – then there is long healing process before you can undergo the next stage of the treatment. 'It is only now that I had been able to have semi-permanent make-up on my face. 'Girly girl': Before the attack Naomi said she would spend three hours getting ready for a night out . 'I loved having the treatment – it feels so good to have my eyebrows back. 'What . I loved about the treatment was its intricacy – it is a form of . cosmetic tattooing.  It is the closest you can get to mimicking the . appearance of the original brow.' In . the video below, Naomi can be seen having the treatment in video – as . well as the moment she weeps for joy when she sees her new brows. Naomi . smiled: 'I did get a bit emotional when I saw them. It’s the first time . I have seen myself with eyebrows for almost a year.' Naomi . is on leave from her job at Victoria's Secret lingerie store at . Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, East London, while she recovers. She eventually plans to return to work and pursue her dream of becoming a make-up artist. Naomi, from London, is still at a loss to explain why she was targeted. She said: 'I asked, ""why me?"" I work hard, I’m a good person. 'I’m the same person now but stronger. Brave: Naomi, who last night won an award for bravery at the Women of Inspiration awards, said of her attacker, 'They can burn by skin but they can't burn my soul' 'I want to say to my attacker, ""You can burn my skin but you can’t burn my soul.""' Naomi was on the phone to her boyfriend after returning from work when she was attacked in Dagenham, Essex, on December 30 last year. She said: 'I felt a splash – that’s when I thought, someone’s out to kill me. 'I just started running straight home. I knew it was acid. It feels like something is eating way at your skin. I felt it most on my scalp, more than my face.' She arrived at her home shouting and banging on the door, screaming ‘acid, acid.’ Her family came to the door thinking she was excited about something. Then when her mother opened the door, Naomi said everyone’s faces ‘just dropped.’ Naomi was last night honoured for her bravery with a prize at the Inspiration for Women Awards at Cadogan Hall in Chelsea.","Naomi Oni, 21, was returning from work when attack occurred .

"It's that time of year again when I realise that Christmas has crept up on me before I'm ready. Of course I know it's coming - but those final few weeks of November go by so fast, don't they? One minute it was October and I was cursing the shops for daring to mention the C word. The next, it was the first week of December and I had not a gift to my name, and not a free weekend to shop before the Big Day. Which is how I found myself hurtling round Gatwick's South Terminal at breakneck speed, doing my entire Christmas shop in two hours. Quick gifts: The Lulu Guinness shopper, left, and the Aspinal coin purse, right, were no brainers for the girls in the family. Lulu Guinness foldaway lips tote: Airport price: £29.17, high street price: £23.25; Brit large Cosmetic Pouch: Airport price: £45.83, high street price: £55 . Easy buy: I snapped up these children's Converse at JD Sports for £23 (same price as high street as children's items are not taxed) It was last Friday ahead of a weekend away to Spain when I realised I had left myself with precisely no Christmas shopping days. A combination of family gatherings, children's parties and work conspired to ensure this year it would be impossible to hit the shops for a clear day. So when I arrived, child- and baggage-free, two hours early for my flight to Valencia and was faced with a load of glossy new shops at Gatwick (they've just spent £21m doing up the South Terminal departure lounge), I had the bright idea of squeezing it all into the time I had before I flew. If I could nail the 20-something-and-counting presents I needed to buy for my family before I boarded, Christmas would be saved... This optimistic notion was fuelled not only by the shiny new shops, but also the 20% discount on High Street prices generally offered (who doesn't love a bargain?) and the fact that they offer a Shop, Fly, Collect service, so I didn't have to lug around a single bag. I hate lugging bags, so this was very much good news. Also, it would all be waiting for me in Arrivals when I returned from my holiday. With my game face well and truly on, I scanned the South Terminal and spied an Aspinal of London (the first to be located in an airport), Ted Baker, Zara, JD Sports, Dixons and Harrods, along with Ernest Jones jewellers (another airport first) and various smaller shops selling quirky bits and pieces. Fun and functional: Children's JVC headphones from Dixons for my three-year-old son; touchscreen running gloves from JD Sports for the brother-in-law. Nike Elite Storm Fit running gloves: Airport price: £18.33, High street price: £23.00 . Aspinal - think super luxe leather goods at a genuinely surprisingly affordable price - proved most fruitful, bearing a Union flag purse, orange leather passport holder, croc diary, gorgeous leather keyring and snakeskin cuff that will keep the females in the family happy. It was also the most lethal: I self-gifted myself more than once and could have kept on going. JD Sports let me nail three children and a brother-in-law at once, with mini Converse trainers at £23, a mini Arsenal kit for £33, Nike Elite running gloves with iPhone touchscreen capability for £18 and a Nike football for £7. In Dixons I found child-safe headphones by JVC, £13, for my three-year-old son, plus one of the brilliant X-Mini yo-yo speakers for a friend, priced under £25, which is the same price you could get it for online (but with no delivery cost). I take them everywhere and recommend them to everyone I know; the sound for the size is epic. Dad got lucky with a long-sleeved Lacoste poloshirt, while mother and auntie were sorted with Chanel No.5 perfume for £53 instead of £66 and a Swarovski bangle for £34. What I liked best about the shopping, apart from the obvious money-saving aspect, was the number of unusual or unexpected (and actually also useful) gifts I could buy that I actually hadn't seen on the High Street - and the selection that meant I could get people things they would really want, rather than the host of emergency books and booze you'd expect from last minute airport shopping. Case Luggage travel accessories shop yielded some really cute Lulu Guinness folding shopping bags, with a black nylon tote that folded up into a pair of shiny red or pink lips - and they only cost £29 (RRP £36). A handy X-Mini speaker makes the perfect present for frequent travellers - the sound is truly epic for the size of the speaker. I recommend these to everyone. Right, a Go travel adapter made a perfect bargain stocking filler . Luxe for less: I solved a few tricky customers with Jo Malone candles for £31.20 instead of £39 . I found a very handy little gizmo that plugs into the car lighter to provide an adapter for two USB cables, so both front-seat passengers of the car can charge their phones at once (genius). The booze selection was excellent too. My cousin is a collector of unusual vodka bottles and has pretty much seen 'em all. But I found at least six to eight vodkas I suspect he won't have seen - from artisan English brand Chase to premium versions of big brands like Belvedere, Grey Goose and Absolut. I managed to narrow it down to a very enticing-looking bottle of Stolichnaya Elite that I know he will love. I picked up a bottle of the Moschino Disaronno amaretto for a friend too (I couldn't resist the heart-motif wrap - it's going to be hard to part with that one), and a bottle of Café Patron tequila for a pal who has been known to smuggle her own bottle into more than one pub in her time. A tricky uncle and discerning colleague were ticked off with Jo Malone candles for £31.20 instead of £39.  I know many people deem the scented candle a lazy, cliched gift... but I absolutely disagree. If it's the right one, it's a joy to receive - and with the beautiful Jo Malone wrapping, it's a joy to give as well. Christmas spirit: Moschino Disaronno made a lovely gift for a girlfriend, while Cafe Patrón goes to one of my wilder pals . By now the flight was showing boarding and my previous gentle stroll around the shops turned into a frantic dash as I vowed to finish the job I'd started. A last minute whizz round Harrods (actually a very, very nice 6,500sq ft version of the store, with clothes, food and trinkets) yielded the rest of my gifts. Chocolate coffee beans topped up Mum, ground coffee in an attractive printed tin did Dad, biscuits for Nan, cocoa-covered almonds for another auntie. It felt utterly surreal having just dropped a few hundred quid in a series of shops yet finding myself walking empty handed to my gate to board my flight - but let me tell you, it felt frickin' brilliant to have got the Christmas shop out the way - and in such a fuss-free fashion. Knowing that passengers have an average of 30 minutes to browse the shops, the stores are staffed to the hilt. All tills are open at all times and assistants are dotted around to make sure no one is left unattended. It makes for a very slick and pain-free experience - which is the opposite of the feeling you get when battling the crowds on Oxford Street or in a busy shopping centre. And the best bit? You get to go on holiday as well. Now if only they would wrap it for me too...

"A 78-year-old dementia sufferer battered his elderly wife to death and was found with her blood-splattered body but had 'no comprehension' of what he had done, a court heard. Francis O'Neill, who suffers from dementia, appeared confused and bewildered as his spouse, Monica, 73, lay dead in the hall of their home. The former merchant seaman and grandfather-of-four is accused of murdering his wife but he is unfit to plead because of his illness. Tragic: Mrs O'Neill was discovered by concerned neighbours at her home on this residential street in Malvern, Worcs., just after midnight on January 21 this year. Mrs O'Neill was discovered by concerned neighbours at her home in Malvern, Worcs., just after midnight on January 21 this year. The grandmother, who volunteered at the WRVS shop at Worcestershire Royal Hospital, was found with 65 injuries, including broken ribs, a blunt blow to the head and a broken tooth. After a five-month investigation, Mr O'Neill was charged with her murder by West Mercia Police on June 20. A jury at Worcester Crown Court are currently deciding the facts of Mrs O'Neill's death. Prosecutor Gareth Walters said Mr O'Neill, known to friends by his second name, Brian, had suffered from significant dementia for a number of years and it was getting progressively worse. Mr Walters said: 'The sole issue is whether you are sure the defendant committed the act of killing his wife. He seemed to have no comprehension.' Mr Walters said that during the day of January 20 the couple had a new cooker fitted at home and neither their cleaner nor the men who installed the appliance noticed any tension or arguments. But, just after midnight, neighbours Brian and Carol Holt who had been friends with the couple for more than 30 years, were awoken by their doorbell. Mr O'Neill was standing outside and asked how to contact 999, saying his wife was asleep in the chair in their lounge and he could not wake her. They accompanied him to the O'Neills' home, where Mr Holt saw Mrs O'Neill lying in the hallway with her head against the under stairs cupboard, bleeding from her left eye and with a tea towel placed across the lower part of her half-naked body. Mr O'Neill seemed 'quite unaware' of what had happened but had an injury to the knuckle of his right hand, which continued to swell. Volunteer: The grandmother, who volunteered at the WRVS shop at Worcestershire Royal Hospital (pictured), was found with 65 injuries, including broken ribs, a blunt blow to the head and a broken tooth . He claimed he had left her watching TV, saw her asleep and then shook her to try to wake her. Police found him 'confused and bewildered' and after being assessed as having dementia, he was not interviewed by officers. Forensic pathologist Dr Nicholas Hunt said: 'Mrs O'Neill died from multiple injuries, including a blunt injury to her head. 'Some of her injuries may have been accidental or through a fall down stairs but others were consistent with blows from a fist or defensive wounds as she tried to protect herself.' An expert on blood spatter found Mrs O'Neill had been assaulted on the upper part of her stairs and blood was also found in the kitchen, as well as on a pair of trousers, which were hanging on a radiator. Neighbour Brian Holt told the court: 'Brian seemed completely oblivious to what happened. He was concerned about where his house keys were. 'I still can't believe what has happened. They were a very loving, happy couple.' In her statement, Carol Holt said: 'Mrs O'Neill was a lovely lady and had a good relationship with her husband, who referred to her as 'The Commander', and she did everything for him.' The O'Neills' cleaner Sandra Beard, said in a statement that Mrs O'Neill was 'caring and kind' and that she had never seen Mr O'Neill show any aggression. The case continues.

"Severe drought conditions plaguing more than half of the United States has developed into the largest natural disaster area in the country’s history. The United States Department of Agriculture declared natural disasters for 26 states and more than 1,000 counties because of the extreme drought that has destroyed crops in farms throughout the nation. The USDA’s designation provides federal financial help for farmers during the troubling time. Scroll down for video . Devastation: Severe drought conditions plaguing more than half of the United States has created the largest natural disaster in the country's history . Extreme: This amazing image shows a lightning storm above a drought-afflicted area in Iowa . The declaration come as the worst drought in a quarter century tightened its grip on Midwestern states over the past week. Sweltering temperatures and scant rainfall punished corn and soybean crops across the region, a report from climate experts said on Thursday. Nearly two-thirds of the nine-state Midwest region was in some stage of drought in the week ended July 10, up from just over 50 per cent a week earlier, according to the Drought Monitor, a weekly report on drought throughout the country compiled by U.S. climate experts. A third of the region was in severe to exceptional drought, up from about a quarter of the region a week earlier, it said. Decision: The U.S. Department of Agriculture declared natural disasters for 26 states and more than 1,000 counties because the extreme drought has destroyed crops in farms throughout the nation . Aid: The USDA¿s designation provides federal financial help for farmers dealing with destroyed crops . 'The most anomalous conditions covered the lower Ohio Valley, southern Great Lakes, and middle Mississippi Valley, where daily highs averaged 10 to 13 degrees above normal. Additionally, these areas received scant rainfall if any,' said Rich Tinker of the Climate Prediction Center. 'The worst conditions (D3 to D4) were assessed along and near the lower Ohio River and in northeastern Indiana, where rainfall was 7 to 11 inches below normal for the last 3 months,' he said, referring to the top two categories of drought, extreme and exceptional. The deepening drought has dragged the yield potential of the developing soybean crop and the pollinating corn crop, which is in a growth stage when its water needs are highest. On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of . Agriculture slashed production forecasts for both crops due to the . drought, joining scores of private forecasts that have sent grain prices . to near-record highs. Damage: Sweltering temperatures and scant rainfall punished corn and soybean crops across the Midwestern region like this corn plant in an Iowa farm . Suffering: The deepening drought has dragged the yield potential of the developing soybean crop and the pollinating corn crop, which is in a growth stage when its water needs are highest . The whole of Iowa was classified as abnormally dry as of July 10 and 12.7 per cent of the top corn and soybean producing state was in severe drought, up from 0.8 percent the prior week. Harder-hit Illinois, the No. 2 corn and soy state, was 66.28 per cent under severe drought or worse, up from 40 per cent the previous week. Severe to exceptional drought covered 80.15 per cent of Indiana, versus 68.84 per cent the prior week. Conditions in Missouri also deteriorated, with 82.54 per cent of the state in severe drought or worse, compared with 78.83 percent the week before. Rain was expected to move across the Midwest over the next 10 days, including parched southeastern areas, but coverage may be spotty, forecasters said on Thursday.

"Roberto Martinez has launched an investigation to find the reasons why Everton’s players have suffered so many hamstring injuries in the last 18 months. Since Martinez arrived at the club in June 2013, a number of Everton’s key players have been afflicted with the issue.

Leighton Baines, pictured scoring a penalty against Sunderland, missed the game against the Hammers due to a hamstring complaint . A number of changes have taken place in Martinez’s tenure, with fitness and conditioning specialists Steve Tashjian and Dave Billows leaving - both men were key figures under David Moyes - while Danny Donachie, Head of Sports Medicine, resigned abruptly before Christmas. Martinez has promoted Matt Connery to succeed Donachie and the manager, who is also a fully-qualified physiotherapist, wants to discover why his players have been so susceptible to becoming hamstrung. ‘There are reasons for it and it’s really important to find out why,’ said Martinez. ‘It worries me the number of players who got re-injured and that’s something we need to address. We need to get down to the detail of why that is happening. ‘When you injure the right hamstring you’ve got a bigger chance of injuring the left and that pattern is worrying. 'We have to find out why that is happening but I’m quite confident that we will get to the bottom of it.’ The biggest casualty in recent weeks has been James McCarthy. He suffered a hamstring tear during a 2-0 win against Wolfsburg in the Europa League on November 27 and missed six games, but was brought back for the Christmas period. Martinez is confident Everton have got to the bottom of James McCarthy's recent injury troubles . McCarthy, pictured during the Merseyside derby, played against Stoke and Newcastle but had to be replaced . Everton have not won since December 15 but manager Martinez is looking forward to taking on Man City . McCarthy was then injured again after playing against Stoke City and Newcastle United in the space of 48 hours, and while Martinez hopes Everton have got to the root of the issue with him - they have looked at his diet and conditioning work - he has left a gap that has been impossible to plug. ‘James is a player who we have no replacement for in the squad,’ said Martinez. ‘He’s unique in what he brings to the team. 'Of course you will have an Everton team without McCarthy, but it’s not going to be the same team, it will affect other players and the way that you want to play. ‘But it would be too big a statement to say without James we cannot play the way that you want to. 'I’ve worked with James for many years and I know what he brings to the side and what he allows the team to do. James is one of those players that you value more when he’s not on the pitch.’","A staggering 20 Everton players have suffered with hamstring complaints since manager Roberto Martinez arrived at the club in June 2013 .

"Jews have reportedly been told to register with pro-Russian forces in the east Ukrainian city of Donetsk or face deportation. A pamphlet handed out in Donetsk orders 'citizens of Jewish nationality' over the age of 16 to pay $50 to register and be issued special passports 'marking the confession of faith'. The leaflets, a chilling echo of Nazi persecution, were handed out to Jews leaving a local synagogue by three men in ski masks holding the flag of the Russian Federation, Israeli media reports. Scroll Down for video and full leaflet translation . Sinister: A leaflet distributed in Donetsk, Ukraine calling for all Jews over 16 years old to 'register'. The leaflet also demanded the city's Jews supply a detailed list of all the property they own, or else have their citizenship revoked . Jews living in the area of the self-declared 'Donetsk People's Republic' were ordered to register at a government building operated by pro-Russian forces or face the threat of deportation. Today, the Donetsk People's Republic said they will only leave the occupied government buildings in the area if the interim government in Kiev resigns. Leader Denis Pushilin, who earlier today spoke to MailOnline denying any involvement in the anti-Semitic handout, said his organisation do not recognize the Ukrainian government as legitimate. Pushilin said the deal signed yesterday specifies that all illegally seized buildings should be vacated, but in his opinion it is the government in Kiev is occupying public buildings illegally. The deal, backed by Ukraine, Russia and several western states, calls for the immediate return of all government buildings seized by pro-Russian militia, but none of the government buildings seized across eastern Ukraine has yet been vacated, according to local media on Friday. It was brokered in Geneva yesterday where U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry seized the opportunity to condemn the leaflets, which recall the days of czarist pogroms and Nazi-era persecution of Jews, calling them ‘grotesque’. Bad deal: A former aide to Vladimir Putin claims Ukrainians were 'sold out' and 'betrayed' in Thursday's agreement in Geneva . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry  and Russian Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday after signing the deal regarding the tensions between Russia and Ukraine in Geneva yesterday . Speaking in Geneva after top diplomats . from the U.S., European Union, Russia and Ukraine reached agreement on . steps to de-escalate the situation, Secretary of State John Kerry . denounced the leaflets. ‘In . the year 2014, after all of the miles traveled and all of the journey . of history, this is not just intolerable; it's grotesque,’ Kerry told . reporters. ‘It is . beyond unacceptable. And any of the people who engage in these kinds of . activities, from whatever party or whatever ideology or whatever place . they crawl out of, there is no place for that. ‘ . Kerry . also denounced apparent threats to members of the Russian Orthodox . Church from members of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. He noted that the . agreement signed on Thursday ‘strongly condemned and rejected all . expressions of extremism, racism and religious intolerance, including . anti-Semitism.’ It requires . all sides to refrain from . violence, intimidation or provocative actions, however,it does not . require Russia to withdraw some 40,000 troops massed near the border. As . the news of the anti-Semitic leaflet broke, Russian Foreign Minister . Sergey Lavrov promised amnesty to pro-Russian protesters who . participated in an uprising against the government in Kiev, except those . found guilty of capital crimes. A pro-Russia activist stands guard in front of the flag of the so-called  Donetsk Republic in the eastern Ukrainian city of Slavyansk . In Kiev, Acting Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk told the parliament Friday morning that the government has drafted a law that would offer amnesty to all those who will be willing to lay down their arms and leave the occupied government buildings. 'Independent Donetsk Republic, General Staff . 'Dear citizens of Jewish nationality: . 'Taking . into consideration the fact that the leaders of Jewish community of . Ukraine has supported banderovtsy’s Junta in Kiev, and have been hostile . to Orthodox Donetsk Republic and its citizens, the General Staff of . Donetsk People’s Republic has decreed the following: . 'All . citizens of Jewish nationality who are older than 16 years-old that . have been living within the territory of Sovereign Donetsk Republic . should attend acting Commissioner for nationalities affairs in Donetsk . Regional Government Department, office 514 for registration before 03 . May 2014. The registration fees are 50 USD. 'You . should bring the amount of 50 USD for registration fees, passports for . marking the confession of faith, documents showing family members, . entitling documents for title to real property and transport facilities. 'In . case of attempts to avoid the registration, the subject persons’ citizenship will be revoked with their subsequent enforced deportation . outside Donetsk Republic including the forfeiture of their property. ' Your People’s Governor – Denis Pushilin . The U.S. State Department said it was looking into who is responsible, but said it took the threat seriously no matter who was behind the leaflets. Although the leaflets were signed by Donetsk People's Republic, its leader denied any involvement in the matter and says the leaflets are fake. In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Denis Pushilin said today in Donetsk, where he has declared independence from Ukraine: ‘I strongly deny that this document on registering Jewish people is genuine. ‘I have never written and signed anything like this, nor orders on food coupons, nor taxes for businessmen nor registration for foreign students, all of which have been reported. ‘Those documents are aimed to discredit our people's republic. They are fakes.’ Of the order about Jew's being forced to register, or lose their rights to property, he insisted: ‘Look at this document. I have never called myself the people's governor, my job is different. ‘The stamp is bigger than it should be because it was Photoshopped from some real document. ‘I am personally strongly against any declarations of this sort made against Jewish or any other people. This is a dirty trick by our foes.’ According to USA Today, . the leaflet says all people of Jewish descent over 16 should report to . the Commissioner for Nationalities in the Donetsk Regional . Administration building and 'register.' It . goes on to explain that the reason for this is that leaders of the . Jewish community of Ukraine supported Bendery Junta in reference to the . leader of a nationalist group fighting for independence at the end of . the Second World War. The letter features the flag of the so-called Donetsk Republic, a self-proclaimed state declared earlier this month by several hundred activists who occupied the Regional Administration Building and the City Hall buildings in the city.

Pro-Russian protesters have occupied the government buildings in eastern cities such as Donetsk and Luhansk, declaring independence from the capital Kiev . Russia has a long and unfortunate history of the persecution of the Jewish people. In the late 18th century, Catherine the Great created the Pale of Settlement, which dictated where in Imperial Russia Jews were allowed to reside, an area of about 20 per cent of then-European Russia which today is part of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Moldova and, notably, Ukraine. Tsarist Russia also saw a wave of anti-Jewish  riots, known as pogroms, which took off with the violent persecution in Odessa in 1821, now the third largest city in Ukraine, which had one of the highest percentages of Jewish population in the Pale of Settlement. Decades of pogroms followed, with a peak between 1881 to 1884 when more than 200 anti-Jewish events occurred in the Russian Empire, notably in Kiev, Warsaw and Odessa. The trigger was the assassination of Russia's Tsar Alexandr II, for which many blamed 'The Jews'. Between 1903 and 1906 thousands of Jews were killed in pogroms, including the 1905 pogrom of Odessa which saw up to 2,500 Jewish men, women and children killed, according to historic reports. The pogroms,  harsh conditions and wide-spread poverty in the Pale of Settlement saw some two million Jews emigrate, mainly to the U.S. in the late 1800s and early 1900s. During the Soviet era, the Soviet Union and countries within its sphere of influence were accused of persecuting Jews. Josef Stalin was said by numerous sources to despise Jews and under Brezhnev, Jews faced discrimination. Late last . night, President Barack Obama said he was sceptical about Russian promises . to de-escalate a volatile situation in Ukraine, and said the United . States and its allies are ready to impose fresh sanctions if Moscow . doesn't make good on its commitments. 'My . hope is that we actually do see follow-through over the next several . days, but I don't think, given past performance, that we can count on . that,' President Obama said at an impromptu news conference at the White House a few hours after the end of the meeting in Geneva. 'We have to be prepared to potentially respond to what continue to be efforts of interference by the Russians in eastern and southern Ukraine. 'The question now becomes, will in fact they use the influence that they've exerted in a disruptive way to restore some order so that Ukrainians can carry out an election, move forward with the decentralization reforms that they've proposed, stabilize their economy and start getting back on the path of growth and democracy and that their sovereignty will be respected?' In March, leaders of Ukraine’s Jewish . communities published an open letter denouncing Russian anit-semitism . and criticising Putin. The Kiev-based Vaad of Ukraine is an umbrella group that says it supports '265 Jewish organizations from 94 cities of Ukraine'. The . letter, written in Russian and co-signed by 21 Jewish leaders — . including the Vaad leadership, supports Ukrainian sovereignty 'in the . name of national minorities and Ukraine’s Jewish community.' Putin has justified his military . action by claiming that he is acting to protect Ukraine’s . Russian-speaking population and claims that Ukraine’s new government is . composed of 'fascists and neo-Nazis'. But the . letter, claiming to represent Russian-speaking Jews, said: 'Your . certainty about the growth of anti-Semitism in Ukraine, which you . expressed at your press conference, also does not correspond to the . actual facts,' 'Perhaps . you got Ukraine confused with Russia, where Jewish organizations have . noticed growth in anti-Semitic tendencies last year.'","U.S. condemns leaflets urging Jews in east Ukraine to 'register'

"A pregnant mother told her six children she was going to the supermarket – and flew to Australia for a six-week holiday with a boyfriend she met online. A court heard the 43-year-old woman effectively left a son aged 14 in charge of his siblings and took off to the other side of the world on New Year’s Day. Police were alerted when the teenager called his grandparents, who dialled 999, and the mother was arrested when she flew back into the UK in February. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was handed a six month prison sentence, suspended for two years, by Judge Murray Creed at Birmingham Crown Court . Yesterday she walked free from court with a suspended sentence after admitting six counts of wilful abandonment. Judge Murray Creed told the woman it was a serious matter and praised her teenage son for his presence of mind. The woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, vanished at 5pm after telling her son she was going to Asda. When she failed to return home four hours later, he called his grandparents, who live outside the area. They alerted police and social services, who arrived at 1am. By then, the mother had sent the boy a text saying she would not be back until the next day. By the time police contacted her, she was at Heathrow waiting to board a flight to Sydney. The judge was told that her Chinese internet boyfriend had wired the flight money to her via Western Union. Patrick Sullivan, prosecuting, said the mother, who is a single parent, ignored messages from her parents and the police, deactivated her social media accounts and refused to fly home until her scheduled return. Officers sent to the mother’s address found the children in a house which was warm but dirty. The children, the youngest of whom is three, were placed into emergency foster care. They are now living with their grandparents. Birmingham Crown Court was shown cards made by the children, two boys and four girls, and addressed to their mother. One read ‘We miss you mummy’ while another said ‘We want to see you soon.’ John Smitheman, defending the woman, told the court they were thriving academically and unaffected by the experience. He said the woman had been a good mother but had been in an abusive relationship with an African man before she struck up an online relationship with the Chinese man. Mr Smitheman said the stress of bringing the children up alone had let to a ‘very unusual, almost unique circumstance’. The woman flew 9,467 miles from her home in Birmingham to Australia to enjoy a six week holiday with her boyfriend . The mother, formerly of Birmingham but now living in Wales, was handed a six-month suspended sentence. A friend and neighbour from Birmingham said: ‘She was a really good mother who loved her children to bits. I don’t know what possessed her to abandon them like this.’ At her home last night the mother declined to comment or apologise. Adrian Brown of the NSPCC said: ‘While there’s no legal minimum age when you can leave children at home alone in the UK, clearly in this case the mothers’ actions were not those of a responsible parent.’","Runway mum left children aged 14 to three years home alone .

"The UK Independence Party received as much money in membership fees as the Conservatives did last year, new figures show. Nigel Farage’s party – which has nearly 32,500 members – raked in £714,492 from its members’ in subscription fees during 2013. Meanwhile, Labour received £33million last year, well ahead of the Tories' £25million, Lib Dems' £7.3million and UKIP's £2.5million. New figures from the Electoral Commission show a sharp rise in the amount of money UKIP raises from membership fees . That is a rate of around £22 per member – and a 60 per cent rise in membership revenue compared with the previous year. The . Conservatives, who do not reveal official membership figures but are . thought to have around 135,000 members, managed to get just £749,000. That . is less than £6 per member, but the Conservatives say most of their . membership fees go to local associations, and little of the money is . held by the central party. Labour, . which traditionally gets far more in membership fees, received . £5.6million from its own 190,000 members and subscription fees from . affiliated trade union members last year. The . annual accounts filed by the parties to the Electoral Commission . yesterday will fuel concerns among Tory MPs that members have deserted . the party for Ukip. All . political parties are losing members, but Conservatives have lost . around half their members since David Cameron became leader in 2005. UKIP leader Nigel Farage has boasted of making a major breakthrough at the general election, taking thousands of votes from David Cameron's Conservatives . Tory party sources said they had around 135,000 full members who have paid the £25 fee. The average age of members is thought to be around 68. This compares to 253,600 members who voted in the 2005 leadership election and 1.2million members in the 1980s. But they around another 50,000 ‘supporters’ who have paid £1 to receive campaign emails. The annual accounts show the Tories received £25million in total income in 2013, slightly more than the previous year; Labour received £33million, the same as in 2012. But the Conservatives – who are under fire for receiving money from Russian oligarchs – banked three times as much in private donations - £15million to Labour’s £5million. Labour received £33million in 2013, well ahead of the Conservatives' £25million, the accounts show . Labour has just received one of its largest private donations under Ed Miliband’s leadership, from property tycoon Sir David Garrard who gave them £500,000. Sir David . was implicated in the 2006 ‘cash for honours’ scandal when he was . nominated for a life peerage by Tony Blair. It was blocked after it . emerged he loaned the party £2.3million. His is the third largest donation to Labour since 2010, after businessman John Mills who has given £1.6m. Andrew Rosenfeld, co-founder with Sir David Garrard of the property development firm Minerva, gave £863,494. The . Conservatives have been on a membership drive in recent months. Douglas . Carswell, the Tory MP for Clacton, said signing up supporters for just . £1 had been very successful. Mr . Carswell said: ‘We don’t measure success by how much money the members . generate but by the support we get. I would rather get the support of a . student or pensioner on a low-income than a plutocrat. Labour has just received a donation from property tycoon Sir David Garrard, who gave them £500,000 . ‘Paying the £25 fee to join a dining club that meets in the local golf club wearing black tie is always going to be a minority interest. 'But I now have dozens of people in my constituency who have become a supporter for £1 or paid nothing but registered for emails about what we’re doing. That’s the important thing.’ Last year the Bow Group, a right-wing think tank, warned that Tory party membership is ‘dying’ and it could be overtaken by the UK Independence Party in just five years’ time. The group called for electoral pacts with Ukip locally and for candidates to be selected through ‘open primaries’ where any local resident can run can run as an MP. Commentators have noted a loss of the ‘country’ Conservative vote to Ukip in some areas, despite the fact the party also attract blue collar ex-Labour voters in other parts of the country. At the European election in May, Ukip candidate William, 10th Earl of Dartmouth was re-elected as an MEP for the South West, where Ukip polled 50,000 more votes than the Conservatives. A Tory spokesman said: ‘It is nonsense to suggest these figures are the whole picture, or we would only get 13 per cent of the money Labour have from members. ‘Labour pool their membership fees centrally. Ours is collected by local associations, and only a small part of it is held centrally.’","UKIP raises £714,492 from members, compared to Tories' £749,000 .

"Mention Daleks and a ruthless race of extraterrestrial robots intent on universal domination spring to mind. But 'The Dalek' is also the nickname of a £200,000 machine that is exterminating potholes 30 times as fast as the conventional method of repair.

The imposing machine is being tested on the roads of central Bedfordshire and is successful, motorists may see more daleks on the road in future - and enjoy smoother journeys . Fully armed: The machine has a robotic arm, which extends from the cab over the pothole and fills it with material to fill in the crater (pictured) The machine blows away the dust and loose debris, sprays a tar-like glue over the hole, then lays gravel on top. The real deal: The pothole-busting machine has been nicknamed the Dalek. An original space character from Dr Who is pictured . It is already used in the U.S. where it is known as the Pot Hole Killer and Central Bedfordshire Council is the first authority in England to trial the machine. ‘Maintaining our roads is a really key priority for the council, although we're conscious that there is a balancing act between keeping the roads safe and minimising disruption for our residents, as well as keeping our highways teams safe while they work, said councillor Brian Spurr, executive member for Sustainable Communities, Services. ‘We're constantly investigating new ways to keep up to speed with road improvements and trying out innovative technology like this ticks all the boxes to help us keep the road network moving. ‘The road patcher is still going through a trial phase but could potentially be another way that we can improve the service for our residents.’ Margaret Seear, from leading public services provider Amey, which has rolled out the new machine as part of its Highways Agency contract for the East of England, said: ‘Things like potholes can be a real headache for drivers and we are pleased to provide an efficient solution that has real benefits for our customer, our employees and road users.’ The trial comes as an annual report suggests the estimated cost of returning roads in England and Wales to a reasonable condition has increased to £12 billion. The Asphalt Industry Alliance survey of local authorities said the cost has risen from £10.5 billion in 2013 and it it could take local authorities a decade to fix the roads. Two million potholes in England and Wales were filled during the past 12 months. However, motoring groups said this is just a ‘sticking plaster’ approach and in the long run it would be cheaper to invest the £12billion to fix them properly. Compensation claims for car damage and injury caused by  potholed roads are rising sharply and now cost taxpayers £32million a year. It would take 12 years to clear the road repair backlog in England and Wales, and 14 years in London, according to the annual local authority road maintenance survey carried out by the Asphalt Industry Alliance. David Bizley, of the RAC, said  it was ‘no great surprise’ that  the catch-up cost of fixing roads had risen. ‘If you don’t resurface roads properly at regular intervals and reconstruct them when they reach the end of their design lives you end up with roads riddled with potholes, endangering lives and costing motorists millions in vehicle repairs,’ he said. The cost of filling a pothole ranges from £52 in most of England and Wales to £70 in London, where it has gone up by £8 in a year.

"A career criminal nicknamed Safari Boy is back behind bars – 21 years and more than 100 convictions after a ‘character-building’ African junket failed to break his cycle of offending. Mark Hook, 38, raided a cottage while its elderly tenant was away, trashing the property and escaping with a digital camera and more than £140 in cash. Yesterday victim Frederick Talbot, an 86-year-old widower, said the serial burglar would never change his ways after the Daily Mail informed him of Hook’s notorious past. Mark Hook, pictured left in 1995 - shortly after his controversial safari trip by social services - and right, in a police mugshot in 2012 after mugging an elderly shopper and handling credit cards . Hook first appeared in court in 1991 when he admitted taking a car without consent. In 1993 he was sent on an 88-day holiday, which included a Kenyan safari, by social services to show him how worse-off people in the world coped without resorting to crime. The trip caused a national furore and was denounced by critics who said it would not reform the teenager. John Major, the then prime minister, told MPs no offenders would be sent on trips abroad again. Early the next year Hook appeared in court over 34 offences including burglary and taking a car without consent. In adulthood he developed a heroin and crack cocaine habit which he sustained through crime in a cycle of offending and jail terms. On Friday, Hook appeared at Gloucester Crown Court via video link from a prison remand wing to admit stealing property including chequebooks, a passport and a pillow case from a cottage on the Stancombe Park Estate in North Nibley, Gloucestershire. Judge Jamie Tabor QC remanded him for pre-sentence reports and adjourned the case until next month. Yesterday Mr Talbot said he had been away when Hook raided the rented property. The retired Stancombe estate manager said: ‘He made a hell of a mess, pulling out every drawer he could after squeezing through a tiny bathroom window. ‘The police never told me anything about his background. He took £26 from a money box which my grandchildren had saved, my national service medal, £120 in two pound coins which I was saving and a digital camera.’ Hook, back row second from left, poses with a group in Egypt at the Temple of Karnak while enjoying the £7,000 safari to try and stop his offending in 1993 . Referring to Hook’s £7,000 trip to Kenya and Egypt as a 17-year-old, Mr Talbot added: ‘I just hope he gets a good jail sentence now. Holiday or no holiday, he will obviously never change his ways.’ Hook claims to be a descendant of Henry Hook, who won the Victoria Cross fighting Zulus at Rorke’s Drift in 1879. The battle inspired the film Zulu in which Private Hook, who is buried in Churcham, near Gloucester, was portrayed by James Booth. Mr Talbot said Private Hook would be ‘turning in his grave’ over his descendant’s criminal record. Hook's innocent smile as a child gave little indication of the terror he would inflict on his victims over the years . The pensioner moved to the cottage on his retirement in 1992. Previous occupant Geoffrey Hook was a distant relative of the career criminal. His widow Tessa, 81, said Hook was also suspected of burgling them when they lived at the cottage. She said: ‘We lost money and jewellery, but I can’t remember if he was ever prosecuted or convicted for it.’ Until Friday, Hook’s last criminal conviction – his 113th – was in July 2012 when he was jailed for 18 months for mugging a woman shopper and handling property stolen from another woman robbery victim. At what was then Hook’s 32nd court appearance, Judge Tabor told Gloucester Crown Court the defendant was a ‘perpetual villain’. Hook was one of a host of young offenders pampered by the justice system in the 1990s. In previous years the delinquents would have been locked up in Borstals or sent to approved schools. But in the mid 1990s there were a string of misguided attempts to put them on the straight and narrow. Clinton Bowen was treated to a three-month £12,000 barge holiday in 1997. The 15-year-old who became known as Canal Boy grew up to be a drug addict who specialised in raiding the homes of the elderly. His brother Casey earned the name Pocket Money Boy when he was paid £60 a week after 37 arrests between 1992 and 1994. After paying out £1,560, social services stopped the money because his offending increased. Jason Cooper was called World Tour Boy after going on holidays costing the taxpayer £50,000 to ‘instil feelings of self-worth by broadening his horizons’. He progressed to a life in and out of jail for crimes including conspiracy to rob a post office, burglary, fraud and car crime. He even tried to sue social services claiming he had not been taught basic life skills such as how to claim benefits.","Mark Hook, 38, raided country cottage while its elderly tenant was away .

The disgraced professor of anthropology, gender and sexuality studies will have to pay $25,000 restitution, which will be divvied up among his seven victims, and he will also be required to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life . Appearing before District Judge Philip Gutierrez in a wheelchair Friday, Williams pleaded guilty to one federal count of engaging in illicit sexual contact in foreign places. He was then returned back to jail, along the way smiling at his family members sitting in the audience and shrugging his shoulders, City News Service reported, via The Desert Sun. Williams will be officially sentenced December 15. Williams made international headlines in June 2013 when he was captured by Mexican authorities in the resort city of Playa del Carmen. The disgraced educator had been placed on FBI’s list of Top Ten Most Wanted Fugitives in connection to sex crimes involving young boys living abroad. Garcia said Williams was captured late Tuesday while drinking coffee near a park in the Caribbean beach town. Sex tourist: Former University of Southern California professor of gender and sexuality reportedly used his trips to Southeast Asia to have sexual encounters with as many as ten boys . Runaway: The FBI placed Williams on its Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list after his escape from Los Angeles . Mexican police caught up with the runaway USC professor on June 18, 2013, as he was enjoying a cup of coffee near a park in the Caribbean resort town. Arresting officers were acting on a tip from someone who recognized the professor from his picture in a newspaper. A federal arrest warrant was issued for the former Palm Springs, California, resident in Los Angeles in April 2013, according to the FBI website. The indictment alleged that Williams traveled from Los Angeles to the Philippines in January 2011 to engage in sex acts with two boys, ages 13 and 14, he met online in 2010. While in the Philippines, Williams sexually exploited both boys, one of whom he also photographed in the nude. He also had sexual relations with a 15 year and three other boys, all aged 16. Williams fled the Los Angeles area approximately one week after returning from the Philippines. Until 2011, Williams was a highly respected tenured professor at the University of Southern California where his field of study was gender development and sexuality. Busted: Williams was arrested in June 2013 in Mexico's southern beach resort of Playa del Carmen . Disgraced: The former tenured professor covers his face in this handout photo taken on June 18, 2013 . Williams was also affiliated with the Buddhist Universal Association of Los Angeles, California, according to the FBI. ‘Williams has an extensive history of travel throughout the South East Asia region, specifically the Philippines,’ the FBI said following his arrest. ‘He has reportedly resided in Indonesia, Polynesia and Thailand.’ Prosecutors alleged that Williams, a Fulbright Award winner once named USC’s Outstanding Teacher, used those foreign trips to prey on at least 10 children ranging in age from 9 to 17, reported the Los Angeles Times.","Walter Lee Williams, 65, pleaded guilty to one federal count of engaging in illicit sexual contact in foreign places .

"Rupert Murdoch, the billionaire News Corp chief, has tweeted his dissatisfaction with the news coverage of the burgeoning conflict in Gaza. The 81-year-old media tycoon, who is an avowed supporter of Israel took to Twitter to call the coverage of events in the Middle East by CNN and the AP biased to the point of 'embarrassment.' Stirring up controversy, Murdcoch also questioned, 'Why is Jewish-owned press so consistently anti-Israel in every crisis?' and asked if President Obama's 'friends in Egypt' could stop the shelling of Israel. Reaction to the tweets was swift with BuzzFeed political reporter Andrew Kaczynski saying he wanted whatever 'Rupert Murdoch is smoking' and New Yorker political reporter Ryan Lizza tweeted simply 'wow'. News Corp Chairman Rupert Murdoch has taken to his Twitter feed to question the 'bias' he feels that certain U.S. media organisations are displaying towards the fresh conflict in Gaza and Israel . In one tweet, the News Corp chief pointed an accusatory finger at CNN and the AP . In another tweet which caused some political commentators to scratch their heads - Murdoch asked why the Jewish-owned press does not back Israel . Murdoch's controversial tweets came as . the White House on Saturday said that Israel had the right to defend . itself against attack and decide how to respond to rocket fire from the . Gaza Strip. The White House is blaming the ruling Islamic militant Hamas group for starting the conflict. ‘We believe Israel has a right to defend . itself, and they'll make their own decisions about the tactics they use . in that regard,’ deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes told . reporters during the president's flight on Air Force One to Asia. Israel on Saturday hit Gaza with nearly . 200 airstrikes, expanding an aerial assault to include the prime . minister's headquarters, a police compound and a vast network of . smuggling tunnels. Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are in agreement that a de-escalation of the violence is preferred, provided that Hamas stops sending rocket into Israel, Rhodes said. The Israeli government has called up thousands of reservists and massed troops, tanks and other armored vehicles along the border with Gaza, signalling a ground invasion could be imminent. Israel launched the offensive on Wednesday by assassinating Hamas' military commander, but Rhodes said the U.S. believes 'the precipitating factor for the conflict was the rocket fire coming out of Gaza.’ He added, 'These rockets have been fired into Israeli civilian areas and territory for some time now. So Israelis have endured far too much of a threat from these rockets for far too long, and that is what led the Israelis to take the action that they did in Gaza.'

"Miranda Kerr has been dropped as a Victoria's Secret Angel because of her 'difficult reputation', it has been claimed. The Australian supermodel, who is married to British actor Orlando Bloom with whom she shares two-year-old son Flynn, has been let go as one of the main faces of the lingerie brand after her $1 million, three year-contract 'was not renewed'. Have her wings been clipped? Miranda Kerr in the 2012 Victoria's Secret catwalk show in New York in November . A source told America's Us Weekly that . the 29-year-old beauty 'has a difficult reputation' and suggested it . was the main reason she will no longer walk the company's star-studded . annual catwalk show wearing a prestigious pair of angel's wings, an . honour reserved for just a handful of the brand's top faces. Another source suggested the brunette . model is 'not a big seller for VS', compared to its other Angels like . Alessandra Ambrosio, 31, Candice Swanepoel, 24, and Adriana Lima, 31. Miranda will reportedly still walk in the company's runway show later this year and will also appear in its catalogue. Frosty? Sources claim the model isn't very friendly with her fellow Victoria's Secret Angels . The source said: 'They can still use . her for catalogue, where she will get a day rate, but she doesn't have . to be an Angel to do that.' A separate insider tells People she is known in the industry as a diva, adding: 'She can be difficult at shoots and appearances. She's not very timely. She's standoffish with the rest of the girls.' But one source added: 'If Miranda and . Victoria's Secret part ways it's not because of her behaviour. It's . purely contractual. She'll be coming back for the show but it's unclear . if she'll be in future campaigns. But she is definitely one of the most . popular models and in high demand.' Keeping his cool: Miranda's husband Orlando Bloom was spotted in West Hollywood - without his wife - on Wednesday . Executives from Victoria's Secret did . not deny that Miranda's contract has not been renewed, but chief . marketing officer Ed Razek insisted he has already invited her to walk . in the 2013 runway show in New York in November. He said: 'Miranda Kerr is one of the . best models in the history of the business - and easily one of the most . popular. She is also a consummate professional.' 'Any rumours to the contrary are . simply untrue. While her international commitments have kept her away . from us more than we’d like over the past few years, she will always be . an Angel to me … In fact, I’ve already invited her to walk the runway in . this year’s fashion show and, happily, she’s agreed.'

"The ‘bad’ type of cholesterol – which causes heart disease – is linked to Alzheimer’s, researchers have found. Such cholesterol has previously been associated with a narrowing of the arteries. Now a study has revealed that the bad type is related to the amyloid peptide protein in the brain, which is present in Alzheimer’s. A study has revealed that the bad type of cholesterol - which causes heart disease - is related to the amyloid peptide protein (pictured) in the brain, which is present in Alzheimer's . In patients affected by disease, clumps of the protein stick to brain cells, affecting memory, mood and behaviour. The discovery may explain the well-known link between raised cholesterol and an increased risk of Alzheimer’s. Researchers found the link depended on whether people had more good cholesterol, known as high density lipoprotein (HDL), or the bad form called low density lipoprotein (LDL). High levels of LDL can lead to narrowed arteries and heart disease, whereas HDL is protective. The new US research suggests the two kinds of cholesterol have the same effect on the brain as on the heart. Study leader professor Bruce Reed, from the University of California at Davis, said: ‘Unhealthy patterns of cholesterol could be directly causing the higher levels of amyloid known to contribute to Alzheimer’s, in the same way that such patterns promote heart disease.’ The discovery may explain the well-known link between raised cholesterol and an increased risk of Alzheimer's (stock picture) The scientists looked at 74 men and women aged 70 and over. All had brain scans using a tracer chemical that binds with amyloid plaques in order to highlight them on the images. Higher fasting levels of LDL and lower levels of HDL were both associated with more amyloid in the brain, according to the findings published online in the journal JAMA Neurology. Professor Reed said: ‘This study provides a reason to certainly continue cholesterol treatment in people who are developing memory loss, regardless of concerns regarding their cardiovascular health.’ Fellow author Dr Charles DeCarli said the discovery was a ‘wake-up call’ for those with a poor cholesterol balance. Dr Laura Phipps, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘The findings add to existing evidence that cholesterol could play a role in the Alzheimer’s disease process. ‘The best way to keep our brain healthy is to eat a balanced diet, maintain a healthy weight, not smoke, exercise regularly  and keep blood pressure and cholesterol  in check.’","Low density lipoprotein (LDL) has been associated with narrowing arteries .

"Facebook users in the U.S. will soon be able to see which of their friends are nearby using a new feature that the company launched on Thursday. The Nearby Friends feature must be turned on by the user, so people shouldn't expect to broadcast their location unknowingly. It will use your smartphone's GPS system to tell your Facebook friends you are nearby - provided they have the feature turned on as well. Rather than share your exact location, it will show only that you are nearby, say, within half a mile. The Nearby Friends feature uses your smartphone's GPS system to tell your Facebook friends you are nearby - provided that you both have the new feature turned on . If you like, you can manually share a more precise location with a specific friend you'd like to meet up with. Friends can see where you're located in a particular park, airport or city block. By default, your exact location will be shared for only an hour, although you can change this. Nearby Friends launches amid the growing popularity of location-based mobile dating apps such as Tinder and Hinge. But unlike those apps, Facebook's feature will let you meet up only with people who are already your friends. Facebook, whose motto has long been ‘move fast and break things,’ built a lot of precautions in this new tool as it tries to avoid privacy fiascos that often bubble up when it makes changes to its service. The new motto, ‘ship love,’ is evident in the cautious rollout of Nearby Friends, said Jules Polonetsky, director of the Future of Privacy Forum, an industry-backed think tank in Washington. He has advised Facebook on privacy issues, including the latest feature. Unless you manually share your location, as shown here, Nearby Friends will only show Facebook friends that you are in close proximity, say within half a mile . He believes Facebook is showing ‘a deeper appreciation that with a billion users, any change needs to be implemented in a way that doesn't surprise the audience.’ That's especially so when it comes to privacy, especially when it comes to location sharing. ‘Once you start bringing this to a mass audience, you need to be cautious,’ Polonetsky said, ‘so inadvertent oversharing is not possible.’ Nearby Friends also won't be available to users under 18, said Andrea Vaccari, a product manager at Facebook. He said the tool ‘makes it easy to join your friends in the real world.’ Of course, all the safeguards and slow rollout mean that most users won't have the feature available right away on Thursday but rather in the coming weeks and months. Initially it will go to people who are likely to appreciate it, Vaccari said, such as people who have ‘checked in’ to various restaurants, bars or other locations using Facebook. Rather than share your exact location, though, Nearby Friends will only show friends that you are in close proximity, say within half a mile . Unlike with other features, Facebook isn't forcing people to use Nearby Friends. Therefore, there is a possibility it won't catch on widely. Vaccari is optimistic that it will. Vaccari joined Facebook in 2012, when the company acquired Glancee, his startup service for meeting nearby people who have friends and interests in common. He has been working on the new feature since then. Facebook employees have been testing Nearby Friends, and Vaccari cites ways it has helped people get together: . Nearby Friends, Vaccari said, isn't for the five to 10 close friends whom you feel comfortable texting or calling up to hang out. Rather, he said, it's for the broader group of friends you enjoy spending time with but wouldn't necessarily call. Nearby Friends may provide that extra push. Users can limit whom they share their location with to smaller groups of friends. Users who sign up will be shown a short tutorial on how the feature works. Besides seeing friends who are nearby, users can also see which of their friends are traveling, and in general which friends are using the feature even if they are not nearby. Facebook says there are no current plans to draw advertising revenue from Nearby Friends. The company says it does not currently target ads to users based on where they happen to be at the moment, but uses their stated ‘current city’ and the location of their computer based on its numeric Internet Protocol address.","Nearby Friends will use your smartphone's GPS system to tell your Facebook friends you are nearby .

"Keith Gregory, pictured, claims he was abused in a children's home in the 1970s which Jimmy Savile used to visit . Keith Gregory was just 11-years-old when he was taken away from his parents in the 1970s to Bryn Estyn children's home in North Wales. Forty years later, he has revealed the horror inside the care home where gang rape, strip searches and vicious canings were a way of life - and where Jimmy Savile was a regular visitor. Mr Gregory claimed young boys used to lie in their beds and pretend to be asleep to avoid being taken to a flat and abused by staff and visitors - those that were taken came back sobbing. He knew of children being driven off . to a hotel where they would be gang raped and said he was beaten bloody . and subjected to humiliating strip searches. His revelations came as a man, named Ben, claimed boys at the home were molested for Savile's 'entertainment'. He . said he was raped repeatedly by the deputy head Peter Howarth - who was . later jailed for abusing boys - and he and other boys there would also . have their pyjama bottoms pulled down by Howarth so predatory paedophile . Savile could ogle them. He told The Sun: 'Savile just eyed up my privates and laughed. 'He thought it was funny, entertainment. This happened to a number of boys.' Then the Jim'll Fix It star made Ben sit . on his lap, 'then he started rubbing my leg. After that I went to bed . but he had other children brought up to him', said the victim. Scroll down for video . 'Paeodophile ring': Bryn Estyn, a children's care home in north Wales, where it was alleged Savile visited and children were molested for his 'entertainment' Peter Howarth, the former Deputy Head of the Bryn Estyn boys home was jailed in 1994 for ten years of abusing boys. He allegedly repeatedly raped Ben . He claims youngsters were sent to Mr Howarth's flat if they had been 'good boys' and Savile and his brother Johnny would sometimes be in the flat with the boys. Johnny, who died in 1998, was sacked as a recreation officer from a psychiatric hospital over claims he raped a former patient. Howarth was jailed in 1994 for ten years for abusing boys and he died in prison. The news comes after other victims named former ex-Tory MP Sir Peter Morrison - Margaret Thatcher's Parliamentary Private Secretary - was another regular visitor. He died in 1995. Ben, now 51, who does not want to use his full name, said he knew boys were taken off in smart-looking cars at night by visitors - and now realises one of the visitors was Morrison. Other victim Mr Gregory, now 55, who is now a county councillor in Wrexham, said: 'I know of 12 or 13 people off the top of my head who have killed themselves because of Bryn Estyn. 'On . my first day I was told to wait outside a staff member’s door, as he . would want to speak to me, so I waited and leaned against the wall. 'When . the member of staff saw that, he punched me in the stomach and shouted ""when I talk to you, you stand to attention"". 'I refused to apologise and . he dragged me in, tore my clothes off and caned me from the back of my . neck to the bottom of my feet. I was beaten bloody. Sir Peter Morrison, left, and Jimmy Savile, right, were both regular visitors to the children's home . 'They didn’t bring in a doctor. Everything was in-house, kept in secret within the walls of the home. 'They . would do searches after a visit, where they’d check you everywhere. It . made me hate visits from my family. It was very invasive - they would . check your penis and your bum. 'They . said it was because people could smuggle stuff in, but why didn’t they . just search the visitors? It was just an excuse to touch us. 'We had what was called ‘Borstal showers’, where a man would come in and watch us. 'One . teacher used to take you into the shower - which was like a cattle pen - . and turn them on alternatively freezing cold and boiling hot and force . you to run all around them, and he would whip you with a very fine stick . if you slowed down. 'I . tried to report this, and other things going on. There were beatings . and we were made to lean against walls, supporting ourselves with our . fingertips, for hours at a time. 'We were made to hold floor buffers - . big metal things - in the air for hours. It used to kill our hands and . arms. It was torture. I’d had enough.' Victim Mr Gregory spent almost three years at the home, pictured, and claimed he was subject to beatings . He said he reported the goings on to a care worker, who came in and set up a case conference with members of staff and members of the governing body, but 'they just started laughing at me'. He added: 'I became aware of people being taken from their beds at night. They made you feel powerless. 'There . was a flat on the grounds where we were told all the ‘good boys’ would . go to watch films. But they were given something to drink and then they . would abuse them. 'We . used to lie in our beds and pretend to be asleep and put our heads . under the sheets. We didn’t know who they were going to come for. You’d . hear the kids being put back into their beds crying their eyes out, . sobbing their eyes out. It sounds horrible, but you’d be glad when it wasn’t you. 'We knew of people visiting this flat. People turned up regularly. 'We also knew of kids being driven off to a hotel where they would be gang raped. That didn’t happen to me, but it was common knowledge. I knew it carried on.' He said there were youngsters whose parent's had died in horrific circumstances, and these were targeted more, because officials knew nothing could be done about. Mr Gregory, who spent almost three years at the home, said he knew some of the lads ended up as sex workers in London and Manchester after being thrown out and ending up on the streets. He said he later was visited by a former police officer who was investigating the Waterhouse Inquiry into child abuse in Wales. Alleged victim: Steven Messham accused a senior Tory politician from the Thatcher years of being involved in a widespread paedophile ring at the children's care home . He added: 'In the . inquiry there were a lot of people we were not allowed to name, all the . visitors (the report focused solely on Bryn Estyn staff and care . workers). If you wrote a name they would cross it out.' 'If . the authorities had looked into the names we supplied during the . Waterhouse inquiry, there’s a chance they could have caught more . paedophiles. Links could have been found. 'And that would have stopped another 12 years of innocent people being abused.' Earlier this week David Cameron ordered an independent investigation - likely to be led by a judge - into whether an inquiry ignored claims a senior Tory was involved in child abuse at the home. The Prime Minister said he would ask an independent figure to review the Waterhouse Inquiry into into abuse at the home in the 1970s and 1980s. It follows allegations that a senior unnamed Conservative was among those involved in abusing children but were not properly investigate at the time. It came after Mr Messham claimed in an interview with BBC’s Newsnight that he was taken out of Bryn Estyn and ‘sold’ to men for sexual abuse at a nearby hotel. Mr Messham said a senior Tory from the time - who was not Sir Peter Morrison and who was not named by the programme, had been involved. He said he was raped by a 'leading politician from the Thatcher years' and said the top Tory told him he'd be killed if he told police. Steven Messham revealed he was contacted by detectives following last Friday's programme which alleged he was raped 'more than a dozen times' by the man, described by Newsnight as a 'shadowy figure of high public standing'.

"Sergey Gordeev was a straight A pupil but shot dead his teacher and a police officer at his school . A student gunman has killed a policeman and teacher after holding more than 20 students hostage in a school near Moscow. The 'straight-A' 16 year old Sergey Gordeev sparked a nationwide security alert amid initial fears his attack at his school near Moscow was a terrorist incident linked to the Winter Olympics which open on Friday. He held 24 pupils hostage for almost an hour, and gunned down his teacher Andrei Kirillov, a married father with two small children, apparently in revenge for unusually poor marks in geography or biology. He also shot and killed married policeman Sergei Bushuev, 38, as he fired a volley of 11 shots at officers surrounding the school. Special forces troops were used to detain him after his father urged him to put down his weapon. The armed pupil and teacher previously had a conflict over his marks. This could have prevented the boy leaving school with a 'gold' medal, say sources at the school. A dramatic text message from a girl in Gordeev's class to her mother during the terrifying siege read: 'A machine gun. We are at school. He is shooting. 'Mama, aaaa-aa-aa. Save me! Its not a joke. Mama. Its awful. He's gone mad. We are hostages on floor 1, room 2.' Gordeev earlier brandished two rifles to as he overpowered the security man at School Number 263 on the outskirts of Moscow in what was initially seen as a terrorist attack. Soon it became clear it was a disgruntled pupil who had seized his father's guns to gain revenge on his mild-mannered teacher. The rest of the school was evacuated as police ordered the boy's father to call him on his mobile and demand he spares his classmates' lives. One teenage girl said: 'He shot the teacher in the stomach. Then he wanted to make sure that he was dead, so he fired another 'insurance' shot to the head.' The father - believed to be a law enforcement officer - then donned a bullet-proof jacket and negotiated with his son the lay down the guns and surrender. The move was seen as saving Russia from a school massacre. Scroll down for video . Terrified: A girl is hugged by her relative as she is evacuated from her school north of Moscow .

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday that screenings will start on Thursday at Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare, Newark's Liberty and Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta. Using infrared temperature guns, staff are checking for elevated temperatures among passengers whose journeys began or included a stop in one of the three African countries. Customs officials reported about 150 people travel daily from or through Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea to the U.S. Ebola patient Thomas Duncan traveled through two U.S. airports before he became contagious with the deadly virus . Nearly 95 percent of these travelers land first at one of those five airports. Those countries have seen most of the deaths from the outbreak, which has claimed more than 4,000 lives. However Republican Representative Tim Murphy said today during a congressional hearing on Ebola that the screening processes are flawed because people can mask symptoms with Ibuprofen or simply avoid the airports which have installed screenings. The screenings are being conducted by the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP), under direction of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CBP staff will identify passengers to screen by looking at trip information and checking passports. On Monday, CDC director Dr Tom Frieden reported that 91 passengers at JFK were pinpointed as having a risk of being infected with Ebola. No passenger was found to have a fever but five were sent for further evaluation. Ebola patient Thomas Duncan landed in Dallas on September 20 after traveling from his home in Monrovia, Liberia. He also traveled through Brussels Airport in Belgium and Washington-Dulles. The 42-year-old Liberian national was not contagious while he traveled. Mr Duncan died last Wednesday after being treated at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital.

"Jimmy Savile: The predatory paedophile had full access to patients at Broadmoor Hospital in Berkshire and intervened in a staff dispute . More than 500 people have reportedly been abused by Jimmy Savile, new figures show, as shocking evidence emerged of how the pervert talked his way into the heart of government. Details of his close relationship with . those in power came as research showed that his youngest victim was just two years old. The research by the NSPCC was commissioned by the BBC's . Panorama as part of an investigation into Savile's links to government. Whitehall officials referred to the predatory paedophile as ‘Doctor’ as they allowed him to intervene in a staff dispute at Broadmoor Hospital. The DJ and Top of the Pops presenter even gained direct access to then health minister Edwina Currie, who suspected Savile of trying to ‘blackmail’ staff after discovering some were illicitly sub-letting hospital housing and fiddling overtime. Confidential Department of Health documents have now revealed the full extent of Savile’s influence over the Berkshire hospital. He first became involved through the League of Friends charity in the late 1960s and was later given his own set of keys and a house in the grounds. In 1987 he was appointed by the Government to serve on the secure unit’s board and was paid £1,230 a month. Despite having no medical qualifications, the entertainer was referred to as ‘Dr Jimmy Savile, OBE, KCSG, LLD’ in official documents. He secured unchecked access to patients, despite concerns from staff about his behaviour. A year later, Mrs Currie made Savile the head of a task force addressing tensions between Broadmoor’s management and unions. A memo suggests his appointment was pushed by senior civil servants, who appear to have been ‘star-struck’ by him. It adds that Savile was going through the hospital’s main departments like a ‘dose of salts’ and that he would be instrumental in solving the row with medical staff. ‘I would say he was one hundred per cent sincere and committed in his desire to improve the management of Broadmoor and the lives of its patients,’ the memo says. ‘But I doubt he’ll let anyone stand in his way, and he clearly doesn’t mind how many people get trampled underfoot in the process.’ The entrance to Broadmoor, the high-security psychiatric hospital: In 1987 Savile was appointed by the Government to serve on the secure unit¿s board and was paid £1,230 a month . Panorama quoted Mrs Currie as saying Savile told her some staff were sub-letting hospital housing and fiddling overtime claims. He planned to use the information to pressure the union to end an overtime ban. Asked if this was blackmail, Mrs Currie said: ‘That sounds like blackmail to me. I made a note of it at the time, because I was so surprised. ‘If this meant that we broke the strike and could help the patients, then we had an issue of ends justifying means.’ The scale of Savile’s offending continues to grow and Thames Valley Police said it has received a further 16 complaints against him. Broadmoor Hospital is one of dozens under NHS investigation over the scandal, including Stoke Mandeville. Peter Watt, of the NSPCC, said: ‘There’s no doubt that Savile is one of the most, if not the most, prolific sex offender that we at the NSPCC have ever come across … somebody who at his most prolific lost no opportunity to identify vulnerable victims and abuse them.’ The West London Mental Health NHS Trust, which now runs Broadmoor, said its governance is ‘much more robust’ than at the time of Savile’s involvement.","New evidence also uncovered showing Savile's links to government .

"If you didn’t get the exam grades you were expecting, blame your parents. Scientists have revealed that the differences in GCSE scores are largely down to DNA. A study of more than 6,500 pairs of twins showed that variations in grades in English, maths and science papers could largely be explained by the mix of genes passed from parents to child. Scroll down for video . Scientists have found that over three fifths of a child’s intelligence is passed down from the parents – much more than previously believed.  Pupils taking their GCSEs are pictured . Some 62 per cent of the difference in scores across the group was down to DNA. The other 38 per cent can be explained by ‘environmental’ factors. This term covers a large range of things from upbringing to health and diet. But while genes – or nature – are more important than nurture, it is not all about intelligence. Many other factors, including personality and behaviour, are also influenced by our genes – and affect exam scores. Even what we think of our teachers, can to some degree be traced back to our genes, the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (MUST CREDIT) reports. The researchers, from King’s College London, studied more than 6,500 pairs of twins. The teenagers were given intelligence tests and quizzed on a whole range of subjects including personality traits, behaviour and their self-belief in their ability. This science behind this is complicated but it allows the researchers to work out how important genes are compared to other factors . They were also asked about their attitude towards school and their teachers and whether they perceived their homelife to be chaotic and if their parents gave them enough support with their schoolwork. The researchers then compared the answers of identical twins, who share all their DNA, with those of the non-identical twins, who are no more genetically alike than other siblings. The science behind this is complicated but it allows the researchers to work out how important genes are compared to other factors. They also factored in the children’s GCSE results. The analysis showed genes to be involved in everything from intelligence, to self-belief and a child’s perception of its home and school-life. And that all of these things counted towards exam scores. Researcher Eva Krapohl, from the Institute of Psychiatry at King’s, says: ‘Previous work has already established that educational achievement is heritable. ‘In this study, we wanted to find out why that is. What our study shows is that the heritability of educational achievement is much more than just intelligence – it is the combination of many traits which are all heritable to different extents. ‘It is important to point out that heritability does not mean that anything is set in stone. It simply means that children differ in how easy and enjoyable they find learning and that much of these differences are influenced by genetics.’ The researchers say children may benefit from more individualised learning – with lessons more tailored towards their needs. It may be that it is also possible to improve exam results by trying to boost a child’s self-confidence or change their perception of how well they are taught or how supportive their parents are. However, they say that the finding that nature is more important than nurture doesn’t mean that teachers aren’t important. For instance, a child would never learn to read without being taught the basics. Researcher Kaili Rimfeld, said: ‘ Finding that educational achievement is heritable certainly does not mean that teachers, parents or schools aren’t important.’ They also say that teenagers shouldn’t use the finding that exam success is largely in their genes to give up. This is because the 62 per cent figure is for differences between children’s scores across the population as a whole. Where any one child is concerned, genes may have a much smaller – or a much larger – influence on how well they do.","Over three fifths of a child’s intelligence is passed down from the parents, according to a study by Kings College London .

"The British lover of Google co-founder Sergey Brin started her affair with him after befriending his wife, it emerged yesterday. Amanda Rosenberg, 27, regularly visited the couple’s house to discuss the Google Glass project she was working on. She wanted Anne Wojcicki’s advice on pitching the product to mothers and the two soon become friends. Scroll down for video . Amanda Rosenberg (left), with Diane von Furstenberg and Sergey Brin at New York fashion week. The British lover of Google co-founder Sergey Brin started her affair with him after befriending his wife, it emerged yesterday . Amanda Rosenberg, 27, regularly visited the couple's house to discuss the Google Glass project she was working on. She wanted Anne Wojcicki's (right) advice on pitching the product to mothers and the two soon become friends . But a bust-up followed when Miss Wojcicki, 40, found a trail of incriminating emails between Miss Rosenberg and Mr Brin, her husband of six years. The tycoon, who is worth £19billion, moved out of the £4million family home last April leaving behind Miss Wojcicki and their two children. The revelations in Vanity Fair seem to back up colleagues’ views of Miss Rosenberg, who went to Marlborough College with Kate Middleton, as someone who was ‘sleeping her way to the top’. A graduate of Leeds University, she was seen as an attention-seeker at Google’s California headquarters, quickly becoming marketing manager for Google Glass. She already had a high-flying boyfriend at the firm – Hugo Barra – when she started her romance with Mr Brin. According to Vanity Fair she was dating both men when Miss Wojcicki came across the ‘alarming’ emails. She allegedly ditched Mr Barra a month later – without saying there was another man – when he asked her to come with him to Hong Kong where he had a new job. Although Google officially tolerates staff relationships, saying they can be creative, Mr Brin having an affair with an underling was seen as inappropriate, according to a source at the company. Other woman: Amanda Rosenberg works as a marketer for Google Glass, where she met Brin . Larry Page, who had known Miss Wojcicki since they were students and set up Google with Mr Brin in her sister’s garage, was ‘insanely upset by this whole situation and wasn’t talking to Sergey’, said the company insider. Mr Brin, 40, and Miss Rosenberg still work together at Google’s special projects division and remain romantically involved. Sources say their relationship can be fiery. Miss Rosenberg was reportedly angry when Mr Brin spent last Halloween with Miss Wojcicki and their children. ‘The two of them have horrible, screaming fights,’ said a friend. ‘It’s part of the passion, the chemical attraction.’ Miss Rosenberg recently revealed online that she is being treated for clinical depression, describing herself as a ‘ticking timebomb’. News of her affair with Mr Brin broke in September. According to posts on her blog, she was born in Hong Kong and raised in London. Together: Brin is pictured in September 2012 with his wife, businesswoman Anne Wojcicki, months before they split. The couple were married for six years and have two children together . She refers to herself as a ‘Chinese Jew’ – a ‘Chew’. Her mother is from Hong Kong, her father is British. She boarded at £31,000-a-year Marlborough College with Kate and Pippa Middleton and Princess Eugenie, and has worked for Google since she graduated with a communications degree. She was based in London, before moving to San Francisco to work at Google’s nerve centre last year. Her social networking pages are filled with photographs of her modelling Google Glass, and one shows her meeting rapper Tinie Tempah. Miss Wojcicki, who is single, does not want a divorce – apparently because she has enough money and wants to avoid fighting over her husband’s fortune. She runs a genetics testing company. Google Glass, a wearable computer in the shape of a pair of spectacles, has alarmed privacy campaigners because it can film what the user sees.","Amanda Rosenberg, 27, visited couple’s house to discuss Google Glass .

"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's official vehicles were spotted breaking several traffic laws on Thursday, just two days after he laid out a sweeping traffic safety plan that included harsh restrictions on reckless drivers. De Blasio was in the front passenger seat of the lead SUV of a two-vehicle caravan that was captured on video speeding, running through a pair of stop signs and not signaling when changing lanes. The footage, which aired on WCBS-TV, was taken as de Blasio returned to City Hall after a news conference in Queens. The mayor's press office deferred to the police department for particulars of the incident because a member of the NYPD was behind the wheel of de Blasio's SUV. Scroll down for video . Safety first: Mayor Bill de Blasio speaks at a press conference on February 18 about his traffic safety plan . Unsafe: The two black SUV's that make up Mayor de Blasio's caravan (center) were recorded violating at least four traffic laws . But de Blasio's press secretary said that 'public safety is everyone's responsibility.' 'With that in mind, Mayor de Blasio is firmly committed to the traffic safety policies outlined this week,' Walzak said in a statement that did not include an apology or admission of wrongdoing. The NYPD did not address the specifics of Thursday's incident in a statement, but said members of the security detail 'receive specialized training in driving based on maintaining security as well as safety.' The statement spoke broadly about acceptable tactics used to keep vehicles together and said the handling of vehicles transporting any 'protectee' is determined by police personnel based on 'protection and professional judgment.' The footage shows de Blasio's vehicles starting their journey in a quiet residential stretch of Maspeth, where they mayor had just held a news conference discussing his administration's plans to combat potholes. The two bulky, black vehicles did not stop at two stop signs in the neighborhood. Later, the CBS camera — which was in a car that followed the mayor's motorcade - showed de Blasio going 40 mph in an area where the speed limit was 30 mph, and then nearly 60 mph in a 45 mph zone. Need for speed: The cars were spotted doing 60mph in a 45mph zone . Ignored signs: The two cars breezed straight through stop signs . Full of holes: De Blasio filled in some potholes after giving a speech in Malspeth about road safety . The SUVs were also shown changing lanes without using their directional signals. The total number of violations witnessed by the news crew would yield a suspended license, according to the CBS report. It was not clear from the footage if de Blasio was aware of the traffic infractions. The mayor's cars are typically driven by members of de Blasio's security detail, which is made up of NYPD detectives. Security protocols suggest that de Blasio sit in the backseat because the SUV's side windows, unlike the front windshield, are comprised of bulletproof-glass. But de Blasio, who is 6-foot-5, frequently sits in the front, where he has more room to stretch out. Just two days earlier, de Blasio released his 'Vision Zero' traffic safety plan which aims to eliminate all traffic fatalities. The plan proposed reducing the citywide speed limit to 25 mph, detailing more NYPD officers to enforce speeding violations and toughening penalties for on speeding drivers. 'We hope that every time someone reads one of your stories, they're also asking themselves the question, are they handling their vehicle as responsibly as they could?' the mayor told reporters at the Tuesday press conference. 'The likelihood of a fatal crash and . this statistic is very powerful,' he also said at the traffic event. 'The likelihood of a fatal crash drops significantly for speeds below 30 . mph. If we get those speeds down, it will be the difference between . losing a life and saving a life.' Brian . Zumhagen, communications manager for the transit advocacy group . Transportation Alternatives, said in a statement that 'no driver is . above traffic law.' Second time: The cars drive through stop signs without stopping, again . Switching lanes: The footage shows the cars changing lanes without indicating . 'We look forward to other city officials leading by example as well,' said Zumhagen, who suggested that it could be a teaching moment for all drivers. The incident also comes just more than a week after de Blasio drew criticism for calling the NYPD about the arrest of a political ally. Bishop Orlando Findlayter was pulled over for a traffic violation and then arrested on an outstanding warrant stemming from an immigration rally last year. The bishop was later released on a desk appearance ticket instead of spending a night in jail. De Blasio said he did not ask for his release and denied any improper behavior, saying he was just asking for information about the incident. De Blasio is not the first mayor whose official vehicles were caught speeding. In 1998, The Daily News observed Rudolph Giuliani's car going more than 20 mph over the speed limit while driving on Staten Island. Giuliani denied that he broke the law.","New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's mayoral motorcade was recorded breaking at least four traffic laws .

However, the museum's president, Christoph Schaeublin, told reporters in Berlin today that it would only accept the collection on the grounds that efforts are made to return any art looted from Jewish collectors to its rightful owners. Before his death, Gurlitt reached a deal with the German government to check whether any of the works were indeed looted. Authorities say that deal is binding on any heirs. One of Gurlitt's cousins has also filed claim, which a Munich court said today would have to be sorted out before the collection goes anywhere. A number of works, including those by Pablo Picasso and Marc Chagall, were discovered during the probe, launched after Gurlitt was stopped by customs officers carrying €9,000 (£7,500) in a briefcase on a train heading out of Switzerland. Nazi heir: Cornelius Gurlitt (left) inherited the vast collection from his father, Hildebrand (right), who was commissioned to obtain artworks on behalf of Adolf Hitler and bought works confiscated from Jewish families . Since he was unemployed and with no obvious means of income, prosecutors obtained a warrant to search his small flat in Schwabing, Munich, upon which police found more than a thousand pieces of art, with an estimated value of up to €50 million. Then, in July 2014 two sculptures were discovered in Gurlitt's home that experts believe could be works by Rodin and Degas. And in September a painting by Claude Monet was discovered in a suitcase belonging to Gurlitt. During World War II, the Nazis went on a looting rampage, destroying and stealing an estimated 750,000 pieces of European art. The years between 1933 and 1945 are a black hole in the art community, with thousands of pieces of art changing hands and going missing. Much of it has never been found. The Nazis took so-called degenerate art - mostly avant-garde modern art, such as expressionism - from museums and public institutions because it was deemed a corrupting influence on the German people. Masterpiece: This painting by German artist Max Liebermann, called 'Two Horsemen at the Beach', has been valued at between  £6 and 8 million . Unknown: An artwork by the German artist Otto Dix (left) and a formerly unknown picture by German artist Ernst Ludwig Kirchner entitled ""Melancholic Girl' (right) are also part of the hoard . Stolen: Hans von Marees’ Die Labung masterpiece  once belonged to the Jewish industrialist Max Silberberg, who was forced to sell it by the Nazis. Mr Silberberg and his wife were later both murdered at Auschwitz . Hitler emplyed a team of four art dealers - including Hildebrand Gurlitt - to buy looted art for a pittance from Jewish collectors who were forced to sell under duress during the Third Reich. The dealers, who answered directly to Hitler's propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels, then marketed the pillaged art to buyers abroad, funnelling profits into the Nazi war chest. After the war, a vast portion of this loot was discovered by the 'Monuments Men' section of the US Army, tasked with finding the stolen art of Europe and restoring it to its rightful owners. The Monuments Men moved into the Bavarian village of Aschbach in Bavaria in April 1945 and arrested the local Nazi party leader Baron Gerhard von Pölnitz who lived in the local castle along with art dealer Karl Haberstock and Hildebrand Gurlitt. A note from a Monuments Men team member found in an archive detailed the astonishing artworks found in the castle: 'Rooms containing paintings, tapestries, statues, valuable furniture and documents from the belongings of two notorious German art dealers were found in the castle.' The flat: Since Gurlitt was unemployed and with no obvious means of income, prosecutors obtained a warrant to search his small flat in Schwabing, Munich, upon which police found more than a thousand pieces of art, with an estimated value of up to €50 million . Towards the end of the WWII, soldiers began stumbling upon treasure troves of stolen art, including this one in a salt mine at Merkers, Germany, which is being inspected by American General Dwight D Eisenhower . Another reads: 'A large room on the upper floor with 34 boxes, two packages containing carpets, eight packages of books … one room on the ground floor containing an additional 13 boxes owned by Mr Gurlitt. Most of these boxes contained pictures and drawings.' Gurlitt, they wrote, was 'an art collector from Hamburg with connections within high-level Nazi circles. He acted on behalf of other Nazi officials and made many trips to France, from where he brought home art collections. There is reason to believe that these private art collections consist of looted art from other countries.' Gurlitt was described as an 'art dealer to the Führer.' But during interrogation, Gurlitt claimed all the art he still possessed had been destroyed in his home during the allied bombing of Dresden. It was a lie he took to his grave in 1956. Cornelius Gurlitt, who would go on to inherit many of these treasures, was 12 when his father was arrested and living in the castle. Hildebrand was quizzed by the Americans in June 1945 and they noted he seemed 'extremely nervous' as if he was not telling them the truth. Still missing: Many of the works, hidden across Europe, are still missing .

The MFAA involved around men and women from 17 nations. It was led by the Americans, but Britain provided the second-largest group of volunteers.

"The hole in the ozone layer above the Antarctic was this year the second smallest it has been in two decades - but still covered an area roughly the size of North America, experts said today. The average size of the Earth's protective shield was 6.9 million square miles (17.9 million square kilometers), according to satellite measurements by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and U.S. space agency Nasa. Researchers say warm temperatures high in the atmosphere helped preserve it. Scroll down for video . A false-color view of total ozone over the Antarctic pole. The purple and blue colors are where there is the least ozone, and the yellows and reds are where there is more ozone.  The average area covered by the Antarctic ozone hole this year was the second smallest in the last 20 years . Nasa and NOAA have been monitoring the ozone layer on the ground and . with a variety of instruments on satellites and balloons since the . 1970s. Long-term ozone monitoring instruments have included TOMS, . SBUV/2, Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment series of instruments, . the Microwave Limb Sounder, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument, and the . OMPS instrument on the Suomi NPP satellite. 'It happened to be a bit warmer this year high in the atmosphere above Antarctica, and that meant we didn't see quite as much ozone depletion as we saw last year, when it was colder,' said Jim Butler of NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory in the Colorado city of Boulder. The Antarctic ozone hole, which forms in September and October, reached its largest size for the season -- 8.2 million square miles, roughly the combined area of the United States, Mexico and Canada -- on September 22, NOAA said. In comparison, the largest ozone hole recorded to date was one of 11.5 million square miles in the year 2000. The ozone layer, which helps protect the Earth from potentially dangerous ultraviolet rays that can cause skin cancer and cataracts, began developing holes on an annual basis starting in the 1980s due to chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. CFCs, once commonly used in refrigerators and aerosol cans, are now almost non-existent thanks to an international treaty signed on September 16, 1987, amid global concern over widening holes in the ozone layer. Still, it could take another decade before scientists detect early signs that the ozone over the Antarctic is returning, NOAA said. The ozone hole reached its maximum . size on September 22, covering 8.2 million square miles (21.2 million square . kilometers), or the area of the United States, Canada and Mexico . combined. The average size of the 2012 ozone hole was 6.9 million square miles (17.9 million square kilometers). The September 6, 2000 ozone hole was the largest on record at 11.5 million square miles (29.9 million square kilometers). The ozone layer above Antarctica likely will not return to its early 1980s state until about 2060, according to NASA scientist Paul Newman. 'The ozone hole mainly is caused by chlorine from human-produced . chemicals, and these chlorine levels are still sizable in the Antarctic . stratosphere,' he said. 'Natural fluctuations in . weather patterns resulted in warmer stratospheric temperatures this . year. 'These temperatures led to a smaller ozone hole.' This year also showed a change in the concentration of ozone over the . Antarctic. The minimum value of total ozone in the ozone hole was the . second highest level in two decades. The ozone layer acts as Earth's natural shield against ultraviolet radiation, which can cause skin cancer. The September 6th 2000 image that shows the largest ozone hole ever seen over Antartica . The ozone hole phenomenon began making a yearly appearance in the early 1980s. The Antarctic ozone layer will likely not return to its early 1980s state until about 2065, Newman said. The lengthy recovery is because of the long lifetimes of ozone-depleting substances in the atmosphere. Overall atmospheric ozone no longer is declining as concentrations of ozone-depleting substances decrease. The decrease is the result of an international agreement regulating the production of certain chemicals.","The average size of the Earth's protective shield was 6.9 million square miles (17.9 million square kilometers)

"An unmarried woman yesterday won a share of her ex-boyfriend’s money after they split. Catherine Blackburn will get £28,500 from the man with whom she shared a house in a landmark court ruling for cohabiting couples. Appeal Court judges said the 54-year-old deserved support because she had been promised a ‘home for life’ by insurance manager David Southwell – who then left her homeless by changing the locks after they broke up. David Southwell and his ex-girlfriend Catherine Blackburn pictured on holiday before they split up. He has been ordered to pay Miss Blackburn £28,500 in a landmark legal decision for unmarried couples . Even though he paid for the mortgage on the £240,000 home, justices said she was ‘effectively a wife’ and sacrificed the value of her own property when she moved in with him. The case comes as senior judges are calling for new legal rights for cohabitees who can be left without a home and out of pocket when a relationship ends. But it leaves men who live with partners facing the prospect of having to pay compensation to a girlfriend if they break up. Yesterday Mr Southwell, 55, called the ruling ‘ridiculous’, claiming he had single-handedly funded their lifestyle. ‘I paid for virtually everything and she did not put a penny towards the house,’ he said. ‘I paid her mobile phone bill. I bought her a brand new car. ‘She went to university because she wanted to study to be a speech and language therapist. She doubled her salary as a result of the degree. Whilst she was at university I was putting £500 a month into her account. The couple lived in a £240,000 house for which Mr Southwell paid the mortgage however the court heard Miss Blackburn was 'effectively a wife' Mr Southwell described the case as 'ridiculous' and claimed it could 'open the floodgates' to other unmarried couples . Lawyers have pressed for two decades for cohabitees to have the same rights as married couples. The Law Commission says a childless couple should be bound to support each other after living together for five years. But critics say it would unfairly bind people together and prove costly for those involved in litigation – and governments have so far declined to act. James Brown of JMW Solicitors described yesterday’s judgment as a ‘significant development’. He added: ‘What is important about this ruling is not just that it might make it easier to succeed with this kind of claim in the future. ‘It might act as something of a temptation for cohabitees who had possibly not considered legal redress once their relationships break down.’ It could also give couples ‘a reason to think again’ about living together, added Mr Brown. ‘It has been ridiculous. The case has now cost me more than £100,000, including my costs, just to give her £28,500.’ He added: ‘I think it is a wake-up call for all cohabiting couples. It could open the floodgates.’ The pair met in 2000 and decided to move in together two years later. They made a joint decision, the courts decided, to buy a house in Droitwich with £140,000 of Mr Southwell’s money and a £100,000 mortgage in his name, which he paid. Judges heard that Mr Southwell did not want to marry because he did not want to have to pay maintenance in the event of a break-up. Instead, the court found, he assured Miss Blackburn and her two daughters from an earlier marriage they would always have a home – although he insists that meant as long as the relationship lasted. Lord Justice Tomlinson, sitting with Lord Justice McFarlane and Lady Justice Macur, said Miss Blackburn enjoyed benefits including a ‘rent-free’ home. She was also given ‘considerable’ help to qualify as a speech and language therapist that enhanced her earning ability’, the judges said. The case was heard at the Court of Appeal at the Royal Courts of Justice in London (pictured) However, Mr Southwell benefited from the support of someone who was ‘effectively a wife’ and who ‘shouldered the major housekeeping activities’, the court heard. The relationship came to a ‘messy’ end in 2012 and Miss Blackburn and her daughters found themselves homeless after the locks of the house were changed, it was said. Appeal judges awarded Miss Blackburn a payout under the property law principle of promissory estoppel, which covers promises to someone that they can use a property. They said she should be compensated for the £15,000 she had put into a rented home she gave up to move in with Mr Southwell, together with the £5,000 she had contributed to the Droitwich house, together with an allowance for inflation. Miss Blackburn last night said she hoped the landmark court ruling would help other women in her position. She said: ‘I paid some utility bills, I paid for food, I paid for items for the house.’ Of Mr Southwell’s decision to put the house in his name, she added: ‘I trusted him and believed everything he said, thinking I would be secure. ‘He seemed very genuine. He was somebody I was very much in love with.’","David Southwell has been ordered to pay Catherine Blackburn thousands .

"Bournemouth striker Tokelo Rantie missed a costly penalty as South Africa surrendered a lead against much-fancied Algeria in Mongomo. Moments after Thuso Phala had put Bafana Bafana into the lead, Rantie was brought down in the box by Aissa Mandie, but blasted his spot-kick against the bar.

Slimani rounded off the win five minutes from time when his shot from the edge of the box slipped through the dive of Keet. It was harsh on South Africa, who had defended manfully, and scored an excellent goal of their own. Phala rounded off a superb passing move, full of first time flicks and clever back-heels, with an emphatic finish. And moments later the midfielder turned provider, a blistering run down the right ending with a ball inside for Rantie, who was brought down by Aissa Mandi inside the box, . But the miss sparked Algeria into life, and there were signs of danger when Slimani was denied by a brilliant save from Darren Keet in the South Africa goal. The keeper did well to first save from Slimani’s backheel and then tipped the striker’s rebound onto the bar and away. Sibusiso Vilakazi (right) challenges Algeria's Aissa Mandi during the Group C Africa Cup of Nations match . South Africa's coach Ephraim Mashaba gestures to his players during Monday's match . But he could do nothing about either of the goals, as Africa’s highest ranked side started their campaign with a win. Many people’s pre-tournament favourites, Algeria had started the brighter, controlling the game and dominating possession, but created very little in the way of clear-cut chances. Tottenham’s Nabil Bentaleb produced a good header from a free kick early on, bringing a save from Darren Keet in the South African goal, but for the most part the Desert Foxes were limited to shots from range. Ryad Mahrez, the Leicester City winger, had very little impact, and was withdrawn after an hour. South Africa meanwhile were happy to get men behind the ball, utilizing the pace of Bournemouth striker Rantie on the break. South Africa defender Rivaldo Coetzee leaves the pitch on a stretcher after getting injured . And it was Bofana Bofana who had the better chances in a low-key first half, Doncaster Rovers’ Dean Furman seeing his rocket strike tipped onto the crossbar, before midfielder Andile Jali had a close-range shot saved following an intricate passing move. Rantie, despite very little support, was a constant menace for South Africa, getting in behind the Algerian defence on several occasions, but never quite able to find the final touch. But in the end his energetic display will be forgotten next to the missed penalty that so dented his side’s chances of progression.","Algeria beat South Africa 3-1 ending first round of games top of Group C .

You know the fireman said he put the window through? I said he f*****g didn’t - I did. We’ve got nothing to worry - just stick by what we’ve said.’ The Philpotts were convicted by jurors at Nottingham Crown Court of the unlawful killing of the six children on May 11, 2012. A third defendant, Paul Mosley, was also found guilty of manslaughter. During the trial, the court heard that the six children - Jade Philpott, 10, and her brothers John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, Jayden, five, and Duwayne, 13 - all died as a result of the petrol-fuelled blaze.

"The encounter with ‘Glint Eastwood’ was meant to be a light-hearted photo opportunity. But Connor May, eight, burst into tears moments after this picture was taken. Street entertainer Glint – dressed as a cowboy and covered head to toe in golden spray paint – handcuffed the youngster and pointed a toy gun at his head. The incident left the boy shocked and upset, his mother Laura said yesterday. She called for such entertainers to be licensed. An uncomfortable-looking Connor May is harnessed to the human statue's belt, with the golden gun pointing at his temple . Connor had been enjoying a day out at a Christmas market with his grandmother, Helen May. When Connor dropped £1 in the human statue’s cash collection, Glint ‘sprang to life’ and cuffed Connor to his belt buckle. He then pressed his golden gun against Connor’s temple as Mrs May, 59, took the picture. But, following the incident in Birmingham on Saturday, the schoolboy burst into tears. Connor with his mum Laura May, from Malvern, Worcestershire, who said she was 'horrified' by the incident at Birmingham city centre's Christmas market . He has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and suffers panic attacks. His mother, 31, from Malvern, Worcestershire, who was not present, described the photo as ‘sinister’. ‘I was absolutely horrified,’ she said. ‘Connor was being restrained. Who knows who this man could be? He’s just allowed to stand there with an imitation gun and no-one cares because he’s painted gold.’ She said her son was ‘really shaken up’ and had had flashbacks since. Helen May, also of Malvern, said: ‘My grandson tried to pretend he was having fun, but he sensed people were looking on horrified. He’s been badly affected by this.’ Birmingham Council said an official would speak to the performer about the incident. Glint, meanwhile, has apparently left town.","Connor May was  harnessed to performer and  toy gun held to his temple .

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez has been impressed with the way Manchester City have coped without some of their biggest stars while his side have been crippled by a long injury list. Strikers Sergio Aguero, scorer of 19 goals in 23 matches, and Edin Dzeko have not played for over a month, during which time City have won seven and drawn one. Captain Vincent Kompany has been missing for all but one of the matches in that run, but City have still put together a sequence which has seen them draw level with Chelsea at the top of the table. Everton manager Roberto Martinez has been impressed with Manchester City's resilience in recent weeks . City have been without striker Sergio Aguero for the last month after he picked up an injury against the Toffees . The clubs' budgets are vastly different, of course, but by contrast Everton have won just once in 10 games with the likes of goalkeeper Tim Howard, defenders Sylvain Distin, Tony Hibbert, Leighton Baines, John Stones, midfielders Steven Pienaar, Darron Gibson, James McCarthy and Leon Osman all missing for some or all of that spell. Those absences, particularly at the back, have contributed to Everton having a defensive record which is beaten only by QPR in terms of goals conceded. 'Injuries always play a part. I don't think it helps when you have to change things around, especially in certain positions,' Martinez said, ahead of the visit of the defending champions. 'You want to have a consistent back line with the same understanding and partnerships, and that has cost us. Manager Manuel Pellegrini (pictured on Thursday night) will be pleased they've kept the pace regardless . Captain Vincent Kompany has been missing for all but one of the matches in a decent run of form . 'There are certain players you can replace better than others and it is not ideal when you cannot find solutions. 'But in the same way it has been a good period to find out about our characters and I still feel this squad is strong enough to be very successful. 'It is the time to get a couple of positive results and see how far we can go this season because I do feel the group is stronger than ever and more focused than even at the start of the season. 'Manchester City are playing with real swagger and arrogance and they don't need many chances to punish you. 'I have been very impressed in the way they have coped with big players missing. 'It is always a sign of a good unit when you have probably the most effective players on the pitch missing and you can carry on finding a way to score goals and win games. Aguero has been in impressive form when fit - scoring 19 goals in 23 matches this campaign . Bosnian Edin Dzeko hasn't been fit since the Champions League win away at Roma on December 10 . 'It is not easy to lose strikers like Dzeko and Aguero for such a long time and go on such an unbelievable run. 'They have strong characters who can find solutions. Once they get the players back, the team could get a second boost in what is left of the season.' Everton drew with West Ham in the FA Cup in midweek but they are looking to avoid a fifth successive Barclays Premier League defeat on Saturday. This is their worst sequence in the league since they lost six on the trot in 2005, and the visit of City presents a real threat to the confidence gained from the West Ham result. Frank Lampard has pitched in with important goals in the absence of Manchester City's main attacking threats . 'It is one of those games where we need to take responsibility,' Martinez said. 'We are at home, we have had four really bad results and we need to put that right. 'It doesn't matter which opposition you are playing against you need to look at what we can do and we are looking to carry on the signs we showed against West Ham. 'When you play a team like City, you know you have to be at your very best because they will always take their opportunities, but the way we performed at the Etihad (in a 1-0 defeat) deserved more than we got and I think we are ready to face a team like City. 'But the margin of error against these sides is very small.'","Manchester City have been without Sergio Aguero for a month .

"It is maths as youʼve never seen in before - transformed into works of art. Created by designers Cristian Ilies Vasile and Martin Krzywinski, the stunning images show the number π, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, which is approximately equal to 3.14159. However, the pair decided to transform the number into colourful pieces of art. Numerology is bogus, but art based on numbers has a beautiful random quality, according to the duo. This  piece of art shows the progression and transition for the first 1,000 digits of pi . Designers Cristian Ilies Vasile and Martin Krzywinski have transformed mathematical numbers, theories and symbols into detailed works of art. Left: Progression and transition for the first 10,000 digits of the accidental similarity number.Right: Progression and transition for the first 10,000 digits of φ . First Cristian Ilies Vasile had the idea of connecting each digit of π to its successive digit with links to the position of the numerically corresponding segments, creating beautiful images similar to the Spirograph toys popular in the 1970s. Martin Krzywinski added to Vasileʼs visualisation ʽby showing the transition probabilities for each digit across bins of 10 digitsʼ to create a whole series of images using 1,000 and 2,000 digits of pi for their data. ʽArt based on numbers has a beautiful random quality,' said Krzywinski, who is selling prints of the images via his website. First Cristian Ilies Vasile had the idea of connecting each digit of pi to its successive digit with links to the position of the numerically corresponding segments, creating beautiful images similar to the Spirograph toys popular in the 1970s.  This design is based on transition paths for the first 10,000 digits of pi . Here, dots are used to represent the adjacency between digits showing the progression and transition for the first 10,000 digits of pi . He also created a series of images showing ʽbubblesʼ outside the main image to signify where particular number sequences occur. ʽThe bubbles that count the number of links quickly draw attention to regions where specific digit pairs are frequent,ʼ he explained. ʽFor instance, there is a large bubble on the 9 segment due to the sequence '999999' sequence at decimal place 762.ʼ . The team also manipulated the digits to create spiral patterns made up of large dots as part of their series of pictures. The digits of pi are, as far as we know, randomly distributed. Art based on its digits therefore as a quality that is influenced by this random distribution. To provide a reference of what such a random pattern looks like, below are 16 random numbers represented in the same way. They're all different, yet strangely the same, the designers said .

"Former home secretary Alan Johnson has branded union leaders 'delusional' after they attacked Ed Miliband over his leadership of the Labour Party. The MP backed the beleaguered Labour leader after senior figures vented their anger over his decision to embrace austerity measures, and suggested that financial support for the party could be withdrawn. Unions affiliated to Labour have been fuming since shadow chancellor Ed Balls said that he would not promise to reverse Government cuts or lift the 1 per cent pay cap on public sector workers. Support: Alan Johnson (right) has hit out at 'delusional' union bosses who have criticised Ed Miliband's leadership of the Labour Party . Unite leader Len McCluskey went public with his anger in a coded warning of a leadership coup, saying that Mr Miliband was setting Labour on course for electoral 'disaster' and undermining his own leadership. And GMB general secretary Paul Kenny wrote to the union’s senior officials saying that Mr Balls’s speech could have a 'profound impact' on its relationship with the Labour Party. But Mr Johnson - himself an ex-union general secretary - said Mr McCluskey’s intervention reminded him of a culture 'the movement had escaped'. 'According to Len, by trying to position Labour as a credible alternative to the coalition, Ed Miliband has set it on a path to ""destruction"",' the MP wrote in the Guardian. 'Stuck in a familiar groove, Len goes on to suggest that all the ills that he claims are befalling Labour are because of actions of so called ""Blairites"" - those terrible people who introduced the minimum wage and increased the number, the stature and indeed the pay of public sector workers across the country.' He went on: 'Ed has stated a simple fact; that a Labour government will not be able to reverse as many of the cuts the current government is making unless it can show where the money is to come from. Poll warning: Len McCluskey, left, accused the Labour Party of disenfranchising their own supporters after Ed Balls said in a speech that he backed the Coalition's stance on public sector pay freezes . 'The difference between Len’s . position and Ed’s is that Len believes a political party can win an . election on a platform of promising no cuts, no job losses and continued . levels of public expenditure. That is the policy of the delusional left . who will never again win the public’s trust. 'The trade union movement lost its . way in the late 1970s when it opposed the minimum wage and supported the . closed shop. It needs to recognise that Ed Miliband’s vision of a . better future requires a change of mindset throughout the party if we’re . to spend one term in opposition rather than a decade.' The GMB, another of Labour’s biggest . donors, warned that Mr Miliband’s decision to accept the Government’s . one per cent pay cap was a ‘serious  mistake’ and also indicated it . could cut its traditional affiliation with his party. The . heads of Unite, the GMB, the PCS and the RMT joined forces to attack . the Labour leader after Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls told a conference at . the weekend the party was backing the pay cap for public sector workers . and would retain it if returned to power. Mr McCluskey said last night that there would be ‘real serious long-term implications’ if Labour is ‘dragged to the Right’. He . added: ‘If Labour loses the next election I think there will be a . serious rethink by a number of unions, including Unite, about our future . relationships and the constitution of our political alliances.’ Earlier . he complained the change of heart on a public sector pay freeze was ‘a . victory for discredited Blairism at the expense of the party’s core . supporters’. Mr McCluskey added: ‘It challenges the course Ed Miliband . has set for the party, and perhaps his leadership itself.’ GMB . general secretary Paul Kenny warned that Labour’s decision could have a . ‘profound impact’. He said: ‘It is time for careful consideration on . the long-term implications this new stance by the party has on GMB . affiliation. This is the most serious mistake they could have made.’ Unions . are responsible for 92 per cent of Labour funds. Since the election, . Unite has given Labour £7.6million, while the GMB has handed over . £2.6million. Last night Mr Balls admitted: ‘I don’t want the GMB or . Unite to disaffiliate from the Labour Party. Of course I take the threat . seriously.’ Mark Serwotka, the leader of the PCS, . said Labour’s new stance ‘guarantees’ that Labour will lose the next . election ‘and lose badly.’ RMT boss Bob Crow added: ‘Ed Miliband has . jammed Labour’s self-destruct mission into top gear. This betrayal of . millions of Labour’s core supporters sets him and his party on a one-way . ticket to oblivion.’ But Mr Miliband hit back, saying: ‘I am not going . to change my policy in the face of threats. I will not back down. I . stand up for what’s right and if people don’t like it, that’s tough.’ Mr Miliband may have won the . leadership battle with his brother David, but it seems his own deputy . still has trouble getting the winner’s name right. During an interview yesterday, Harriet . Harman said: ‘Now we see David Cameron and Nick Clegg following . Dav...Ed Miliband’s argument.’ However, her aides insisted that she was . mistakenly referring to Mr Cameron. After . being deemed 'too ugly' to become prime minister, Ed Miliband has been . dealt another blow after it was revealed that 70 per cent of people . don't believe in him. The . YouGov poll gives him his worst rating since winning the Labour . leadership and a sure sign that supporters are turning away from him. He received an overall rating of -3 points compared to David Cameron's 91 and Nick Clegg's 45 from Lib Dems. Further . rubbing salt into the wounds, most people said they believe his elder . brother, David, would do a better job but he has ruled out standing . again.","Len McCluskey of Unite gives coded warning of leadership coup as he says New Labour will come to 'get' Miliband .

Around 430,000 acres of land in California, such as this area pictured in National Geographic Magazine, will be left fallow by drought this year because there hasn't been enough rain or snow. Forecasters have predicted that it is set to continue until the end of the year and possibly beyond . In early 2014 no water had reached the Rye Path Dam (pictured in National Geographic Magazine) that lies on the Humboldt River in Nevada. As of Thursday, 81 per cent of the state had severe drought conditions . They also capture the water levels in Shasta Lake, California, which are 65 per cent below the historic average and the Rye Path Dam on the Humboldt River in Nevada, which had collected no water in early 2014. In August, officials in Shasta Lake put Emergency Water Use Restrictions in place for the area because of the reduced levels. The drought crisis in California is so bad that some residents are now stealing water out of fire hydrants. In the western United States, most water arrives in winter storms, which swoop in from the Pacific and dump snow atop the region’s mountain ranges. To catch this water, Westerners have built dams, but the lack of snow simply means they are stopping anything. A growing population that requires more water to be taken from the vast system of is also worsening the situation. One that has required a massive increase is Phoenix, Arizona, which has seen its number of residents grow four-fold since 1970. Today forecasters have predicted the severe drought or worse will continue into next year across much of the West, including parts of western Utah, most of Nevada and practically all of California.

That . was a slight improvement from the 87 percent in that category three . months ago, but it was up from 78 percent the beginning of the year.

Girl Scouts have set up collection points while local charities are searching for money to install tanks next to homes. Officials . are trucking in water for those families in greatest need and have put a large tank in . front of the local firehouse for residents to fill up with water for . bathing and flushing toilets. About . 290 families in East Porterville - a poor, largely Hispanic town of . about 7,000 residents nestled against the Sierra Nevada foothills - have . said their shallow wells are depleted. Officials say the rest of Tulare County has many more empty wells, but nobody has a precise count. Other Central Valley counties also report pockets of homes with wells gone dry and no alternative water service. 'When . you have water running in your house, everything is OK,' said East . Porterville resident Yolanda Serrato. 'Once you don't have water, oh my . goodness.' With . California locked in its third year of drought and groundwater levels . dropping, residents and farmers have been forced to drill deeper and . deeper to find water. Sal Martinez draws water out of the pool at Eagle's Nest Resort in Porterville, California. The resort is offering the residents pool water to flush toilets and for other non-potable uses . Lawmakers . in Sacramento passed legislation to regulate groundwater pumping, which . Governor Jerry Brown signed into law this past week. Three days later, Brown signed an executive order that provides money to . buy drinking water for residents statewide whose wells have dried up, . while also directing key state officials to work with counties and local . agencies to find solutions for the shortages. The . State Water Resources Control Board had already allotted $500,000 to . buy bottled water for East Porterville residents, said Bruce Burton of . the board's Drinking Water Program. But . many East Porterville residents, like Ms Serrato, say all they want is to . get a glass of water from the kitchen sink. Her well dried up nearly two . months ago, she said, making life challenging for her husband and three . children. Eagle's Nest Resort manager Valarie Bowker discusses her concerns about the drought, while the park's pool remains open so locals can use it as a non-potable water source . To bathe, they . each have to fill a bucket from a 300-gallon tank in the . front yard, carry it inside and pour water over their heads with a cup. They've lived in their home for 21 years, she said. 'It's not that easy to say, ""Let's go someplace else.""' East . Porterville sits along the Tule River, which starts high in the . mountains and runs through the unincorporated town. Typically, river . water permeates the sandy soil under the community, filling up wells as . shallow as 30 feet deep. However, drought this year has caused the river to run dry along with the wells. Tulare . County spokeswoman Denise England said East Porterville needs to get . connected to the nearest water main in neighboring Porterville. She said that could cost more than $20 million and take up to five years - if the project didn't hit political snags. She . added counting the number of dry wells is difficult because people . don't come forward fearing their children will be taken away if their . home lacks a safe water source, or they believe that their home would be . condemned, making them homeless. Officials have had to combat these rumors, she said, adding, 'We're blindly feeling our way through this.'","430,000 acres of land will be left fallow in California - because there hasn't been enough rain or snow .

"Elaine Lordan, a former EastEnders soap star, has been seen drinking from a bottle of white wine in the street. The troubled actress  took her dog walking in North London in late November, but was later the same day pictured purchasing alcohol and drinking it while she walked home. Elaine, 47, who has battled alcoholism in the past, endured a tragic course of events when her mother, father and son died in close succession, shortly after she was treated for the problem. Drinking problem: Elaine Lordan was pictured drinking from a bottle of white wine in the street in late November . The star had been pictured picking up a bottle of Chenin Blanc at a corner shop, which she walked out carrying inside a black plastic bag. Making strides in a pair of comfortable trainers, she didn't go far before opening the alcohol and proceeding to take a swig in public. Elaine then appeared to stop in one spot, upturn the bottle and finish the capacity of the drink in one go. The actress went to dump the bottle in a bin before even making it home with her purchase. Taking a swig: The former EastEnders actress was seen taking swigs from  the bottle of Stowells White wine . The star once played Lynne Slater in the high profile BBC soap and she looked a little tired. Her gaunt frame showed through a layered up ensemble. Hiding beneath a velvet tracksuit, green parka and  cap, the former 'Ender was barely recognisable. Before: In 2003, the recognisable EastEnders actress was convicted of drink-driving and had her licence revoked . Buying a bottle: Elaine picked up a bottle of Stowells Chenin Blanc wine . Elaine started her day by walking her dog. She looked happy despite her troubles and had a smile to show when she held the pooch close in North London. Later that afternoon, Elaine took to the streets to clear the leaves with a kitchen mop that already looked dirty. The soap star, who was once a member of the fictional Slater family, was thought to have sought professional help in 2003 for her drinking woes. In 2001, she received a driving ban for drink-driving and was ordered to pay £750 by magistrates in St Albans and ordered to pay £2,500 costs. Breathalysers showed she had 51mg of alcohol in her breath. The legal limit is 35mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath. She left the soap in 2004 - maintaining that she was not sacked for her excessive drinking - with the incentive to give up drink as she and partner Peter Manuel were trying for a baby. At the time, mum Bernadette told one magazine: 'Elaine drinks too much. It is a problem and I wish she would cut down. Cleaning up: Elaine proceeded to dust the front of her house with a kitchen mop . All smiles: Earlier that morning, Elaine was pictured smiling as she took her dog for a walk . High spirits: The former soap star looked to be enjoying her day when she walked with her pooch . 'She will be seeing a professional for help. She was constantly in the public eye and working long hours. Drinking blocks out her stress.' In 2005, Elaine's mother - who was helping her to rehabilitate - died after throwing herself in front of a London tube. The 62-year-old left Lordan grief stricken and nine months later her baby was born five weeks premature.

"Warning: Dr Myles Bradbury has been warned he faces a substantial sentence after admitting carrying out examinations on children 'purely for his own sexual gratification' and with no medical justification . A children's doctor who admitted abusing boys in his care fondled some of his victims behind a curtain while their parents were in the room, a court has heard. Dr Myles Bradbury has been warned he faces a substantial sentence after admitting carrying out examinations on children 'purely for his own sexual gratification' and with no medical justification. His 18 victims, aged between 10 and 16, included children with haemophilia, leukaemia and other serious illnesses, Cambridge Crown Court heard. In total, the married 41-year-old father-of-one, who worked at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, and lived in Herringswell, Suffolk, has pleaded guilty to 25 offences including sexual assault, voyeurism and possessing more than 16,000 indecent images. At the beginning of his sentencing hearing today, prosecutor John Farmer said the defendant had a 'longstanding, unlawful, sexual interest in boys'. He added: 'The defendant, through the trust he had acquired, circumvented the procedures and encourages a number of young patients to see him alone. 'It was in these circumstance under the guise of legitimate examinations he went entirely beyond the bounds. 'He took the opportunity of fondling the boy's genitals and encouraging them to masturbate in his presence and obtain erections for his own personal gratification. 'On some occasions, when he failed to exclude the parent, he simply carried on behind the curtain behind which the boy had gone to remove his clothes.' The offences took place over four-and-a-half years, beginning within six months of him taking up his post in 2008 and continuing to the day he was suspended when the first concerns were raised. At some point, he began using a camera pen in an attempt to gain images of the boys when partially clothed, Mr Farmer added. Police found 170,425 images on this pen but none of these were classed as indecent. Mr Farmer explained Bradbury was first arrested in December 2013 after police were alerted by Canadian authorities that he had bought a DVD containing indecent images of children as part of Operation Spade. At that point Cambridgeshire Police were already investigating after concerns were raised about his conduct. Mr Farmer said the offences were a 'grave breach of trust' which had undermined the trust of patients. 'This defendant was a complete maverick and his behaviour is the antithesis of his profession - he has betrayed his profession,' he added. Serious: A photo from a trip to Africa during which Bradbury was left alone with children. His 18 victims, aged between 10 and 16, included children with haemophilia, leukaemia and other serious illnesses, Cambridge Crown Court heard . Guilty: In total, the married 41-year-old father-of-one (far left) has pleaded guilty to 25 offences including sexual assault, voyeurism and possessing more than 16,000 indecent images . The court is due to hear mitigation from Bradbury's barrister, Angela Rafferty, this afternoon before Judge Gareth Hawkesworth delivers his sentence on Monday. Bradbury, who, the court heard, was also involved in church and Scout groups, was described as 'a man of great charm and persuasiveness' whom everybody trusted. When one victim raised concerns with his mother, she responded: 'He's a doctor, it must be necessary.' Brazen: Outlining details of some of Bradbury's victims, the prosecutor said the familiar routine involved isolating them from their parents, asking them to remove their clothes and then groping their genitals . Mr Farmer said: 'That was the very image that really protected him from anything other than the most persistent line of complaint.' Outlining details of some of Bradbury's victims, the prosecutor said the familiar routine involved isolating them from their parents, asking them to remove their clothes and then groping their genitals. The depth of the examinations were often increased to meet Bradbury's sexual needs, not any medical requirement, he added. One victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said in a statement read to the court: 'I am now anxious to go to the doctor because I don't know who I should trust. 'I have haemophilia and a pain in my side so I know I should go but I feel disgusted and weird. 'I didn't think it would happen to me and I feel angry every time I think about it but also relieved it wasn't just me but we shouldn't have to go through it.' Another said he had regular nightmares, felt stressed and lacked confidence. 'I'd like to see Myles Bradbury and ask him why he did what he did to me,' he added. Bradbury looked anxious as he sat in the dock wearing a dark suit and blue tie. In mitigation, Ms Rafferty said Bradbury's guilty pleas had spared his victims the ordeal of giving evidence in court. She added: 'Clearly on a human level something has gone very badly wrong in this man's life and thought processes.' She said Bradbury seemed to have repressed homosexual feelings during puberty and this influenced his behaviour. Ms Rafferty added that he accepted what he did was 'repugnant'. 'He knows he will not get any understanding or forgiveness because what he did was unforgivable,' she said. 'His medical life may have done some good at some time but that means nothing now. 'He accepts that that was the life which allowed him to commit those offences.' Mistakes by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) meant Bradbury was left free for 16 months to wage his campaign of abuse. The doctor bought a DVD in 2005 from Azov Films in Canada. The company advertised on its website 'just legal' and 'naturist' films but many were clearly illegal - and were bought by paedophiles in over 50 countries around the world. The site was finally closed down by Toronto police in the summer of 2012 and concerned officers in Canada soon dispatched the names of its customers to authorities in other countries in an operation called Project Spade. CEOP was handed a list of 2,235 suspected British paedophiles in July 2012 by Canadian police - but did nothing for months. Canadian police told British authorities about suspected paedophiles including Bradbury as part of a worldwide operation called Project Spade . It was only when the centre was absorbed by the National Crime Agency last November that Bradbury's name was passed to Suffolk police and his home was raided. In the intervening time he had continued his abuse and made his trip to the African orphanage. Among the other suspects named on the list handed over by Canadian authorities was that of teacher Martin Goldberg, who was found dead a day after police first contacted him. Following the 46-year-old's death, a search of his house in Shoeburyness, Essex was conducted and 7,257 indecent images of children that he had downloaded from the internet were found. Three police forces in Britain - Essex, North Yorkshire and North Wales - are under investigation for allegedly failing to act on the child porn intelligence, it emerged earlier this month.

"Airline cabin cleaners at two of America's busiest airports walked out in protest over fears they could be exposed to Ebola. Around 200 workers responsible for keeping the inside of the planes at LaGuardia and JFK International in New York clean held a demonstration outside the terminals overnight on Wednesday, complaining that they often have to encounter hypodermic needles, vomit and blood. The employees who work for Air Serv, a company contracted by Delta, held up placards and chanted 'no justice, no peace' on Wednesday night and Thursday morning, suggesting they were ill-equipped to deal with sick passengers . Scroll down for video . Demonstration: A cabin cleaner holds up a sign protesting 'workplace hazards' at a picket line in LaGuardia airport in New York during a strike over fears they could be exposed to Ebola . Vulnerable: They have accused Air Serv, who are contracted by Delta, for exposing them to 'vomit, blood and feces without protection' Protest: An Air Serv employee holds up a placard complaining that they are exposed during the strikes on Thursday morning. They staged a walkout on Wednesday evening . As the international Ebola crisis continues, a British man is said to have died from the deadly infection in Macedonia. A doctor has also rubbished the panic-buying of 'Ebola protection kits' as a waste of money, suggesting the only use the general public will have for them is as a Halloween costume. Dr Tom Frieden, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevntion, has also warned the spread of the vrisu could become a global health catastrophe that could rivals aids. As the workers walked out at LaGuardia and JFK The Service Employees International Union Local 32BJ was scheduled to conduct infectious disease training today for airport cabin cleaners, terminal cleaners and wheelchair attendants. It was aimed at helping workers to identify infectious disease hazards and protect against exposure and spread. But the workers, who don't deal with international flights, said their concerns predate the Ebola scare, and the newest threat has pushed them to demonstrate. Joel Castillo, 23 from Far Rockaway, New York who usually works in the afternoon, told the Wall Street Journal he would not work Thursday, adding: 'We're protesting because we don't have adequate protection.' Complaints: A woman holds up a sign alleging the company of treating their employees like garbage . He said sometimes airplane equipment can malfunction, exposing staffers to human waste, and said workers were requesting body suits and durable gloves. Mr Castillo added that the current gloves provided are 'like paper; they rip easily.' 'If it wasn’t for Ebola, we’d still be striking. But we have heightened concerns because of it,' Five major US airports have added an extra layer of security in a bid to prevent anyone with the disease from entering the country. The screening will include taking the temperature of passengers who have flown from disease-ravaged countries. The new airport screening will begin Saturday at New York's JFK International Airport and then expand to Washington Dulles and the international airports in Atlanta, Chicago and Newark, New Jersey. The White House said checks would reach more than 9 of 10 travelers to the U.S. from the outbreak zone. Instruction: Mary Moorer trains workers from the union 32BJ, many of them airline cabin cleaners, terminal cleaners and wheelchair attendants, on how to better protect themselves from infectious diseases . Safety: The infectious disease training classes will show the workers how to put on protective clothing and handle potentially harmful bodily fluids . Protection: A cleaner holds up their hands wearing rubber gloves during the training at LaGuardia airport . President Obama is calling it a 'belt and suspenders' approach. Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola on US soil, was able to get into the country after he allegedly lied on a health form in Libera. He died on Wednesday after contracting the deadly infection. Today his family said they believe he wasn't given the same quality of care leading up to his death Wednesday morning as the other patients treated in the U.S. for the dreaded virus. His newphew Joe Weeks and others in his family are calling his treatment 'unfair,' after seeing other patients pulled from the brink of death in government-funded evacuation planes and using life-saving blood transfusions and cutting edge drugs. Five US citizens have been diagnosed with Ebola and three of them have beaten it. NBC News cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, the latest American victim, arrived at the infectious disease ward at the University of Nebraska Medical Center this week for treatment.

"The two Indian sisters who were filmed hitting two men with a belt after allegedly being sexually harassed today revealed that they fought back to show that 'girls are not weak'. Pooja, 19, and Aarti Kumar, 22, were verbally abused by three men in their early 20s on a bus in Rohtak, Haryana, last Friday - and have since become internet heroines for their retaliation. The university students, who were on their way home from Rohtak Government College, turned on their abusers - and beat them up with a belt while fellow passengers watched. Scroll down for video . Hitting back: Sisters Pooja, 19, left, and Aarti, 22, right, were filmed beating up a group of men who were verbally and physically abusing them on a bus in Rohtak, a district in the northern state of Haryana . Today, Pooja told MailOnline: ‘We encounter these kinds of incidents on a daily basis. It was only when the boys started misbehaving with a pregnant woman that we resorted to this. ‘We really thought to these guys a lesson and beat them up. We wanted to show that we girls are not weak and capable to defending ourselves. We really wanted to kick them. ‘After they got beaten they ran away, otherwise they would have continued to harass us. I am not regretting it. I did the right thing.’ The three men, from Asan village in Rohtak, had initially attempted to flirt with the sisters by giving out his phone number on a piece of paper, but things turned sinister when they refused him. A video of the bus attack has gone viral on social media in India, and has since seen the men arrested . When Aarti told the men to stop and not touch her, one of the men pushed her and grabbed her by the throat. Coming to her sister's defence, Pooja removed her belt and began hitting, kicking and punching the man holding her sister until he let go. Pooja said: ‘You see we have been tolerating these kind of things for long enough, but how long can we tolerate this? ‘Our patience was over when we saw a fellow lady passenger who was pregnant being abused and bullied by these hooligans than we decided to act and teach them a lesson.’ The incident took place on a bus on Friday, when the Kumar sisters were on their way home from Rohtak Government College, and was filmed by one of the passengers . ‘Women get harassed and abused everywhere in India and men haven’t learnt any lessons even after so many incidents. Every man has a mother and sister, but they still indulge in these things.’ Most of the passengers did nothing to help the girls, and neither driver not the bus conductor stepped in. The film of the incident, which has been circulating on social media, shows one man attempting to separate the girls from the three men. The victims even dialled the number of a women's helpline, but got no response. The Kumar sisters say they were 'thrown off the bus' by their abusers, who followed them and continued to harass them. One of the men grabbed 22-year-old Aarti, left, by the neck so Pooja, right, removed her belt and defended her . Pooja told local media that they finally fought off the trio by throwing a brick at them, after which they fled the scene. After reaching home, the sisters narrated the incident to their parents and subsequently a case was registered at the Rohtak Sadar police station. The three men, said to be soldiers-in-training, have been arrested over the attack. Today, the bus conductor and driver were both suspended for allegedly not informing the police about the incident. Haryana Women's Commission vice-chairperson Suman Dahiya said: 'I will personally visit the place where the incident took place.' A women-only taxi business in India's capital New Delhi, may have to close after its main customer, a government-run women's advice helpline, have failed to  pay them for six months. The Sakha Cabs project was set up in the Indian capital New Delhi in 2010 with just two drivers offering to carry only female passengers who were nervous about travelling with male cab drivers. But the project expanded rapidly when they got a contract to transport female employees from a government run helpline called 'Women in Distress'. At risk: The Sakha Cabs project was set up in New Delhi in 2010 to carry only female passengers but may now have to close down after drivers have not been paid for six months . However, the cab company say they may have to close up shop, as the government-run helpline has not paid them. Sakha Cabs director Nayantara Janardhan said: 'The staff operating the helpline offer advice to women with all sorts of problems, and after a day's work they don't want to be driven home by a man. 'They want to be driven home by woman and know that they can relax and enjoy the journey and that they will be delivered safely.' But she said the cash shortfall was causing severe problems, and said many of her female drivers had had to take out loans in order to get by in recent months after the company ran out of money because it was not being paid by the regional government run project in New Delhi. Janardhan added: 'We really feel we are providing a valuable service, but it can't go on operating as a free charity. We have bills to pay too.' Many of the women are dependent on the job to support families. One female driver, called Khushi, is a 23-year-old resident of Gautampuri slum which is near Badarpur, an area in a southern district of New Dehli. She said: 'My father was a labourer and stopped working after I started earning. His health isn't good. My salary helps me put my three younger sisters and a brother through school.'","Sisters fight back after being sexually harassed on bus in India .

"Manchester United have signed promising Belgian teenager Indy Boonen on a three-year deal. Sportsmail reported in December that United were interested in the 16-year-old attacking midfielder, who can also play as a left back, as well as his brother Seppe, a 13-year-old goalkeeper. It is believed the youngster initially grabbed the attention of United scouts when he played in a friendly against the Red Devils for former side Genk in April 2013.

The 16-year-old will take comfort from the fact young players are afforded first-team opportunities at United, with Tyler Blackett, Paddy McNair and James Wilson all featuring for Louis van Gaal's side this season. The youngster appears to be a big fan of Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo too, posting several photos of the former Manchester United forward on his Facebook page. As well as his brother, Seppe, football runs right through the family, with Boonen's father - Jacky - a former professional footballer for Lierse, Beveren and Lokeren in the 1990s. Jacky admitted to HLN that his son, a talented playmaker with a strong left foot, is a much bigger talent than he ever was. The family are now expected to move to England with Indy in the summer, as the highly-rated youngster looks to continue his development in Manchester, joining up with United's youth set-up next season.

"Former Southampton striker James Beattie has hailed the impact Saints manager Ronald Koeman and the club's recruitment, as they continue to surprise the Premier League. Koeman has built a young, exciting squad at St Mary's that is making a big impression as Southampton remain in the hunt for Champions League football next season. Despite selling a selection of star players last summer including Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Calum Chambers and Rickie Lambert for a combined total of £92million, Koeman's side are currently fourth, one point behind Manchester United and one ahead of Arsenal, with only 13 games left to go in the season. James Beattie, during his time as Accrington Stanley manager, has praised Ronald Koeman's impact . Beattie signed for Southampton in 1998 and scored 76 goals in 235 appearances for the south coast side . Beattie, who signed for the south coast side in 1998, making 235 appearances for Southampton and scoring 76 goals before moving to Everton in January 2005, is delighted with the club's rise. 'I think the best thing that happened last summer was that the owner Katharina Liebherr gave Ronald all that money to go and reinvest,' Beattie told Bleacher Report. 'That's a huge step. The club then recruited some fantastic, largely unknown, players because the manager knows the European market very, very well.

Former Saints star James Beattie has kept a close eye on Southampton matches this season . 'Recruitment is probably 90 per cent of your success in football, employing the right people and getting them to work in the same way, whether it be the manager, the coaching staff or the players of course. 'How the hell they got Alderweireld on loan I'll never know. It takes time to spot a player like that.' The 36-year-old, now a manager himself having kept Accrington Stanley in League Two during his first season in charge before leaving in September, has recognised the impressive impact at Saints under Koeman since arriving in the summer. 'Outside the club, people were making assumptions, but talking to people inside Southampton, Koeman was always full of confidence and that dripped through to the squad,' added Beattie. 'I've seen 10 of the last 15 games, home and away. I speak to a few of the lads in the dressing room and they say Koeman's training is top drawer, he's personable and gets his message across.

"Scored a deal: Dunkin' Donuts is the latest in a long list of endorsement deals that Lebron James has inked . Executives at Dunkin Donuts are hoping to make China run on Dunkin’ and using Lebron James to help by signing an endorsement deal with the basketball star. Dunkin' Brands Inc. said Monday that NBA superstar Lebron James has agreed to promote Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins ice cream in Asia where the company has about a third of its stores. The company is hoping to cater to the eastern market by creating different savory products for the various countries. One example of a locally-inspired menu item would be pork donuts in China, and though they may not be palatable to Americans or Europeans, it will certainly show the company's understanding of the nation's preferences, where it aims to open another 100 stores in the next two to three years. James will promote Dunkin's brands in China, Taiwan, India and South Korea through advertisements, online media and in-store marketing, so he may well be testing out the new pork donuts while on promotional visits. 'Donuts are a very flexible product. You can do savory donuts, you can do donuts with shredded pork -- that's in China,' said CEO Nigel Travis. 'We also have a range of other savory products that we have been testing and introducing country by country.' Getting the menu right in each market is critical. Pork donuts, for example, are not likely to sell well in Indonesia and Malaysia, where people are predominantly Muslim. James will also make personal . appearances in Asia after the season ends in June, which is sure to . increase profits for the company as the 27-year-old is very popular in . the region. International appeal: At present, a third of the company's stores are in Asia- like this store in Shanghai- and they are due to add 250 more in the next 2-3 years . Dunkin' executive John Costello would not elaborate on the specific terms of the . deal, but said it was multiyear and worth multimillions of dollars. ‘I'm . really excited about partnering with Dunkin' Brands and connecting with . the huge community of basketball fans’ in Asia, James said in a . statement. James, a two-time . NBA Most Valuable Player, has the best-selling basketball jersey and . shoe in China and has visited Asia four times. This endorsement deal comes on top of a number of others that help James earn between $25million and $30million per year. Open for business: Seen here at a charity event sponsored by Sprite- with whom James has an endorsement deal- the NBA star makes anywhere between $25m-$30m per year . Brand ambassador: James has long had a contract with Nike, and has nine signature shoes by the company . Fast . food has been profitable for the player in the past, as he has a . long-term contract with McDonalds already underway, as well as other . food and drink deals with Sprite, Glacéau and Bubblicious. There are over 10,000 Dunkin' Donuts shops worldwide in 32 countries. This figure puts them in the same league- though still vastly outnumbered- as Starbucks which has 17,009 locations. The brand's headquarters are in Canton, Massachusetts, and unsurprisingly the chain is seen most frequently in the Northeast of the United States. In the home state alone there are 294 locations. Moving west of the Mississippi River, however, there are only 75 franchises. That number is sure to increase in the coming years as the company announced that it plans to triple its total size. A large amount of those locations are going to come in the U.S. as it plans to have 15,000 stores by 2020. They also plan to expand outside of the U.S., with expected openings in the Ukraine, India, Brazil and Costa Rica. But given their endorsement plans with Lebron James, it comes as no surprise that much of their attention will be focused on Asia. The company plans to open 250 stores throughout the continent in the next two to three years, 100 of which will be in China. China . is the NBA's second-biggest market after the U.S., and NBA players . often visit Asia on behalf of shoe companies or other sponsors during . the offseason. Dunkin' is hoping James' popularity . will help boost sales in a region where it has about 5,400 stores, or . about a third of its global total. The company plans to add at least 250 . stores in Asia during the next two to three years- 100 of which are . expected to be in China, chief executive Nigel Travis said. Dunkin' opened its first restaurant in . Vietnam in December and plans to open its inaugural store in India . later this year, Mr Travis said. South Korea has the most Dunkin' stores . in Asia with about 1,900 while Japan has 1,087 - all Baskin-Robbins. The James deal ‘is Asia focused and reflects our commitment to Asia,’ Mr Travis told reporters in Singapore. ‘Lebron has a strong commitment to . building his relationship in Asia so he's definitely planning multiple . trips to Asia in the offseason this year.’ The popularity of basketball in Asia . has grown during the last decade, in part because of former Houston . Rockets center Yao Ming of China, who retired last year. New . York Knicks guard Jeremy Lin has become an overnight sensation in Asia, . especially in China and Taiwan. Lin, whose parents were born in Taiwan, . is the first Asia-American player in the NBA. Mr Costello said Dunkin is happy to have snagged James, who has been an All-Star for eight seasons. Appealing to the Asian market: Retired star Yao Ming (left) and Asian American phenomenon Jeremy Lin (center) are big hits in Asia, but Lebron James (right) is extremely popular in the region as well . Lin . ‘certainly is an exciting new player with 20 games to his history,’ said Mr Costello, who is Dunkin's chief global marketing and innovation . officer. ‘But Lebron James . has had a fabulous nine years. We think the excitement around Jeremy Lin . will actually create more awareness in Asia.’ James, . 27, is in his ninth NBA season since turning professional straight out . of high school. His team, the Miami Heat, lost in last year's finals to . the Dallas Mavericks.",Company expanding its Asian presence and plans to create locally-inspired menu items like shredded pork donuts in China .
"Estibaliz Carranza, 34, was sentenced to life in prison in 2012 for the murders of former-spouse Holger Holz in 2008 and ice-cream machine salesman Manfred Hinterberger two years later . A cold-blooded ice-cream parlour owner dubbed the 'ice lady' for the calculated way in which she killed her ex-husband and lover has revealed how she dismembered them with a chainsaw and took concrete-mixing classes to hide the bodies. Estibaliz Carranza, 36, was sentenced to life in prison in 2012 for the murders of former-spouse Holger Holz in 2008 and ice-cream machine salesman Manfred Hinterberger two years later. She shot both men in the back of the head at close range, cut up their bodies and froze them in a deep-freeze refrigerator before later interring them in concrete under the cellar of her store. Now, in an explosive memoir written from her jail cell, she has revealed the grisly details about how she carried out each murder. Holz became her first victim after he refused to move out of their home, in Vienna, Austria, following their divorce. She told how she walked up behind him one evening as he worked on his computer, held her Beretta .22-calibre handgun to the back of his head and pulled the trigger. She then used the noise of her ice-cream making machines to drown out the sound of the chainsaw as she cut him into pieces before hiding some of his body parts in flower pots in her basement. Two years later, after apparently getting away with murder, Carranza also murdered her new boyfriend, Mr Hinterberger, while he was sleeping after a drunken argument. Before his killing, however, she took both shooting course and a concrete mixing course in preparation. Claiming he was drunk and abusive, she said: 'He turned his face to the wall and started snoring... I was so angry. I had the gun under the mattress. I took it out, loaded and shot.' In the morning she 'asked him to forgive me for what I had done'. She then proceeded to dispose of the body. A year later, she fell pregnant by a third boyfriend, and was looking forward to a happy future when workmen stumbled across the remains in the basement, and called the police. But she fled . Writing in her book, entitled 'My Two Lives, The True Story of the Ice Lady' and co-written with journalist Martina Prewein, she said: . Victims: She killed Mr Holz (left) after he refused to move out of their home following their divorce, then shot dead Mr Hinterberger (right) while he was sleeping after a drunken argument . Scene: She used the chainsaw to cut up the bodies then buried them in cement in the basement of Schleckeria -- which is still serving ice-cream today in Wien-Meidling, Vienna . 'I killed two men, whom I once loved. There is no way of glossing this over, I robbed two mothers of their sons. I believed I had to serve men, no matter how they behaved.' She said she had simply been unable to break up with her lover, Manfred Hinterberger. 'I couldn't say no. I couldn't do it, I couldn't get free of him,' she wrote. She said she made them into 'monsters and finally they made me a beast'. A psychiatric report commissioned by the court said that Carranza, now in a unit for the 'mentally abnormal', was dangerous and was like a 'princess... who just wants to be 'rescued' by a man'. During her trial, Judge . Susanne Lehr told a Vienna court her confession and her state of . 'considerable psychological damage' were mitigating factors, but her . careful planning and her behaviour after the murders counted against . her. Carranza, . wearing the same grey dress she had worn throughout the four-day trial . and donning a pair of glasses, did not react to the unanimous jury . verdict and nodded to confirm she had understood the sentence. A psychiatric report commissioned by the court said that Carranza, now in a unit for the 'mentally abnormal', was dangerous and was like a 'princess... who just wants to be ""rescued"" by a man' Her . lawyer Rudolf Mayer - who also defended Josef Fritzl, who used his daughter as a sex . slave - said he would appeal to have the verdict overturned. The . photogenic Mexican-Spanish immigrant, whose case attracted . extensive interest from Austrian media, . said Mr Holz had completely changed after their wedding, turning verbally . abusive, lazy and joining a Hare Krishna sect. She complained that he . had refused to move out when she had a new lover, even after their . divorce. The new lover, Mr  Hinterberger, suffered the same fate . two years later, receiving four shots in the back of the head as he lay . in bed snoring after she had tried to start a discussion about his . infidelity. Carranza wept as she told the judge: 'All I can say is that I'm sorry I took the lives of Holger and Manfred.' Earlier, . prosecutor Petra Freh told the court Carranza was a manipulative liar . prepared to do anything for her own advantage, according to the Austria . Press Agency. Psychiatrist . Heidi Kastner, who spent more than 30 hours with Carranza before the . trial, said the murderer had a 'grave, comprehensive, multi-faceted . personality disorder' and was at considerable risk of killing again if . she did not have therapy. Kastner . was also the expert psychiatric prosecution witness in the 2009 Fritzl . case, spending four months with him before the trial that ended in his . conviction for rape, incest, kidnapping and enslavement of his daughter . over 24 years. The remains . of Carranza's victims were found by chance last year when maintenance . work was being done in the building where she had buried them.","Estibaliz Carranza killed husband in 2008 and then lover in 2010 in Vienna .

"For many people, heartbreak can lead to drowning your sorrows in comfort food and piling on the pounds. But when Taryn Wright split up with her husband she decided it was time for a positive change. The 31-year-old from Grays, Essex - who claims her unhappy marriage transformed her from a contented size 12 into a frumpy size 20 - embraced life as a single girl, losing seven stone in just one year... and dropping to a slender size six. Now that Taryn has lost all the weight and is a size six she is enjoying life as a confident single girl, and believes the reason she was fat was because she was married . She says: 'It was like I woke up one morning after I had been married a couple of years and suddenly realised that the old me was gone. This big, fat, miserable person was left in her place' The senior credit controller said: 'Being a wife made me fat - but being single made me sexy again. I was always happy with my figure until I got married. 'After the wedding, my life totally changed. But when I left my husband, I didn't even have to try to diet. Incredibly, the weight just fell off because I was single again. I won't get married again in a hurry - it made me fat.' Taryn was a size 10 when she met her market trader husband - who does not wish to be names - in a nightclub at the age of 23, and in true whirlwind romance style the couple moved in together just weeks later and married the following year in 2006. Taryn walked down the aisle in a size 12 dress weighing 9 stone, but after settling into married life her figure dramatically changed. Taryn was a size 10 when she met her market trader husband in a nightclub at the age of 23, but her weight quickly ballooned because she was miserable as a wife . She says: 'I wanted to show my husband I was trying to lose weight and look sexy again. But in secret, I was still eating pizza and chocolate when he was out because I was so bored and lonely' She says: 'It was like I woke up one morning after I had been married a couple of years and suddenly realised that the old me was gone. This big, fat, miserable person was left in her place. 'At first I just didn't understand why. I hadn't had any children and I didn't have any major issues with food. But it was when I sat and thought about how much my life had changed that I realised why I was fat. 'I'd gone from being an independent, fun-loving girl who enjoyed partying to staying in all the time, watching TV and eating takeaways. Life revolved around sitting on the sofa and deciding what to eat for dinner.' Taryn as a healthy size 12 on her wedding day, before she began eating out of 'boredom' during her marriage . Taryn said married life made it impossible to diet: 'Before our wedding, I found it easy to lose a few pounds. I would just skip a few meals and the weight would drop off me. 'But as a married woman, I had my husband to think about. I couldn't simply not cook a meal - sitting down to eat was pretty much the only thing we did together.' Fearing her marriage was already in trouble, Taryn felt prioritising her diet would only cause more problems. She says: 'The only thing we really looked forward to was a bottle of wine, a movie and takeaway at the weekend. 'I was worried that if I gave that up, we would have no connection at all so it was easier to push the upset about my weight aside and carry on as normal. 'Food was the glue keeping us together because we both loved our takeaways. It became my comfort - my way to get through the boredom.' As the cracks in her marriage grew, Taryn turned to food even more. She regularly treated herself to family-sized pizzas and garlic bread to forget about her unhappiness. Taryn admits: 'Neither of us wanted to say the marriage wasn't working. It was easier to buy a slab of chocolate and get stuck in to that than face the truth.' But the bigger Taryn got, the worse her relationship became. She says: 'I was sure my husband didn't find me attractive any more so I avoided being physical. 'I started dressing in baggy, frumpy clothes and felt like an old, middle-aged woman.' When she reached 15st, Taryn joined a slimming club in a last-ditch attempt to shift the pounds. She says: 'I wanted to show my husband I was trying to lose weight and look sexy again. But in secret, I was still eating pizza and chocolate when he was out because I was so bored and lonely. 'I was nothing like the woman I had been before - it seemed impossible to get below a size 20.' Fearing the old Taryn was gone for ever, she joined a gym and started working out four times a week. But because her marriage was still failing, she regularly turned to junk food to soften the pain. She says: 'I was just going round in circles. I knew I desperately wanted life to change but wasn't sure how to make it happen.' Taryn had been married for six years when the turning point came in January last year. BREAKFAST: Two bacon and egg McMuffins. MID-MORNING SNACK: Crisps. LUNCH: Leftover takeaway or Subway foot-long roll. SNACK: Crisps. Hot pastry. DINNER: Takeaway or a large home-cooked meal of pasta or jacket potato. SNACKS: Chocolates, crisps and dips. Cans of Diet Coke. BREAKFAST: Bowl of cereal at work, or bacon and egg roll. LUNCH: Sandwich on the go. DINNER: Cooks the same meals as before but just eats one portion. SNACKS: No snacks, no time to think about them or eat them. Still drinks Diet Coke. Taryn admits: 'Neither of us wanted to say the marriage wasn't working. It was easier to buy a slab of chocolate and get stuck in to that than face the truth' Taryn made the effort to reconnect with . her old friends and soon found that a busy social life had a dramatic . impact on her diet: 'Because I had things to do, I would just grab something healthy to eat on the way' She explains: 'It was a typical night. I had just got in from work and my husband had got up after a night shift and headed straight out the door. 'We barely looked at each other. I was home alone not knowing when he would be back and I had two choices - I could either open the fridge and start scoffing or pack a bag and leave.' She chose the latter. She says: 'I called a friend who agreed I could stay with her. Then I packed as much stuff as I could and called a taxi. I was scared but also relieved because I knew nothing would change otherwise. To me, our marriage had already been over for a long time.' Taryn made the effort to reconnect with her old friends and soon found that a busy social life had a dramatic impact on her diet. She says: 'Because I had things to do, I would just grab something healthy to eat on the way, like a sandwich or a wrap. Food was no longer the only focus of my life.' After just a few weeks of single life, Taryn was surprised to notice her clothes getting looser. She says: 'It was crazy. I'd not gone back to the slimming club or gym since leaving my husband but for the first time in years, I was actually losing weight.' When people started noticing her weight loss, Taryn would say it was because she had gone from being married to single. 'It was true,' she says. 'I could see no other explanation.' Taryn soon started divorce proceedings and the weight continued to fall off with no effort at all. In less than 12 months, she had managed to lose 7st and gone from a size 20 to a size six.

"Hot spots: The Duchess in the Topshop dress which sold out online in an hour . It is possibly the most well-known colour code of them all  – pink for a girl, blue for a boy. So when the Duchess of Cambridge revealed she had bought a pram in light blue, Royal watchers wondered excitedly if she had dropped the biggest clue yet to the sex of her unborn child. Kate – who is six months pregnant – told guests at a recent reception that she had chosen a buggy by designer label Bugaboo, which has celebrity fans including actress Sienna Miller and television presenter Peaches Geldof. The buggies, which cost from £500 to £1,000 and can operate as either a pushchair or pram, come in a variety of colours and parents who do not know the sex of their baby usually prefer neutral hues such as beige, off-white or black. The Duke and Duchess have insisted that they do not know if they are having a boy or a girl. But although it is possible to swap some of the buggy’s accessories for those in different colours, including pink, Kate’s choice of blue will be seen as a  clear hint as to her feelings about the gender. She has said she would prefer a son while William wants a daughter. Yesterday, Bugaboo said it had not presented the buggy to the Royal couple after being advised by officials not to send gifts. So it appears that Kate, who was seen shopping for a Moses basket in South Kensington last week with her mother, bought the pram herself. The Duchess, 31, revealed the Bugaboo colour when she chatted to a group of Army wives at a drinks reception in Aldershot on St Patrick’s Day. According to one source: ‘She and some . of the other girls were talking about prams and one of the girls had her . baby in a Bugaboo. Royal transport: A blue Bugaboo buggy fit for a prince? The Kate-effect: The Duchess' choice of dresses often create sell-outs and her baby purchases could do the same . Her choices of dress have long spawned a rush to the shops – and this pretty polka dot outfit proved pregnancy has done nothing to dent the ‘Kate-effect’. Just an hour after the Duchess of Cambridge arrived at the Warner Brothers film studios in Hertfordshire on Friday, the Topshop dress, which costs just £20 in the sale, had sold out online. Now it has emerged the skater dress was bought personally by the Duchess from Topshop in Oxford Circus last month. It is understood she arrived unannounced and spent nearly an hour browsing with her security staff, looking at the main range rather than maternity clothes. 'Kate said she has bought one in light blue. It was a . bit of a hint.’ Guardsman Lee Wheeler, 29, who met Kate at the ceremony, said the Duchess was happily discussing the Royal bump. He said: ‘I asked her, “Do you know if it’s a girl or a boy?” and she said, “Not yet”. She said, “I’d like to have a boy and William would like a girl.” I asked her if she had any names and she said no.’ Since then, however, the Royal couple have revealed they have a shortlist of boys’ and girls’ names. Alexandra and Elizabeth are said to be favourites for a girl, with George in the running for a boy. Last night a spokesman for the Duchess declined to comment.","Duchess purchased a blue Bugaboo buggy - a celebrity favourite .

"Scientists have warned that the end might just be nigh for many species as they believe our planet is on track for the sixth mass extinction. The Earth has previously suffered five mass extinction events, the worst of which was 250million years ago when 96 per cent of marine species and 70 per cent of land species were wiped out. Now they believe that the combination of climate change, destruction of natural habitats and movement of animals to new places is driving many species to extinction. Scientists believe that the combination of climate change (illustrated) destruction of natural habitats and movement of animals to unnatural climate change is driving many species to extinction . The mass extinction event 252 million years ago wiped out more than 96 per cent of marine species and 70 per cent of life on land - including the largest insects known to have inhabited the Earth. Now scientists think it occurred in just 60,000 years. Multiple theories have aimed to explain the cause of what is known as the end-Permian extinction, including an asteroid impact, massive volcanic eruptions, or a cataclysmic cascade of environmental events. Researchers at MIT have determined that the end-Permian extinction occurred over 60,000 years, give or take 48,000 years which they say is 'practically instantaneous, from a geologic perspective'. The leading theory among geologists and paleontologists has to do with widespread, long-lasting volcanic eruptions from the Siberian Traps, a region of Russia whose step-like hills are a result of repeated eruptions of magma. The new timeline adds weight to the theory that the extinction was triggered by massive volcanic eruptions from the Siberian Traps that released volatile chemicals, including carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere and oceans. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said in 2007 that 20 to 30 per cent of plant and animal species face a higher risk of extinction if the Earth continues to get hotter and now one science writer has explored what would happen if the extinction rate is accelerated. In her book The Sixth Extinction, Elizabeth Kolbert discusses modern-day extinction rates and told The Washington Post that it is not natural for humans to see anything go extinct in the course of their lifetime. The New Yorker writer said that the normal background rate of extinction is incredibly slow but nowadays naturalists are seeing animals become extinct – or teeter on the brink of extinction – all the time. She said that whether the present situation is a mass extinction, or ‘just’ an elevated extinction rate, is up for debate. Ms Kolbert said that the changing chemistry of the oceans is possibly the largest factor on the slippery slope to mass extinction. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in 2007 that 20 to 30 per cent of plant and animal species face a higher risk of extinction if the Earth continues to get hotter. A polar bear skull is pictured. The animals are threaded with extinction as their diet consists of seal, which they can only hunt from the ice . In her book The Sixth Extinction, Elizabeth Kolbert discusses modern-day extinction rates . A third of the carbon dioxide pumped into the air by humans is trapped in the oceans and when it dissolves it turns acidic, destabilising huge bodies of water and upsetting the animals that live in oceans. ‘When people try to reconstruct the history of the ocean, the best estimate is that what we're doing to the oceans or have the potential to do is a magnitude of change that hasn't been seen in 300 million years,’ she said. ‘And changes of ocean chemistry are associated with some of the worst extinction crises in history.’ By looking at which creatures survived mass extinction events, scientists are trying to work out which species are likely to survive a sixth mass extinction, based on their characteristics. Ms Kolbert said that experts have found species distributed widely tend to pull through, or groups that are made up of a lot of species. She believes that climate change is . having a huge effect on different species, but based upon research in . the Peruvian cloud forest, things move at different rates and some . species can move up a mountain or to higher latitudes to stay within . their temperature comfort zone, easier than others. One . genus of Peruvian tree called Schefflera can keep with the fast rate of . temperature change by moving swiftly up a mountain, but other plants . cannot move as fast, or at all, she said. Science writer Elizabeth Kolbert said that the changing chemistry of the oceans is possibly the largest factor on the slippery slope to mass extinction. Coral reefs most easily display ocean acidification (pictured). They become bleached and die as the result of increasing carbon dioxide levels . Scientists’ best guess is that between 20 and 30 per cent of species area at risk of extinction if the average temperature of the planet rises by 2°C, but others believe the climate models are inaccurate. According to the book, scientists also think that the exchange of species – such as when Columbus arrived in the New World – leads to the extinction of species as the food chain is altered. In the age of cheap and plentiful global travel, the effect has been amplified.

"Model Myla Dalbesio has made history by landing a coveted Calvin Klein underwear campaign, even though  she is considered plus-size by the fashion industry's standards. At a U.S. size 10 (UK size 14), the 27-year-old from Wisconsin is too curvy for a standard sample size zero or two, but plus-size is traditionally classified as size 12 and up, putting her right in the middle. 'It's kind of confusing because I'm a bigger girl,' Myla, who stands at 5ft 11in, told Elle. 'I'm not the biggest girl on the market but I'm definitely bigger than all the girls [Calvin Klein] has ever worked with, so that is really intimidating.' Scroll down for video . Breaking boundaries: Model Myla Dalbesio, 27, who wears a U.S. size ten, has made history as one of the curviest woman ever to star in a Calvin Klein campaign . Myla, who describes her body type as 'in the middle,' looks stunning in the 'Perfectly Fit' campaign, flaunting her curves in a black bra, her brunette hair slicked back. She says the ad, which also features the more 'straight-sized' Jourdan Dunn, Ji Hye Park, Amanda Wellsh and Lara Stone, is revolutionary in that it doesn't address that fact that she is the lone 'plus-size' model in the group. 'I'm not skinny enough to be with the skinny girls and I'm not large enough to be with the large girls , and I haven't been able to find my place,' she explained. As such, 'this [campaign] was such a great feeling.' And yet some people have taken to Twitter in outrage that she could even be considered a 'bigger' girl. 'Genuine WTF moment,' one critic wrote in a tweet directed at Elle. 'This woman is described as ""plus-size"" and ""a bigger girl"". Aaaraagahagaagahahagahahag'. Another person said: 'I wouldn't consider her a plus size model. Her height and her muscular tone should not categorize as a ""big girl.""' And a third commented angrily: 'How is that plus size??'

'I'm not the biggest girl on the market but I'm definitely bigger than all the girls [Calvin Klein] has ever worked with' Outcry: Some critics have taken to Twitter in outrage that she could even be considered a 'bigger' girl . In comparison: Also featured in the campaign are Amanda Wellsh (left) and Jourdan Dunn (right), who both fit the standard sample size . Despite the outcry, which seems to be directed at Elle rather than Calvin Klein, Myla says landing the campaign has made her hopeful that size is becoming less of an issue in the fashion industry. 'It's not like [Calvin Klein] released this campaign and were like, 'Whoa, look, there's this plus-size girl in our campaign,'' she explained. 'They released me in this campaign with everyone else; there's no distinction. It's not a separate section for plus-size girls.' A statement released by the fashion house expresses the same sentiment. 'The Perfectly Fit line was created to celebrate and cater to the needs of different women,' a spokesperson told MailOnline. 'And these images are intended to communicate that our new line is more inclusive and available in several silhouettes in an extensive range of sizes.' Myla, who is currently signed by Jag Models after being scouted at 16 when she was crowned Miss Teen Wisconsin, has opened up in the past about being encouraged to lose weight in order to fit into the 'standard' modeling size. The model, who also works as a performance artist, has spoken in the past about her darkest days when she found herself heading down a path of drugs and eating disorders. Fitting in: Despite the controversy, Myla says landing the Calvin Klein campaign has made her hopeful that size is becoming less of an issue in the fashion industry . She told Fashionista in 2012: 'I tried for a long time to make myself [lose weight]. I tried throwing up after I ate and that's awful. That is painful - I would never wish for anyone to do that ever.' The model revealed that she would spend weeks eating nothing but calorie-free black olives and pickles  and spending hours in the gym to try to slim down to a more typical model weight. She then gave up modelling for two years to concentrate on her studies but it was Crystal Renn who paved the way for her return as a plus-size girl. Myla said: 'They told me about plus modeling which was something I'd never heard of before. In the middle: 'I'm not skinny enough to be with the skinny girls and I'm not large enough to be with the large girls... 'This [campaign] was such a great feeling', explained Myla (with model Danielle Redman) 'But then they [scouts Jeff and Mary Clark] showed me, and this is when Crystal was really starting to pick up speed, so I walked into Ford and the first thing Gary [Dakin] said to me was, ""You're the next Crystal Renn,"" and then they signed me.' But Myla has also noted that she is encouraged to have landed the Calvin Klein campaign, despite not fitting into the super-skinny mold. 'Look at the history of the brand, they launched Kate Moss, and this is the woman who started this whole trend of waif,' she told Entertainment Tonight earlier this year. 'To see a brand like that embracing a greater range of sizes… it's really special.'

"Said (left) and Cherif (right) Kouachi grew up in a specialist boarding school in the tourist village of Treignac after their parents both died . A former teacher of the brothers who attacked a magazine office in Paris said the boys were more interested in football than religion at school but were too dim-witted to avoid extremists after they left. Said, 34, and Cherif Kouachi, 32, murdered 12 people in central Paris last week before fleeing to a print works where they were shot by armed police while saying they were ready to 'die as martyrs.' But a former teacher who helped to raise the orphaned pair at a school in the holiday village of Treignac recalls them as happy, popular and trustworthy children who had little interest in religion. Said and Cherif, who are of French-Algerian descent, were sent to the Monedieres centre in the picturesque Mastiff region in 1994 by their mother, who was unable to raise them after their father died suddenly. Once at the boarding school, which specialises is raising children with social needs, they were largely isolated from the outside world. There they took up sports, showing a passion for football, while also taking regular lessons. Francoise Ronfet, a retired biology teacher from the school, grew particularly fond of Cherif. He was not especially bright, she said, but showed a willingness to learn. She had fewer dealings with Said, Cherif's older brother, but said his level of intellect was 'low'. She said that she noticed Said praying but that religion did not form a large part of his upbringing. While the boys were in school their mother died and when the time came for them to leave at age 18 they had no family to return to. Instead they moved together to a council apartment in Paris's poor 19th arrondissement where they fell into a life of drug dealing and petty crime before being taken in by the Buttes Chaumont gang. Francoise Ronfet, a former teacher at the school, recalled Cherif (left) as a well behaved boy who loved football and didn't practice religion. She said his brother Said (right) had a 'low' intellect and prayed occasionally . When the brothers left the isolated school they returned to Paris where they were taken in by an extremist gang . The group, which also included Deli attacker Amedy Coulibaly, 32, was lead by two radical Imams who preached jihad. Speaking about Cherif's move to Paris, Ms Ronfet told The Times: 'He joined up with little groups of hooligans. They ran rings around him because he was relatively fragile and allowed himself to be led by the nose. 'I think it's from then on that he started spending time in the mosques. But when he was at college in Treignac he had nothing to do with religion. I don't think he was a practising Muslim. Farid Benyettou, a janitor-turned-preacher who lead the Buttes Chaumont gang  is the extremist preacher credited with radicalising the Kouachis . 'As for his brother, Said, his level of intellect was very low. I think he used to pray. When I saw the photos on the TV, I was really very surprised the boys turned out like that.' It was a cleric named Farid Benyettou, a janitor-turned-preacher, who was responsible for radicalising the boys, teaching that waging jihad was a way to get closer to God. Both of the brothers were questioned in 2005 over their links to the Buttes Chaumont gang after it began sending groups of young men to Iraq who never returned. Neither of them were formally charged but in 2008 Cherif was brought back to court after he was caught trying to get on a flight to Damascus with an operating manual for an AK-47. Cherif, who had married a woman named Izzana Hamyd the same year, was sent to jail for three years, though he only served 18 months before being released. While inside he began working out and met another radical cleric named Djamel Beghal, who had previously attended the Finsbury Park mosque Abu Hamza preached at. After being freed from prison, Cherif was photographed by French intelligence visiting Beghal in Murat in central France in April 2010. Despite his radically altered persona, it seems he never lost his childhood passion for football, as he was also videoed kicking a ball around with three suspected extremists. Later that year, Cherif was arrested for a third time over a plot to break Smain Ali Belkacem out of jail after he was imprisoned for life over the bombing of a Paris railway station in 1995. Police papers filed at the time also make mention of Said, though officers later decided there was not enough evidence to charge the pair. Another member of Buttes Chaumont was Amedy Coulibaly, 32, who shot a policewoman dead in Paris the day after the Koouachis attacked, before killing four more in a Jewish supermarket . Little is known about what became of the brothers between that date and last week's massacre at the offices of Charlie Hebdo. French security sources have suggested that the brothers could have been in Syria as recently as last year, while it is also thought the pair could have travelled to Yemen where they received military training while serving with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Cherif is believed to have had at least one child in that time. Said married Soumya Bouarfa in Paris in March 2012 and has at least two children.","Said and Cherif Kouachi were raised in boarding school in central France .

The Home Office document, marked restricted but leaked ahead of a crunch vote by MPs, reveals there are about 12,000 foreign prisoners in the UK – and another 4,000 who have been freed after serving a sentence but not deported. Their offences include murder, manslaughter, rape of a minor and kidnap. The number of foreign prisoners is growing and attempts to remove them are often futile, a secret Government report warns . The report predicts that numbers of more serious offenders will increase and admits: ‘Some countries are extremely difficult to remove a non-compliant person to... these include Iran, Somalia and Zimbabwe.’ The leak came as rebel Tory MPs will today threaten to back a Commons motion that would make it easier to deport foreign criminals after their sentence. Dominic Raab, whose move is supported by more than 100 MPs, said the leaked document was ‘a chilling analysis of the growing threat of foreign national criminals’. He added: ‘Today MPs have a chance to steel our deportation capacity to protect the public. We must take it.’ Mr Raab’s amendment to the Government’s Immigration Bill would require judges to deport foreign criminals jailed for over a year, unless they were at risk of torture or murder on return. It would effectively overrule the controversial Article 8 protection for family life contained in the European Convention on Human Rights used by some foreigners to avoid deportation. David Cameron has indicated some sympathy with the idea but Home Secretary Theresa May is said to have vetoed Government support for the change. Dominic Raab, whose move is supported by more than 100 MPs, said the leaked document was 'a chilling analysis of the growing threat of foreign national criminals' Nick Clegg is also said to have raised concerns. The Home Office report, which appears to date from 2012, says there were 10,779 foreigners serving time in UK prisons, 1,431 who had served time but were still detained pending removal, and 4,238 now ‘non-detained’ because there was ‘no reasonable expectation of removal in the short term’. It warns that polling data shows that removing foreign prisoners at the end of their sentence is considered ‘one of the key priorities’ for the UK Border Agency by the public.’ ‘Individual cases continue to receive high-profile media coverage, more recently focusing on the UK’s inability to deport individuals due to Article 8 of the ECHR,’ it continues. The report warns that the number of ‘non-detained, time-served’ foreign prisoners has ‘increased due to accumulation of hard to remove cases and longer time spent in the UK’. It says data from late in 2011 showed that 111 ‘non-detained’ foreigners had committed the most serious offences, including murder, manslaughter, rape, rape of a minor, sex offences against children, indecent assault of a minor or terrorist offences. A further 485 had committed serious offences including attempted murder, attempted rape, kidnapping, sex offences, violent crime, indecent assault, armed robbery and conspiracy to murder, kidnap or defraud. Last night, Home Secretary Theresa May attempted to appease the Tory backbenches by promising to strip British terror suspects of their citizenship . ‘The absolute numbers of these types of offenders will increase,’ the report adds, suggesting the total number of serious offenders will rise to 646 by April of this year. Last night, Home Secretary Theresa May attempted to appease the Tory backbenches by promising to strip British terror suspects of their citizenship. Under the tough new rules, officials would be able to remove a fanatic’s passport even if it leaves them technically stateless. The move would mean that, if the extremist ever left Britain, they would find it near impossible to return. But the last-minute intervention failed to quell Tory anger over the Home Office’s handling of the flagship Immigration Bill, which returns to the Commons today. The Home Office has tabled dozens of amendments to the legislation and limited the time available for debate to just four hours - meaning that the rebels’ concerns may not even be discussed. Mr Raab added: ‘The government is trying the old trick of squeezing awkward amendments off the agenda. It beggars belief that the most popular amendment, with cross-partly support, isn’t guaranteed even a minute of debating time. It risks strengthening the perception that the political elite won’t address the issues ordinary people care about - and that is UKIP’s feeding ground.’ Fellow Tory MP Peter Bone described the Home Office’s handling of the issue as ‘a complete farce’. He added: ‘It looks very much like the Government is going to use Parliamentary tactics to try and stifle debate on issues that are of huge concern to the public. If ministers get their way we will have no vote and no more than a token debate - it is a gift to UKIP.’ Dozens of Conservative MPs have signed another amendment that would re-impose the restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian immigrants which lapsed at the beginning of this month. Ministers say the move would be illegal under EU law. Government sources said Mrs May was planning to come forward with her own proposals for curbing the use of Article 8 in the coming months. ‘There is a lot of sympathy for doing something on this, but it has to be legally watertight,’ a source said. The Home Secretary already has the power to take away British citizenship from those with dual nationality. To date, she has confiscated the UK passports of 16 individuals alleged to have links with terror groups. But she now intends to go much further by also removing citizenship from people who gave up their original nationality to become British. A spokesman for legal charity Reprieve said: ‘This is a very alarming development, which reverses a long-standing ban on citizenship-stripping where doing so would leave someone stateless. ‘It would give the Home Secretary the power to tear up people’s passports without any need for the kind of due process we might once have expected as British citizens.’ A Home Office source said last night that the department ‘doesn’t recognise’ the content of the leaked report and it was ‘not true’ that deportation efforts to some countries were becoming futile.","Their offences include murder, manslaughter, rape of a minor and kidnap .

"When her beloved husband of more than 30 years suffered a stroke, Karen Howe turned to her local council for support. The mother-of-two asked if they could provide a care home place, explaining that he had begun to lash out in confusion and she was struggling to cope. But Mrs Howe was stunned when officials refused – and suggested that if her husband was becoming difficult, perhaps she should consider leaving him. Disgusted: Karen Howe, 55, said she 'felt sick' when the council said she could perhaps consider leaving her husband who had suffered a stroke when she asked for support . The ‘insulting’ advice from social workers at Nottinghamshire County Council came after 68-year-old Mr Howe was left partially paralysed and prone to bouts of aggressive behaviour after a stroke several weeks ago. In a letter to the couple’s solicitor, a social work manager said that Mrs Howe ‘does not have to continue to live with her husband if she no longer wishes’, adding: ‘Mr and Mrs Howe may need to explore the usual processes for couples who no longer wish to remain living together, i.e. take account of savings and assets before separating.’ Mrs Howe, 55, who has two adult children, said the advice to leave her husband was ‘insulting and bullying’. She told the Mail: ‘One of the social workers told me I should either sell the house or divorce Norman in order to fund his care. I felt sick. It was insulting.’ She added: ‘I love him, I want to care for him but he needs proper nursing care.’ Mrs Howe, from Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, said she attributed the advice to a desire on the part of council managers ‘to save as much money as possible’. Devoted: Norman and Karen on their wedding day in 1982 - she said the advice to leave him was 'insulting' Mr Howe, a former coal miner, and his wife have few assets beyond the house they own. And while a council cannot seize the home of a couple to pay for care, the value of a house can be taken into account if the only inhabitant is the person who needs a care home place. The family’s solicitor Tim Davies said: ‘My concern is that this gentleman is being refused nursing home care by the local authority because they would be forced to meet the costs.’ He said that Mr Howe’s stroke left him ‘with a number of severe medical issues which have left him bedbound’, adding that ‘he has [also] developed severe challenging behaviour’. Managers at King’s Mill Hospital have offered NHS funding to pay for Mr Howe’s medical bills should he enter a nursing home. However, the offer is for £110 a week – several hundred pounds short of the full bill for a home. And social workers have said that Mr Howe should remain at the couple’s house, with carers visiting four times a day. A letter to Mr Davies from Gregg Dunning, a social worker based at the hospital, said: ‘Our assessment ... indicates that Mr Howe’s needs can be met in the community and a nursing home placement is not essential.’ Caroline Baria, director for care at Nottinghamshire County Council, said the authority couldn’t comment on specific care cases. However she added: ‘We support people to return home after a hospital stay where they are able’ and said social workers are advised not to get involved in residents’ marital issues. Jailed, carers who threatened dementia patient with eviction . A trio of bullying carers were yesterday jailed for waging a campaign of terror and humiliation on vulnerable dementia patients in a nursing home. Elderly residents were subjected to ‘deplorable’ physical and emotional abuse over the course of several months – with one even being told she faced eviction and her belongings had been sent to a tip. Confused patients also had their hair pulled and were made to pose in degrading positions at the Bupa-run care home. Behind bars: Chevonne Benson, 23, (left) and William Bowman, 22 (right) were jailed for a campaign of terror on vulnerable dementia patients . Relatives of those who suffered at the hands of William Bowman, 22, Chevonne Benson, 23, and Claire Strong, 21, wept in court as they heard graphic details of the abuse. They condemned the ‘disgusting’ acts carried out at Beacon Edge nursing home in Penrith, Cumbria, after being told by police that the trio saw their actions as ‘a joke’. The abuse only came to light when an employee blew the whistle on her colleagues, prompting a police investigation. The 11 victims were aged 72 to 97 and all but one were female. Passing sentence at Carlisle Crown Court, Judge Barbara Forrester said the group ‘showed no humanity or compassion to these elderly victims. It was cold, calculated abuse.’ Bowman was jailed for three-and-a-half years after admitting eight offences of ill-treatment of a person without capacity and was convicted of sexually touching a woman. Benson was given three years after admitting ten counts of ill treatment, while Strong was jailed for one year after admitting three similar offences. The deplorable physical and emotional abuse took place at Beacon Edge nursing home (pictured) in Cumbria . The catalogue of abuse stretched from January to September 2013, and included Bowman pulling the hair of a 90-year-old dementia sufferer and being photographed looking up the nightdress of a 96-year-old woman. Benson also targeted an 82-year-old retired nurse, telling her she was to be evicted because she had failed to pay her bills, and that her belongings had been sent to a tip. The three carers, who had no previous convictions, have been banned from ever working in the nursing profession again. Bupa said more than 20 members of staff had been suspended from its four homes in the town in the last year, but denied the suspensions were linked to abuse by the trio. A Care Quality Commission inspection in July 2013 did not raise concerns about abuse.","Karen Howe, 55, sought help from council when her husband had a stroke .

"Google has taken action after its search engine was found to be suggesting vile racist terms when users searched for a number of UK cities including Bradford, Leicester and Birmingham. The search engine was found to be making crude and offensive suggestions when users typed in 'Why is' followed by the name of a city. For example, if a user typed in the phrase 'Why is Bradford...' the site automatically suggested the search 'Why is Bradford so full of P****.' Typing in the phrase with Leicester and Birmingham also produced similar results. Google took action after its search engine was found to be producing racist slurs. If users typed in 'Why is' followed by a number of UK cities it would auto-complete the search to 'so full of P****'  (library image) Google took immediate action against the Autocomplete suggestions and removed all of them from the site. Certain other racist insults do remain, however. The site said the suggestions are produced by combining algorithms that predict what people will search for with popular searches. The internet giant said: 'Autocomplete is a feature of Google search that offers predicted searches to help you more quickly find what you’re looking for. 'These searches are produced automatically based on a number of factors including the popularity of search terms. 'We periodically update our systems to improve Search, so the terms that appear in Autocomplete may change over time.' Speaking with Matt Quinton at The Sun, Labour MP for Leicester East Keith Vaz said: 'I am shocked these search options come up. Google boss Eric Schmidt. Last year, he confirmed the site would block all links to child abuse online . 'It is totally unacceptable and I will be raising this matter in Parliament' Google has come under fire in the past for acting slowly to remove or block indecent images online. The company initially refused to sign up to an alert system that would block people from viewing vile images on the internet, saying it had its own methods of blocking such material. At the time, The Home Affairs Committee, which is chaired by Mr Vaz, accused 'complacent' internet service providers and search engines of being 'far too laid back about what takes place on their watch'. Speaking in July last year, he said: 'The Prime Minister was right to highlight the responsibility of the internet service providers, search engines and social media sites. 'They are far too laid back about what takes place on their watch and they need to do more to take inappropriate content down. If they do not act, the Government should legislate.' However, in November the company's CEO Eric Schmidt said the search engine would block all links to child sexual abuse online. In a piece in the Daily Mail, he wrote: 'We've fine-tuned Google Search to prevent links to child sexual abuse material from appearing in our results.' In 2012, Google rejected the White House’s request to remove a controversial anti-Islam YouTube clip that sparked violent anti-American protests across the globe. Instead the internet company, who own YouTube, censored the video in several locations as well as blocking it in Egypt and Libya - where U.S. embassies were stormed by protestors enraged over the depiction of the Prophet Mohammad as a fraud and philanderer.","Insults appeared when users typed in 'Why is' followed by number of cities .

"Racists aboard a packed train in Belgium snatched control of its PA system to tell Jews to get off at Auschwitz 'and take a short shower'. The suspects were able to access the Namur to Brussels train's tannoy during the peak of the evening rush hour to make the reference to the notorious Nazi concentration camp. One said in French: 'Ladies and gentlemen, we are approaching Auschwitz. All Jews are requested to disembark and take a short shower.' An SNCB train like the one involved: The suspects were able to access the Namur to Brussels train's tannoy during the peak of the evening rush hour to make the reference to the notorious Nazi concentration camp . Auschwitz was the scene of one of the worst mass exterminations of the Second World War where, over the course of several years, more than a million Jews, gypsies and others were gassed or worked to death. Belgian rail company SNCB has filed an incitement to hatred complaint with police over the incident at about 5pm on January 31. A passenger also reported it to Viviane Teitelbaum, a Jewish MP in the assembly of the Brussels region. She told Belgian broadcaster RTL that the witness suspected that it was teenagers who had got hold of the keys that conductors use to make announcements over the train's tannoy. Auschwitz was a network of concentration camps and extermination centres built and operated by the Nazis in parts of southern Poland which were annexed by Germany during the Second World War. A dominant symbol of the Holocaust, it went on to become a major site of the Nazis' 'Final Solution to the Jewish question', with Jews delivered to its gas chambers from all over German occupied Europe. 'Work makes free': The main gate of the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz I, which was the centre of a network of camps where more than a million Jews, gypsies, Russians and others were murdered by the Nazis . Guards would tell new arrivals selected for extermination that they were to take a shower and undergo delousing, before leading them into chambers disguised as communal showers. There the victims - mainly women, children and the elderly who were not considered useful enough specimens for the labour camps - would be locked in and gassed with the pesticide Zyklon B. It is believed that at least 1.1million prisoners died at Auschwitz, either by gassing or by being worked to death, 90 per cent of them Jews. Others deported to Auschwitz included Poles, Romany gypsies, Soviet PoWs, Jehovas Witnesses and tens of thousands of people of other diverse nationalities. Thierry Ney, a spokesman for SNCB, told RTL that misuse of trains' PA systems is an offence punishable by a fine or prison sentence. He added that a complaint would be filed to Belgian police. 'We condemn the abuse of the intercom and the words spoken,' he said.","At least 1.1million died at the Nazi death camp in German-occupied Poland .

"A pair of French thieves posing as police officers stole £173,000 in cash from a Saudi diplomat minutes after he had landed in Paris after they pulled him over on a busy motorway. The robbers took a suitcase from the boot of the official's car which contained 162,000 Euros, $30,000 and £10,000. Driving a car equipped with flashing blue lights with 'police' written on it, the thieves pulled the diplomat over on the A1 just outside of the French capital. Theft: The Saudi diplomat was pulled over on the A1 motorway close to Paris by two armed men posing as police officers . The armed men demanded an inspection of the car boot and said they were 'confiscating' the suitcase before telling the official, who had just landed at the private Le Bourget airport on Monday, he was 'free to go'. A French police spokesman said: 'It is unclear why he was carrying so much cash. Newly arrived: The diplomat had landed only minutes earlier at Le Bourget airport close to Paris . 'We do not know if the robbers were working on a tip off or simply got lucky.' He confirmed that officers in the Seine-Saint-Denis department were investigating the theft. The robbery is the latest in a string of thefts on wealthy visitors to Paris. A group of 23 Chinese tourists were robbed in a restaurant also near Le Bourget soon after arriving in France back in March. They were attacked by three armed men who stole their passports and around 7,500 Euros in cash. Jena-Frangois Zhou, who runs Ansel Travel, which caters to Chinese tourists said: 'It's becoming a scourge. Since last year, we've seen attacks almost daily.' In May, a group of France's most prestigious luxury goods companies, including Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Dior and Hermes, united to complain that robberies on tourists were frightening off their wealthy foreign customers.","The diplomat had only just landed at Le Bourget private airport .

"North Korea is digging a new underground tunnel as they apparently prepare to carry out a third nuclear test, according to South Korean intelligence officials. Satellite images show that the final work is being carried out for a test at a site in Punggye-r, in the north-east of the country, where tests were conducted in 2006 and 2009. The report was released as North Korea prepares to launch a long-range rocket that Washington - which others say is a cover for testing missile technology that could be used to fire on the U.S. They announced plans last month to . launch an 'observation satellite' during . mid-April celebrations as they mark 100th anniversary of the birth of North . Korean founder Kim Il Sung. Scroll down to see the potential route of the missile . Celebrations: North Korea announced plans last month to launch an observation satellite using a three-stage rocket during mid-April celebrations of the 100th anniversary of the birth of North Korean founder Kim Il Sung . Anniversary: North Koreans walk in front of two portraits, one of founding leader Kim Il-Sung (L) and the other of his son Kim Jong-Il in Pyongyang . David Cameron has warned North Korea that it would be 'unacceptable' to defy calls for rocket tests to be abandoned. Speaking on a visit to nearby Japan, the . Prime Minister urged the state to 'take a different path' and engage . with the international community. Mr Cameron and counterpart Yoshihiko Noda discussed the threat from North Korea when they held talks today. 'On the issue of North Korea we have . said very clearly and the Japanese and others have said that it is . unacceptable to launch these satellites and missiles,' Mr Cameron told . TV station News Zero. 'Now there is a new leadership in North . Korea they should be taking this opportunity to change their approach, . engaging with the rest of the word and stopping this sort of activity. 'If they go ahead it should be condemned in the strongest possible terms by the UN Security Council. 'We have to send the clearest possible . message... Clearly North Korea is quite a bankrupt country; they are . unable to feed their own people and interestingly America has been . helping. 'We need to explain that they need to . take a different path. They need to do less in terms of weapons and the . military and more engagement with the rest of the world. 'If they launch this satellite, that is clearly a breach of the UN resolution that has already been ratified.' Observers fear a repeat of 2009, when international criticism of the North's last long-range rocket launch prompted Pyongyang to walk away from nuclear disarmament negotiations and, weeks later, conduct its second nuclear test. The report by South Korean intelligence officials said: 'North Korea is covertly preparing for a third nuclear test, which would be another grave provocation. 'North Korea is digging up a new underground tunnel at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, in addition to its existing two underground tunnels, and it has been confirmed that the excavation works are in the final stages.' Dirt believed to have been brought from other areas is piled at the tunnel entrance, the report said, something experts say is needed to fill up tunnels before a nuclear test. The dirt indicates there is a 'high possibility' that North Korea will stage a nuclear test as plugging tunnels was the final step taken during its two previous underground nuclear tests. The U.S., Japan, Britain and other . nations have urged North Korea to cancel the launch, warning that firing . the long-range rocket would violate U.N. resolutions and North Korea's . promise to refrain from engaging in nuclear and missile activity.

"Google is set to reveal a completely new version of its Google Glass eyewear next year, it has been revealed. The troubled product has failed to fire the public's imagination, with wearers dubbed 'glassholes' and even many Google employees abandoning them. However, an new version with chips made by Intel will go on sale next year. Scroll down for video . Goggle's Glass is expected to get a total makeover, and will switch chip suppliers to Intel . 'Intel plans to promote Glass to companies such as hospital networks and manufacturers, while developing new workplace uses for the device, ' The Wall Street Journal claims . According to the report, Glass will switch from its dead Texas Instruments chip to a processor built by Intel and will get a full hardware refresh. Recently it emerged that the consumer version, which Google promised would go on sale this year, has now been delayed until 2015 - raising questions over its future. The . Googler, who heads up the top-secret lab which developed Glass, . has hardly given up on the product - he recently wore his pair . to the beach. But Brin's timing is not propitious, coming as many . developers and early Glass users are losing interest in the . much-hyped, $1,500 test version of the product: a camera, . processor and stamp-sized computer screen mounted to the edge of . eyeglass frames. Where's the Glass? Sergey Brin was spotted without Google's specs at a Silicon Valley red-carpet event on Sunday. Since they were unveiled, he has rarely been seen without them. Google itself has pushed back the . Glass roll out to the mass market. While Glass may find some specialized, even lucrative, uses . in the workplace, its prospects of becoming a consumer hit in . the near future are slim, many developers say. Of 16 Glass app makers contacted by Reuters, nine said that . they had stopped work on their projects or abandoned them, . mostly because of the lack of customers or limitations of the . device. Three more have switched to developing for business, . leaving behind consumer projects. However, plenty of larger developers remain with Glass.

Google founder Sergey Brin (L) and designer Diane von Furstenberg sit and watch the rehearsal for her Spring/Summer 2013 collection show during New York Fashion Week, where  new Google Glass frameswere launched in a bid to make them more appealing. Glass was the first project to emerge from Google's X division, the secretive group tasked with developing 'moonshot'products such as self-driving cars. Glass and wearable devices overall amount to a new technology, as smartphones once were,that will likely take time to evolve into a product that clickswith consumers. 'If there was 200 million Google Glasses sold, it would be a . different perspective,' said Tom Frencel, the Chief Executive of Little Guy Games, which put development of a Glass game on hold this year and is looking at other platforms, including the Facebook Inc-owned virtual-reality goggles Oculus Rift. 'There's no market at this point,' Several key Google employees instrumental to developing . Glass have left the company in the last six months, including . lead developer Babak Parviz, electrical engineering chief Adrian . Wong, and Ossama Alami, director of developer relations. And a Glass funding consortium created by Google Ventures . and two of Silicon Valley's biggest venture capitalists, Kleiner . Perkins Caufield & Byers and Andreessen Horowitz, quietly . deleted its website, routing users to the main Glass site. Google insists it is committed to Glass, with hundreds of . engineers and executives working on it, as well as new . fashionista boss Ivy Ross, a former Calvin Klein executive. 'We are completely energized and as energized as ever about . the opportunity that wearables and Glass in particular . represent,' said Glass Head of Business Operations Chris . O'Neill. 'We are as committed as ever to a consumer launch. 'That is . going to take time and we are not going to launch this product . until it's absolutely ready,' O'Neill said. After an initial burst of enthusiasm, signs that consumers are giving up on Glass have been building.Some developers recently have felt unsupported by investorsand, at times, Google itself. Brin had predicted a launch this year, but 2015 is now the . most likely date, a person familiar with the matter said. After an initial burst of enthusiasm, signs that consumers . are giving up on Glass have been building. Some developers recently have felt unsupported by investors . and, at times, Google itself. The Glass Collective, the funding consortium co-run by . Google Ventures, invested in only three or four small start-ups . by the beginning of this year, a person familiar with the . statistics said. A Google Ventures spokeswoman declined to comment on the . number of investments and said the Web site was closed for . simplicity. 'We just found it's easier for entrepreneurs to come . to us directly,' she said. The lack of a launch date has given some developers the . impression that Google still treats Glass as an experiment. Google dubbed the first set of several thousand Glass users . as 'Explorers.' But as the Explorers hit the streets, they drew . stares and jokes. Some people viewed the device, capable of . surreptitious video recording, as an obnoxious privacy . intrusion, deriding the once-proud Explorers as 'Glassholes.' 'It looks super nerdy,' said Shevetank Shah, a Washington, . DC-based consultant, whose Google Glass now gathers dust in a . drawer. 'I'm a card carrying nerd, but this was one card too . many.' Glass now sells on eBay for as little as half list price. 'It's not a big enough platform to play on seriously,' said . Matthew Milan, founder of Toronto-based software firm Normative . Design, which put on hold a Glass app for logging exercise and . biking. Mobile game company Glu Mobile, known for its . popular 'Kim Kardashian: Hollywood' title, was one of the first . to launch a game on Glass. Spellista, a puzzler released a year . ago, is still available, but Glu has discontinued work on it, a . spokesman for the company said. Another developer, Sean McCracken, won $10,000 in a contest . last year for creating an aliens-themed video game for Glass, . Psyclops, but Google never put it on the official hub for Glass . apps, making it tougher to find. He has quit working on updates. Still, there are some enthusiastic developers. Cycling and . running app Strava finds Glass well-suited for its users, who . want real-time data on their workouts, said David Lorsch, vice . president of business development. And entrepreneur Jake . Steinerman said it is ideal for his company, DriveSafe, which . detects if people are falling asleep at the wheel. In April, Google launched the Glass at Work program to help . make the device useful for specific industries, such as . healthcare and manufacturing. So far the effort has resulted in . apps that are being tested or used at companies such as Boeing . and Yum Brands' Taco Bell. Google is selling Glass in bulk to some businesses, offering . two-for-one discounts.","Sergey Brin appeared in San Francisco without trademark specs .

"Most people work out if they are overweight by stepping on to the bathroom scales or seeing if they can still fit into their favourite clothes. But doctors rely on a more scientific formula, called the Body Mass Index (BMI), which involves dividing a patient’s weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared. For nearly 200 years this has been the gold standard by which the nation’s weight patterns have been monitored. Scroll down for video . These days, BMI is a household term, but now many scientists are asking just how useful it really is, because it fails to accurately assess your body fat . These days, BMI is a household term. But now many scientists are asking just how useful it really is, because it fails to accurately assess your body fat. For example, a supremely fit and muscly athlete might be classed as obese despite carrying little or no body fat, simply because muscle is more dense — i.e. heavier — than fat. At the other end of the scale, a slim man with little muscle mass and a stomach paunch could be classed as healthy, despite the fact that he may be carrying a relatively large amount of fat around the waistline. This is important because visceral fat, which lies in and around the abdomen, is thought to be a key risk factor in the development of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Visceral fat secretes molecules that, among other things, lead to damaging inflammation in blood vessels. This flaw in BMI is why even super-fit people can be told to go on extreme diets because they register as overweight or obese on the BMI chart. Scientists are questioning the reliability of measuring fat by Body Mass Index (BMI). As a result of the flaws in this system, scientists are now turning their attention to new ways of measuring body fat. One is the A Body Shape Index (ABSI), which was developed two years ago by researchers at the City College of New York . Last month, Anita Albrecht, a professional bodybuilder and personal trainer from East London, was told she needed to lose weight after a nurse diagnosed her as overweight, based on her BMI score, during a routine visit to an NHS clinic. Miss Albrecht, who finished sixth in the 2012 Miss Galaxy Universe bodybuilding competition, was told she needed to go on a 1,000-calorie-a-day diet — half the recommended intake for a woman. At 4ft 11in and weighing 10st 3lb, she was found to have a BMI of 29, officially ‘overweight’ and borderline obese. Even in his prime, rugby star Jonny Wilkinson was reportedly classed as overweight according to his BMI. ‘Where BMI is really useful is for measuring trends in large populations,’ says Dr David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum. ‘That’s because when you look at large numbers, the big, muscly types and the thin unhealthy types tend to cancel each other out, so you can get an average over thousands of people. The big problem is with individual patients.’ As a result of the flaws in this system, scientists are now turning their attention to new ways of measuring body fat. One is the A Body Shape Index (ABSI), which was developed two years ago by researchers at the City College of New York. A man measuring his BMI. Scientists think it could be inaccurate because a slim man with little muscle mass and a stomach paunch could be classed as healthy, despite the fact that he may be carrying a relatively large amount of fat around the waistline . It uses a similar formula to the one used for BMI, but adds in waist circumference, so takes visceral fat into account. Computer software then predicts the chances of dying from weight-related problems. For example, a score below one means there is less chance of dying prematurely from obesity-related conditions. But a score of two predicts the patient is twice as likely to die from obesity as the average person of their age and sex. A recent study, published in the online medical journal PLOS ONE, found this way of measuring the body was highly accurate at predicting deaths from obesity-related illnesses. The problem is while BMI can be worked out on a calculator, the ABSI is more complicated and relies on computer software to convert the measurements into your risk of dying prematurely. Another new approach is the Body Adiposity Index (BAI), developed at the University of Southern California in 2011. This uses a formula based on dividing your height by hip circumference to roughly calculate the body fat percentage. If the score is less than 23, this suggests you have healthy levels of body fat. Anything between 23 and 29 is overweight and 29 or over obese. So a man who is 5ft 9in but weighs in at 15st, with 44in hips, would have a BMI of 31 — making him only just inside the obese range. But his BAI score would be 31.2 — indicating dangerously high levels of fat around the waistline. In other words, it’s a better insight as to how his fat levels are likely to affect his health. Professor Richard Bergman, who developed the BAI, says it gives a good indication of fat levels whatever the patient’s weight. But research has suggested it does tend to overestimate the amount of body fat in men and underestimate it in women due to statistical flaws. British experts stress that neither of the new scoring systems is used in the NHS and, for most doctors examining patients on a day-to-day basis, the most important factor is their tummy size. ‘Put simply, if they have a big belly, then they have a weight problem and they need management,’ says Dr Haslam. ‘I use waist circumference as a measure because it’s manageable.’ Diabetes UK says a woman should consider herself at risk if her waist reaches 31.5in (80cm), a white or black man 37in (94cm) and South Asian men 35in (90cm). The threshold for the South Asian population is lower because they tend to deposit visceral fat more easily.","Body Mass Index (BMI) has been base for monitoring fat for nearly 200 years .

"Craters from asteroid impacts may be one of the best places to look for life on Mars, a study suggests. Scientists have found microbes thriving more than a mile under a U.S. crater where a space rock smashed into the Earth 35 million years ago. They believe craters may provide a refuge protecting bugs from events such as ice ages or global warming. Search for life: Craters on Mars could hold the key to finding lifeforms on the red planet . Drilling beneath crater sites on Mars could potentially uncover similar life forms, say the scientists. Researchers from the University of Edinburgh drilled almost two kilometres (1.24 miles) below one of the biggest asteroid impact craters on Earth at Chesapeake Bay in Virginia. Samples revealed microbes spread unevenly through the rock. Heat from an asteroid collision would kill everything living at the surface. But deep fractures in the rock would allow water and nutrients to flow in and support life, the researchers believe. Professor Charles Cockell, from the University of Edinburgh's School of Physics and Astronomy, said: 'The deeply fractured areas around impact craters can provide a safe haven in which microbes can flourish for long periods of time. 'Our findings suggest that the subsurface of craters on Mars might be a promising place to search for evidence of life.' The findings are published in the journal Astrobiology.",Drilling under Mars crater sites similar to those on Earth could uncover life .
"Fast food chain In-N-Out Burger may only have outlets in five states but its reputation for fine hamburgers is known throughout the land.

'Monkey Style' burgers: In-N-Out employees won't admit to its existence, but that doesn't have to stop you from simply creating your own . Inspired by chat on Twitter about the emergence of a new 'Monkey Style' burger, the food blog Foodbeast took a trip to an In-N-Out Burger to see what all the fuss was about. The 'Monkey Style' burger is a hamburger but with addition of a portion of  'Animal Style' fries (that's french fries covered with spread, cheese and grilled onions) sitting alongside the patty in between the buns. The Foodbeast crew couldn't get an In-N-Out employee to admit on camera to the existence of the 'Monkey Style' burger, but that didn't stop them from simply creating there own. Earlier this year a chef at an In-N-Out Burger revealed some of the secret food experiments that go on in the kitchen after the last customers has left.

Unfortunately these delicious sounding delights are unlikely to be available to eat any time soon. The company’s menu has barely changed since the chain was launched 65 years old in Southern California. The company already has a 'secret menu', which it actually publicizes it on the company’s website and includes the ‘Protein Style’ Burger, which is a burger wrapped in crisp Iceberg lettuce instead of a bun, ‘Animal-Style Fries,’ which has grilled onions, pickles and cheese piled on top of French fries. Healthy option: This 'Protein Style' Burger, which wraps the burger in crisp Iceberg lettuce rather than a bun, is available on the secret menu . Another noteworthy non-menu item is the ‘Neapolitan Shake,’ a creamy blend of chocolate, vanilla and strawberry ice cream.

"A young woman who had four teeth removed and her jaw broken, fitted with metal plates and then realigned to fix her lifelong underbite has said she finally feels her face looks the way it was meant to - even though she didn't realise quite how much it would change her face. Sophie Yates, 24, from London, had underbite correction surgery - known as orthognathic surgery - on the NHS at the age of 18 to remove the 2cm horizontal gap between her top and bottom front teeth that had made her self-conscious since the age of 10. Speaking to MailOnline, Sophie, who now works in marketing in the City, said her awkward underbite meant she was bullied as a child growing up in a small village in East Kent, and that 'people often asked why my teeth didn't line up'. Sophie Yates graduating from Royal Holloway, University of London, after her surgery, left, and before the operation, right . She said: 'My jaw was just growing in a way it shouldn't have been and I was really self-conscious about it. People did bully me a bit - my sister probably the most! 'It wasn't so much painful as really awkward to hold in that position, and it always felt more natural to have my mouth open than closed.' When she was 10, Sophie's orthodontist said hers was an 'extreme case', and that she should seriously think about having the surgery when she was 18 and her bones stopped growing, otherwise the problem was going to continue getting worse and worse. 'Because of that I always felt I had the wrong face,' she said. 'I knew I was going to have the operation so I was just waiting for it to be done so I could look like I was supposed to.' Sophie, pictured after the operation, said: 'I always knew I was going to have the operation so I was just waiting for it to be done so I could look like I was supposed to' Sophie said: 'I suppose my reasons for . having the surgery were partly aesthetic and partly because it was . uncomfortable. But it was going to keep growing . and I didn't want to wait and see how bad it might get' Sophie visited the orthodontist every three months growing up and had braces for 10 years. Then, in 2009, when she reached 18 and began studying at Royal Holloway, University of London, the visits became more frequent. 'I went about once every week, and then in the run-up to the operation I had four of my top back teeth removed to make room for where my jaw would be afterwards,' she said. She added: 'I suppose my reasons for having the surgery were partly aesthetic and partly because it was uncomfortable. But it was going to keep growing . and I didn't want to wait and see how bad it might get.' Sophie in the weeks immediately following the operation, when her face swelled up . Sophie in the months following the operation, before her face swelling subsided, left, and the passport photo which led to her being stalled in customs in China after officials refused to believe it was her . Sophie spoke to a number of people . who'd had the surgery - which costs between £4,000 and £5,000 if done . privately - and others who'd had operations to correct overbites, and . says she wasn't at all nervous, having prepared herself for the . procedure for almost a decade. The operation - which was last week . reported in MailOnline to be on the rise among women in South Korea - . involved staying two nights in hospital. While there, Sophie was put asleep under . general anaesthetic while surgeons cut away the skin between her gums . and her jaw to break the jawbone, fit it with metal plates and . reposition it correctly, sewing her gums back together with stitches. Sophie pictured after surgery, left, and before, right, when she was self-conscious about her face and people often asked why her teeth didn't fit together properly . Before having the operation Sophie says she was self-conscious about her face, and always felt it didn't look the way it was supposed to . They also made a hole in her chin into which they weaved a tube so Sophie could breathe during the operation. 'When I woke up and the painkillers wore off it was rather sore,' she said. 'Then the next day my face swelled up and the bottom half was really black and bruised.' Sophie's mouth was held together with elastic bands for one month to set her teeth and keep the stitches in place, and she could only drink through a straw ('I ate quite a lot of processed spinach!'). Sophie said: 'It's improved my confidence and made me happier - but having seen how long the healing process is I don't think I'll be getting any more cosmetic surgery for a while...' She spent a week resting in bed, took one week off university, then bravely returned to class, even though doctors said she would probably be bed-bound for a month. 'The healing process for the operation is quite long - it took seven months for the swelling to subside completely - but I could still walk so I decided to go back. Even though I couldn't speak and nobody recognised me. I had to wave to communicate with people. Speaking about the way her new face looks, Sophie said: 'Everybody asks if I had an identity crisis after my face changed - and it's true that I didn't realise quite how much it would change - but because the recovery took so long I got used to my new face gradually. 'It's funny how nobody recognises me - it can be quite a good thing when I want to avoid old friends back in Kent! - but I also look completely different on my passport which led to me being held up in China in customs recently because they didn't believe I was me!' Sophie, pictured post-operation, says her friends think her new face is an improvement and her family are really pleased for her . When asked how the operation changed her life, she said: 'I don't feel it changed my life too much, though I do prefer the way I look now - I don't miss my old face at all! I feel this is what my face was meant to look like all along. My friends think it's an improvement and my family are really pleased for me. 'I'm also lucky that I've managed to avoid most of the side effects. Some people report completely losing feeling in their face, and I only really lost a tiny bit in my chin. 'I would definitely recommend the operation to anyone who needed it. It's improved my confidence and made me happier - but having seen how long the healing process is I don't think I'll be getting any more cosmetic surgery for a while...'","Sophie Yates, 24, from East Kent, had orthognathic surgery in 2009 .

"Fears are growing that Britain's jails are becoming a hotbed of extremism after it was revealed today that nearly half the inmates of one top security prison are Muslim. Some 42 per cent of those housed at Category A Whitemoor jail - and more than a quarter of those in London prisons - consider themselves to be of Islamic faith. Experts now fear large numbers are being radicalised on the inside, where they say the spread of Jihadist ideas is rife. Figures show more than a quarter of inmates in London jails are Muslim, with one Category A jail revealing 42 per cent of its convicts follow the Islamic faith . Whitemoor inmate Zia Al Haq, left, was jailed for 18 for planning bomb attacks in London while Nezar Hindawi, right, was handed a 45-year sentence for plotting to blow up a jet . A source at Cambridgeshire jail Whitemoor told the Sunday People: 'Whitemoor is now effectively run by Muslims, many of whom are Jihadis.' A 2012 probe into the jail branded it a 'Taliban recruiting ground' and said inmates were offered protection if they converted to the religion. Shadow Justice Minister Sadiq Khan claimed ministers are not doing enough to tackle the issue of radicalisation in prisons. He said: 'In jails like Whitemoor, the Chief Inspector is on record warning of the risks of radicalisation. The Government needs to wake up to his problem before it is too late.' Shadow Justice Secretary Sadiq Khan says too little is being done to tackle the problem at jails like Whitemoor .

"Tamerlan Tsarnaev 'read extreme right wing literature' One of the Boston Bomber suspects subscribed to right-wing white supremacy literature and government conspiracy theories before the horrific attack which killed three people. Tamerlan Tsarnaev read extreme right-wing literature that claimed 'Hitler had a point' and articles about the 'rape of our gun rights', an investigation has found. The 26-year-old also had material that claimed the 9/11 attacks and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing were government conspiracies. He and his brother Dzhokhar, originally from Chechnya, allegedly carried out the bombing at the Boston marathon's finish line on April 15 which killed three people and injured more than 260. Until now the pair are believed to have carried out the attacks due to their radical jihadist beliefs. But an investigation by the BBC's Panorama programme has learnt that Tamerlan possessed white supremacist literature, and material on mass killings and how victims were murdered. After the shoot-out, it emerged that Tamerlan had become interested in Islam - but to what extent is unclear. A spokesman for Tamerlan's mosque in Cambridge, Massachuessets, said Tamerlan only prayed there occasionally, and described him as an angry man who latched onto Islam, Panorama reported. The older of the two Chechen brothers once dreamed of representing the U.S. as a boxer, it was reported, but before the bombings had turned to Islam. Tamerlan Tsarnaev read extreme right-wing literature that claimed 'Hitler had a point' and articles about the 'rape of our gun rights' Tamerlan wasn't a devout practicing Muslim, but within the last two years had begun praying five times a day, his aunt Maret Tsarnaeva has said. The relative said that the brothers and their family came to the United States in 2002 after she helped them apply for refugee status. Tsarnaev has a three-year-old daughter called Zahara with Katherine Russell, 24, who converted to Islam for her husband. He received his American citizenship on . September 11, 2012. He traveled to Russia last year and returned to the . U.S. six months later, government officials told The Associated Press. The attack at the Boston Marathon killed three and injured more than 260 people . The brothers allegedly dumped two pressure cooker bombs crammed with shrapnel and detonated them near the finish line . The eldest brother was killed in a police shootout on April 19 – four days after he and his younger brother Dzhokhar allegedly set off bombs during the Boston Marathon. The gun battle happened a day after the FBI released images of him and his younger brother at the Boston marathon. His brother, 19-year-old Dzhokhar, was found hiding in a boat parked in a suburban yard and suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the neck. They allegedly dumped two pressure cooker bombs crammed with shrapnel and detonated them near the finish line, killing three people, including an eight-year-old boy, and injuring 180 more. Three people were killed in the cowardly attack and 264 more were wounded, several of whom lost limbs. Dzhokhar, 19, has pleaded not guilty to 30 charges, including 17 that carry the death penalty.","Tamerlan Tsarnaev read right-wing literature that claimed 'Hitler had a point'

"Manchester United legend Paul Scholes cannot see how Louis van Gaal will be able to play Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao in the same team. Scholes believes that Falcao, who signed a late loan deal from Monaco on deadline day, is an exceptional player but insists his former club will only be able to field two of their big-name strikers. Writing in his column for the Independent, Scholes said: 'When I watched Falcao play for Porto, Atletico Madrid and Monaco I saw a striker with excellent movement and a goalscoring record that is simply out of this world. VIDEO Scroll down for Wayne Rooney: Falcao is sign of intent from United . Where will he fit? Radamel Falcao poses with Ryan Giggs after signing a deadline day loan deal . Who will miss out? Paul Scholes doesn't believe Louis van Gaal can field all three of his star strikers . 'Falcao creates competition in United's forward line. There is no way that Van Gaal can play Rooney, Van Persie and Falcao together. It will have to be two from three and which two it is hard to say as yet.' Scholes believes the club's astonishing summer spending spree, which has seen Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera, Marco Rojo, Angel di Maria and Daley Blind arrive at Old Trafford for a combined fee of around £150 million, has given Van Gaal a squad capable of finishing in the top four. 'Credit has to go to [executive vice-chairman] Ed Woodward, who has left Van Gaal a squad that should be capable of finishing in the top four,"" he said. 'I don't think the league title is realistic but Champions League football is the aim. Now it is over to Van Gaal to shape the team. Despite being excited by the new arrivals, Scholes admits he was disappointed to see academy graduate Danny Welbeck leave in a £16m move to Arsenal - even if he is unlikely to score 20 goals in a season. 'It shows how highly regarded Danny is that a club as big as Arsenal signed him. He will be a good signing for Arsene Wenger,' he said. 'Danny will never be a 20-25 goals-a-season man but he could get Arsenal 10 to 15.' Like our Manchester United Facebook page. Great expectations: The arrival of players like Angel di Maria have set United up for a top four finish . Not prolific: Danny Welbeck will not score 20 goals a season for Arsenal, warns Paul Scholes . Meanwhile, former manager Sir Alex Ferguson has expressed his amazement at United's spending this summer. 'Certainly it's amazing, the amount of money spent nowadays,' he said at the annual UEFA coaches seminar in Nyon. 'My personal opinion is that it's never going to change, the world is progressing, and transfer fees with it, and I don't know if there will be an end to it.

"Once the largest building in America, this abandoned asylum is now no more than a labyrinth of crumbling brick walls and dusty beds. Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital was open for more than 120 years and housed more than 7,000 patients at a time including the folk singer Woody Guthrie. But it closed for good in 2003, and despite a fierce campaign authorities in New Jersey will demolish the remains of its chapel, classrooms, dental clinic and power station within months. Left to rot: Once reputedly the largest building in America, Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital in New Jersey had more than 7,000 patients during its peak in the 1950s . The doctor won't see you now: A therapy room lies abandoned with straps still trailing across the bed. The remains of the complex will be demolished within months . Reclaimed by nature: Weeds have begun to spring up again in the condemned 19th Century buildings. The photos were taken by urban explorer Julia Wertz, 31 . Magnificent: The grand building opened its doors in 1876 and soon expanded. Its patients included the folk singer and Huntingdon's Disease sufferer Woody Guthrie . With 678,000 square feet of space, the former 'lunatic asylum' opened to relieve pressure on a nearby facility. The main building was widely said to be the largest building by footprint in the U.S. until 1943, when it was surpassed by the Pentagon - which has 6.5million square feet altogether. The Pentagon itself has long since been surpassed and America's largest building by footprint is now the Tesla Motors plant in Fremont, California. The factory opened in 2010 has the second-largest footprint in the world (5.5million sq ft), beaten only by an auction centre for flowers in the Netherlands (5.6million). Built from 1871 and opened in 1876, the hospital originally accommodated just 600 patients but soon expanded. By 1880 the patient . population was 800 and in 1903 the numbers reached 1,500. The population of the hospital reached its peak in 1953, when millions of shell-shocked soldiers returned from the Second World War suffering from what is now widely known as post-traumatic stress disorder. By then it held 7,674 patients and was a self-sufficient campus, with facilities including a . laundry, chapel, dental clinic, infirmary, classrooms, therapy buildings, . dormitories and even a power station. American folk singer Woody Guthrie, who wrote hundreds of songs and made famous recordings of Red River Valley and This Land is . Your Land, was  committed in 1956 with Huntington's Disease. The genetic disorder had blighted the life of his mother and made it difficult for him to walk, causing wild fluctuations in mood. Even as Guthrie was in his final years before he died in 1967, folk revivalists were basing a new scene on Guthrie's genius in New York's Greenwich Village. One of his visitors in Greystone Park was the undisputed king of the Village scene: a 19-year-old Bob Dylan. A 19-year-old Bob Dylan visited folk singer Woody Guthrie (left) when he was a patient at Greystone Park, where many of the chairs and tables lie abandoned (right) Faith: The purpose-built chapel would have provided solace to those suffering from terrible illnesses in an age which understood little about them. But now it lies empty, with the upside-down cross of St Peter (often - and maybe in this case - appropriated as a symbol of satanism) graffitied on the wall near where the altar stood . Magnificent: The vaulted ceiling of the chapel, which will soon be demolished in a project expected to cost $50million. The site was so large it had its own power station . Big questions: The way Western countries treat the mentally ill has been a major debate, particular since Ken Kessey's 1962 novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest . Many western psychiatric hospitals were controversial for their use of treatments such as electric shock therapy, which was introduced at Greystone Park in the early 1900s. Ken Kessey's 1962 novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest would be made into a seminal film starring Jack Nicholson, which swept all four major Academy Awards and turned America's treatment of the mentally ill into an international debate. As years went by Greystone Park's grand buildings fell victim to decay and overcrowding. Finally, in 1988, its directors could take no more. All . patients were moved to a modern complex next to the original site, but the central block was still used by . administration staff for another 15 years until they, too, left in 2003 and the doors closed for good. Last year the state of New Jersey announced plans to tear down the asylum in a $50million project to expand the new complex, prompting outcry among those who wanted to preserve it. The last buildings on the campus are expected to be demolished within months after authorities received six offers, but ruled all would require some sort of state subsidy. In December the Preserve Greystone group accused New Jersey's administration of failing to engage with developers who wanted to re-use and restore the historic building. Mould and asbestos: Now unfit for human habitation, this was once the parlour on the self-contained campus where the 7,000 patients could go for a haircut . Learning: The school room inside the campus, which over the years taught many people with complex issues which psychiatrists had yet to fully understand . Silver lining: New Jersey's authorities rejected six alternative offers for the site, claiming all of them would have required public money, and chose to demolish it instead . Urban explorer Julia Wertz, 31, said: 'Holes in the roof have let in rain and snow, which has allowed plants to take root in the floors. Snow and ice appear in winter' 'The private sector has expressed interest in re-purposing it, and other historic structures on the site as well, thus preserving them for future generations and sparing taxpayers the terrible costs of their destruction,' they said in a statement. 'The administration failed to follow through, changed course, and did their best to create the perception that it was financially “infeasible” for the private sector to make a go of it.' Volunteer John Huebner added: 'Failure to redeem a local icon exacts a cost on public morale. People rightly value their history – good, bad or indifferent, and the near universal response to the prospect of the Kirkbride’s demise is “what a shame”, “what a waste”, “too bad they couldn’t find a way to do something with it.”' Urban explorer Julia Wertz, 31, made a tour of the eerie interior and took the haunting photos in this collection. She said: 'The interior of Greystone has fallen into various states of decay. The wards furthest from the centre are the most destroyed since they were abandoned first. The top floors have seen the worst of it. 'Holes in the roof have let in rain and snow, which has allowed plants to take root in the floors. Piles of snow and ice appear in the winter. 'At the centre of the building the administration block is remarkably well preserved. In fact, the power was still on until just a few months ago. 'The whole building is covered in hazardous asbestos and mould.' Grand: Twin staircases inside the huge complex, which expanded throughout the first half of the 20th Century as soldiers returned from the Second World War . Room with a view: Leaves creep in through the window of one of the wards. Preservationists were furious at the New Jersey administration for 'ignoring' other offers .","Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital, New Jersey, was largest building in U.S. until Pentagon surpassed it in 1943 .

"Samsung said that the Galaxy S3 smartphone which apparently 'exploded' had actually been placed in a microwave. An Irish customer had purchased Samsung's new flagship phone, only to report that the phone burst into  flames as he was driving his car. But the customer has now admitted that the phone was placed in a microwave in an attempt to remove water damage to the phone. Time to burn: The S3 is shown suffering damage near the charging port - although the battery looks unscathed and was later determined to have been caused by a microwave deliberately . Initially reported to have ignited . into fire while charging in an Irish customers car, the Internet poster . who first brought the damage to the attention of the web, retracted his . claims, saying that he was mistaken. 'The damage to the phone was caused . by another person, although they were attempting to recover the phone . from water this later caused the damage shown on the phone. It occured . due a large amount of external energy and there was no fault with the . phone,' wrote Dillo2k10 on a Samsung Tomorrow Board. Reacting seriously to the claim that their wildly successful smartphone might be faulty, Samsung enlisted Fire Investigations UK (FIUK) to determine the exact cause of the damage done to the Galaxy S3 unit. Exposing the destroyed phone to a series of tests, the investigation discovered that 'The energy source responsible for generating the heat has been determined as external to the device and the device was not responsible for the cause of the fire,' according to engadget. In addition to this, the results state that 'The only was it was possible to produce damage similar to the damage recorded within the owner's damaged device was to place the devices or component parts within a domestic microwave.' Samsung launched the investigation after a user of the company's flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S3, alleged his phone blew up while he drove in his car. Here is the full report which exonerates the Samsung Galaxy S3 device of spontaneously combusting . As these unverified images below appear to show, the smartphone started burning at the base of the unit, near the charging port. The Galaxy S3 has already sold more than 10 . million models worldwide and was one of the fastest-selling gadgets of . all time following its launch in May. The pictures were posted on a website by the angry user, who called himself Dillo2k10, from Dublin Ireland. They clearly show an area of blackened, melted plastic around the charging terminal. The user said: 'I was driving along with my Galaxy S3 in my car mount when suddenly . a white flame, sparks and a bang came out of the phone. 'I pulled in to look at my phone, the phone burned from the inside out. Burned through the plastic and melted my case to my phone. The phone . kept working but without any signal.

"The 'baby gap' is left after giving birth and is where the stomach muscles have separated . Approaching the end of my ‘fourth trimester’, I recently decided it was time to try and sort out my stomach. Feeling brave, I force myself to really examine my new reality.  Once finely honed by Pilates with definition that I was inordinately proud of, I’m now left with a jiggling and sagging mess. Determined to be kind to myself in this process, I shake off my discouragement and head to the gym.  Here’s what I find when I attempt my first sit up – I can’t. Whereas pre-baby I could do 75 without breaking a sweat, now I can’t manage a single one.  My abdominal muscles are not just weak, post baby and Caesarean – they seem to have disappeared completely. And I soon realise I am not alone. Caron Bosler is a Pilates Guru who has worked with lots of high profile pregnant women – including a famous Royal she refuses to talk about. She has created a new technique, called the AB Method, specifically designed to help post-natal women reclaim their abdomen. She says, ‘The AB Method was developed when I realized how much pelvic floor control and abdominal strength I lost with the birth of my daughter Amanee Bham two years ago.  In fact I’ve named the method after her.  I have spent my entire life working out and am a former professional dancer, and yet pregnancy affected me far more than I anticipated.’ She continues, ‘In addition to the strain of pregnancy, on top of that, there is the whole process of feeding. And like most new mums, I constantly found myself rounded over whilst feeding and holding my baby. This throws the back into an awkward position; straining with the weight of a squirming baby.  Combine this with the natural Linea Alba separation of the abdominal wall and loss of pelvic floor stability and like many women, I discovered how easy it is to feel out of control of your own body.’ And Caron quickly determined that ordinary Pilates were just not cutting it. 'Whereas pre-baby I could do 75 sit ups without breaking a sweat, now I can't manage a single one,' says Ahsley . ‘Obviously, Pilates was great keeping me and my clients in shape all the way throughout pregnancy. But a vital piece was missing to get back on the road to full recovery.  What I needed to do was form a clear pattern of exercises that new mothers could do to help this process.  A lot of mother's aren't aware that when the stomach muscles separate (Diastasis Recti) to make room for the baby that they need encouragement to go back together. There are a few simple exercises that with constant use and slow progression can encourage the natural gap that forms in the muscles to close.’ I turn up at Caron’s sun filled studio on Gloucester Road, sceptical but open minded. I’d trained with her before, but never coming from such a place of weakness. The first thing she has me do truly startles me. The AB method aims to close the 'baby gap' left in the abdomen by separated muscles . She has me lie down and attempt a basic sit up, raising my shoulders just slightly off the matt.  Then, using gentle pressure she guides my fingers to just below my belly button – and I feel a hollow space.  I can feel a gaping hole in my abdomen, an actual gap between my muscles that I can feel with my hands.  And it’s big. ‘That’s about three fingers worth,’ she says, ‘it’s significant yes, but I’ve worked with this before. Don’t worry, you can do this.’ Caron says that this ‘baby gap’ has to be addressed before you can really kick start your fitness routine. ‘The problem I found is that there was no clear way to get from the open gap in the abdominals back to full range of movement without the fear of reoccurrence. Unless the gap is brought back together, any abdominal twisting movements or movements bringing the feet over the head will cause the stomach muscles to separate again. What I’ve developed is a clear pattern of movement initiating from the closing of the Linea Alba. From there we slowly add on the pelvic floor and postural exercises to bring the body back into full range of movement. Once the body is back in harmony then we can get back to normal exercise. ‘ . And while I must admit that the yummy mummy tummy tuck has a certain appeal – I’ve learned it doesn’t address the real problems underneath. Experts I spoke with all agreed that in a tummy tuck, even when the diastasis (or separation) is successfully stitched surgically, nothing has been done to change the strength, tone or function of the muscles underneath, which support the stomach and back. And while private tuition can be expensive, Caron offers a special rate to pregnant and post- natal women.  She says, ‘It’s something I feel passionately about. I see so many women who are pregnant or just post baby and I know there are special issues there– and as a new mum myself, who is currently expecting my second baby, I’m really engaged in this subject. There’s nothing that gives me greater satisfaction than helping a woman during this extraordinary time in their lives.’ Start . lying on your back with your knees bent and your feet hip width apart. Place your hands on either side of your belly button with your thumbs . towards your head and your fingertips towards your toes. Your fingertips . should be at least 4 inches apart. Take a breath inhaling. As you . exhale, slowly pull your navel in towards your spine and push your . abdominal muscles together with your hands.  You can do this exercise . very soon after a natural birth. Repeat 10x every day. Adding on . Once . you have mastered the feeling of your abdominals pulling in with your . hands trying to encourage the gap to close, add the pelvic floor. As you . inhale everything is relaxed, as you exhale slowly pull the pelvic . floor in and up as the navel pulls down and the hands push the muscles . to close. Repeat 10x . Knee Folds . Start . in the same position as above with your hands on either side of your . belly button. Take a breath inhaling. As you start your exhale slowly . draw the pelvic floor in and abdominals down. Continue to exhale and . fold one knee in towards your chest so that the knee is above the hip . bent at a right angle. Inhale to relax. On the next exhale, fold the . other knee in towards the chest at a right angle. Repeat 10x . Knee Opening . This . time start with the knees and feet together but keep the rest of your . positioning the same. As you inhale slowly open the right knee out to . the side making sure your hips do not move. As you exhale, slowly draw . the pelvic floor in and the abdominals down. Continue to exhale and . deepen the abdominals pulling down in order to draw the leg back up into . center.

Cute and quirky: The model accessorized her ensemble with a fun Charlotte Olympia handbag . Ambassador for style: The 31-year-old has an official role with the British Fashion Council . Hosted by comedian Jack Whitehall, for the second year in a row, the awards are set to honour those who have greatly impacted the fashion industry. The event boasted a guestlist of London's best-dressed, including Alexa's close friends Poppy Delevingne and Suki Waterhouse, all of whom were there to see Poppy's younger sister Cara scoop the award for Model of the Year for the second time. Cara's fellow models and long-time friends Karlie Kloss and Joan Smalls took to the stage to present the 22-year-old, who first won the coveted prize in 2012. Dressed in a beautiful Burberry gown, Cara thanked her fans for continuing to believe in and support her, saying: 'I would be nothing without fashion.' Shortly afterwards, her elder sister Poppy seized the opportunity to share a touching tribute to the Burberry model, congratulating her on her overwhelming fashion success. All about the bag: Alexa made sure that the photographers got a good look at her unique bag on the red carpet .

"Some forces insist on sentences of more than three years before they release a custody photo to the press . A new secret justice row broke out last night after The Mail on Sunday discovered that hundreds of thousands of convicted criminals are having their identities protected by police. More than half of forces in England and Wales refuse to publish mugshots of offenders unless they have been jailed – in defiance of national guidelines. Some insist on sentences of more than three years before they release a custody photo to the press, citing concerns about data protection and the criminals’ human rights. This means just a tiny handful of the 1.2 million people sentenced in criminal courts each year have their pictures published or put online, even though it is widely acknowledged that publicity can link offenders to other crimes and prevent more from being committed. It comes after The Mail on Sunday revealed ‘secret arrest’ plans by police chiefs, backed by Lord Justice Leveson and now put in place across the country, to prevent forces revealing the names of suspects they have detained. Following this newspaper’s investigation, the Association of Chief Police Officers’ senior officer in charge of media policy wrote to all 43 chief constables in England and Wales urging them to release more photos of sentenced offenders. Andy Trotter, the chief constable of British Transport Police, said last night: ‘I’m a little disappointed and hence I’ve written to chiefs today. ‘I am disappointed to find a variety of responses to your inquiries and I’m reminding chiefs that this is the policy. I’m reminding forces of the existing guidance that encourages openness and co-operation. ‘We’ve got a good story to tell – crime is down, the prisons are full – and we want to see more court results in newspapers, not fewer. The default position ought to be we release photos unless there is a specific prohibition such as the person is a juvenile.’ He added that the length of an offender’s sentence should be ‘immaterial’ in deciding whether or not their image is released. It is not an infallible measure of the seriousness of a single crime because the sentence may be influenced by a previous record. A survey of 39 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales sows that 28 require an offender to be given an immediate custodial term at the very least before their image can be released . ‘That doesn’t make sense to me and I . think that is arbitrary and I don’t think should be used as any sort of . criterion to be applied to the release of images,’ said Mr Trotter. Although . the existing guidelines developed by ACPO in 2009 are not legally . binding on forces, they encourage officers to release custody images to . the media. The guidelines . state that publicising a criminal’s identity is justified if it serves a . purpose such as aiding the detection of crime, encouraging witnesses . and victims to come forward, reassuring residents, increasing confidence . in the justice system or preventing future offences. Forces are being urged to release pictures and details of more detained suspects . Although . police are told to bear in mind the nature of the crime and the impact . of releasing an image on the perpetrator and their family, there is no . reference to sentencing thresholds. However, . a survey by this newspaper of 39 of the 43 police forces in England and . Wales has established that 28 require an offender to be given an . immediate custodial term at the very least before their image can be . released. Of those 28 forces, six will publish mugshots only of those given terms of two years or more, and another six – Merseyside, North Yorkshire, Northamptonshire, Cleveland, Durham and Staffordshire – insist on three years or longer. Of the 1.2 million people sentenced in 2012, 98,047 (eight per cent) were given custodial terms. Of these, 10,731 were sentenced to more than three years behind bars. One force, Dorset, even insists that media organisations remove photos of criminals from their websites a month after sentencing to ‘ensure proportionality’. Most forces added that they would release images for those given shorter jail terms in exceptional cases if the press requested them. A further 11 forces, including the Metropolitan Police, said they followed ACPO guidelines and considered each case individually rather than making custodial sentences a prerequisite. New guidance on relations between police and the media will be finalised this summer and approved by the College of Policing, the new professional body for the force. In one well-known case, Derbyshire Constabulary refused to release photographs of two murderers who had fled from an open prison, arguing that they had likely left the area and therefore posed no risk to residents. Pictures of Jason Croft and Michael Nixon were eventually published by another force.","More than half forces in England and Wales refuse to publish mugshots unless the person has been jailed .

"Video games have been accused of fuelling youth violence after a 13-year-old boy slashed a friend’s throat following an online row. Police believe the attack, in Clydebank, Scotland, was influenced by the teenager’s use of violent video games. He had only known his 14-year-old victim for a few months after they met online while playing Xbox game Gears of War 3. Violent: A teenager slashed another's throat after playing the ultra-violent video game Gears of War 3 . Players: The game, which is popular with children, rewards players for slaying their opponents . The 18-rated game, which contains ‘strong bloody violence’, rewards players for devising ways of murdering their opponents. Brian Docherty, chairman of the Scottish Police Federation, said: ‘These games are rated 18 and shouldn’t be played by children of this young age – but online gaming may be outside their parents’ knowledge. We need to look again at what we can do to stop this.’ The High Court in Glasgow heard the boys had a falling-out, which resulted in the victim being slashed. Popular: the X-box game is very popular with young people . Then, in a scene reminiscent of violent video games – the accused sneered at his victim: ‘Don’t die,’ before calmly walking off. The accused, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted assault. The victim is now traumatised and his attacker – already a father – faces being locked up when returns to the dock later this month. Prosecutor Andrew Brown, QC, told the court: ‘The reporting officer was of the opinion that the violent video games played online by the accused may have been a factor in his conduct.’ The boys met while playing Gears of War 3 online around Christmas 2011. They later met in person and the court heard there was no animosity between the pair until a month before the slashing. Mr Brown said: ‘The pair had fall-outs online amounting to name-calling via the messaging system used in the game.’ On April 14 last year, the day of the attack, the victim met some friends and the group later encountered the accused at a local shop. Later that night, the victim and another boy were going to a house when they saw the accused. The accused grabbed the 14-year-old then struck him across the throat with a knife. The victim told paramedics a boy had ‘slit his throat in an argument about Xbox games’. He suffered a wound so deep it exposed his windpipe and required 20 staples following surgery. The court was told the victim – now 15 – has refused to speak about what happened to him and has had difficulty sleeping. A spokesman for Microsoft, which publishes Gears of War 3, said: ‘We have some of the most robust parental control systems to empower parents to decide how their children play and communicate. We have the greatest sympathy for the victim and his family.’","Police believe teenager was influenced by playing violent video games .

"A man has developed a rare condition that causes him to experience orgasmic sensations when he hears James Bond theme music. It is only the second known case of a patient developing synesthesia after a stroke. The neurological condition causes the stimulation of a sense, such as hearing music, to lead to automatic, involuntary experiences in a different sense, such as seeing colours or tasting a flavour. A stroke patient has developed synesthesia, a neurological condition that causes the brain to confuse senses, several months after a stroke. When listening to high-pitched voices or brass instruments - often when listening to James Bond themes -  he would experience 'orgasmic sensations' After a stroke in 2007, the unnamed 45-year-old man from Toronto noticed that words printed in a particular shade of blue disgusted him, according to a report by National Post. He then became aware that the sound of high-pitched voices and brass instruments — specifically, the theme music from James Bond films — triggered out-of-body, orgasmic sensations and blue flashes of light in his vision. He said he felt as if ‘he could ride the music’. The Toronto St. Michael’s Hospital patient specifically recalled a moment when he watched the Beijing Olympics. Synesthesia is a condition in which one sense is simultaneously perceived as if by one or more additional senses such as sight. Another form of synesthesia joins objects such as letters, shapes, numbers or people's names with a sensory perception such as smell, colour or flavour. Around four per cent of people are thought to have the condition which is eight times more common in women. Most synesthesists tend to be left-handed. There are no dangerous side-effects to the having the condition . Famous synesthesists include Marilyn Monroe, Mary J Blige as well as the artists Kandinsky and Hockney. He said when a woman sang at the opening ceremony it triggered an overwhelming and frightening reaction. He said: ‘I had the sensation of entering the TV, and entering the stadium and I was floating above the crowd. I could feel the heat and humidity coming off the people. I could feel it on my skin. ‘It scared the hell out of me. I thought, ""this is how you lose your mind"". I was convinced I was going to go crazy.’ He was eventually referred to his Dr Luis Fornazarri, a behavioural neurologist, who instantly diagnosed him with synaesthesia.

Feeling blue: The man first became concerned because he became addicted to raspberries after he said they tasted of a certain shade of blue. However seeing sky blue suddenly left him feeling disgusted . Other symptoms exhibited by the man include an insatiable hunger for raspberries because they taste of a 'certain shade of blue'. The patient's stroke occurred in his thalamus -  the area of the brain responsible for processing sensory information. Experts . say the process of repair after the stroke caused the brain to . 'miswire', connecting areas of the brain that once never came into . contact with each other. The only other reported case of synesthesia following a stroke is a 35-year-old U.S. woman who experienced tingling in her body when she heard certain sounds. Since the male patient's diagnosis, he has learned to control his synesthesia, saying that having a diagnosis has reassured him that his 'weird feelings' aren't a sign of madness but just a side-effect of his stroke.","A Canadian man has developed synesthesia - a neurological condition that causes the brain to confuse senses - several months after suffering stroke .

"Rapid evolution of HIV, the human . immunodeficiency virus, is slowing its ability to cause AIDS, . according to a study of more than 2,000 women in Africa. Scientists said the research suggests a less virulent HIV . could be one of several factors contributing to a turning of the . deadly pandemic, eventually leading to the end of AIDS. 'Overall we are bringing down the ability of HIV to cause . AIDS so quickly,' Philip Goulder, a professor at Oxford . University who led the study, said in a telephone interview. Red balloons are released to mark World Aids Day at the Emilio Ribas Hospital in Sao Paulo: Rapid evolution of HIV, the humanimmunodeficiency virus, is slowing its ability to cause AIDS,according to a study of more than 2,000 women in Africa. The world has finally reached 'the beginning of the end' of the AIDS pandemic, a leading campaign group claimed today. The number of people newly infected with HIV over the last year was lower than the number of HIV-positive people getting access to the medicines they need to keep AIDS at bay. The report was released by the ONE campaign, an advocacy group working to end poverty and preventable disease in Africa, to mark World AIDS Day. 'But it would be overstating it to say HIV has lost its . potency -- it's still a virus you wouldn't want to have.' Some 35 million people currently have HIV and AIDS has . killed around 40 million people since it began spreading 30 . years ago. But campaigners noted on Monday that for the first time in . the epidemic's history, the annual number of new HIV infections . is lower than the number of HIV positive people being added to . those receiving treatment, meaning a crucial tipping point has . been reached in reducing deaths from AIDS. Goulder's team conducted their study in Botswana and South . Africa -- two countries badly hit by AIDS -- where they enrolled . more than 2,000 women with HIV. First they looked at whether the interaction between the . body's natural immune response and HIV leads to the virus . becoming less virulent or able to cause disease. Previous research on HIV has shown that people with a gene . known as HLA-B*57 can benefit from a protective effect against . HIV and progress more slowly than usual to AIDS. The scientists found that in Botswana, HIV has evolved to . adapt to HLA-B*57 more than in South Africa, so patients no . longer benefited from the protective effect. But they also found . the cost of this adaptation for HIV is a reduced ability to . replicate -- making it less virulent. Conceptual view of HIV within the blood-stream: Some 35 million people currently have HIV and AIDS haskilled around 40 million people since it began spreading 30years ago. The scientists then analysed the impact on HIV virulence of . the wide use of AIDS drugs. Using a mathematical model, they . found that treating the sickest HIV patients -- whose immune . systems have been weakened by the infection -- accelerates the . evolution of variants of HIV with a weaker ability to replicate. 'HIV adaptation to the most effective immune responses we . can make against it comes at a significant cost to its ability . to replicate,' Goulder said. 'Anything we can do to increase the . pressure on HIV in this way may allow scientists to reduce the . destructive power of HIV over time.' The study was published on Monday in the journal Proceedings . of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). (Editing by Alison Williams)","Rapid evolution of HIV slowing its ability to cause AIDS .

"Chelsea are confident that Andre Schurrle's move to Wolfsburg will go through despite comments from Klaus Allofs, sporting director at the Bundesliga club, that a fee still needs to be negotiated. Juan Cuadrado’s arrival is dependent on Schurrle leaving and the German window shuts at 5pm UK time - with the delay surrounding a solidarity payment owed to club's in the player's development. Schurrle’s terms aren’t the problem - a four-year deal at £85,000 a week – for Wolfsburg but neither club want to pay five per cent of the transfer fee. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Andre Schurrle bags a brace for Wolfsburg vs Bayern . Wolfsburg are stalling on Chelsea's £24million asking price for Germany international forward Andre Schurrle . Wolfsburg's Kevin De Bruyne (second left) celebrates after scoring during the 4-1 win over Bayern Munich . The Bundesliga club, who are second in the table and beat leaders Bayern Munich 4-1 on Friday, are refusing to budge, as are Chelsea. Schurrle needed to beat a noon deadline to be registered on the German FA's transfer list before potentially completing a switch. That was done under an hour beforehand as the move goes down to the wire. Schurrle remains in London, with general manager Klaus Allofs saying: 'Chelsea agreed to putting him on the transfer list just before midday and you can read into that what you want.' Furthermore, Schurrle's contract will run until 2019, with the winger earning around £85,000 a week. It would be a record transfer for the German club and the huge expenditure is causing the delay in agreeing a deal, meaning the transfer is likely to go down to the wire on Monday.

"A university professor has decided to live inside a dumpster for an entire year in a radical experiment to see if people would be happier living a simpler lifestyle. After formulating and finalising his plans for the undertaking last year, Professor Jeff Wilson has now been housed in the 36-square-foot container for more than seven months. He may even continue living in the dumpster for another year if he feels like continuing with the much simpler life - which he claims to prefer. Scroll down for video . Professor Jeff Wilson has been living in this dumpster for seven months now and says he may yet stay for another year . The dumpster was large enough to fit a bed and a few pieces of Mr Wilson's (pictured) furniture . But it was just an empty barren space before he filled it with his possessions . Mr Wilson, who is dean of the University College at Huston-Tillotson in Texas, USA, said the toughest part of his challenge was dealing with the temperature inside the dumpster. The heat hit 45C in the summer and reaches -5C in the winter. Having now built temperature controls, though, he said he is focusing on communicating the design aspect of the project. However, managing the smells from the toilet can also be an issue. He said: 'We hope the dumpster will become a conversation box on subjects as wide as tiny housing, energy sustainability, science education, and higher quality of life. 'Ultimately, the hypothesis we are investigating is if a person can have a relatively good and happy life by downsizing. 'This is an outlier experiment. The students and university, thought they thought the experiment a bit odd, have warmed to the idea, even if they do stand upwind of me more than they used to.'

"Former Nottingham Forest striker Dougie Freedman has been named the club's new manager in place of Stuart Pearce who was sacked on Sunday night after a 1-0 home defeat against Millwall. Freedman, 40, was the preferred candidate of Kuwaiti owner Fawaz Al Hasawi because of his experience of working in The Championship with clubs on limited budgets. The pair held amicable discussions on Sunday night before Freedman was appointed on an 18-month contract. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Nottingham Forest 0-1 Millwall .

Pearce, a legendary Forest player under Brian Clough and a former England Under 21 and Manchester City manager, was sacked after seven months in charge following a run of three wins in 23 matches. Scot Freedman built the Crystal Palace team that won promotion to the Premier League in 2012-13 but left midway through the season to join Bolton Wanderers. With Bolton £170million in debt, he was unable to turn their fortunes around and was sacked  in October, nearly two years into the job and with the team 23rd in the table. Importantly for Al Hasawi, both of Freedman's previous chairmen Steve Parrish of Crystal Palace and Phil Gartside at Bolton gave the Glaswegian excellent references as someone who cares about the future of the football club as well as the present. Fawaz Al-Hasawi (centre) feels Forest need a change to their philosophy to turn around their barren run . Forest also face financial restrictions and are currently one of three Championship teams alongside Leeds United and Blackburn Rovers who are banned from buying players because of breaches of Financial Fairplay regulations. Freedman also spent time as a player at Forest and represented the club alongside John Terry, who was a young loanee from Chelsea at the time. In total he scored 23 goals in 83 appearances for the club between 1998 and 2000 spending his first season there in the Premier League. Forest are now 12th in the Championship. Because of the transfer embargo, they are not allowed to sign players but have space in their squad for one more loan signing provided there is no loan fee attached.

"As many as 100,000 women in Britain have undergone female genital mutilations with medics in the UK offering to carry out the illegal procedure on girls as young as 10, it has been reported. Investigators from The Sunday Times said they secretly filmed a doctor, dentist and alternative medicine practitioner who were allegedly willing to perform circumcisions or arrange for the operation to be carried out. The doctor and dentist deny any wrongdoing. The practice, which involves the surgical removal of external genitalia and in some cases the stitching of the vaginal opening, is illegal in Britain and carries up to a 14 year prison sentence. It is also against the law to arrange FGM. Cases of Female Genital Mutilation are increasing across the UK but not one person has been prosecuted for any offences . Known as 'cutting', the procedure is traditionally carried out for cultural reasons and in Africa and with large numbers of immigration from countries like Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia it is becoming more common in the UK. It is believed to be proof of a girl's 'purity' for when she marries, but victims often suffer in silence and are rarely given anaesthetic. They frequently suffer long-term damage and pain and often struggle to stand or walk properly. Supermodel turned UN ambassador Waris Dirie was mutilated aged 5 . Research suggests that every year up to 6,000 girls in London are at risk of the potentially fatal procedure, and more than 22,000 in the UK as a whole. The Metropolitan Police said since 2008, it had received 166 reports of people who fear they are at risk of FGM but it has failed to bring forward a single perpetrator. It is the same for all 43 forces across England and Wales with no convictions for the offence ever taking place. Only two doctors have ever been struck off by The General Medical Council since 1980. The . Sunday Times uncovered a respected dentist who was prepared to . circumcise two girls, aged 10 and 13 and a GP who referred an undercover . reporter to the dentist. They also spoke to a supplier who deals in alternative medicine who offered to circumcise a 10 year-old girl for £750. A midwife in Birmingham also said she had seen the number of mutilations in the area treble since 2002. Alison . Byrne, a specialist midwife at the Birmingham's Heartlands hospital who . has helped pioneer treatment for women suffering from the condition . said she has had patients aged between 16 and 40. She . said she had some women who had been left with an opening the size of a . matchstick through which to pass urine and menstrual blood. Ms Byrne added that as a result many of the women developed severe infections and can continuously bleed for days on end. She has said there is a huge lack of training and knowledge among medical staff which is causing a serious problem. Doctors . at the hospital now offer a procedure called deinfibulation which . involves the removal of scar tissue formed by the cutting of the . clitoris. Tradition: This graphic shows the percentage of women who have had FGM in African countries - and the percentage of their daughters who have undergone the procedure . It is offering hope to dozens of women affected by the condition. It is also estimated that one in 20 women in parts of London are victims of the practice.[ . Minister . for equalities Lynne Featherstone said: 'Female genital mutilation is . an abhorrent crime and we are very clear that hose found to practice it . should feel the full force of the law.' According to Forward, a charity which campaigners against FGM, an estimated 100,000 women in the UK have undergone mutilation. Supermodel . turned United Nations ambassador Waris Dirie, who was mutilated aged 5 . in her home country of Somalia, is a vociferous opponent of the . practice. Calling for a . crackdown on FGM, she said: 'If a white girl is abused, the police come . break down the door. If a black girl is mutilated, nobody takes care of . her. This is what I call racism.' Majority of FGMs occur in Africa and Middle Eastern countries where it is seen as vital in preserving chastity. In Somalia, Sudan and parts of Egypt more than 90 per cent of women are forced to go through with the procedure. The first type involves the removal of the clitoris. The second type involves the removal of the clitoris and part of the labia - the outer part of the vagina. This is the most common and account for about 80 per cent of FGMs. The third type involves the removal of all external genitalia and stitching of the vaginal opening. Scar tissue eventually develops and only a small hole is left open. The final type is the most severe and often leaves the women with infections and serious emotional scars. It involves the cutting and sewing of the vagina and at times the introduction of a foreign substance into the vagina.","Police have failed to bring forward a single conviction .

"A brave German Shepherd puppy was badly injured after he pushed a boy out of the path of a runaway lorry and took the impact himself. Eight-month-old Geo has been hailed a hero by his adoring family after he averted tragedy on a family walk in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. Carly Riley and her three sons Charlie,10, Josh, seven, and Ben, four, were walking along Burrs Road in the town when the accident happened. Boy's best friend: Geo the German Shepherd suffered serious injuries when he heroically saved the life of 10-year-old Charlie, pictured here with him . As they waited at a street corner to cross the road, an out-of-control truck careered onto the pavement, heading straight for Charlie. Geo jumped forwards, pushing the boy out of the way, and was hit off the pavement and onto the road.  He was then hit by the vehicle again before the driver drove off. Mrs Riley and her factory worker husband Ian, 34, reported the hit-and-run to the police. Mrs Riley, who has set up a Facebook page called Geo The Hero in honour of her eight-month-old puppy, said: 'We were waiting to cross the road at the lights when I just heard a car going really fast.  Then a pick-up truck mounted the curb. 'Geo must have sensed it as he leapt on Charlie and took him out of the way. 'It could have wiped us all out.  If it wasn't for Geo I am 100 per cent sure it would've been Charlie.' Recovering at home: Geo has more than earned his keep by saving the life of his family's young son . Before the accident: Geo the puppy with a stick before he was hit by the truck in Clacton.  His family say he is now recovering . Geo, a German Shepherd-collie mix, suffered a broken leg, fractured spine and severe bruising in the accident, which happened earlier this month.  He endured five hours of surgery during which two metal plates were inserted in his leg. The Rileys, who hope he will make a good recovery, are now facing vets' bills of around £8,000 and have set up a PayPal account into which well-wishers may donate to help pay for the dog's treatment. Mrs Riley, 28, said: 'It wasn't a question of getting him put down: we want him fixed no matter what it costs.  He's family.'","Boy's mother Carly Riley says pet 'must have sensed' the child's danger .

"Fury: Max Kpakio claims he was turned down for a job with Virgin Atlantic because of his name . Virgin Atlantic was today accused of racism after allegedly rejecting a job application from an African refugee, but accepting him when he applied with a British name. Max Kpakio was turned down for a call centre job - and when he suspected his foreign-sounding name was at fault, he re-submitted his application under the name Craig Owen. He claims the enthusiastic response the second application received proves that his initial rejection was based solely on racial discrimination, and is taking the airline to an employment tribunal. The 36-year-old graduate was born in Liberia, but has lived in the UK for the past 10 years and is now a British citizen. When his application to work at a Virgin call centre in Swansea was rejected, he was convinced it was due to his African name. Not . only was he invited for interview when he applied as Craig Owen, but . the company repeatedly contacted him encouraging his application - even though it was nothing more than a simplified version of his genuine CV. After . he failed to respond to their initial email, they sent a string of . messages saying how much they were looking forward to meeting him. Application: Mr Kpakio hoped to get a job at the Virgin call centre based in this building in Swansea . 'There was an enormous difference in the way I was treated when I used a British name,' Mr Kpakio said. 'When I was first sent a rejection, I couldn't understand it - I thought I had provided a very good CV. 'I'd offered advice to clients over the telephone before, so I believed I was a very good candidate for the job. 'It occurred to me that my ethnic origin may have something to do with the rejection. I then decided to make a further application to Virgin, using the name Craig Owen. 'They were in touch with me seven or eight times, and kept coming back to me when I didn't respond.' Refugee: The 36-year-old left his native Liberia to escape the civil war and graduated from Swansea University . Mr Kpakio moved to Swansea with his three children in 2002, to escape the civil war which was tearing his home country apart. He earned a degree in International Relations from Swansea University. His case for alleged racial discrimination against Virgin, which was founded by flamboyant tycoon Richard Branson, is due to be heard by an employment tribunal in April. A spokeswoman for Virgin Atlantic said: 'We are an equal opportunities employer. 'We pride ourselves on providing opportunities to talented people regardless of their race, sex, age or other characteristic. Lawsuit: Virgin Atlantic, founded by Richard Branson, pictured, denies racial discrimination . 'We take allegations of discrimination extremely seriously. 'And whilst we do not comment on individual cases, we strongly deny any of our recruitment decisions or practices are discriminatory in any way.' Research done over the past few years have suggested that job applicants with foreign-sounding names face obstacles to being hired in many lines of work. A number of studies in which researchers have submitted identical CVs under two sets of name, British and non-British, have shown that the former are significantly more likely to receive a positive response from employers.","Max Kpakio was turned down for job at Virgin call centre in Swansea .

"A grieving mother-of-three lost eight stone after her brother died from a heart attack at the age of just 39. Natalie Jones, 37, from Birmingham, weighed 19st 8lbs and was a size 24 when her brother Mark died suddenly of coronary heart disease. She said: 'Mark was a big man and he loved his food. He had a huge appetite and really enjoyed tucking into big portions. Natalie with her son Jack days after her brother Mark died in June 2012 (l) and pictured this year (r) 'He was a smoker too and I believe his unhealthy lifestyle contributed to his heart attack. We have no history of heart disease in our family. 'Mark was great to his family. He worked so hard to support his four children and he loved them so much. It broke my heart to think he wouldn't be around to see them grow up. 'I didn't want to leave my three children without a mum - I knew I had to do something.' Shortly after her brother's death size 24 Natalie, who is mother to Jack, three, Sam, 13, and Cole, 14, was tested by her doctor after a routine examination revealed a suspected heart murmur. She was terrified by the discovery but was relieved when an echocardiogram revealed her heart was in fact in good health. However, at 19st 8lb, she remained at high risk of developing heart problems in the future. Natalie with her son Jack, now three, shortly after he was born . Natalie pictured with her fiance Craig Groves in 2011 . She said visions of Mark's death, which occurred in June 2012, spurred her on to break old habits. Determined to head off a similar fate, she began regularly attending a local gym and, in the course of 15 months, lost an incredible eight stone. She said: 'I used to be naturally lazy. If I could get away with not doing something, I wouldn't do it. The exercise was torture at first - I could barely manage two minutes on the treadmill. 'I knew I had to keep going for the sake of my kids. 'I also had an image of Mark dying at the roadside - in a place he didn't know, surrounded mostly by strangers. 'He had been on the way to hospital when he had his heart attack. He was with his wife who was driving their car. But they never got there. His wife was forced to pull over and a couple of passing policemen came to their aid, but it was too late. Natalie, second left, next to her brother Mark, third from right, with her sister Stacey, first left, mother Susan, third from left, her sister Kelly, first right and Susan's husband Keith, second from right . 'I was horrified by the thought of dying in a place like that. Going to the gym, and putting effort into physical exercise, was a way of fighting back that fear.' She also radically changed her eating habits. She said: 'I couldn't bare to give up junk food completely, so concentrated on cutting down. Instead of eating a whole chocolate bar, I'd limit myself to small squares. 'I was so happy when it worked. In just over a month, I lost a stone. I found that as I exercised, I increasingly enjoyed eating healthily.' Natalie was supported in her weight loss challenge by her fiance Craig Groves, 39, who works in industrial design.

"A First World War seamstress flirted with soldiers on the front line by sewing romantic poems into their kilt linings, it has emerged. A note with a three-line poem, followed by an address, was found attached in an heirloom which had been passed down for generations without being discovered. After some of the stitches were unpicked from the garment - which was meant to be sent to Scottish soldiers in the field but never made it - the note dropped out. Hidden message: This London Scottish Regiment kilt had a flirty note sewed inside of it, from a seamstress who referred to herself as Helen Govan, and left her address . 'If single drop a line': The message, which rhymes in parts, imagines the handsome soldier in his kilt and suggests he get in touch - as long as he isn't married . It imagines the soldier looking handsome in uniform and suggests that he gets in touch with the seamstress, identified as Helen Govan - unless he is already married. The rhyming message said: 'I hope your kilt will fit you well, & in it you will look a swell. 'If married never mind. If single drop a line. 'Wish you bags of luck, & a speedy return back to Blighty.' Economic historian Dr Helen Paul, of the University of Southampton, found the hand-written message when she was removing the packing stitches from the kilt, which has been passed down her family over decades. The London Scottish Regiment kilt, manufactured by Peter Wilson of Bridge Street in Glasgow, would have been made for use by a soldier sent to fight in the war, but for reasons unknown, it was never unpacked or worn. Dr Paul is now hoping to find the descendants of the seamstress to uncover the story behind the note. Heirloom: Dr Helen Paul, an academic at the University of Southampton, found the note in the kilt, where it had lain untouched for around a century . She said: 'This garment has been in our family for a number of decades, and until recently, we were completely unaware there was such an intriguing secret hidden in its folds. It was a real surprise when the note fell out. 'My father tried to trace any relatives of the note's author a few years ago, but his efforts failed and I'm hoping to pick up where he left off. 'There are many unanswered questions. We don't know how many of these poems this lady sent. 'Was this a one off, or were there many more lost to the battlefield, or even still existing undiscovered? 'If there were more, did anyone ever answer her message and indeed did she ever meet and marry a soldier returning from the war? 'It would be fantastic to trace who this lady was and learn more about her history, as well as the social history of the women who made and packed the kilts, which ultimately went to clothe the soldiers fighting in the trenches.' Clothing historian Professor Maria Hayward from the University of Southampton said: 'The condition of the kilt is very striking - you do not expect to see a piece that has such clear links to the First World War being in such good condition. 'The construction, which is very simple, in combination with the efficient use of fabric and the way one size could be made to fit most men, made kilts of this type a very versatile piece of military uniform, which also retained its distinctive national identity.'","Flirtatious rhyming message was sewn into London Scottish Regiment kilt .

"This giant floating egg on the River Beaulieu could well be Hampshire's quirkiest living space. It may look like it comes straight from the set of a low-budget science fiction movie, but the giant wooden pod cost £40,000 to build and will in fact be the home and workspace of artist Stephen Turner, 58, for the next year.

'My artwork is very much about nature and natural processes and the relationship we have with nature,' says Turner. Architect Wendy Perring and project manager Phil Smith faced the task of translating Turner's values into the practical space. They showed architect and presenter George Clarke the miniature plastic prototype, demonstrating how the two halves are joined together. A door reveals an open-plan living space with kitchen and desk area. Each half of the egg is made of two wooden skins with a membrane in between to make it watertight. It is wider at rear allowing room for two storage cupboards either side, and a very simple bathroom.

"This is the adorable moment a mother polar bear teaches her young cubs the art of diving.

'This is a very happy family of polar bears learning to dive,' the photographer said. 'You . see the mother teaching her cubs how it's done, but they are just . generally having fun together... Polar bears love swimming but they also . like to play and jump into the water, so there was a lot of spray,' she added. The polar bear is often regarded as a marine mammal because it spends many months of the year at sea. In general they live relatively unsociable lives, but they are occasionally spotted playing in the wild - sometimes for hours at a time.

"The Iranian woman executed for killing a man she said was trying to rape her urged her mother not to mourn in a will written shortly before her death. Reyhaneh Jabbari, 27, was hanged at dawn on Saturday despite international outcry and a high-profile campaign within the repressive state urging authorities to stay her sentence. In her last will and testament, the young woman said that she did not want to be buried in a grave where her mother would go to cry and suffer, nor did she want her to wear black. ‘I don’t want to rot in the soil. Please don’t cry. I love you’, she told Sholeh Pakravan. ‘I wish I could have hugged you until I died’. Scroll down for video . Put to death: Reyhaneh Jabbari was hanged at dawn on Saturday morning despite calls for clemency . Jabbari also asked that her organs were donated anonymously, according to The Sunday Times. Footage today emerged of a distraught Mrs Pakravan wailing outside the gates of Rajai Shahr Prison, near Tehran, after her daughter was put to death. She had been summoned to the site to see Jabbari for the last time on Friday and had expressed her bitter torment and disbelief in a Facebook post earlier this week. ‘After seven and a half years of pain and suffering, is this how my dear child comes to her end?’, she wrote. This tribute appeared on the Facebook page dedicated to the 27-year-old titled Save Reyhaneh Jabbari From Execution In Iran . Jabbari was sentenced to death in 2009 for stabbing to death a former employee of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence, Morteza Abdolali Sarbandi, who allegedly drugged and attempted to rape her . The execution was condemned by the US State Department, the British government and by human rights groups including Amnesty International. 'The shocking news that Reyhaneh Jabbari has been executed is deeply disappointing in the extreme. This is another bloody stain on Iran’s human rights record,' said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa Programme. 'Tragically, this case is far from uncommon. Once again Iran has insisted on applying the death penalty despite serious concerns over the fairness of the trial.' Jabbari was sentenced to death in 2009 for stabbing to death a former employee of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence, Morteza Abdolali Sarbandi.

'After seven and a half years of pain and suffering, is this how my dear child comes to her end?', her mother wrote on Facebook . The murder - which took place two years earlier in 2007, when Jabbari was just 19. She had met him in a cafe and he had convinced her to visit his office to discuss a business deal. While there Sarbandi allegedly drugged and attempted to rape her and she grabbed a pocket knife and stabbed him. Jabbari maintained until her death that another man who was present at the time killed him. Amnesty International described the investigation as 'deeply flawed' and said that the trial had failed to examine all the evidence. The organisation also said that Jabbari confessed after being subjected to 'savage tortures'. It is claimed that she spent two months in solitary confinement where she did not have access to a lawyer or her family. The date of her execution has been repeatedly delayed, first postponed in April after a global petition to spare her life attracted 20,000 signatures.

The mother of the victim spared his life soon after . Earlier this month, the death sentence was deferred again, apparently after Jabbari had said her final goodbyes to her family, while a government car waited to transport her to the execution site. Throughout the past months, her friends and family have been a regular presence outside the prison, staging protests calling for release. Her mother also gave emotional interviews discussing her daughter's plight and begging the Iranian government to spare her life. Speaking earlier this month via Skype to Fox News,  Pakravan said: 'I wish they would come tie a rope around my neck and kill me instead, but to allow Rayhaneh to come back home.' 'The only thing I want ... from God, from people around the world ... in any way, in any form, is I just want to bring Rayhaneh back home.

The execution was carried out after Sarbandi's family refused to pardon Jabbari or accept blood money. An estimated 250 people have been put to death in Iran this year. MEP Gérard Deprez, the chair of Friends of a Free Iran, a pressure group in the European Parliament, earlier called on Iran to halt the execution. He said: 'Hassan Rouhani's government has hanged more than 1,000 people, many of them in public squares in Iranian cities. This is the worst record by any Iranian president for the past 25 years. 'If human rights are not improving in Iran, continued talks will only be seen as a green light for further aggression by the regime against its people as well as spreading its terror to other countries of the region. 'It is time the west imposes sanctions on Iran's human rights violations with no further delay.'","Reyhaneh Jabbari, 26, was sentenced to death in 2009 by an Iranian court .

"She caused no shortage of controversy as a fresh faced 16-year-old on Australia's Next Top Model. And former reality series contestant Cassi Van Den Dungen was back in the headlines on Monday after leading a parade of excruciatingly thin models down the runway at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. The now 21-year-old mother-of-one looked dramatically thinner than her teenage self as she revealed her slim legs, protruding elbow joints and gaunt and sunken cheeks, but has hit back at claims she is too skinny. Scroll down for video . Courting controversy: Model Cassi Van Den Dungen faced a recent backlash after looking gaunt at Alex Perry's Australian Fashion Week show . Shock: The 21-year-old's skeletal frame drew more than one concerned eye as she displayed her thin thighs and protruding elbow joints at Alex Perry's runway show . Posting two photos of food on her Instagram account the next morning, Cassie left a string of hashtag references defending her skeletal physique. 'Love my job, love food, I am who I am, deal with it' (sic) she wrote alongside a photo of a buffet filled with yogurt, fresh fruit and pastries. A second image posted minutes earlier shows a rucksack filled with Starburst and Haribo sweets, two butter croissants, a banana, a can of energy drink and bottle of water which she boasts is her breakfast for the day. Taking to the runway at Alex Perry's Autumn/Winter showcase on Monday, Cassi was one of a host of worryingly thin models prompting seasoned front row spectators to voice concern. Gaunt: The second placing reality star, who was dubbed 'the next Kate Moss' on the competition series, revealed her  sunken cheeks and gaunt facial features . Before: Cassi had a much fuller face when she appeared on the show in 2009 . Mia Freedman, the creator of Mamma Mia,  dubbed the show: 'The hunger games', while Jackie Frank, editor-in-chief of Marie Claire was compelled to phone one model's agent to inquire after her health. 'When I saw those legs I nearly died,' she told The Daily Telegraph. 'I rang the model agent and said, ""Why is that girl walking down the runway when she's clearly not healthy?""' Defending her frame: Cassi posted two images of food on her Instagram page on Tuesday morning writing, 'Love food, I am who I am, deal with it.' Stick thin: The mother-of-one appeared just as slim ahead at Melbourne Fashion Festival in 2010, ahead of the birth of her son later that year . The fashion industry has long come under fire for their tiny sample sizes which promote the development of unhealthy eating habits. Models feel intense pressure to fit the sizes or face loosing their livelihood. Brazilian stunner and Victoria's Secret model Alessandra Ambrosio headlined Alex Perry's runway on Monday and speaking to Today on Tuesday morning said she enjoys eating bacon and egg sandwiches before her shows. The striking Victoria's Secret alum cut a much healthier and athletic figure as she walked alongside the skeletal Australian models. Healthier figure: Brazilian stunner Alessandra Ambrosio headlined Alex Perry's Autumn/Winter showcase and flaunted a much healthier, athletically slim figure . Cassi was the runner up in the 2009 cycle of Australia's Next Top Model which was won by Tahnee Atkinson, who in contrast is known for her curvy and voluminous figure. The young model drew media attention for her angry, foul mouthed outbursts and smoking habit on the show, and famously turned down a modelling contract with a New York agency. Since finishing the popular competition series, she has been working locally and internationally, appearing at the Melbourne Fashion Festival and walking for up-market brands such as Miu Miu in Paris. She is also mother to her nearly three-year-old son Drake who was born with a cleft lip and palate.","The 21-year-old wrote: 'Deal with it. I am who I am' alongside photos of food .

"The distraught wife of British hostage Alan Henning pleaded yesterday to his jihadist captors to show mercy and release him. In a direct televised appeal to Islamic State, a tearful Barbara Henning said: ‘I ask Islamic State please release him, we need him back home.’ She said her efforts to communicate with the captors of her 47-year-old taxi driver husband have been met only with silence. Her sole contact has been an audio message from Mr Henning pleading for his life. Scroll down for video . Desperate:  Barbara Henning today broke her silence to issue a plea for ISIS to release her husband Alan . Public: Although Mrs Henning has made previous statements calling for her husband's release, this is the first time she has been filmed appealing to his captors . Her appeal was made minutes before the Ministry of Defence announced that RAF Tornados had attacked IS targets inside Iraq – a move some fear could spark a backlash against Mr Henning. The Briton known as Jihadi John, who has appeared in videos beheading hostages, said British aid worker David Haines, 44, was murdered because the UK began supplying Kurdish forces with weapons. Mr Henning, from Salford, who was seized on Boxing Day last year as he delivered aid to Syrian refugees, was shown at the end of the video of Mr Haines’s death with the threat that he would be next. Emotional: Mrs Henning said she was 'dreadfully concerned' for the safety of her husband . Fear: Last week Mrs Henning revealed she had received a message from her husband pleading for his life . Concern: Alan Henning is an ex-taxi driver from Manchester who travelled to the Middle East as an aid worker . Since then there has been a massive international campaign to secure his freedom and Mrs Henning stressed: ‘Muslims across the globe continue to question Islamic State over Alan’s fate. 'Their position regarding his situation is unequivocal. He is innocent ... We are at a loss why those leading Islamic State cannot open their hearts and minds to the truth about Alan’s humanitarian motives for going to Syria and why they continue to ignore the verdict of their own justice system [not guilty of spying]. ‘Surely those who wish to be seen as a state will act in a statesmanlike way by showing mercy and providing clemency.’ Plea: Mrs Henning urged Islamic State leaders to 'open their hearts and minds to the truth about Alan's humanitarian motives for going to Syria' 'I have a further message for Islamic State: We've not abandoned Alan and we continue in our attempts to communicate with you. 'We have had no contact from Islamic State holding him other than an audio file of him pleading for his life. 'Muslims across the globe continue to question Islamic State over Alan's fate. Their position regarding his statement is unequivocal. He is innocent. 'Some say wrong time, wrong place. Alan was volunteering with his Muslim friends to help the people of Syria. He was in the right place during the right time. 'We are at a loss why those leading Islamic State cannot open their hearts and minds to the truth about Alan's humanitarian motives for going to Syria and why they continue to ignore the verdicts of their own justice system. 'Surely those who wish to be known as a state will act in a statesmanlike way by showing mercy and providing clemency. 'Alan, we miss you and we're dreadfully concerned for your safety. But we are given so much hope by the outcry across the world as to your imprisonment. We ask Islamic State: Please release him. We want him back home. 'Thank you.' More than 100 high-profile Muslim leaders have warned that killing Mr Henning is against shariah law and would be the ‘worst condemnable sin’ against Islam. Mr Henning’s brother-in-law Colin Livesey said he fears the air strikes could make it harder to find Mr Henning as the group will be forced to move. Dr Shameela Islam-Zulfiqar, who travelled with Mr Henning on several aid convoys to Syria, warned UK air strikes would leave little hope of Mr Henning being released alive. She added: ‘It doesn’t leave you very optimistic, but we still have to remain hopeful.’ Hopeful: A yellow ribbon inscribed with the words 'Free Alan Henning' adorns a fence in his home town of Salford, as his friends, family and neighbours pray for his release .

"The UN's World Health Organisation has come out with the firm recommendation that we should all be aiming to cut our sugar intake by half . On paper, you would think it had been a good week for those with serious concerns about the amounts of sugar that so many of us are consuming. On Wednesday, for instance, no less an authority than the UN’s World Health Organisation came out with the firm recommendation that we should all be aiming to cut our sugar intake by half and that children should not be given fizzy drinks at all. That came just one day after Dame Sally Davies, the Government’s Chief Medical Officer, proposed that a sugar tax needed to be introduced if we wanted to cut sugar intake and reduce obesity. And it came on the same day that an eminent New York cardiovascular research scientist warned that the long-running demonisation of fats, and saturated fats in particular, could be entirely misplaced. The real killer, according to Dr James DaNicolantio, particularly when it comes to heart disease and Type 2 diabetes — those two scourges of the modern age — is sugar. After these three dramatic interventions, surely it is game, set and match for those of us who would like to see sugar consumption seriously reduced? Well, as a cardiologist and science director of the campaigning health group, Action On Sugar, I can tell you that we’re certainly not dancing in the streets just yet. For despite the mounting evidence of the damage to health done by sugar — evidence that many working in the field would now describe as overwhelming — this was the response from the Prime Minister’s official spokesman on Wednesday: ‘What we are doing is working with the industry. You have already seen commitments from retailers and food manufacturers to reduce levels of salt, to remove some artificial fats, to reduce calorie content and improve labelling.’ It’s the first sentence — ‘what we are doing is working with the industry’ — that gives the game away because it’s absolutely true. The links between Government ministers and food manufacturers, and indeed between scientists who are supposed to advise the Government and the food manufacturers, are nothing short of astonishing. For these are the same food manufacturers who have been adding extra sugar to processed foods, confectionery and fizzy drinks for decades. The London Olympic Games, the biggest celebration of fitness and health in this country for decades, was sponsored by Coca-Cola and McDonald's . It is the closeness of those links that are widely blamed for a compulsory food traffic-light system — an idea once enthusiastically championed by the Food Standards Agency and designed to give shoppers an idea of the nutritional value (or not) of the item they were about to buy — quietly dying a death soon after the Coalition came to power. But then what do we expect when the London Olympic Games, the biggest celebration of fitness and health in this country for decades, was sponsored by Coca-Cola and McDonald’s? And what do we expect when, as this newspaper revealed only last month, fast-food companies, supermarkets and restaurant chains have had dozens of meetings with ministers since the last election? Nando’s, Tesco, Pepsi, Mars and, almost inevitably, the ubiquitous McDonald’s are among those who have had the chance to bend the ministerial ear since 2010. Government ministers hate their close links to the food industry being exposed by the media. But these links exist and are one reason, I believe, for the Government’s lax approach. Too often, when a minister pronounces on dietary matters, I wonder whether he is just saying what his chums in the food industry have told him to say. Meanwhile, rates of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer — all conditions with increasingly strong links to sugar intake — continue to rise. Influential organisations such as the British Nutrition Foundation have a membership that reads like the Who's Who of the sugar industry - Coca-Cola and Pepsi among them . The Food and Drink Federation, the industry lobby group, for instance, has had 16 meeting with ministers since the last election and an astonishing 99 with Government officials. By contrast, we in Action On Sugar have had just one, although a second, we’re told, is in the pipeline. There’s no way of knowing who has met whom, but there is also no hiding the conflicts of interest. Bill Morgan, special adviser to former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, for instance, came from a PR firm that has Coca-Cola, Kraft Foods and Tesco on its books, although the PR company has always denied that Mr Morgan worked on two of those accounts. But its website did highlight his potential for linking the interests of its clients with Government policy. Even Mr Lansley, himself, architect of the Government’s ‘Responsibility Deal’, which effectively handed responsibility for the levels of fats, salt and sugar in food to the food manufacturers themselves, has past links with the industry. In 2009, while still Shadow Health Secretary, he was director of a marketing firm where clients included Pepsi, Mars, Pizza Hut and Diageo’s Guinness. Earlier this year, Channel 4’s Dispatches programme revealed that five of the eight members of the Government’s Scientific Advisory Committee of Nutrition (SACN) received substantial funding from large confectionary companies. The real killer, according to Dr James DaNicolantio, particularly when it comes to heart disease and Type 2 diabetes - those two scourges of the modern age - is sugar . These included the committee’s chairman, Professor Ian Macdonald, who receives money not only from Unilever, the world’s biggest ice-cream maker, but also from Coca-Cola and Mars. His committee colleague, Professor Tom Sanders, one of the Government’s most trusted advisers when it comes to diet, sugar and heart disease, has had his research funded to the tune of £4.5 million by the sugar giant Tate & Lyle. There is, of course, no evidence — or indeed, any suggestion — that members of the SACN have ever put the interests of the companies that sponsor them first. But the committee has gone against prevailing scientific opinion as rates of obesity and diet-related diabetes have grown and its reports are said to be one of the main reasons why official health advice on the amounts of sugar we eat haven’t changed in 11 years. The WHO is absolutely right, we must cut down on our consumption of dietary sugar . This advice suggests that an individual can consume a staggering 22 teaspoons of sugar a day as part of a guideline daily amount. On Wednesday, the World Health Organisation suggested that figure should be just six teaspoons. The difference is huge and, in the face of the dramatic intervention by the WHO, I wonder if the SACN’s committee’s recommendations will suddenly be changing now? On Wednesday, I was due to go on Channel 4 News to discuss the WHO’s new recommendations but the debate was cancelled when the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) withdrew, apparently after discovering that I would be up against them. Had they turned up, I might have pointed out that the relentless drive for profit among food companies had contributed to unnecessary suffering for millions of people and thousands of deaths that might otherwise have been prevented. Moreover, there is growing evidence that not all calories are the same (contrary to what the food companies will tell you). Research from Stanford University last year showed that for every 150 sugar calories (from a can of Coke, for example) consumed above the recommended daily calorie intake, there is an 11-fold increase in the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes compared with 150 ‘excess’ calories consumed from a non-sugar source. That increase is completely independent of body weight and levels of exercise: in other words, we are all vulnerable. Yet still the Government does nothing. And as long as influential organisations such as the British Nutrition Foundation have a membership that reads like the Who’s Who of the sugar industry — Coca-Cola, Kellogg’s McDonald’s, Nestle and Pepsi among them — and the British Dietetic Association can promote an Eat Well plate that includes a full-sugar can of cola and fruit juice as part of a balanced diet, I fear that won’t change. But change it must, for our health, and particularly the health of our children, depends upon it. The WHO is absolutely right, we must cut down on our consumption of dietary sugar and it’s high-time the Government cast aside its cosy relationship with the food industry, faced up to the unpalatable scientific facts and did the right thing.","World Health Organisation recommended cutting our sugar intake by half .

"Everton winger Christian Atsu scored twice as Ghana booked their place in the semi-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations by beating Guinea 3-0. Atsu, who has scarcely played during his loan spell at Goodison Park from Chelsea, struck his goals either side of one from Crystal Palace striker Kwesi Appiah. The second in particular was a magnificent strike, as Atsu cut in from the right wing and curled a beautiful dipping shot over the dive of Guinea keeper Naby Yattara to make it 3-0. Ghana's Christian Atsu (second left) celebrates scoring his side's second goal in the 3-0 win over Guinea .

Sent off: N Yattara 93 . Atsu, despite his lack of playing time in England, is an established name in Ghana, and has been a regular for Avram Grant’s side in Equatorial Guinea. But for 24-year-old striker Appiah, on loan from Crystal Palace, this was his first international start, and it brought his first international goal. The League Two forward also helped provide another on his full debut, as the Black Stars saw off Guinea with incredible ease. Ghana were helped greatly by some woeful Guinean defending, in particular for Appiah’s goal shortly before half -time. Centre back Baissama Sankoh made such a hash of his clearance that it trickled straight into the striker’s path on the edge of the box, and Appiah, with no defenders in sight, finished coolly through Yattara’s legs. A fan waits for the start of the quarter-final match in Malabo with '2015' glasses on his face . Everton winger Atsu (centre) advances with the ball past Guinea defender Djibril Paye (right) It was the crowning glory on an excellent display from the Thamesmead-born forward, who also had a hand in the first goal, scored by Atsu, in just the fourth minute. Appiah drove at the Guinea defence before feeding Andre Ayew in the box. The Marseille forward took the ball away from goal before rolling it across the box, for Asamoah Gyan. But despite the striker arriving ahead of the ball, it still arrived for Atsu to convert emphatically at the far post. From that point on Ghana were in control without ever having to get into top gear. Guinea - who only reached the quarter-final through the random procedure of drawing lots - were disappointing from start to finish. They had promised to lift their Ebola-ravaged nation with a win after their mid-week reprieve, but never looked capable of scoring. Ghana's fans cheers for their team during the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-final match on Sunday . Kevin Constant, excellent throughout the group stages, was extremely disappointing before being replaced shortly before the hour, while Idrissa Sylla, inexplicably preferred to Mohamed Yattara up front, was appalling until half-time, when he was hooked. Even the usually lively Ibrahima Traore was strangely subdued, as the National Elephant failed to muster a single shot on target. To add insult to injury they had Naby Yattara sent off in stoppage time for bringing down Gyan with a flying kick when the former Sunderland man was through on goal. Yattara might have been shown a red card an hour earlier for a needless shove on Atsu, so he could have few complaints about his late dismissal, which saw an outfield player between the posts for the final few seconds. Ghana's players celebrate their second goal during the 3-0 victory over Guinea in Malabo on Sunday . The win will take Ghana through to face hosts Equatorial Guinea, and barring complacency - or the sort of fortune that the home side enjoyed on Saturday night in beating Tunisia - it is hard to see them failing to make the final now. It is a far cry from the shocking performances of the first two games, when Avram Grant seemed unable to coax the best from his talented squad. But in Atsu and Appiah he seems to have found a new generation of threatening forwards.

"Overlooked details in the infamous lawsuit that won an elderly woman was awarded $2.86million after spilling a cup of scalding McDonalds coffee on herself have been revealed in a re-examination of the case. Stella Liebeck's lawsuit was turned into a punch-line as many news outlets overlooked the critical facts of the case including the nearly 700 other complaints that McDonalds had received about their hot coffee. A new video produced by Retro Reports shows the graphic photos of the third-degree burns that then-79-year-old Liebeck received on her groin, saying that after viewing the physical damage that she underwent they decided to give her a hefty sum. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Victim: Stella Liebeck was 79-years-old when she suffered third-degree burns to her groin after spilling a cup of scalding coffee on herself while sitting in a parked car . They initially decided to order the restaurant chain to pay her $160,000 in medical expenses and compensatory damages, as well as an additional $2.7million in punitive damages. The judge was the one to reduce that amount down to $640,000 before the final payout was settled out of court. What wasn't commonly reported was the way in which the jury came up with the $2.7million figure. At the time, McDonalds earned roughly $1.33million per day on coffee sales alone, so the jury felt it was appropriate for them to pay the equivalent of two day's earnings. Another point in Mrs Liebeck's favor- which was pointed out in a documentary called 'Hot Coffee'- was the fact that McDonalds ordered workers to brew their coffee between 180 degrees and 190 degrees. Typical at-home coffee machines brew their drinks at about 30 degrees lower. Infamous: The details of her lawsuit were kept confidential for much of the case, making many see it as outrageous that a jury awarded her $2.9million in damages from McDonalds . Verdict: The judge lowered the pay out to $640,000 and then they finally settled out of court, but what many did not understand was that $2.7m of the $2.9m made up two days of coffee profits for the fast food giant . WARNING: This photo was one shown to the jury where they saw the skin graft that had to be taken out of Mrs Liebeck's leg to replace the skin that had suffered third degree burns in her groin . A doctor testified that a 180-degree liquid can cause third-degree burns in less than 15 seconds. That is what happened to Mrs Liebeck. She was sitting in the passenger seat of her grandson's parked car when she put the coffee between her knees and spilt it in her lap. Rush to judgement: Her case was seen as an example of being overly litigious, but many did not know the real details . 'All I remember was trying to get out of the car. I screamed, not realizing I was burned that bad. I just knew I was in terrible pain,' she said in a television interview. She sustained burns over 16 per cent of her body, and doctors later determined that 6 per cent of that area were classified as third-degree burns. She spent a week in the hospital being treated for the burns, which racked up $10,000 in medical expenses. Retro . Reports states that Mrs Liebeck sent a letter to the fast food giant . asking for them to pay for her medical expenses and they said that they . would give her $800 to settle the issue.

"Lorry drivers are being ordered to avoid Calais because of confrontations with knife-wielding illegal immigrants who are trying to get to Britain. Cross-Channel haulage firms are advising drivers to use other ports – including Cherbourg, Boulogne and Dunkirk – to transport goods to the UK to prevent migrants clambering into their vehicles. Up to 2,000 foreigners – mainly Africans and Asians – have massed at Calais in a desperate bid to reach our shores where they will be able to claim benefits if they fail to find jobs. Scroll down for video . Caught out: 16 immigrants were found in a tanker that was filling up at a Calais petrol station on Saturday . The growing problem has led to calls for a new Sangatte-style refugee camp – a successor to the notorious Red Cross centre closed in 2002 that was used by 60,000 people as a springboard for illegal entry to the UK. Angry truckers have told of desperate migrants armed with knives, iron bars and other weapons who leap on to UK-bound ferries. At the weekend police launched a hunt for an Iraqi Kurd people-smuggler who pointed a pump-action shotgun at them as they arrested 15 illegal immigrants who were attempting to stow away in the back of a wagon parked in Calais. And three Sudanese migrants suffered severe knife wounds during a vicious fight in the centre of the town over the right to a favourite spot to leap onto passing lorries. The migrants lie in wait in groups at junctions where lorries have to slow down and stop. Aided by unscrupulous criminal gangs, they risk their lives trying to open the trailers doors and jump inside before the targeted vehicles drive on. On Saturday, 17 migrants suffering from lack of oxygen were discovered huddled inside a Dutch tanker and were rescued only after the driver heard them banging to be released – a chilling echo of the Afghan migrants, one of whom had died, who were discovered at Tilbury earlier this month. Meanwhile, hundreds of migrants attempted to break into stationary UK-bound lorries when a motorway to Calais ground to a halt with a huge traffic jam. Taking action: Theresa May held top-level talks with Calais officials on Friday in a bid to tackle the crisis . French Police were forced to divert trucks on other routes as the numbers of potential stowaways became so great they were unmanageable. Now many haulage firms are telling drivers to use other French ports to reach the UK – raising concerns that new migrants camps will also spring up in those towns. Others, however, cannot avoid Calais because they have fixed-term contracts with ferry companies that depart from there. Robin Walkam, 34, a trucker from Hartlepool, said transport company bosses had ordered drivers to avoid Calais when crossing the Channel amid fears of harm to employees and goods. He said: ‘It is very dangerous to cross from Calais. The migrants cause a lot of damage. ‘In the old days it was easy to monitor their movements. They were much fewer. Now there are dozens at a time and they are more organised and quite capable of staging diversions. ‘It’s like being in a war zone. The only difference is that we have no body armour and can’t carry guns. Sooner or later some driver is going to get killed.’ A member of staff at a truck stop in Calais, close to the migrants’ camp, said: ‘It’s no wonder that drivers are now avoiding Calais if they can. You only have to look outside to see the scale of the problem. ‘The migrants are everywhere hanging around the trucks whilst they refill or the drivers have a meal or take a shower.’ On Friday Home Secretary Theresa May held top-level talks with French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve in a bid to come up with a solution to tackle the crisis. Calais’ mayor Natacha Bouchart has called on the French minister to scrap British immigration controls based in France – a move that would open the floodgates to the UK – even if it ‘causes a diplomatic incident’. She also announced plans for a ‘Sangatte 2’ hostel, providing shelter, food and washing facilities, for 400 refugees who are currently squatting in makeshift camps and disused buildings while seeking to reach Britain’s shores. It would be built at a rundown summer camp for children on the Calais coast, less than 30 minutes’ walk from truck depots and Calais ferry terminal, with views towards the white cliffs of Dover. She also demanded the UK would tear down its border controls in Calais – introduced in a 2002 agreement with Paris – a move rejected by Mrs May.","Up to 2,000 foreigners have massed at port in bid to reach the UK .

"To commemorate the life and work of painter Vincent van Gogh, fellow Dutch artist and designer Daan Roosegaarde has created a beautiful, illuminated bike path inspired by one of van Gogh's most famous works. The kilometre-long Van Gogh-Roosegaarde cycle path is inspired by Starry Night and features 50,000 glow-in-the-dark stones, which have been embedded in the ground. The solar-powered stones soak up the sun's rays by day, resulting in a breath-taking swirling pattern of glowing fragments. To commemorate the life and work of Vincent van Gogh, fellow Dutch artist Daan Roosegaarde created this dazzling bike path tribute . The Van Gogh-Roosegaarde cycle path opened in Eindhoven, Netherlands, on November 12 . The opening of this unique installation marks the start of the Van Gogh 2015 international theme year . The path also boasts LED lights, which are meant to enhance visibility on cloudy days when the stones may not be able to charge. 'I wanted to create a place that people will experience in a special way, the technical combined with experience, that's what techno-poetry means to me,' Roosegaarde said in a statement. The cycle path is located in the Dutch county of Brabant, where Van Gogh was born and raised. It opened in the city of Eindhoven on November 13. Inspired by one of Van Gogh's most famous works - Starry Night - the path boasts 50,000 glow-in-the-dark stones . The stones are solar-powered, so they charge via the sun's rays during the day and turn on at night, illuminating the ground for one kilometre . Roosegaarde collaborated with Heijmans, a construction services business, to pull off this gorgeous feat . The installation is part of the larger Van Gogh Cycle Route, which is free of charge and open to the public year round. The entire route measures 335 kilometres and is split into five individual day trips, which connect several Van Gogh heritage sites. The dazzling one kilometre stretch is just part of a series of celebrations, called Van Gogh 2015, intended to mark the 125th anniversary of the painter's death. Over the year, cultural events celebrating the life and work of the artist will be held in the Netherlands, Belgium and France. The one-kilometre stretch is part of the larger 335-kilometre Van Gogh Cycle Route, which takes riders to many artist-inspired heritage sites . Source of inspiration: Vincent van Gogh's iconic painting is housed at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam . Mission accomplished: 'I wanted to create a place that people will experience in a special way,' Roosegaarde said of his achievement .","Crafted by Dutch artist and designer, Daan Roosegarde, to celebrate the life and work of the acclaimed painter .

"The radical Orion spacecraft, designed to carry astronauts into deep space, has been given to go-ahead to launch for the first time on Thursday. The launch has been overshadowed by two space disasters - the Antares rocket explosion and the tragic failure of Virgin Galactic's SpaceShip Two. However, Nasa hopes the launch could reinvigorate the space programme. Scroll down for video . Ready to go! Engineers are now preparing Orion to launch on top of 180ft tall (55 metres) United Launch Alliance Delta 4 Heavy rockets in an unmanned test flight on December 4th. Weather conditions remain good for Thursday's Orion test flight, forecasters say. The latest predictions show  there is a 60 percent chance of favorable weather for the 7:05 a.m. launch aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. There is a 40 percent chance of violating the flight through precipitation and liftoff wind rules. Engineers are now preparing Orion to launch atop 180ft tall (55 metres) United Launch Alliance Delta 4 Heavy rockets in an unmanned test flight on December 4th. NASA and Lockheed Martin completed the Flight Readiness Review (FRR) for Orion's upcoming flight test Dec. 4, giving a 'go' to proceed. The FRR is a rigorous assessment of the spacecraft, its systems, mission operations and support functions needed to successfully complete Orion's first voyage to space. The spacecraft is hoped to take astronauts to explore an asteroid and eventually make the 34 million mile (55 million km) journey to Mars. Nasa's quest to send astronauts out into the solar system begins this week with a two-laps-around-Earth test flight. The new Orion spacecraft is not going to Mars just yet; Thursday's debut will be unmanned and last just 4 1/2 hours. But it will be the farthest a built-for-humans capsule has flown since the Apollo moon missions, shooting 3,600 miles out into space in order to gain enough momentum to re-enter the atmosphere at a scorching 20,000 mph. The dry run, if all goes well, will end with a Pacific splashdown off Mexico's Baja coast. Navy ships will recover the capsule, a la Apollo, for future use. This initial Orion is rigged with 1,200 sensors to gauge its durability for the day when astronauts do climb aboard during the decade ahead. Advertised destinations include an asteroid to be corralled in lunar orbit for human exploration in the 2020s, followed by Mars in the 2030s. 'We're approaching this as pioneers,' said William Hill of NASA's exploration systems development office. 'We're going out to stay eventually. ... It's many, many decades away, but that's our intent.' Lockheed Martin Corp. built the capsule and is staging the $370 million test flight for NASA. Orion is NASA's first new spacecraft for humans in more than a generation, succeeding the now-retired space shuttles. Unlike the capsules under development by two U.S. companies for space station crew transport, Orion is meant for the long haul, both in time and space; it would be supplemented with habitats for potential Mars trips. 'We need a spacecraft that's going to be sturdy enough and robust enough' to carry astronauts well beyond low-Earth orbit for weeks and months at a time, said Lockheed Martin's Bryan Austin, a former NASA shuttle flight director who will oversee Orion's maiden voyage. During its December 4 test flight, the unmanned capsule will shoot more than 3,600 miles (5,790km) into space. It will then take two big laps around Earth before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph (32,200 km/h) and parachuting into the Pacific off the San Diego coast. The Launch Abort System and upper stage, shown in the left of this image, have been transported to Cape Canaveral. Here, they will be joined with the Delta IV Heavy Rocket ahead of a test flight in December. The right image shows the stages Orion will go through during flight . During the two-orbit, four-hour mission, engineers will evaluate the systems critical to crew safety, the launch abort system, the heat shield and the parachute system. The data gathered during the mission will influence design decisions and validate existing computer models. The flight also will reduce overall mission risks and costs for later Orion flights. The capsule will re-enter Earth's atmosphere generating temperatures as high as 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit, before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. 'That's how Orion really separates itself from the commercial field. 'They're there to get you to station and back. Of course, we're there to be hardened enough to sustain it for that long duration.' For this orbital tryout, a Delta IV rocket will hoist Orion from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. 'Liftoff is scheduled for 7:05 a.m. EST, just after sunrise. 'The rocket, with Orion and its launch escape tower at the tiptop, stretches 242 feet high. Future Orion launches will use the mega rocket still under development by NASA, known as SLS or Space Launch System. The first Orion-SLS launch is targeted for 2018, unmanned, followed by the first piloted mission in 2021. No one at NASA is pleased with such a poky pace. At best, it will be seven years before astronauts fly Orion - anywhere. By comparison, it took eight years from the time President John Kennedy announced his intentions of landing a man on the moon - before John Glenn had even rocketed into orbit - to Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin's lunar boot prints in 1969. Given the present budget situation, 'it is what it is,' said Kennedy Space Center's director Robert Cabana, a former astronaut. And the presidential election ahead could bring further delays and uncertainties. In any case, don't confuse Orion with NASA's old-time Apollo capsules. For one, the 11-foot-tall Orion is designed to hold four astronauts, one more than Apollo. For relatively short outings of three weeks or so, Orion could accommodate six. After a 22-mile journey from the Launch Abort System Facility at the Kennedy Space Center, the Orion Spacecraft arrives at Space Launch Complex 37B at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, in Cape Canaveral . Test flight: Orion will make two big laps around Earth before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph (32,200 km/h). Pictured is an artist's impression of the Orion craft in orbit . 'People often ask us, `Hey, this thing looks like a capsule, it looks like Apollo,' and people will confuse that with `it's not new,' ' said Scott Wilson, NASA's Orion production operations manager. While physics drives the capsule's outer bell shape, 'everything else in the capsule is state-of-the-art,' he said. 'Everything, from the thrusters, from the environmental control systems, to the structure itself' is benefiting from all the advances in technology, Wilson said. With no one on board, this first Orion will have hunks of aluminum in place of seats for ballast, simulators instead of cockpit displays and, obviously, no life-support. The heat shield on Orion's base, designed to protect the craft from the searing temperatures of atmospheric re-entry, is 16.5 feet across and is the biggest, most advanced of its kind ever made, according to NASA. On this flight, Orion will reach close to 4,000 degrees, not quite the 5,000 degrees that would be generated from a moon mission, but close enough for a shakedown. That's why Orion will aim for a 3,600-mile-high peak altitude, more than 14 times higher than the International Space Station - to pick up enough speed to come back fast and hot. NASA is pulling out all the stops for Orion's inaugural run. The space agency has teamed up with the nonprofit, educational Sesame Street Workshop to promote not just this mission, but the effort to send astronauts to Mars. Comics, video and graphics are building up the countdown. 'The astronauts of the 2030s and beyond are today's preschoolers,' NASA explains on its website. There's even a new countdown clock to herald the event. Last week, Kennedy Space Center took down its familiar launch countdown clock dating back to the Apollo program; officials said it had become too expensive to fix and maintain. A new multimedia display went up in its place, just as long at 26 feet, but taller at 7 feet. The countdown begins: The Orion craft, designed to carry astronauts into deep space, as it arrived at Cape Canaveral Air Station in Florida . 'This is just the first of what will be a long line of exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit,' said Bill Hill, deputy associate administrator for Exploration Systems Development. 'In a few years we will be sending our astronauts to destinations humans have never experienced. It's thrilling to be a part of the journey now, at the beginning.' During the trip to Cape Canaveral from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center, the conical-shaped capsule was encased in its 52ft-tall (16 metre) protective fairing. The entire transported stack - which includes the fairing,  crew module and 'Launch Abort System' - is 70ft tall (21 metres) in total, or about the size of five double decker buses. When attached to the rockets, it will be around 250ft (76 metres). Last month the Delta IV Heavy rocket, built by United Launch Alliance, made its move to nearby Space Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.","Nasa's Orion spacecraft is designed to carry astronauts to an asteroid and eventually to Mars .
