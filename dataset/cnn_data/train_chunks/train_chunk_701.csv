The creeping paralysis began in Emily Thompson’s hands and feet and eventually became so complete that she could not speak or move her eyelids. But the former dancer has astonished doctors by recovering in weeks from a rare medical condition which left her helpless and in intensive care. Miss Thompson, 20, was diagnosed with the disorder Guillain-Barré syndrome, which affects one in 50,000 people and attacks the lining of the nerves. It is so serious that one in five patients never make a full recovery. Emily Thompson (pictured with her mother, Carolyn) was left unable to move after developing the nerve condition Guillain-Barré syndrome - it causes the immune system to attack the nerves resulting in paralysis . Her family was devastated  when she . developed pneumonia and spent five weeks on a ventilator and a further . two weeks in intensive care. But this week, after a total of  only ten weeks in hospital, Miss Thompson was able to take her first two steps. ‘Being unable to move was terrifying,’ she said. ‘I thought I could not take any more. I wanted to die. ‘But after five weeks the feeling started to return to my face, and slowly I was able to speak again. Ms Thompson (pictured with her sister, Victoria, and brother, Michael) spent ten weeks in hospital. For seven weeks she was in intensive care and developed pneumonia meaning it was feared she might not survive . Ms Thompson (pictured before she fell ill) was diagnosed after noticing her hands and feet had gone numb. She has now taken her first steps and is finally being released from hospital . ‘I . am starting to take my first steps, and doctors say I will make a full . recovery. To say I am relieved would be an understatement.’ Miss . Thompson, of Newton Hall, near Durham, first realised something was . wrong in August, when she developed a numb feeling in her hands and . feet. A few days later she was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome and taken into hospital. Her . family, including her mother Carolyn, 51, father David, 49, sister . Victoria, 29, and brother Michael, 27, kept a bedside vigil. Soon . Miss Thompson, who is studying to become a social worker at Sunderland . University, could not move a single part of her body. Ms Thompson (pictured before her illness) will now spend time in rehabilitation learning how to walk again. She says that for a while she believed she would not ever be able to walk again . Ms Thompson said: 'There were 10 days when I couldn't remember anything. I just didn't know what was real or what was a dream' She . went into a dream-like state for ten days, having hallucinations that . she was a Big Brother contestant and that her father had won the . lottery. After seven weeks in intensive care, Miss Thompson’s condition improved and she began to regain feeling in her body. She . said: ‘I just wanted to cry when I started to move. It was so . overwhelming because I thought it was never going to happen.’ Guillain-Barré . syndrome occurs when the immune system attacks the nerves. Most . patients develop it shortly after having a viral or bacterial infection. Treatments target the antibodies in the blood that are attacking the . nerves. Ms Thompson (pictured before her illness) does not remember very much from her time in hospital so her oler sister, Victoria, has written her a diary of her time in intensive care . Guillain-Barré  syndrome is an autoimmune disease which affects just one in 50,000 people in the UK. Symptoms, including pain, tingling and numbness, begin in the feet and hands and move into the arms and legs. It can also cause muscle weakness, co-ordination problems, paralysis and even death. The exact cause is not known, but most people develop the syndrome after a viral or bacterial infection. It attacks the peripheral nervous system - the network of nerves outside the central nervous system, including the motor nerves, used by the brain to control muscles. Around 20 per cent of people never recover fully from the syndrome.","Emily Thompson, from Durham, was healthy until she got Guillain-Barré syndrome which causes the immune system to attack the nerves .

A Mormon doctor in Utah has been found guilty of the 'perfect murder' after forcing his wife to have a facelift so he could give her a lethal cocktail of drugs and then drown her in the bathtub. Martin MacNeill half-smiled as the jury found him guilty early on Saturday morning of murdering his wife, Michele, six years ago. Prosecutors claimed the father-of-eight tried to move his mistress into the family home shortly after his wife's death, and a previous lover told the court the doctor had claimed he could kill a person without anyone knowing. As the verdict was read out at 1.10am his daughters, who had testified against him, let out a cry of relief and cried after winning their long battle to get justice for their mother. Guilty: Martin MacNeill smiles as he thanks his defense team after he was found guilty of murder and obstruction of justice early Saturday morning . 'We're . just so happy he . can't hurt anyone else,' Alexis Somers, one of his older daughters, . said. 'We miss our mom; we'll never see her again. But that courtroom was . full of so many people who loved her.'The victim's sister, Linda Cluff, added: . 'We're thankful for the prosecutors who did such a good job and to the . jurors who could see the evidence. We got justice today. I am just . thrilled.' Victim: Michele MacNeill's husband was accused of making her have a facelift so he could give her a cocktail of drugs and then her in the bathtub . Martin MacNeill, 57, showed little emotion when the verdict was read. He hugged his lawyer afterward and said: 'It's OK.' He . faces 15 years to life for first-degree murder when he is sentenced on . January 7. He also was found guilty of obstruction of justice, which . could . add one to 15 years. MacNeill was led by deputies back to Utah County . jail. Randy Spencer, one of his lawyers, said he was disappointed, before declining further comment. The . chief prosecutor, Chad Grunander, said the largely circumstantial case . was the most difficult he ever brought to trial and that many . prosecutors wouldn't bother trying, especially with medical examiners . unable to produce a finding of homicide. 'It . was an almost perfect murder,' Mr Grunander said in his closing argument, . asserting that MacNeill 'pumped her full of drugs' that he knew would be . difficult to detect once she was dead. Tears in court: Linda Cluff, sister of Michelle MacNeill hugs friends after court was adjourned following the guilty verdict against Martin MacNeill . Feeling the pressure: Martin MacNeill, who is accused of killing his wife, heard the closing arguments in his first-degree murder trial on Friday. If convicted, he faces life in prison . An early mistress of MacNeill's testified he once confided he could induce a heart attack in someone that would appear natural. After . deliberating for 11 hours, the jury issued its guilty verdict to murder . and obstruction of justice shortly after 1am on Saturday. The . case shocked the Mormon community of Pleasant Grove, 35 miles south of . Salt Lake City, and captured national attention because the defendant . was a wealthy doctor and a lawyer. The father-of-eight had a . picture-perfect family and was a former bishop in his local congregation of . The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Defense . lawyers contended that Michele MacNeill died of natural causes. They believed . she had a heart attack and fell headfirst into the tub. They noted that the post-mortem examination showed she had an enlarged heart, a narrowing of the arteries, and liver and kidney deterioration. 'There's . simply no proof' of homicide,' Mr Spencer said. 'The prosecution has . presented to you their cherry-picked portion of the evidence.' He . called the testimony of a handful of prison inmates angling for early . release doubtful. The men who spent time behind bars with the doctor . testified he had acknowledged killing his wife - or suggested that . investigators could never prove he did it. Their . testimony was the only direct evidence of murder, Mr Grunander said. MacNeill's lawyers argued he would never admit murder to strangers in . prison. Attack: Prosecutor Chad Grunander, left, and defense attorney Randy Spencer give their final arguments . Look of love: Gypsy Willis passes Martin . MacNeill, a doctor accused of murdering his wife, after testifying . against him. They had an affair for more than a year before . the death . Former lover: Gypsy Willis, who had been having an affair with MacNeill for 15 months when his wife died, looks towards MacNeill from the witness stand during a recess in his trial on Thursday . MacNeill was medical director of the . Utah State Development Center, a residential center for people with . cognitive disorders, who moonlighted in other medical jobs, once . consulting for a laser hair removal clinic. He had a law degree but . wasn't known to practice law and has since surrendered his law and . medical licenses. The highlight of the . three-week trial was a mistress who MacNeill introduced as a nanny . within weeks of his wife's death. His older daughters quickly recognized . Gypsy Willis as his secret lover and said her mother had been arguing . with her husband over the affair. Mr Grunander told the Salt Lake Tribune one of the most damning pieces of evidence had been a government identification application MacNeill filled out for Ms Willis who had stated she was his wife, Jillian MacNeill. On the section of the form asking for their wedding date, MacNeill had written April 14, 2007 - the date of his wife's funeral. His daughters went to work uncovering what they call their father's secret . life. They abandoned him while dogging authorities to open a murder . investigation. It wasn't until MacNeill's release in July 2012 from a . federal prison in Texas on charges of fraud that Utah prosecutors moved . to file charges of murder and obstruction of justice. Ms Willis . also served a federal sentence for using the identity of one of . MacNeill's adopted daughters to escape a debt-heavy history. That . daughter had been sent back to Ukraine, supposedly only for a summer. For . a time, MacNeill's only family defender was his only son. Damian, a . 24-year-old law student, committed suicide in January 2010, according to . his sisters, who have said he was haunted by their mother's death. 'Pillow talk': Martin MacNeill's former mistress . Anna Walthall testified that he told her he knew how to give someone . certain drugs and they would die and it would make it look like a . natural heart attack . Happy family? Martin MacNeill, second from right, stands accused of murder in the 2007 death of his wife and the mother of his eight children . Loss: Michele MacNeill, right, was found unconscious in a bathtub in 2007. Prosecutors claim that her husband, left, left her there to die after giving her a lethal cocktail of prescription drugs . Prosecutors . said MacNeill might have got away with a perfect murder, but his . erratic behavior the day of his wife's death and shortly afterward was 'dripping with motive'. They reminded jurors . about testimony that MacNeill stood in the bathroom yelling what . prosecutors called phony grief, 'Why did you do this? All because of a . stupid surgery,' as paramedics tried to revive his wife. Family . testimony suggested it was MacNeill who insisted his 50-year-old wife, a . former beauty queen in her California hometown, get the surgery. Prosecutors said he used it as an excuse to mix painkillers, Valium and . sleeping pills for her supposed recovery. 'Make no mistake, the defendant's fingerprints, if you will, are all over Michele's death,' Mr Grunander said. Prosecutors . said MacNeill contrived a medical condition in the weeks leading up to . his wife's death, telling many around him he was dying of cancer or . multiple sclerosis to absolve him of any motive in the death. He also . made use of a cane and could be seen limping at times. Investigators . who subpoenaed MacNeill's medical records found he was in good . health. And they discovered something else: MacNeill had been collecting . veteran benefits for decades, saying in an application he had bipolar . or anti-social disorders. MacNeill's arrest . warrant contains a former girlfriend's explosive allegation - not used . at the trial - that MacNeill killed a brother and tried to kill his . mother long ago. Utah investigators confirmed . the brother, Rufus Roy MacNeill, was found dead in a bathtub in New . Jersey. They determined MacNeill was never charged and found no . indication he was ever under investigation for it.","Attorneys delivered closing arguments in murder trial of Martin MacNeill, who is accused of killing his wife Michele in 2007 .

A man who killed a convicted sex offender by setting fire to his flat in a bid to force him to move out has been jailed for 10 years. Daniel Martin pushed a blazing wheelie bin up against the front door of Andrew Heath's flat in Worcester in the early hours of December 14, 2011. This sparked a fire which consumed much of the flat, killing the 52-year-old victim. Sentencing Martin, 25, for manslaughter at Birmingham Crown Court today, Mrs Justice Thirlwall said the crime was 'shockingly stupid'. Jailed: Daniel Martin, left, has admitted killing sex offender Andrew Heath, right, by setting a fire in his flat . She said the killer had intended 'to do something so frightening, it would cause him to move away from the area where he had lived since 2001'. 'You say you threw stones at his window to try and wake him and say you saw a light come on,' she added. 'Whatever you did, it was too little too late. 'You say your intention was only to frighten the victim and the prosecution accept you did not intend to kill or attempt to cause really serious harm.' The judge added that Martin was not a danger to the public, but he 'was a liar and thoroughly anti-social', with a long record of previous convictions. Attack: The flat was gutted after Martin set a wheelie bin on fire and pushed it against the door . Mrs Justice Thirlwall accepted that Martin had expressed genuine remorse after pleading guilty to the crime. She also heard prosecution evidence indicating Martin had an IQ in the lowest percentile. Mr Heath died of smoke inhalation in what the judge said must have been a 'terrifying experience', in which he would have known he would almost certainly die. Mrs Justice Thirlwall added the fire spread quickly, burning through the door and up Mr Heath's stairway into the flat. His burned body was found by firefighters slumped against a radiator. Investigation: Police in the street where the crime occurred in December 2011 . The victim had five convictions for gross indecency and indecent assault against teenage boys aged between 14 and 17 in Leicester and Birmingham between 1985 and 1999. The court heard that he was known as 'the fag man' because he used to give teenagers cigarettes in an effort to 'befriend' them. Martin was separately jailed for three years for two burglaries, carried out before he was arrested over Mr Heath's killing in October last year. He was further imprisoned for six months for assaulting another man in the street in Worcester, with all the sentences ordered to run concurrently. Afterwards, Mr Heath's sister Leia Charleson said his death had had a devastating effect on the health of their parents, who were unable to come to terms with what happened. Death: Martin apparently only meant to scare Mr Heath in order to force him out of the area . 'Both of my parents passed away without having an answer to their only son's death, and before Daniel Martin admitted his guilt,' she said. Ms Charleson welcomed the outcome as 'some comfort' for the family's grief. 'Despite what Andrew did in the past he did not deserve to die in such a cruel way,' she added. Three of Martin's friends were also jailed for 14 months each in March this year after they talked about frightening witnesses in the case on the internet. Marcus Taylor, 25, Gary Dayus, 26, and Thomas Barnes, 21, who billed their group as the 'Warndon Manz', warned about 'getting the snitches' and running them out of town. The court heard that Taylor posted on a social media site: 'We will get a massive crew together and run them out of Worcester' before referring to taking one witness's 'head off'.","Daniel Martin, 25, pushed a burning bin against Andrew Heath's door .

Classic children's TV shows including Topsy and Tim, the Clangers and the Wombles are being brought back to TV. The new version of Topsy and Tim, which starts tomorrow on CBeebies, has been updated for the 21st century and features bedtime stories from Dad on a tablet computer, Mum spending time on her laptop and the children printing things from their computer. The new version of Topsy and Tim (left) starts tomorrow on CBeebies, starring Jocelyn MacNab and Joshua Lester, based on the old animated series (right) The BBC has also said it is making a new version of the Clangers, due for release in 2015, while Channel 5 will be bringing back the Wombles for 52 new episodes in the same year. Topsy and Tim, which started life as a series of book more than 50 years ago, has been turned into a live-action show following the lives of two preschool twins. The 60 new 15-minute shows chart their adventures from Dad making special sandwiches - an odd combination of peanut butter, lettuce and cheese - to washing the car and babysitting a friend's guinea pigs. Speaking to The Observer Jean Adamson, 86, who invented and illustrated Topsy and Tim with her husband, Gareth, said: 'Childhood has not changed significantly over the past 50 years. The books reflect the things very young children do, grubbing about in the garden, squabbling.' She added that the 130 books, which sold 21million copies, were based on real-life events involving her own three children. Another classic show enjoying a revival on the BBC is Peter Rabbit, which has just started its second series. The Clangers, which was first broadcast by the BBC in 1973 and stars a race of mouse-like creatures living in space, is being brought back for new episodes due to start in 2015 . The Wombles, another BBC series, is being revived on Channel 5 with 52 new episodes due to air on the channel Milkshake morning programme from 2015 .

The Daily Mail has been praised in court for a ‘tenacious’ investigation that smashed a million-pound MOT fraud. Both the judge and the prosecution paid tribute to the work of the newspaper in ending a large-scale operation that put lives at risk. Seamus Montgomery, 70, admitted  supplying fake MOT certificates in a scam that ran for at least five years. Seamus Montgomery (left), 70, admitted supplying fake MOT certificates in a scam that ran for at least five years. The Mail inquiry led to his arrest in 2010 . Incredibly, despite enjoying an enviable lifestyle before his arrest, the retired accountant was given legal aid as he fought the case. He finally admitted his guilt in a plea bargain that led to his wife, Paula, 63, being cleared of similar charges. Montgomery was sentenced to two years in jail, suspended for two years, at Chelmsford Crown Court. It may never be known how many  people were injured – or even died – while behind the wheel of a vehicle given a false MoT by Montgomery. The couple, from Tollesbury, Essex, had a £200,000 townhouse in Alvor, on the Algarve in Portugal and Montogomery would offer the service in foreign newspapers. He was suspected of issuing about 1,000 certificates each year. The fraud was exposed when the Mail investigation was provided with a certificate for a dangerously unroadworthy vehicle. In 2011, we told how he would provide apparently genuine certificates – some of which were blank, others filled out – for £200. When placed under surveillance,  Montgomery was photographed discarding hundreds of records for his ‘MoT business’. Following the disclosure, the  certificate issuing system was changed so that the green paper documents were laser-printed instead and automatically registered on a computer database. Prosecutor Raj Joshi told the court it was a ‘sophisticated’ scam. ‘It was apparent from evidence recovered that this large-scale operation had gone back to 2005,’ he said. ‘It caused considerable harm and undermined confidence in the system of MoTs.’ When police executed a warrant on the Essex holiday home occupied by Montgomery and his wife they found 75 completed MoT  certificates and more than 75 blank documents. Christopher Paxton, defending, said the Montgomerys, who now live in a caravan park in Penzance , Cornwall, had suffered as a result of the case and it had been a ‘great burden’ on them. ‘In the community they lived in they have lost some friends as a result of the allegations,’ he said. ‘The fall from grace has been profound.’ Recorder John Caudle said Montgomery had brought the problems on himself. ‘He could have owned up much earlier,’ he said. ‘It is regrettable to have a man aged 70 here who has succumbed to greed.’ Echoing a judge’s comments at a previous hearing, he paid tribute to how the Mail provided police with the information to smash the fraud. The prosecution said it may not have come to light otherwise. A Legal Aid Agency spokesman said anyone facing a Crown Court trial can apply for funding and a means test ‘ensures more affluent defendants make contributions towards their costs’.","Seamus Montgomery, 70, admitted  supplying fake MoT certificates in a scam that ran for at least five years .

A train carrying 90 cars full of crude oil derailed early Friday morning in western Alaba,a, causing three of the cars to explode and emergency officials still don't know what caused the accident. A dozen cars derailed in the accident four miles outside of Aliceville, Alabama. The derailment caused three to explode and the fire then spread - damaging nine cars. No one on board the train or near the crash site was injured. An undetermined amount of oil spilled into nearby water, but officials said there were no signs of a spreading slick or any threat to drinking water. Aerial photographs showed what appeared to be oil in muddy water around the wreckage. Explosion: A train derailment early Friday morning in Aliceville, Alabama resulted in the explosion of three oil tankers, which spread to damage nine cars total and leak oil into a nearby slough . Investigation: Emergency officials still aren't sure what caused the train to derail in western Alabama. They are waiting for the fire to burn out to start their investigation . Slow: Emergency officials say that the train was moving at a slow pace when it derailed and will be looking into the role a trestle might have played in the accident . Yasamie August, a spokeswoman for Alabama Emergency Management Agency, said only one family was evacuated as a precaution but was allowed to return home soon after. Sheriff David Abston said the train derailed shortly after midnight near a trestle that crosses water. Flames turned the night sky orange, he said. 'It was a bright fire. It was visible from a long way,' Abston said. Two students were hunting in the woods around the train tracks when the derailment happened. The two men headed for the crash to see if anyone needed help and found the train's two conductors who they helped drive away from the scene before the explosions happened. Survivors: The train was carrying more than 90 tankers and a dozen derailed. Above, a picture of the front of the train. The train's two conductors survived the explosion. No injuries were reported . Oil spill: Officials aren't sure how much oil leaked into the surrounding slough, but said that a beaver dam has kept it from spreading . Witnesses: Two students were hunting wild hogs in the surrounding woods when the explosion happened and said it looked like the sun rising, and felt like an earthquake . 'I saw this glowing light through the trees, I thought, it looked like the sun was coming up,' one of the students told ABC 33/40. The force of the explosion was so strong, it shook the earth. 'Really, it was like an earthquake, it felt like an earthquake,' the student added. Firefighters let the blaze burn out since the damage was contained to a rural area. A daytime photo released by the state emergency agency showed five tank cars standing upright on a rail bed with dark smoke visible in the background. Pile-up: When the fire burns out and the investigation is completed, the undamaged trains will continue on their journey to Florida. The train originated in North Dakota . 'It was scary, especially (with) two . boys in the house, two little kids,' witness Heather Garner told . WBMA-TV. 'And I was sitting outside when one tank blew. And it looked . like fire was just coming straight toward the house.' After . the fire burns out (which may take a few days) federal and railway . officials will begin investigating what caused the derailment . The . accident happened in a wetlands area near a creek and the Tombigbee . River. Regional emergency coordinator Don Hartley said it appeared some . oil had entered the water but flames prevented a close investigation. 'Fortunately a beaver dam has caused the water to stand still,' he said. 'Any product in water wouldn’t go anywhere.' Conductors: The trains two conductors were rescued by the two students and driven away from the crash site . Evacuation: Only one family was evacuated as a precaution but were soon allowed to return to their home . Scott Hughes, a spokesman with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management, said an initial test found no contamination to drinking water. Hartley said the short-line train, operated by the Alabama Gulf and Coast Railway, was headed to Florida from North Dakota at the time of the accident, which occurred near a trestle that appeared badly damaged after the accident. The train was moving at a slow pace when the derailment happened. 'One thing the investigation will look at is whether the trestle caused the accident of the accident damaged the trestle,' he said. Aliceville, with about 2,400 residents, is located about 100 miles southwest of Birmingham, near the Mississippi line.","A train carrying 90 crude oil tankers derailed in western Alabama early Friday morning .

A man who made international headlines as a 14-year-old for pretending to be a police officer for several hours and fooling his way into a squad car has been sentenced to prison for posing as a cop yet again. Now 19, Vincent Richardson will spend 18 months behind bars after pleading guilty Thursday to false impersonation of a peace officer after trying to buy police clothing on July 23. The Chicago man walked into VCG Uniform and told the salesman he was an Englewood District officer and needed a nylon duffel bag, cargo pants, blue duty shirt and duty belt. Richardson, of the 6300 block of South Mansfield, was dressed in navy cargo pants and a white duty shirt that resembled what police wear and produced his drivers license. However he abruptly left the store before completing the transaction. The store employee searched Richardson's name on Google and discovered his infamy for impersonating an officer as a kid. Catch Me If You Can: Vincent Richardson has been sentenced to 18 months prison after being caught impersonating a police officer while trying to buy an official uniform. It is the second such offense for the 19-year-old, who as a child spent at least five hours 'on duty' in a notorious and embarassing case for the police department . The employee promptly called police and reported him, according to The Chicago Sun-Times . When Richardson came back to get his ID, real officers were waiting for him. In 2009, Richardson entered the Grand Crossing District station about 1.30pm dressed as an officer and 'reported for duty'. He was just 14-years-old. He identified himself as an officer from another district but was detailed for the day to Grand Crossing and also was savvy enough to sign out a police radio and a ticket book. Richardson was wearing police-issued pants, shirt, vest, sweater and skull cap . He had also used a newspaper under his shirt to give the impression he was wearing a bulletproof vest, which is standard. At the age of 14 and after being in a police youth program, Vincent Richardson 'reported for duty' at a Chicago police station and spent several hours doing traffic stops, like this one, until the officer he was partnered with became suspicious . Richardson partnered with another officer for about five hours, going on traffic stops. The ranking officer became suspicious after noticing Richardson did not have a police star but admitted he did not notice he was underage. His holster was empty as well. The year before Richardson had been part of a community program that allows youths to interact with Chicago police officers. Children who take part in the program are known as a 'police explorer'. It is unknown however how he managed to get a uniform. The case was a huge harassment for the police department. In 2009, Vincent Richardson made international headlines as a 14-year-old after walking into this Grand Crossing District station dressed as an officer. He was assigned to traffic patrol for five hours before his identity was discovered toward the end of the shift . A few months later, Richardson dressed up as a businessman and pretended to take a test drive at a South Side car dealership before driving away with a Lexus. In 2010, he was sentenced to juvenile prison for pushing his mother and stealing his uncle’s car. A year later, he was charged as an adult in a gun case. Richardson received one year in prison for aggravated unlawful use of a weapon, according to court records. This week, Judge Lauren Gottainer Edidin sentenced him to 18 months in prison and issued a $454 fine.","Vincent Richardson, of South Mansfield, Chicago, shot to notoriety as a 14-year-old when he arrived at a police station dressed as an officer and spent 'several hours' on duty before his cover was blown .

Ilie Wacs prefers not to moralize on the twist of fate which led his family to escape the Holocaust but refuses to play down the courage of the man who saved them - a young tailor who worked for his father but was also an SS officer. Mr Wacs and his sister Deborah Strobin were only children in Vienna, Austria, when the Nazis rose to power in the 1930s. As the fascists' grip tightened on Jews across Europe, it would be the warning of the young man called Alois which led to the Wachs family's escape to Italy, then on a boat to Shanghai and finally, America. Deborah Strobin and Ilie Wacs as children with their parents Helen and Moritz in Shanghai, 1946 after escaping Nazi-occupied Austria . In their co-authored book, An Uncommon Journey, the siblings write: 'Alois came to our house. His tone was . quite grave, and he convinced Papa that something terrible was going to . happen. 'I could tell it was dangerous for him even to be seen in our . home. He told Papa, ''Gather your family tonight. Tell them to come here. Keep everyone inside. You will not be touched.''' The nights in question were November 9 and 10, 1938, known as Kristallnacht, or 'The Night of Broken Glass' among the Jewish community. Over the two nights, waves of violence were unleashed against the Jews throughout Germany, annexed Austria and areas of recently-occupied Czechoslovakia. Mr Wacs and Mrs Strobin will commemorate the 75th-anniversary of Kristallnacht by sharing their family's story on November 10 at the Simon Wiesenthal Museum of Tolerance in Los . Angeles. While the family hid silently inside . their apartment, they heard the heavy boots of Nazi officers at . their front door. But no one knocked. The book reads: 'We were passed over. We were shielded by Alois. We were saved.' Siblings Deborah Strobin and Ilie Wacs have written a book, An Uncommon Journey, about their escape from the Nazis during WW2. They are on a mission to find the SS soldier Alois who helped them . Businesses and properties owned by Jews were the target of vicious Nazi mobs during a night of vandalism that is known as Kristallnacht in November 1938 across Germany, annexed Austria and Czechoslovakia . Soon afterwards, the siblings escaped with their parents to Italy and then on a boat to Shanghai, changing their name from Wachs to Wacs. They later moved to America. Mr Wacs, a retired fashion designer, lives in New York City and his sister is a renowned philanthropist in San Francisco. The siblings have spent a long time looking for Alois, or his relatives, so that they can finally thank the man they refer to as the 'Righteous Gentile' for saving their lives. The brother and sister have scant details - only that Alois was in his twenties and head tailor of their father's business at no 7 Lilienbrungasse, Wein 2, in Vienna for a period, including the years 1937 - 1939. He was also a member of the local Nazi party. Mr Wacs, now an artist, told the Huffington Post that if he ever found Alois, he would simply 'thank him for saving our lives'. On his family's miracle escape, Mr Wacs said: 'There is no moral. Life is random. Survival is primarily a matter of luck. We survived because of that man, but if that man hadn't been around, we wouldn't have survived. It's difficult to draw moral conclusions.'

A would-be suicide bomber, a jihadi fighter and an extremist who trained with the failed 21/7 attackers are among six terror suspects who will have restrictions lifted in just two months. The British citizens, aged 25 to 39, all have close links to Pakistan, Somalia and Iran. They have all been under the supervision of MI5 thanks to Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Orders, which involve tagging, restricting their movements and who they can talk to. But, according to The Sun, the orders expire on January 26 after two years - and so far Liberal Democrat ministers have refused to allow their renewal. Six terror suspects could be roaming the streets without restrictions when their control orders expire in January. One is linked to the failed bomb attack on July 21, 2005, two weeks after the atrocity which killed 52, above . The orders can only be renewed if there is fresh evidence of terror-related activity. So far Lib Dem MPs have refused to tighten the laws surrounding the restrictions . Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, left, has warned Home Secretary Theresa May, right, there needs to be 'a plan in place' for each suspect after the orders expire . TPIMs replaced stricter Control Orders in January 2012 under a coalition deal to bolster suspects' civil liberties. Suspect 1: A British man, 25. Involved in liquid bomb plot to blow up transatlantic flights. Suspect 2: British train driver, 31, married with three children. Went to Pakistan for terror training in '08. Suspect 3: Thirty-nine, British, married with five children. Funded brothers' terror activities in Pakistan. Suspect 4: Trained in 2004 with failed 21/7 bombers. Plotted attacks on UK. Aged 29. Suspect 5: Iranian/British, 29, went to Somalia in 2006 for training. Suspect 6: In Afghanistan to fight western troops in 2008 and had terror training in Somalia in 2009. Fought with al-Shabaab. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper warned Home Secretary Theresa May she 'needs to heed the advice of experts, ourselves and even their own Mayor of London'. She said: 'We need to know there is a plan in place for each individual based on the threat they pose. Ministers should be looking urgently at whether any of those TPIMs should be extended based on the police and the courts' view of the impact on public safety.' The six suspects were initially issued with Control Orders by a judge when it proved impossible to convict them for legal reasons. They were among ten people given TPIMs, two of whom have absconded. A new TPIM can only be issued if there is new evidence of terror-related activity. A spokesman for the Home Office did not deny the allegations. He said: 'TPIMs are just one weapon in the considerable armoury at the disposal of our police and security services. They have received tens of millions of pounds of extra funding to step up surveillance and secure more prosecutions of terror suspects.'","Orders which monitor movements and communications expire on Jan 26 .

Lord Thomas, the Lord Chief Justice, has backed Home Secretary Theresa May's campaign to tighten deportation laws . The Government drive to tighten laws on the deportation of criminals and illegal immigrants was backed by the Lord Chief Justice yesterday. Lord Thomas said ministers were ‘quite right’ to be looking at abuses of the judicial review system by immigration lawyers. And he wished success to the efforts by Home Secretary Theresa May to stop criminals and illegal migrants from using the right to family life to persuade judges that they should not be thrown out of the country. Lord Thomas made his views known at a time when Mrs May and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling are both engaged in efforts to limit the use of what they see as loopholes in the laws. The new Lord Chief Justice may have to take major court decisions in the most controversial areas of immigration law over the coming months. He has already denounced the way immigration lawyers frequently make last-minute applications to overturn deportation decisions on grounds which some think spurious. Last year he spoke out in the case of a Bangladeshi student whose lawyers made two last-minute applications to keep him in the country on the eve of his deportation. He said that the procedure was ‘an intolerable waste of public money’, an abuse of the courts, and ‘totally without merit’. Lawyers who acted in the same way in the future would face ‘vigorous action’, he warned. Yesterday Lord Thomas said that judicial review has been ‘a huge success story’ over the past four decades. But he added: ‘It is realistic to say that sometimes people do bring judicial review proceedings which are wholly unmerited. ‘I, during the course of the summer, . sat on a number of cases arising out of the use of it to delay . immigration deportations, and I gave a number of judgments on which I do . not wish to add. ‘So there are areas of the system where there is abuse, and the Government is quite right to be looking at it.’ Theresa May has been campaigning for 18 months to regulate the use of Article Eight of the European Convention which grants the right to a family life, and has been used by immigrants to remain in the UK . Lord Thomas also said he wanted Mrs May to win her battle to limit the way Article Eight of the European human rights charter, which sets out the right to a family life, is used by judges to prevent foreign criminals and illegal immigrants from being deported. The Home Secretary has spent 18 months trying to set down rules which mean that judges do not allow criminals or illegal migrants to stay in the country on the thinnest of claims that they have a family life in Britain. Some judges ignored a Parliamentary vote to tighten the rules, so full legislation saying ‘little weight’ should be given in court to claims of a newly-established family life are included in the Government’s Immigration Bill, now going through Parliament. Among successful claims have been those of a Nepalese man guilty of manslaughter who stayed in Britain even though he had no partner, no children and lived with his parents. In another notorious case, a judge allowed a visa overstayer to remain in the country after hearing that he had a pet cat. Lord Thomas said: ‘In relation to Article Eight and immigration, I think the Government has taken a course which is interesting and I hope will be successful, which is namely to legislate setting criteria by which the courts should proceed. ‘I cannot comment on that at all, because obviously the way the criteria are to be applied, and the compatibility of the criteria for Article Eight, will be something that may come up in future court cases.’","Lord Thomas said ministers were 'quite right' to look at abuses .

Britons are a nation of 'desk potatoes' with one in five admitting they remain behind their desk all day, a new poll has revealed. Six out of ten take their car into work - despite more than a third claiming they would prefer to be able to walk to work. Researchers for private health firm BUPA, who commissioned the study, also found the average Briton walks for only ten minutes a day. 'Desk potatoes': One in five Britons admit they remain behind their desk all day . Current medical advice is for adults to spend 30 minutes walking every day. The main excuse given by exercise-shy Britons for failing to go walking is poor weather. Thirty-one per cent gave this as the reason, while 26 per cent blamed lack of time and 12 per cent blamed their personal lack of fitness for not walking. Beneficial: Current medical advice is for adults to spend 30 minutes walking every day . The problem is particularly acute among young adults, A quarter of Britons aged between 18 and 24 walk for just five minutes every day. Bupa's UK Medical Director Dr Paula Franklin said: 'It's so easy to make excuses but there are many health benefits to walking. 'For most people it is the most accessible form of physical , activity. It is also free and can be great fun. 'Usually walking can fit easily into your daily routine. Something as simple as choosing to walk - even part of the way to work instead of taking the car or bus - can have a huge impact. 'For example, adding 20 minutes of walking to your day can dramatically reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart disease and strokes.' The study, in which researchers from YouGov interviewed 2,000 people, shows women walk for 12 minutes a day and men for eight minutes. Three in 20 adults even admitted they give up walking on the way to their destination at least once a week and use public transport instead. Women were more likely to blame the weather and 'feeling too tired' as excuses, while men blamed their 'hectic schedules' and lack of time. The NHS recommends that young people - aged five to 18 - should have 60 minutes of exercise every day. Older adults should do 150 minutes every week.","Six out of ten Britons take their car into work, a new poll has revealed .

But instead of blowing a fuse, he has been unfailingly polite to the thousands who have mistakenly contacted him via the social networking site, earning him praise online as ‘the most patient and polite man on the internet’. Store bosses last night promised to send a gift to thank the professor for redirecting people to the correct Twitter page, which is @johnlewisretail.

Sisters Bo, 46 and Yan Li, 43, were jailed in 2009 for laundering cash, linked to a human trafficking operation which claimed the lives of 23 cockle pickers at Morecambe Bay in Lancashire in 2004.

Caught: Police arrested the sisters at a hotel in Chippenham, Wiltshire, although before officers had a chance to search their room, Yan Li's boyfriend, Phillip Freeman, removed more than £22,000 and hid it in a locker . But just three weeks after being released later in 2011, they were caught trying to pass-off £20 notes that, unbeknown to them, had been withdrawn from circulation whilst they were in jail in 2010. Police arrested them at a hotel in Chippenham, Wiltshire, but before officers had a chance to search their room, Yan Li's boyfriend, Phillip Freeman, removed more than £22,000 and hid it in a locker. Staff found the money during a routine clear out of the lockers and called police about the concerns when 64-year-old Freeman returned to collect the money the following day. Freeman drove the money to Bo Li's boyfriend's house, John Bowkett, in Solihull, Birmingham, who put it in a plastic container and buried it in his back garden, where it was later discovered by police. Cash: Just three weeks after being released in 2011, the sisters were caught trying to pass-off £20 notes that unbeknown to them had been withdrawn from circulation whilst they were in jail in 2010 . Freeman admitted delivering the cash to 65-year-old Bowkett who then led officers to the bottom of the garden were he handed over the money.

All four were charged with money laundering and convicted by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court on September 20. On Friday, the Chinese-national Li sisters were jailed for two years. Freeman received a four month jail term suspended for 12 months while Bowkett was handed a six month community work order and issued a four month overnight curfew. Both Freeman and Bowkett were ordered by the judge to each pay £10,000 costs. Evidence: Hotel staff found the money during a routine clear out of the lockers and called police about the concerns when 64-year-old Freeman returned to collect the money the following day .

The Prime Minister has refused to boycott this week’s controversial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (Chogm) in Sri Lanka, despite a second major nation pulling out in protest over human rights issues. According to Foreign Secretary William Hague, Britain believes it can have ‘more impact’ by engaging in face-to-face talks with the country’s president, who has been accused of persecuting the country’s Tamil minority and political opponents. Yesterday Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh announced he was pulling out of the bi-annual summit, which is being opened on Friday by Prince Charles on behalf of the Queen, who is head of the 54-strong ‘Family of Nations’. Differing opinions: Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh, left, has announced he is pulling out of this week's Chogm summit in Sri Lanka, while David Cameron, right, is refusing to boycott the controversial meeting . Last month Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, said he would boycott the meeting over the Sir Lanka’s alleged abuse of human rights, as well as cut off funding to the Commonwealth itself over its decision to host the meeting there. In an interview yesterday, Foreign Secretary William Hague said the government ‘understood’ why the Indian leader had chosen not to attend the three-day meeting. But he insisted Britain would have ‘more impact’ by directly raising concerns in the country and rejected calls by Labour to join the boycott. He also revealed that Mr Cameron would not only be meeting with the Indian President on Thursday to discuss the on-going Sri Lankan issue, but would be the first head of government since the island won independence from the UK in 1948 to visit the Tamil north during his stay. Interview: Foreign Secretary William Hague said the government 'understood' why the Indian leader had chosen not to attend the three-day meeting . Mr Hague said: 'We do understand [the boycott] that but we are not joining that. ‘The Indian foreign minister will be attending so, in the case of some of these countries, although their prime ministers are not going, other ministers are. ‘We have decided that if we were to stay away... it would damage the Commonwealth without changing things positively in Sri Lanka. ‘Sri Lanka is in the spotlight so let’s make full use of it being in the spotlight. Rather than sit in London and talk about it, we will be there.’ He added: ‘The Prime Minister will be the first head of government from any country since Sri Lankan independence in 1948 to go to the north. ‘I will be visiting places to promote reconciliation in Sri Lanka, talking about our efforts there to prevent sexual violence in conflict. ‘It will make more impact in Sri Lanka with the Prime Minister and me there doing that, than sitting in our offices in London.’ UN high commissioner for human rights Navi Pillay has warned that Sri Lanka - considered a ‘country of concern’ by the Foreign Office - is heading in an ‘increasingly authoritarian direction’. The Sri Lankan government, particularly its President Mahinda Rajapaksa, denies allegations that it has been complicit in kidnappings, torture and other abuses amid mounting concerns over disappearances of political opponents and attacks on the judiciary and press. The Chogm summit is being opened in Colombo, Sri Lanka, pictured, by Prince Charles on behalf of the Queen . It has also been accused of a sickening . catalogue of war crimes again the Tamils, including the apparently . indiscriminate shelling of areas - including hospitals - packed with . civilians, extrajudicial executions and rapes by soldiers during a . bitter quarter-century civil war. Western nations have long been pressing Sri Lanka to account for thousands of civilians who are suspected to have died in the final months of the conflict, which ended in 2009 when government forces crushed resistance by Tamil rebels who were fighting for an ethnic homeland. Labour, rights activists and Tamil groups have called again on the Prime Minister to join the boycott of this week’s three-day conference. Denial: President Mahinda Rajapaksa denies allegations that Sri Lanka has been complicit in kidnappings, torture and other abuses . Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said: ‘David Cameron must now urgently consider reversing his decision to attend the summit in Sri Lanka this week. ‘For months Labour has urged the Government to do more to raise Britain’s concern over human rights in Sri Lanka in the run up to the summit. ‘If the Prime Minister now chose to reverse his decision to attend the summit - even at this late stage - he would have Labour’s full support.’ He added: ‘The Government’s policy has descended into confusion ‘If the Prime Minister is still refusing to consider downgrading the British delegation, despite reports to the contrary, he must now explain this decision given other Commonwealth leaders are prepared to take a different approach.’ Downing Street said it recognised attendance posed a ‘difficult’ choice for some countries but that it was up to each to determine its own approach. Mr Cameron has vowed to personally push the Sri Lankan president to hold an independent investigation into the claims on human rights abuses, including the disappearances of tens of thousands of opponents. ‘I will raise my concerns when I see President Rajapaksa next week in Colombo,” he said. ‘And I will tell him that if Sri Lanka doesn’t deliver an independent investigation, the world will need to ensure an international investigation is carried out instead.’ ends .","Indian PM Manmohan Singh has pulled out of Commonwealth summit .

The Ministry of Defence is preparing to launch an investigation into why the 'execution' of a wounded Taliban fighter only came to light when civilians stumbled across a video of the murder on a soldier's laptop. The Royal Marine, known only as Marine A, was found guilty last week of murdering the Taliban insurgent in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, two years ago. The 39-year-old is the first British soldier to be found guilty of a war crime in Afghanistan. Scroll down for video . Evidence: Footage captured by a camera mounted on the helmet of a Royal Marine and played during the court martial proceedings recorded the moment the soldier shot dead the insurgent in an Afghan field . The MoD has said no final decision has been taken on whether an inquiry will be launched but a senior marines source told The Sunday Times: 'We have been told to be prepared for an inquiry into the incident and what happened afterwards.' Marine A was convicted after footage emerged of him shooting the insurgent at close range in the chest. As the man convulsed on the ground, Marine A told him: ‘There you are. Shuffle off this mortal coil, you ****. It’s nothing you wouldn’t do to us.’ Recording: The footage recorded on Marine B's helmet camera showed Marine A, a highly respected non-commissioned officer, order his men to move the captive out of sight of cameras on a surveillance balloon . He then turned to comrades and said: ‘Obviously this doesn’t go anywhere, fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention.’ Two other soldiers, Marine B and Marine C, were cleared of murder. Footage was captured on a camera being worn on Marine B's helmet against orders. Marine B tried to delete the footage but a clip was found by police in September 2012. It is believed the clip may have been passed around like a war trophy. A total of 30 British soldiers have been investigated over shooting incidents involving members of the Afghan Security Forces or insurgents since 2006. A foreign field: After a two-and-a-half week trial, a seven-strong military board found Marine A guilty. His comrades named only as Marine B and Marine C were cleared after nine hours of deliberations . Of the 30 soldiers, marines and airmen investigated in 22 separate inquiries, only three have faced court martial and only one – Marine A – has been convicted . A Facebook page has been set up called Free Marine A which 10,000 people joined in less than a day. But speaking during a visit to Helmand province, Defence Secretary Phillip Hammond said nobody on deployment in Afghanistan has called for clemency for the Royal Marine. Mr Hammond said it was clear the murder was against the values of both Britain and the armed forces, in an interview with the Sky News Murnaghan programme. The Defence Secretary's comments echoed the views of General Sir Nicholas Houghton, the Chief of the Defence Staff of the British Armed Forces, who said the Army must be 'immaculate' in upholding judicial process. Audio: 'It's nothing you wouldn't do to us,' a soldier is heard saying in the recording after the shot is fired . Mr Hammond said: 'I have not heard any such suggestions (for clemency) here. People here understand part of what makes us different from the insurgents and the terrorists that we are going after is we maintain a certain standard. 'These are standards that are core to our values as a society and core to the values of the British Armed Forces. This is an isolated incident, I believe, one individual who has let the side down. Phillip Hammond said it was clear the murder was against the values of both Britain and the armed forces . 'It is not indicative of the kind of behaviour that people in the British Armed Forces condone or expect to indulge in. 'I have heard no suggestion since I have been here there is any request for special treatment for anyone convicted of the crime of murder.' Speaking on the BBC One Andrew Marr Show, Gen Houghton said: 'My position on this is no serviceman or woman of the British Armed Forces is above the law - not above the law of the country, international law or the law of armed conflict. 'This was a heinous crime. Judicial process has found this individual guilty. 'It would be quite wrong for the armed forces to adopt some special pleading, some sort of exemption. 'If we try to put ourselves beyond the law or expect special provision from the law, then we start to erode the position where we have a moral ascendancy over those who are our enemies and that is the wrong thing to do. 'There is a due process that will lead to a sentencing. It's for that process to determine whether or not any form of clemency should be shown in the sentencing... we would not want our position to be eroded. 'Those in authority over the armed forces should not request any form of leniency... we should be immaculate in these respects. 'Murder is murder, this is a heinous crime, thankfully it is an exceptional act in terms of the conduct of our armed forces.'","Royal Marine, known only as Marine A, was found guilty of murdering Taliban insurgent two years ago .

Despite accusing investigators of a 'witch hunt' today in a short personal statement she told MPs she apologised 'fully and unreservedly for what was a genuinely inadvertent breach of the rules'. Tory MP Nadine Dorries apologised to the Commons 'fully and unreservedly', above, for breaching rules relating to registering her media earnings, in the House of Commons . She has been censured by the Commons Standards committee, which also complained about her attitude towards the investigation. The . Mid Bedfordshire MP caused a storm in Westminster when she jetted off . to Australia without getting permission from Tory party bosses in . October last year. She . claimed she would be able to reach an audience of millions, discussing . important policy issues like lowering the abortion limit. The Mid Bedfordshire MP has been censured by the Commons Standards committee after branding their investigation a 'witch hunt' Instead she was pictured performing . jokes with Linda Robson from Birds Of A Feather and eating camel toe and . ostrich anus in a challenge against ex-Coronation Street star Helen .

The investigation into her finances was triggered after a complaint by Labour MP John Mann. Scroll down for video . Sorry: Tory MP Nadine Dorries has been told to apologise to the Commons over the investigation into her payments for taking part in TV shows . In addition to taking part in I'm A Celebrity, Ms Dorries took part in another seven media appearances, investigators found after examining the website of the MP's agent. Ms Dorries insisted the money had been paid to her company, Averbrook Ltd, and did not need to be declared. She said she had 'no obligation to answer for what payments are made by whom to Averbook' and would only register earnings if Averbook paid her anything. Trial: The investigation was triggered after Labour MP John Mann raised doubts about Ms Dorries' finances . Nadine . Dorries has repeatedly made headlines for her outspoken remarks, including publicly criticising David Cameron and George Osborne. March 2012: . On Cameron and Osborne's benefits changes: 'The problem is that policy . is being run by two public schoolboys who don't know what it's like to . go to the supermarket and have to put things back on the shelves because . they can't afford it for their children's lunchboxes. What's worse, . they don't care, either.' April 2012: . 'Not only are Cameron and Osborne two posh boys who don't know the . price of milk, but they are two arrogant posh boys who show no remorse, . no contrition, and no passion to want to understand the lives of others - . and that is their real crime.'May 2012: . 'In order for David Cameron’s position as leader to be challenged, the . chairman of the committee needs to receive 46 signatures from . Conservative MPs... I would guess that those signatures are already . coming in and will reach 46 by Christmas.'November 2011: On taking part in I'm A Celeb: 'If that is where 16 million people are, it's where politicians need to be too'December 2012: . 'I long for the day Boris Johnson is Prime Minister. He is a good man . and a hero of mine, and he can reach people other politicians can’t.'January 2013: On talk Tory MP Adam Afriye was gearing up to challenge Mr Cameron: 'He has got leadership potential.' March 2013: 'We . need a change of direction. I think if these polls stay like this and . we did badly in the May elections I think Cameron and Osborne will be . forced to change direction.' But the committee said it was 'hard . to believe' that she would have been asked to take part in the show if . she were not an MP, and as a result the earnings were linked to her role . in parliament. The committee ordered Ms Dorries to . register the details required by the rules but also took issue with her . refusal to co-operate properly with the investigation, including her . 'attitude toward the Commissioner's inquiry'. She has updated her entry on the register of MPs' interests at the end of October, covering the previous 12 months. It showed Averbrook's gross income . was £142,000, giving a profit of £82,000, and that Ms Dorries had taken a . £10,000 dividend on October 30. The committee said: 'Payments directly made for services should be registered whether or not they are made to a third party.' But Ms Dorries told them that her contract with ITV meant she could not publicly say how much she had earned for taking part in I'm A Celebrity. She told the committee: 'If I were ever to disclose and to say, “This is the amount of money that I am paid by ITV”, I would fall foul of that contract and would be at the mercy of ITV.' She appeared on the show alongside comedian Brian Conley, darts player Eric Bristow, boxer David Hayes and ex-Eastenders actress Charlie Brooks, who eventually won. Ms Dorries tried to justify her appearance on the show by saying she ‘mostly works seven days a week’ and ministers are often out of the country. After just 11 days she became the first celebrity to be kicked out of the jungle in the results of a public vote. She has since landed signed a ‘six-figure’ book deal to write three novels. Ms Dorries threatened to sue Standards Commissioner Kathryn Hudson for pursuing a 'witch hunt' against her. In a letter to the commissioner Ms Dorries wrote: 'I should inform you that I feel your report amounts to a witch hunt and I have forwarded it on to legal professionals for further advice regarding my position in relation to the committee and you personally. 'You are choosing to use a vexatious complaint made against me to reinforce your 'on the hoof, make it up as you go' policy. 'I will not tolerate that or any report which invokes libellous negative coverage against me as a result and will not hesitate to pursue you personally should that be the case.' In a letter to Ms Hudson last month the MP said she had taken on extra media work to meet a £67,000 legal bill. 'As a single parent with financial responsibilities for a disabled ex-husband, an elderly mother and a child in full-time education, I faced the possibility of bankruptcy or finding a way to pay the bill. 'This is the initial impetus that drove me to undertake media work.' Ms Dorries won a Bushtucker Trial against Coronation Street star Helen Flanagan, which involved eating ostrich anus . The report said: 'The House’s Code of . Conduct and disciplinary system depend on Members being prepared to . explain their conduct, to submit to public scrutiny and where necessary, . to respond to the Commissioner’s inquiries. 'We . recommend that Ms Dorries register all payments in respect of her . employment, whether or not they have been channelled through Averbrook .

A hero of the Nairobi mall siege, who was shot twice in the back, says the mental scars of the atrocity are harder to recover from than the physical ones. Safari guard Simon Belcher, 49, originally from Pethshire, shielded a four-year-old boy under a car in September's terror attack in the Westgate shopping centre. The father-of-two, who was shot while his wife, Amanda, watched from underneath another car, said he still struggles with the memories of the massacre, in which 72 people died. Safari guard Simon Belcher (pictured in hospital) was shot twice in the back in the Nairobi terror attack but he says the mental scars are taking longer to heal than the physical wounds . Mr Belcher, who runs a safari guide business in Kenya, said: 'My wife and I feel safer in the bush . among the crocodiles and lions than in a shopping centre with humans now . - it's going to take us a while to recover. 'I still have a wound in my chest where the bullet exited but apart from that my body has healed. 'The physical stuff is fine. It's the mental stuff that gets you in the dark of the night.' Mr and Mrs Belcher had returned from guiding a safari tour days before the September 21 attack. They were going to the cinema in the shopping centre when members of the Al-Shabaab terror group struck. Speaking from the Kenyan coast where he is recovering with his family, Mr Belcher said: 'In a funny way it's brought my wife and I closer together. 'It sounds terrible and something you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy, let alone your family - but because we both experienced that horrific day we know exactly what each other is going through and can pick each other up in the bad times. Mr Belcher said he and wife, Amanda, feel safer in the Kenyan bush that in a shopping centre with other people . 'We've shared this and ultimately came out the other side alive.' He and his wife parked on the rooftop and went into the mall when they heard gunfire. He said: 'At first we thought it was a robbery gone wrong but when we heard grenades going off we knew it was terrorists and probably Al-Shabaab.' The Somalian terror group have made a number of attacks on neighbouring Kenya in recent years. 'My wife and I feel safer in the bush . among the crocodiles and lions than in a shopping centre with humans now . - it's going to take us a while to recover,' Simon Belcher . Mr Belcher said: 'Our intention was to . make our way on foot down the car park ramp that led out of the . building but, as we did, we could see two terrorists coming up shouting . and shooting. 'We then ran . over to the opposite end of the car park where a cookery class had been . taking place earlier. All the adults and kids who had been there were . scattered about hiding. 'We got under two cars parked next to each other. The terrorist pair began shouting how Kenyans had killed Somalian women and children and they were here to kill all Christians and Kenyans in revenge. Only Muslims would be spared. 'Some people said they were Muslims and they were let go. Then the terrorists started shooting the rest. 'It wasn't like in the movies where the baddies indiscriminately spray round after round of bullets. 'This was very deliberate targeting. You'd hear a shot and then a few seconds later perhaps another two being fired. Mr Belcher and his wife hid under a car during the attack and shielded a four-year-old boy from terrorists . 'From my position I could see people's legs as they ran away. I'd hear a shot and then they'd topple over on the ground dead. 'It was very strange - things going fast and slow at the same time.' The couple stayed frozen to their position under the cars as the terrorists went on the rampage on the rooftop. After 10 minutes the terrorist pair lobbed a grenade towards hostages near Mr and Mrs Belcher. He was hit in the leg by shrapnel. 'I didn't scream for fear of giving away our position, and was surprisingly calm,' he said. 'I thought ""it's not hit my head or heart"" so I'll survive and worry about it later.' It was in the ensuing panic after the grenade attack that Mr Belcher saw a young boy fleeing with a woman. 'My wife and I started mouthing to them to get under the car with us, which they did. I don't know what would have happened to them otherwise. 'I protected the boy under the car but soon afterwards I was spotted.' Unfortunately, as one of the terrorists bent over to pick up ammunition he had dropped, he spotted him hiding. A total of 72 people died in the Al Shabaab attack on the Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi in September . 'It was lucky it was just me he saw . but, as he stood up, he must have signalled to his accomplice who fired . into the car - shooting me twice in the back, with one bullet also going . through my arm as well. 'They . either must have thought I was dead or it was too much hassle to bend . down to make sure because they left me alone after that. 'I guessed the bullets hadn't gone through my lungs or spine so it wasn't going to kill me immediately.' For . the next two and a half hours the couple and the four-year-old boy and . others who had joined them, cowered as the terrorists returned . intermittently. Mr Belcher said: 'It was very eerie. You could hear all the normal sounds of shopping malls - the whirl of . ventilation units, the background music from restaurants and then . gunfire. 'Eventually, . private security forces - the real heroes - managed to secure the . rooftop and start getting people out. The first wave of rescues were for . people who could walk. 'My wife refused to leave me and we were rescued 15 minutes later when they managed to get an ambulance up the ramp. 'We were taken to the nearest hospital where I was operated on. 'Later the doctors told me I was only 10 minutes from death and had suffered near fatal blood loss and internal injuries. Mr Belcher was rescued by police and private security forces, who he said were the 'real heroes' 'But the adrenaline coursing through my body meant I had no idea what was going on and how close to death I was.' After 10 days in hospital, he was . discharged and, alongside his wife, is taking part in intensive . counselling sessions to deal with post-traumatic stress disorder from . their ordeal. Mr Belcher said: 'I want my story to be positive - we are here and lucky to be alive. 'In some ways it's been harder for Amanda because although she's not had the physical wounds she's had the mental ones, which are harder. 'My children, who are both at boarding school in South Africa, took it badly. 'My son Seb, 18, was very angry about it all and my daughter Phoebe, 17, has had some terrible nightmares. 'But these terrorists' ultimate aim is to divide us along religious grounds. We can't let that happen. 'The little boy who was so strong throughout the whole thing got away safely in the first wave of rescues, but I've been unable to track him down since. 'It would be great to see him again to tell him how brave he was.

The family of Bethany Arceneaux will not face charges for shooting her kidnapper dead in a dramatic rescue operation, police have said. A cousin of Ms Arceneaux reportedly shot and killed Scott Thomas, 29, after tracking him to the abandoned building in Duson, Louisiana, where he was keeping her hostage. Thomas is believed to have been stabbing Ms Arcenaux, the mother of his two-year-old child, when the cousin opened fire, fatally wounding him. Rescued: Marcus Arceneaux carries his niece, Bethany, to safety after she was kidnapped and stabbed in an abandoned house . Remote: Bethany Arceneaux was rescued from an abandoned house in Louisiana, close to where her kidnapper's car was found . The Lafayette Parish Sheriff's . department concluded the cousin acted within Louisiana state law, . allowing for the use of deadly force to prevent great bodily harm or . death. Ms Arceneaux, who is recovering in hospital, was pictured drenched in blood, being carried into a car by her uncle Marcus Arcenaux. Mr Arcenaux had tracked his niece to the abandoned house in only two days. Once there, he saw Bethany through a window - she was in grave danger. He kicked down the door as Mr Taylor began stabbing the 29-year-old mother of his child, and fired several rounds but was not sure if he hit the violent man, he told CNN. 'We kicked doors down. It was like a movie unfolding,' Miss Arceneaux's brother, Ryan, told the Advertiser. 'If we would have waited, she would have been dead.' Officers instead found Mr Taylor's body in the home later that evening and have since ruled the shooting justified. It is still under investigation by the District Attorney's Office. This wasn't the first time he had violated a restraining order protecting the previously abused woman. Search party: Family and friends used off road vehicles to search remote areas shielded by sugar cane fields . Hero: Marcus Arceneaux carried his niece to safety after her horrifying ordeal . Ryan Arceneaux was part of a search . party made up of family and friends who were helping police try to find . Ms Arceneaux after Mr Thomas, the father of her two-year-old son, . kidnapped her on Wednesday evening. At . around noon on Friday the group were investigating an abandoned house, . barely visible through the sugar cane fields surrounding it. The house, on Anderson Road, was close to where Mr Thomas had ditched his car on Wednesday night. Kaylyn Alfred, another of the victim's brothers, said they heard screams for help as they entered the desolate building. As the search party confronted Mr Thomas, who was the subject of a restraining order, he allegedly began to harm Miss Arceneaux. Stand off: Police use their car as a shield as they surround the house Scott Thomas was hiding in . Search party: Police creep up on the house after the victim's family helped her break free . In the tussle that followed Mr Thomas was shot and Marcus Arceneaux was able to grab and carry her to safety. 'She’s . shook up, she’s sliced up, but she’s alright, Ryan said. His sister was . believed to have been stabbed but is recovering in hospital and has . been reunited with her son. Captain . Kip Justice of the Lafayette Parish Police Department confirmed that . 29-year-old father died as a result of injuries received in the . confrontation. In June Bethany Arceneaux filed a protection order against Scott Thomas, after he locked her inside their home and made threats to harm her. Thomas was barred from coming near his ex-girlfriend or son, and was ordered to stay away from her home and his child's daycare center. In the order she claimed Thomas had choked her, dragged her by her hair and 'held a knife to my throat countless times'. During the final episode before she left him she said he made threats to kill her. She . added: 'Since then Scott has been riding around my mom's house and my . work looking for me. I am afraid for me and my son's life.' Thomas abducted Miss Arceneaux as she collected her son from daycare on Wednesday, November 6. 'The . man began harming her. He [Arceneaux’s family member] did what he . needed to do to stop that aggressive behavior from Mr Thomas,' Captain . Judice said. Police, who . were also searching for the victim and were close by when shots were . fired, are now trying to piece together what happened. The . search for Ms Arceneaux began when witnesses saw Mr Thomas throw her . into a car at 5.20pm on Wednesday as she collected their son from a . daycare center. Their child was later found abandoned in the car. Ms Arceneaux had filed a protection order earlier this year against him, claiming he had locked her and their young son in the family home and threatened to kill her. The protection order had barred the violent man from coming close to his ex-girlfriend's home or son's daycare center after the threatening episode. 'After we called cops on him he grabbed our son from me and shoved him into the car,' Ms Arceneaux wrote on the order. 'He then got on his knees in front of the cops and said ""I swear to God on all my children I will kill you.' 'Since then Scott has been riding around my mom's house and my work looking for me,' she added. 'I am afraid for me and my son's life.' Hostage: Scott Thomas grabbed Bethany Arceneaux, the mother of his child, on Wednesday last week . Lafayette . Police Corporal . Paul .

Just when she should have been blowing the out candles on her cake, British sailor Michelle Porter was clinging on for dear life after her yacht was struck by a 'monumental' wave. The boat was caught in hurricane-force gusts off the coast of South Africa as she and fellow crew took part in the Clipper round-the-world race. Ms Porter, from London, was evacuated to a hospital in Port Elizabeth on Saturday - the day she turned 37. It was feared she may have broken her arm, but a medical examination found she had miraculously escaped with torn ligaments and severe bruising. In a statement issued by the race organisers, Ms Porter said: 'It's certainly a birthday I won't be forgetting anytime soon and for the wrong reasons. 'I feel a bit numb, a bit sick, and also pretty devastated that I've had to leave the yacht.' Ms Porter, who hopes to rejoin the yacht in Australia, added: 'I sailed with it from London and I'm pretty gutted that I'm not doing this leg.' Ian Gray, the station commander of the National Sea Rescue Station in Port Elizabeth, said its crews had rendezvoused with the yacht five miles from the harbour. 'We came alongside to put a crew member on board and the patient was found to be uncomfortable, in some pain, but in good spirits,' he said. 'We managed to transfer the casualty onto the seven-metre rescue boat. 'From there we were able to transfer her to the larger craft where she'd be more comfortable and then brought her back to the harbour.' Scroll down for video .

The new mother mauled to death yesterday while working at a big cat animal shelter, may have violated safety procedures according to a statement released by the organization. Renee Radziwon-Chapman, 36, was already dead when emergency responders arrived at WildCat Haven in Sherwood, Oregon Saturday night on reports that an employee was gravely injured. She was the sanctuary's animal care technician and also a new mother. Few details have been released on the attack so far, but it appears that Radziwon-Chapman was breaking the facility's safety rules when she was attacked. WildCat Haven in Sherwood, Oregon says animal technician Renee Radziwon-Chapman was alone in a cage of cougars when she was killed Saturday night. Breaking the rules? According to a statement released by the sanctuary, Radziwon was discovered alone in an animal enclosure with cougars which goes against their safety guidelines. Above, Radziwon-Chapman gives a reporter a tour of the facility in 2011 . A statement released by the organization . refers to their safety handbook which requires staff members to work in . pairs when going into animal enclosures. Once big cats are safely in . 'lockout areas' one team member can go into the enclosure. Deadly: Radziwon-Chapman was killed by a cougar, and the cougar to blame was locked up after the incident. (Above picture is not the cougar that attacked her) 'At this time it is believed that Radziwon-Chapman was alone at the sanctuary and alone in the enclosure with cats, who had not been shifted into the lockout area,' the statement said, adding that an investigation is ongoing. While it was initially reported that several cats were loose within the sanctuary, the organization denied that saying that no cats escaped from their enclosures, which are surrounded by 14-foot tall walls. 'The enclosures exceed what is required by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which inspects the facility yearly,' they said. The cougar responsible for Radziwon-Chapman's death was locked up after the attack. 'Right . now, out thoughts and prayers are with the family of our dear colleague . and friend who we have so sadly lost. We are devastated by this loss,' the statement said. Radziwon-Chapman's husband, Aaron Chapman, had also volunteered at the facility in the past and the two recently had a baby girl. WildCat Haven was started in 2001 by Cheryl and Michael Tuller who rescued one bobcat but their sanctuary has now grown to shelter 67 Cats. For the past eight years, Radziwon-Chapman has served as the head keeper at the facility and is also a certified tech. As the sanctuary's first employee, Radziwon-Chapman has spoken to the media on behalf of the facility before. In 2011, she gave KATU a tour of the facility for a story about people who keep big cats as exotic pets. Sanctuary: This is the website for the WildCat Haven Sanctuary just outside Portland, Oregon where the tragic attack occurred . 'I don't think people realize how many cats are in captivity in back yards,' Radziwon-Chapman said in 2011. Some of the cats living at the sanctuary come from families who adopted them at a young age and then got overwhelmed with them once they grew into full-size cats. Radziwon-Chapman's death came as a shock to WildCat Haven board member Jim Caliva. 'Her relationship with the cats was amazing,' he said. 'She knew exactly what she was going, but apparently there was a mistake. I don't know what it could be.' Its website describes the facility as a 'last hope' for more than 60 wildcats that have been abandoned or abused, including bobcats, cougars, lynx and tigers. Last summer, the sanctuary announced plans to move from its 8-acre facility in Sherwood to an 82-acre site near Silverton and launched a fundraising effort. The Tullers did not set a timetable for the move, the Oregonian reported. The facility is not open to the public, but does provide on-site tours to donors.","Animal care technician Renee Radziwon-Chapman, 36, was found dead in a cougar enclosure Saturday night .

A teacher who ignored Chinese authorities’ orders to evict her parents has been forced to divorce her husband and lost her job. Lin Xin was told she needed to remove her parents from their home and demolish it earlier this year. She ignored the 'ridiculous' local government orders and has now paid the price by losing her lifestyle. Refusal: A teacher who ignored Chinese authorities' orders to evict her parents has been forced to divorce her husband and lost her job (file photo) Ms Lin, who is a teacher at the Minhou No4 Middle School in Fujian province, said that when she was first handed the edict she thought they wanted her to persuade her parents to leave their home. But it soon became apparent they wanted her and her husband to demolish it. 'I feel this is too ridiculous. If I had only been asked to perform ideological work on my parents I would have done, but asking me to demolish it with my own hands is simply incredible. I am a teacher. I can't do it. I am supposed to be a model for others. I would be cursed to death by students and how could I teach in the future,' she said. It is still not clear why the land is needed - land seizures rank as among the biggest . causes of social tension in China, spotlighting an ugly side of the . urbanization drive that has raised it to the world's second-biggest . economy. Ms Lin ignored the local Party Committee request during the summer, but was shocked to be told by the headmaster when she returned in September that she had been suspended and would not be allowed to teach until her parents' home was demolished. Although she had not broken any rules, the decision had been taken according to a document signed by local officials. Ms Lin's husband is also a teacher at the school and to make sure he was not embroiled in the messy sage she took the difficult decision of divorcing him last month. The pair live apart and take the childcare in looking after their toddler separately. Last month it emerged that when another woman called Xu Haifeng's home was razed three years ago, she went to China's capital Beijing to complain about the city and county governments that ordered the demolition. Land disputes are one of the main causes of the tens of thousands of protests across China each year . Since then, she says family members have been kidnapped at least 18 times, typically having black bags thrust over their heads before being taken to a hotel-turned-illegal jail in the eastern city of Wuxi and locked for weeks in a tiny, windowless room. Xu's story is shocking even in a country that has become used to tales of arbitrary and sometimes violent land expropriations. It illustrates how the stresses from the deep indebtedness of China's local governments extend beyond banks into the lives of ordinary Chinese, as hard-up authorities resort to any means they can in a desperate scramble for funds. 'Our Wuxi is now steep in debt,' said Xu. 'The Wuxi city today relies on drawing from residents' financial wealth and stealing residents' land to survive.' Her 74-year-old mother, she says, has been abducted nearly a dozen times and held illegally for almost a year in a campaign to silence the family's demands for proper compensation. Amnesty International said in a report last year that land grabs have increased as the economy slows and local governments have sought cash to pay off debt, though other experts dispute the finding. There is no official data on land grabs. According to reports, local authorities across China derive between 20 and 90 percent of their income from selling expropriated land. Land disputes are one of the main causes of the tens of thousands of protests across China each year. Most go unreported, although some, like a revolt in the southern village of Wukan in 2011, have attracted a high profile and prompted promises of action by Beijing. Last month a four-year-old girl was killed by a bulldozer that was razing her home during a land grab in the southeastern province of Fujian, local media reported.","Lin Xin was told she needed to remove her parents earlier this year .

(picture posed by model) Women with breast cancer could soon be offered ‘one-stop’ radiotherapy – sparing them six weeks of exhausting treatment. Thousands could benefit from the radiation technique, which can be carried out at the same time as the cancerous lump is removed. While the patient is still under anaesthetic, a blast of ‘gentle’ X-rays is used to destroy any remaining tumour cells at the cancer site. The 30-minute procedure, known as targeted intraoperative radiotherapy, instantly removes the need for weeks of the conventional treatment. A trial published today found it was as effective and safe as traditional radiotherapy. Last night it was described as ‘very encouraging’ by the charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer. At present, conventional radiotherapy is offered to all women who have breast- conserving surgery, where just the lump is removed rather than the whole breast. Each year in the UK 30,000 women with early breast cancer have a lump removed and as many as 22,000 could be eligible for the single-shot technique. Conventional radiotherapy, which irradiates the whole breast, requires 22 hospital visits spread over five to six weeks, to reduce side effects such as tissue shrinkage. But a trial of breast cancer patients in 33 different centres comparing the old and new methods found they were as good as each other. Findings from the Targit trial, published in The Lancet medical journal, show intra-operative radiotherapy has a comparable recurrence rate, of around 1 per cent, and a reduction in side effects. Deaths from other causes including heart disease were significantly fewer in the group having one-stop treatment. Radiotherapy involves using high-energy rays to destroy any remaining cancer cells to try to prevent the illness returning. Most women have their first dose of radiotherapy, lasting between ten and 15 minutes, one month after surgery. The success of a trial could see a change in NHS policy, doctors have claimed . They then have the treatment daily from Monday to Friday, with a rest at the weekend, for about three weeks. It can be an unpleasant ordeal and women have to lie in a room on their own while a machine directs the rays to their breast. Although it isn’t painful, it can cause unpleasant side effects including sickness, tiredness and soreness of the skin which last a few days. Studies show that radiotherapy is highly effective and it has been found to reduce the chance of cancer coming back by 40 per cent. The trial, led by Professor Michael Baum and Professor Jayant Vaidya, of University College London, has involved almost 3,500 patients since 1998. It compared outcomes for women given one-stop radiotherapy with those having the conventional form. Overall, four out of five women having one-stop radiotherapy needed no additional treatment.Professor Baum said: ‘We are hoping the publication of the trial results will lead directly to changes in NHS practice. ‘Many women will be spared six weeks of treatment going back and forth to the radiotherapy centre.’ Widespread NHS use could save around £15million because it would slash waiting lists for radiotherapy, according to the researchers’ estimates. It will be evaluated by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence next year for use on the NHS. But it is already available in private hospitals in London, and at least two NHS hospitals, said Professor Baum, adding: ‘It has taken off in Germany and the US but Britain … is lagging behind.’","‘Gentle’ X-rays is used to destroy any remaining tumour cells .

One of the two victims killed in a mass shooting at Texas house party on Saturday that left 22 other people injured has been named. Queric Richardson, 17, a student of Morton Ranch High School in Katy died from a single gunshot wound to the head at the scene and an as-yet unidentified 16-year-old girl died after being transported to hospital. Richardson's distraught father, Laurence Guidry, told reporters that his son 'didn't deserve' this as he revealed that Queric's 16-year-old brother Kenneth was shot while trying to save his older brother from the hail of bullets. Scroll Down for Video . Shot: Queric Richardson, 17, (left) was shot along with his brother Kenneth at the party in Houston on Saturday - Queric sadly died at the scene . 'He was shot 10 minutes before he even realized he was shot, trying to help his brother,' said Guidry. 'Queric didn't deserve this. He was just a child,' said Guidry. 'He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.' Relatives of Richardson told KRTK that the teen was due to celebrate his birthday next week, was an able student and worked at the local Dairy Queen. Willie Young, 21, and Randy Stewart, 18, were arrested on Monday in connection with the shooting. Young is charged with deadly conduct while Stewart is charged with aggravated assault, according to the Harris County Sheriff's Office. It was celebratory gunshots fired at the packed 18th birthday party attended by over 100 people that triggered the mass shooting that left two dead, two critically injured and 22 others injured in chaotic scenes where people jumped from second-floor windows to escape the shooting at the suburban Houston home. Devastated: Laurence Guidry (left) said that his son's (right) death was a tragedy that did not need to happen . Gruesome: Blood is pooled down the street from where two people were killed and at least 20 others injured, late on Saturday, when gunfire erupted at a house party in the Cypress area of Houston . Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia said the gathering Saturday night was openly promoted using multiple social media sites, drew more than 100 people, most of them 17- to 19-year-olds, and became a 'birthday party gone wild.' He said it appears partygoers were dancing in the home when someone armed with a pistol shot into the air in celebration. In the ensuing confusion, another person who was armed began firing into the crowd, Garcia said. Young people then streamed into the narrow street to avoid the burst of gunshots that followed shortly before 11 p.m. Saturday. 'Anytime you promote a birthday party on social media, you have no control over who to expect at your door,' Garcia said to KRTK. 'What it does is indicate, that your saying to the social media world, 'I don't know who you are, but you're invited.' That's not a good practice.' The day after: Tonya Grice uses hydrogen peroxide to clean blood from the walkway of her sister's house where two people were killed when gunfire erupted at a house party . Grizzly: Blood is splattered near the front entrance of a home where two people were killed in the Cypress area of Enchanted Creek Drive in Houston . Help: Family and friends pick up bloody items that were left in the yard at 7318 Enchanted Creek in Cypress, Texas, on Sunday . The initial shot was reportedly fired in celebration, which caused someone to react and fire randomly into the crowd. 'It is just a horrible combination of immaturity, access to a firearm and the inability to control oneself,' Garcia said. Partygoer Shaniqua Brown — who said she heard about the party through Instagram, a photo-sharing app and website — told The Associated Press it 'was not rowdy at all.' She said she first heard gunshots in the house and they continued outside as people fled and sought cover. One anonymous witness said that the shooting continued for five minutes and described the horrific scene outside the house as he fled to safety. 'I saw one guy. He was lying on the floor with blood leaking out of his mouth and off his body and stuff,' the witness said. 'And I saw another girl on the floor, and she looked like she was in shock, but she was also bleeding.'

Bloody footprints seen outside the house in the 7318 Enchanted Creek, Sunday, Nov. 10, 2013, after two people were killed and at least 22 others were injured . Authorities have given varying accounts of the number of people injured, but they clarified Sunday that 20 were hurt, with 16 suffering gunshot wounds and four others varying injuries such as a fracture and twisted ankles in the panic to flee. Garcia chastised the party organizers, who advertised the event on social media, saying 'you have no control on who to expect at your door.' Authorities are searching for two gunmen, he said, one who’s about 17 years old and the other believed to be about 22. Garcia said party organizers arranged to have people searched as they entered the home. 'Anytime you have to factor in a bouncer and being searched at the door, you have already taken a turn for the worse,' he said. Sheriff’s spokesman Thomas Gilliland said earlier that deputies were confronted with 'mass chaos' when they responded to the call in the residential neighborhood about 25 miles northwest of Houston, adding that 'kids were literally everywhere.' Worried: An unidentified parent waits on a child at the scene of a suburban Houston shooting. Two people have been killed and at least 22 others hurt when gunfire rang out at the large house party in the Cypress-area of the city . He said witnesses reported partygoers jumping from the second floor in their scramble to flee. Mariah Boulden said the gathering was her birthday party. Boulden, who lives at the residence, said her brother and others were patting down people as they entered the home. At least one parent was in the house, said Christina Garza, a spokeswoman with the sheriff's office. No drugs or alcohol are suspected in the shooting. Garcia said Boulden's mother was in the home during the party. Two men refused to be searched and walked away, she said, then apparently hopped a neighbor’s fence and entered through a back gate. On the hunt: Police said they are looking for two people suspected of being the gunmen responsible for the deaths and injuries . Two killed, 22 injured: The party was attended by some 100 people, mostly young adults, the sheriff's office said . 'They wasn’t supposed to be here whoever they was,' Boulden said. She said her family is planning a candlelight vigil at the home for the victims of the shooting. Pools of blood were visible outside the two-story brick home Sunday, and the garage door was bent after people had pushed it upward while trying to escape. Bruno Figueroa, who lives a few houses down the street, told The Associated Press he heard five to 10 shots. He looked out his window and saw a crowd of at least 30 people running down his street. 'Kids were running everywhere,' he said. Figueroa said people suddenly began ducking into back yards and behind vehicles in driveways, apparently trying to hide from a car that was slowly coming down the street. Figueroa said that from his upstairs window he could hear the people who were hiding nearby. 'They were crying, yelling, ‘My brother got shot,’ ‘Why did they do this?’ he said. Figueroa said as soon as the slow-moving car rounded a corner and then sped away, the people who had been hiding gathered back in the street.","Two shot dead, two critical and 19 others injured after mass shooting at house party in Houston .

A 2,000lb satellite fell through the Earth's atmosphere today at around 7pm EST. According to the European Space Agency, the Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) burned up when going through the Earth's atmosphere. Remaining debris could have fallen anywhere along a path through East Asia and the Western Pacific to Antarctica. 'The most probable impact ground swath largely runs over ocean and polar regions, as well as uninhabited areas of Australia,' the space agency noted on its website earlier today. Incoming: Europe's 2,000-pound Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer, or GOCE, plummeted down to Earth at 7pm - and no one knew for sure where it landed . GOCE was last observed passing 121km (75 miles) above Antarctica at 10:42pm GMT. As the whizzing GOCE - or Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer - descended scientists monitored its movements to determine the landing site and ensure public safety. Not everyone was as sure as scientists were that it would land in the oceans that cover 70 per cent of the Earth's surface. On Saturday, British gaming company Ladbrokes gave FoxNews.com six to four odds it would crash-land in North or South America. The 1.2-ton, $466million science satellite built by German and Italian engineers was launched in 2009 to map variations in Earth's gravity, and now it is doomed by its force. Scientists assembled the data into the first detailed global maps of the boundary between the planet's crust and mantle, among other projects. Full name: Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer . Launched: 17 March 2009 . Launcher: Rockot (with Breeze-KM upper stage) by Eurockot Launch Services GmbH . Launch site: Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia . Nominal life: 20 months . Cost: $466million . Orbit: About 161.5 miles altitude, polar, Sun-synchronous . Mass: 2,000lbs . Dimensions: 17.4 feet long, about 3.3 foot body diameter . Propulsion tank: 88.2lbs of xenon gas . Mission: Measuring Earth's gravity field and modelling the geoid with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution . The arrowhead-shaped GOCE ran out of xenon fuel on October 21 and has been steadily losing altitude since, tugged by Earth's gravity. The satellite was intended to orbit at 160 miles, but on Saturday morning it hovered at just 105 miles. With its aerodynamic design featuring wings and tail fins, GOCE has been called the ‘Ferrari of space.’ Jeffrey Kluger, senior science and technology editor for Time Magazine, told CBS that earthlings would only have to be ‘a little bit worried’ about the plunging pile of scorched space debris. ‘Whenever you have one ton of hardware coming down, no one knows where, that's not a good thing,’ he said. With two-thirds of Earth covered by water and vast areas of sparsely populated land, the risk to human life and property was considered extremely low, the European Space Agency said. Rocket science: GOCE is seen on show at the Turin Thales Alenia space facility before press day, on July 18, 2007 . Space mission: GOCE was launched in 2009 to map variations in Earth's gravity with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution . Kluger explained that it was estimated that about 45 pieces of satellite debris, each weighing no more than 200lbs, would breach the atmosphere and land within a footprint of 190 square miles. ‘So a satellite would practically have to be aiming at your house to strike it,’ Kluger wrote in his Friday Time column. Skyfall: Jeffrey Kluger, senior science and technology editor for Time Magazine, said that earthlings should be 'a little bit worried' about the plunging pile of scorched space debris . Due to constant changes in Earth's upper atmosphere, scientists had trouble determining where and when GOCE would re-enter. Satellites that are too bulky to bring down safely to Earth after they had served their purpose are sometimes boosted into one of the graveyard orbits more than 22,000 miles up, where they can hang around for centuries. For GOCE, however, it was not a viable option because the satellite only has a small, weak ion engine on board. The last big satellite to fall back through the atmosphere was Russia's failed Phobos-Grunt Mars probe. The 14-ton spacecraft re-entered in January 2012. In 2011, NASA's 6.5-ton Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite and Germany's 2.4-ton X-ray ROSAT telescope re-entered. Heiner Klinkrad, head of the European . Space Agency's space debris office in Germany, told the site Spaceflight Now that statistically . speaking, it is 250,000 times more likely to win the jackpot in the . German lottery than to get hit by a GOCE fragment. About . 100 tons of space debris falls to Earth every year, and so far there . have been no reports of injuries of fatalities caused by extra-terrestrial . scrap metal. In living color: In this handout image supplied by the European Space Agency, a rendering of the variations in Earth's gravitational pull is shown as seen by the Europe's GOCE satellite . However, under UN’s Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects created in September of 1972, should a space fragment cause damage upon re-entry, the country that launched the satellite would be held accountable, Fox News reported. The treaty, which has been ratified by 88 countries as of January 2013, guarantees that the state responsible will pay compensation. In the case of GOCE, the satellite was launched from Russia, so that country would be on the hook for any damage.","The satellite broke through Earth's atmosphere at around 7pm tonight .

Ambrose Murray, 22, pictured outside Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court, stole his father's opiate painkillers to feed his drug habit . A former 'star pupil' who sold his father's super-strength prescription painkillers to feed his drug habit has been jailed after they killed a young partygoer. Ambrose Murray, 22, stole opiate skin patches from his father John, who suffers from chronic back pain. But when he sold the medicine at a house party near his home in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, 20-year-old Josh Makin swallowed a patch instead of putting it on his skin. It gave him 150 times the standard dose, killing him overnight. His girlfriend found him dead beside her the next afternoon. Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court heard Josh was  drinking, taking drugs and playing a games console at a friend's house in the early hours of September 8 last year. Meanwhile Murray was offering his father's patches, which he had been stealing for several months alongside other pills, to guests at a house party. He wrote on Facebook: 'Does anyone there want to buy fents?' Prosecutor Brian Berlyne said 'fents' referred to fentanyl, the active ingredient in the stolen painkillers. When Josh, an office worker at a solicitors' firm from Sale, Greater Manchester, arrived at the party, he and a friend were handed the patches and told Murray they would pay him the next week. Murray told Josh the drugs were strong painkillers which should be stuck to the skin, the court heard. But after Murray had left, Josh put a packet of fentanyl on his tongue and swallowed it. Murray was jailed for supplying drugs. The court heard his actions did not cause Josh Makin's death directly . A strong opioid medicine similar to morphine, fentanyl is used for treating chronic pain. It is from the same basic  family as heroin and induces relaxation and euphoria. Skin patches containing fentanyl are . designed to be worn like a nicotine patch for 72 hours, releasing the . drug slowly into the bloodstream. It takes 12 hours for the full effects of the patch, often used for terminal illnesses, to wear off. Several patients have claimed they became addicted to the drug. Bob Rees, 53, from Pontypridd, Wales, told the media he went into 'cold turkey' after being weaned off fentanyl. 'I’m as addicted to pain medication as junkies are to heroin,' he said. The court ruled that Murray's actions did not directly cause Josh's death because the . opiates were swallowed, rather than used properly. But he was jailed for 18 months for supplying class A drugs and theft. Murray, wearing a grey suit and dark red tie, sobbed in the dock as the sentence was handed down. Lisa Judge, defending, told the court Murray was top of his class in junior school, but struggled when he started at the local grammar. Murray, of Dunham Road, Altrincham, had become addicted to drugs and started stealing painkillers from his father to fund his habit, it was heard. But Judge Mushtaq Khokhar told the court: 'Drugs are a plague on this society'. Josh’s mother, Louise, told the Manchester Evening News after the hearing: 'No sentence that the court could have passed would bring him back. 'We just want this to be a warning that when you experiment with drugs you are in the unknown.'","Ambrose Murray, stole ultra-strong fentanyl patches which treat back pain .

Two men have been charged after attempting to rob a Catholic priest following Mass in Chicago. Deandrea and Markquis Little, 22 and 20, sat through the ceremony before following the 73-year-old into the sacristy at around 8.30am last Monday and demanding money. Deandrea is alleged to have poked the priest in the head and threatened to hit him before saying he would tell the papers the priest had 'touched us' if anyone found out. Deandrea Little, 22 (left), and Markquis Little, 20 (right), are accused of threatening a catholic priest after Mass last week in an attempt to get money. Deandrea told the man to keep quiet or he'd tell papers 'you touched us' According to police reports the pair had carried out a four-year campaign of intimidation against the church in the Back of the Yards area, taking at least $10,000, damaging windows and jumping on the priest's car. The priest claims to have been giving them $10 or $20 at a time, meaning they visited the building at least 500 times since 2009. The pair were arrested after the Priest had recognised them sitting at the back of his congregation during the Mass. The pair are accused of carrying out a four-year campaign of intimidation, taking around $10,000 from the 73-year-old priest over four years (file picture) Deandrea and Markquis have been charged with intimidation, stalking and attempted robbery and are due to appear in bond court on Monday. Police would not confirm if the two men were related. Two years ago another Catholic priest was robbed at his home in Chicago by two armed men. Reverend Daniel Mallet was beaten up at home by men in 'ninja masks' who forced him to open a safe before stealing $500 meant for the poor. As the men left they asked Mr Mallet to pray for their sins.","Deandrea and Markquis Little, 22 and 20, charged after attempted robbery .

That's because the lovable four-year-old has repeatedly saved Judy Owen's life, something she puts down to the pet's 'psychic' powers. Miss Owen, 60, claims to have avoided serious injury twice after Daisy warned of impending danger. According to Miss Owen, Daisy also barks instinctively seconds before the phone rings and can even tell when her owner is about to get out of her seat by offering up her paw. Life-saver: Judy Owen (pictured), from Worcester, says her 'mystic' pet Daisy (right) can warn her of impending danger . Miss Owen said the little cockerpoo - a cocker spaniel poodle cross - has already predicted a car crash and a potentially lethal accident in her master's bathroom. Daisy first showed an ability to foresee danger in February this year when she became agitated and started howling while Judy was driving. Miss Owen slowed down and just minutes later, a fellow driver ploughed into the back of her car as it pulled out of a junction and sent the motor hurtling into a wall. Incredibly, Miss Owen escaped serious injury because she had slowed down as a result of Daisy's barking. On another occasion, Daisy started to run round Judy's apartment in Worcester at 4am - just hours before a shower screen shattered in her bathroom. Shop owner Miss Owen, who is not married and lives on her own, said: 'A few Sundays ago I went to bed as normal, but at 4am Daisy suddenly awoke and began rushing round my apartment - nothing seemed to quieten her. Adorable: Four-year-old Daisy has helped Judy Owen, 60, avoid serious injury twice . 'After about half an hour I persuaded her to come back into the bedroom where she jumped up on the bed and lay horizontally next to me, pushing her little body against mine. 'Two hours later there was a huge explosion in the bathroom. My glass shower door had exploded and sent pieces of glass everywhere - they'd even gone flying out into the hallway. 'Just before it happened Daisy wouldn't leave my side, she wouldn't let me go, she just wanted me to stay there. 'Psychic' dog Daisy (pictured) who barked loudly to wake her owner Judy Owen just before the glass on her shower smashed . Miss Owen said the little cockerpoo - a cocker spaniel poodle cross - has already predicted a car crash and a potentially lethal accident in her master's bathroom . 'Maybe she heard the glass cracking first, I didn't know what was going to happen but she seemed to sense something and wanted to protect me. 'If it had happened two hours later when I usually have a shower I would, without a doubt, have been very badly injured. 'The first time I noticed Daisy's sixth sense was back in February, when I was driving and she started getting agitated, I got quite cross with her making such a fuss. 'Then a few minutes later a man went into the back of me and sent my car flying into a wall - it was a complete write-off. Luckily neither of us was hurt, although Daisy was very shaken. 'It could have been much worse but because I'd slowed down to calm Daisy we weren't going that fast at the time of the impact. 'She's normally a very placid dog so it's very out-of-character for her to get agitated and howl. 'Whenever she does it in future I might just lock myself away because I'll know something bad is on the way. I strongly believe Daisy has psychic powers. There is really no other explanation for it.' Miss Owen believes her close bond with Daisy, who she got as a ten-week-old puppy, allows her to interpret signals from her dog. The inseparable pair spend most of the day together, and Daisy even meets and greets customers at her master's boutique in Worcester city centre. Daisy has another unusual talent - picking up litter when she goes for her daily walk by the canal. Miss Owen added: 'I think she saw me always picking the rubbish up and picked up the habit herself. She's an amazing little dog, she's like a little child really.'","Four-year-old dog warns owner Judy Owen, 60, of impending danger .

After her weight crept up to 29 stone, breaking a chair was the last straw for this mother of three. So afraid was Kim Freshwater that she’d flatten any more furniture, she finally overhauled her diet. And the triumph of losing more than half her body weight led to the 45-year-old being named Woman of the Year by Slimming World yesterday. Scroll down for video . Before shedding 17 stone, Kim Freshwater, 45, weighed 29st and wore size 38 clothes. She suffered back and knee pain, breathing difficulties, high blood pressure and was unable to fit in armchairs . Mrs Freshwater lost 17st and now weighs 11st 7lbs and wears size 10 or 12 clothes. She says she is happier than she has ever been before. She can now do many things she was unable to do before her weight loss, such as cycling and playing tennis . In two and a half years, Mrs . Freshwater’s weight fell from 28st 12lb to 11st 7lb as she dropped 13 . dress sizes from a size 38 to a 12. Yesterday, . she explained she had been afraid to go to see her son accept an award . at school as there were only flimsy foldaway chairs to sit on. She said she often avoided weddings and parties for fear of embarrassing her family. And the 45-year-old missed a family funeral because she couldn't walk between the church and the graveside. ‘A . chair had already collapsed under me while we were staying with friends . for Christmas,’ she said. ‘It was mortifying and I was constantly . scared that I would break something else.’ Mrs . Freshwater, who lives in Havant, Hampshire, with husband Lee, 53, an . accountant, and their teenage children, had to walk with sticks, . suffered from high blood pressure, breathing problems and joint pain. She also slept on the floor in hotels for fear of buckling the bed and . had to get a belt extension on planes. Her . incredible weight loss started after her GP prescribed vouchers for her . local Slimming World group. Whereas before she ate no breakfast or . lunch but gorged on lasagne, chips, crisps and chocolate in the . evenings, now she eats three home-cooked meals a day. She said: ‘I actually eat more now than I did before but I’ve learned to make good choices.’ She . also plays tennis, swims, cycles, walks miles – without her sticks – . and even abseiled 350ft down a tower in Portsmouth, raising £600 for . charity. She added: ‘I only . wore black but now my wardrobe’s full of every colour. I don’t think I . realised how unhappy I was until I became as happy as I am now. ‘I had to walk with sticks and I couldn’t fit in the seats at the cinema or on rides like rollercoasters. ‘I once broke a chair at my friend’s house, which was mortifying, and I even slept on the floor when we went away because I was so scared the bed wouldn’t be able to take my weight. ‘I’ve missed so many wonderful moments with my family and I can never get those back, but now I’m determined to make up for lost time and there’s so much I want to do.’ Mrs Freshwater had weight problems for most of her life and at the age of 11 was already a dress size 14 to 16. Then, when her father died when she was still a teenager she started comfort eating. Before she lost weight, Mrs Freshwater avoided attending events for fear of embarrassing her husband and children. She missed her son's school award ceremony because she feared she would break the chairs . She said: ‘My dad had always been my best friend and I suppose I used food to fill the hole he left. ‘As I got older, people would always say how pretty I’d be if I lost weight and I did try, but the diets I did were only ever quick fixes - I’d regain all the weight I lost as soon as I stopped.’ She added: ‘I felt I’d let my family down because I wasn’t there to support them. ‘I . was so upset about it one night that I couldn’t sleep and there was a . programme on TV about funerals, showing how severely overweight people . need special coffins and how difficult it is to cremate their bodies. ‘It was as if someone was trying to tell me something - I didn’t ever want to have to put my family through that.’ Mrs Freshwater suffered from high blood . pressure, breathing problems, and back and knee pain because of her . weight so her GP prescribed her 12 weeks of vouchers for her local . Slimming World Group. Mrs Freshwater said: 'I've missed so many wonderful moments with my family and I can never get those back, but now I'm determined to make up for lost time and there's so much I want to do' She said: ‘I was worried people would judge me or the scales wouldn’t go up to my weight. ‘I needn’t have been so nervous though because everyone made me feel so welcome and my consultant, Georgina, was really friendly.’ Mrs Freshwater lost 44lbs in her first 12 weeks and has now lost a total of 243lbs, dropping from 28st 12lbs to 11st 7lbs. She has transformed her eating habits, swapping one huge meal a day for three healthy home-made meals and snacks. She said: ‘I actually eat more now than I did before but I’ve learned to make good choices. ‘The . plan isn’t a diet, we all eat together as a family and we have lots of . our old favourite meals, just adjusted so they’re cooked in a healthier . way.’ Before her weight loss, Mrs Freshwater did not eat any breakfast or lunch - she just gorged on a huge supper. Now she eats three small meals a day . Now she plays . tennis, goes swimming, walks miles - without her sticks - and has . started cycling again for the first time in 20 years. She even abseiled 350 feet down the Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth, raising £600 for charity. She said: ‘I love that I don’t need seatbelt extensions on planes any more, I can sit in chairs with arms, I can shop on the high street - the list is endless. ‘My husband jokes that my weight loss has been hard on his bank balance because before I used to have four pairs of shoes but now I’ve got about 40 and I only wore black but now my wardrobe’s full of every colour of the rainbow. ‘I don’t think I realised how unhappy I was until I became as happy as I am now.’ Before: .

A 2,000lb satellite is expected to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere within hours. According to the European Space Agency, the Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) will break through the atmosphere and break up by 7pm Sunday (Eastern time). 'The most probable impact ground swath largely runs over ocean and polar regions, as well as uninhabited areas of Australia,' the space agency noted on its website. Incoming: Europe's 2,000-pound Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer, or GOCE, is expected to plummet down to Earth at 7pm - and no knows for sure where exactly its debris is going to touch down . 'With a very high probability, a re-entry over Europe can be excluded.' As the whizzing GOCE - or Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer - descends, scientists are monitoring its movements to determine the landing site and ensure public safety. Not everyone is as sure as the scientists are that it will land in the oceans that cover 70 per cent of the Earth's surface. On Saturday, British gaming company Ladbrokes gave FoxNews.com six to four odds it would crash-land in North or South America. The 1.2-ton, $466million science satellite built by German and Italian engineers was launched in 2009 to map variations in Earth's gravity, and now it is doomed by its force. Scientists assemble the data into the first detailed global maps of the boundary between the planet's crust and mantle, among other projects. Full name: Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer . Launched: 17 March 2009 . Launcher: Rockot (with Breeze-KM upper stage) by Eurockot Launch Services GmbH . Launch site: Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia . Nominal life: 20 months . Cost: $466million . Orbit: About 161.5 miles altitude, polar, Sun-synchronous . Mass: 2,000lbs . Dimensions: 17.4 feet long, about 3.3 foot body diameter . Propulsion tank: 88.2lbs of xenon gas . Mission: Measuring Earth's gravity field and modelling the geoid with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution . The arrowhead-shaped GOCE ran out of xenon fuel on October 21 and has been steadily losing altitude since, tugged by Earth's gravity. The satellite was intended to orbit at 160 miles, but on Saturday morning it hovering at just 105 miles. With its aerodynamic design featuring wings and tail fins, GOCE has been called the ‘Ferrari of space.’ Most of the spacecraft will burn up as it blasts through the atmosphere, but up 25 per cent of the satellite is expected to survive re-entry and end up somewhere on the planet's surface. Jeffrey Kluger, senior science and technology editor for Time Magazine, told CBS that earthlings have no cause for panic, but people should be ‘a little bit worried’ about the plunging pile of scorched space debris. ‘Whenever you have one ton of hardware coming down, no one knows where, that's not a good thing,’ he said. With two-thirds of Earth covered by water and vast areas of sparsely populated land, the risk to human life and property is considered extremely low, the European Space Agency said. Rocket science: GOCE is seen on show at the Turin Thales Alenia space facility before press day, on July 18, 2007 . Space mission: GOCE was launched in 2009 to map variations in Earth's gravity with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution . Kluger explained that it is estimated that about 45 pieces of satellite debris, each weighing no more than 200lbs, will breach the atmosphere and land within a footprint of 190 square miles. ‘So a satellite would practically have to be aiming at your house to strike it,’ Kluger wrote in his Friday Time column. Skyfall: Jeffrey Kluger, senior science and technology editor for Time Magazine, said that earthlings should be 'a little bit worried' about the plunging pile of scorched space debris . Due to constant changes in Earth's upper atmosphere, scientists cannot yet predict where and when GOCE will re-enter. Satellites that are too bulky to bring down safely to Earth after they had served their purpose are sometimes boosted into one of the graveyard orbits more than 22,000 miles up, where they can hang around for centuries. For GOCE, however, it was not a viable option because the satellite only has a small, weak ion engine on board. The last big satellite to fall back through the atmosphere was Russia's failed Phobos-Grunt Mars probe. The 14-ton spacecraft re-entered in January 2012. In 2011, NASA's 6.5-ton Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite and Germany's 2.4-ton X-ray ROSAT telescope re-entered. Heiner Klinkrad, head of the European . Space Agency's space debris office in Germany, told the site Spaceflight Now that statistically . speaking, it is 250,000 times more likely to win the jackpot in the . German lottery than to get hit by a GOCE fragment. About . 100 tons of space debris falls to Earth every year, and so far there . have been no reports of injuries of fatalities caused by extra-terrestrial . scrap metal. In living color: In this handout image supplied by the European Space Agency, a rendering of the variations in Earth's gravitational pull is shown as seen by the Europe's GOCE satellite . However, under UN’s Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects created in September of 1972, should a space fragment cause damage upon re-entry, the country that launched the satellite would be held accountable, Fox News reported. The treaty, which has been ratified by 88 countries as of January 2013, guarantees that the state responsible will pay compensation. In the case of GOCE, the satellite was launched from Russia, so that country would be on the hook for any damage.","Scientists predict a 2,000lb satellite will break through the earth's atmosphere at 7pm tonight .

The son of a former Zimbabwe president has been investigated by a council for benefit fraud in an alleged scam involving his wife, a £95,000 winner on Deal Or No Deal. Michael Banana is accused of receiving cash for a council house while living elsewhere with benefit cheat Caroline Banana, who tasted success on Noel Edmonds' games show. Mrs Banana - who continued to claim benefits despite the mammoth win - was filmed by undercover officers for a series about the UK's worst fraudsters. But while they were following her they . discovered husband Michael, the son of notorious ex-president Canaan . Sodindo Banana, was living with her in Stoke. Alleged con: Michael Banana with his benefit cheat wife Caroline Banana in a picture taken on holiday. He is now accused of receiving cash for a council house but living elsewhere with her . Big win: Caroline Banana, left, won £95,000 on Deal Or No Deal. Husband Michael was seen celebrating wildly on the show, right . Despite claiming the pair had split up - and being given a council house in Stockport - he was regularly spotted at her house. He appeared alongside her on the Channel 4 show hosted by Noel Edmonds, and investigators found Facebook pictures of them on holiday together. Statesman: Canaan Banana was the President of Zimbabwe in the 1980s, and Michael Banana, his son, fled to the UK with his mother when he was jailed for a series of sexual assaults . Stockport Council is now pursuing him for a housing benefit overpayment of £2,485 - which he is appealing against. They say unless he pays up they will take him to court. Mr Banana's late-father was the infamous Canaan Sodindo Banana, president of the African nation for most of the 80s. The no-nonsense leader passed a law in 1982 forbidding people for making jokes about his name, but was disgraced in 1998 when he was found guilty of 11 charges of sexual assault. He was sentenced to ten years in jail - nine of which were suspended - and his wife and family, including son Michael, sought political asylum in Britain in October 2000. President Robert Mugabe described Banana senior as 'a rare gift to the nation' when he died in 2003. Steve Prince, the main investigator for Stoke-on-Trent City Council in Mrs Banana's case, staked out her house and her children's school for weeks to track her movements. He was alarmed to see her and Mr Banana - also known as Michael Thabo - acting like a couple. He added: 'She's been claiming benefits from people like myself that contribute to that system. 'When she won the money, it was the time to say thank you for your help, I don't need that money anymore.' Mr Prince also discovered Mr Banana had come from luxurious beginnings before coming to the UK with his family as political refugees, and his family had lived in an impressive state house in Zimbabwe. Scam: Mrs Banana won a life-changing amount when she appeared on Deal Or No Deal in 2011, but still claimed benefits . Confusion: Michael Banana, pictured on the show, was allegedly living with his wife in Stoke despite claiming the pair had split up . In shock: Caroline Banana speaks to Noel Edmonds after winnig £95,000 but soon afterwards she was taken to court on benefit fraud charges . Mrs Banana, 40, admitted continuing to claim £6,147.92 worth of housing benefit, income support and council tax benefit after winning the TV quiz show in November 2011. The mother-of-three was sentenced to a 12-month community order and ordered to do 215 hours of unpaid work. Michael is not yet facing criminal proceedings, but has been asked to pay back the cash he received while living with her, between September 2011 and June 2012. A spokesman for Stockport Council said: 'We have considered all the information provided and will be upholding the decision that Mr Banana wasn't a resident at the property.' If he does not pay, the council could decide to launch criminal proceedings. Mr Banana denies the claims. The full extent of Mrs Banana's mammoth scam was shown on BBC One's Panorama - Britain On The Fiddle last Wednesday. The BBC team spent 18 months following her and a host of other cheats for the three-part series presented by reporter Richard Bilton. He was approached by the BBC team and refused to comment.","Michael Banana accused of getting cash for a council house he didn't live in .

The mistress of the Mormon doctor who was found guilty of killing his wife has spoken out for the first time saying the she still can't believe that her ex is a murderer. 'The Martin I knew and loved was not the person that he was portrayed on the stand,' Gypsy Willis said of her former lover Martin MacNeill. Willis was one of the star witnesses in the state prosecution's case against the former doctor who plied his wife Michele with prescription drugs after pressuring her to get a facelift. She was found dead in the family's Pleasant Grove, Utah home. The MacNeills had eight children and two of their older daughters were the driving forces behind the case against their father. Not the cause: Gypsy Willis, Martin MacNeill's mistress, said that he did not have to kill for her because he could have 'had me any time he wanted' 'We'd been living in fear of our father for so long. He'd threatened to destroy us for standing up to him. To finally get justice for our mom was overwhelming,' his daughter Alexis Somers said following the sentence that was handed down over the weekend. MacNeill was found guilty on two counts - one of first degree murder and one of obstruction of justice - and now faces at least 15 years to life in prison. In an interview with ABC News that aired Monday night, Willis said that she still cannot believe that MacNeill, 57, is a killer. 'I did not know anything,' she told ABC. Willis was never charged in connection to the death, but investigators wondered if she had a role in the planning since she was a regular presence at the MacNeill house following Michele's death. First she went to Michele's funeral - and even sent Martin a picture of her naked bottom during the service. 'It was a huge mistake, I am so sorry. I only wanted to come and support the man I cared for in whatever way I . could,' she said. Shocked: Willis, who was charged with fraud alongside MacNeill when they stole his daughter's identity to help erase Willis' debt, said she still cannot believe Martin killed his wife Michele . 'I think I wanted to distract him, also I loved this guy and I wanted to keep his attention. I was sorry that it was inappropriate.' The unusual activity did not end there as she admitted that she went along with his plan to have her live in the MacNeill home under the guise of working as a nanny for the children. 'I am sorry for it,' she said of the decision to pose as their nanny. 'I was more selfish back then and truthfully I was living my life for me.' She added that she had told MacNeill it was not appropriate for her to move in so soon after the death, but 'he was rather insistent'. That said, she still argues against the prosecutor's theory that she was the reason why MacNeill killed his wife, as he wanted to be with Willis instead. 'Martin had me anytime he wanted me I do not believe I was any kind of incentive,' Willis said. Guilty: Martin MacNeill smiles as he thanks his defense team after he was found guilty of murder and obstruction of justice early Saturday morning . 'To finally get justice for our mom was overwhelming': Alexis Somers said that she and her relatives are happy their father will now be behind bars for the murder of their mother . 'I truly cared for him and I can't say . that I'm sorry that I loved him but I think everyone's life would have . been better if I had not met him.' Still, she said, she believed that Michele had died of natural causes so the tragedy would have occurred whether she had known the family or not. When asked if she still loved MacNeill, she responded: 'I care for him on a deep soul level. I'm concerned for him. He's a kindred spirit.' After the investigation went cold, with police initially ruling her death as natural, her daughters and sisters pushed for the case to be reopened. 'The person I knew as my father does not exist. This is a person I once loved, and who I wanted to be proud of me. But we uncovered who our dad really is: a murderer,' Somers told People Magazine. 'To now be responsible for him having to spend the rest of his life behind bars, it's overwhelming to think about. But he's an evil man who's capable of doing so much damage.' Loss: Michele MacNeill, right, was found unconscious in a bathtub in 2007. Prosecutors claim that her husband, left, left her there to die after giving her a lethal cocktail of prescription drugs . That damage also relates to his . daughters, as he still faces charges of sexually assaulting Somers, who . is now 31, in the months following her mother's death. She . did not discuss those allegation during her time on the stand in this . case. Instead Somers, who is a doctor, recalled how her mother had . complained that MacNeill had been giving her many different types of . medications. She also . revealed that she and some of the family's other older siblings were . suspicious that the woman that he brought in to be their new nanny just . days after their mother's funeral was his mistress. That ended up being the case, and that mistress-turned-nanny, Gypsy Willis, also testified in the trial. Willis cooperated in the murder case as a way to help lessen her sentence in connection to the fraud charges she faces for stealing the identity of one of MacNeill's adopted daughters in order to erase years of bad debt on her part. The MacNeill daughters and Michele's sisters were a constant presence in the Provo, Utah courtroom and they were heard letting out a loud yelp before dissolving into tears when the verdict was delivered. Bracing for the outcome: Somers (front right) and her sister Rachel MacNeill (back right) stand alongside their aunts and other relatives as they rose for the jury to read their verdict on Saturday. Both Rachel and Alexis testified in the case against their father .

For the first time in six years, we can finally breathe. And now . finally our mother can be at peace as well,' Somers told the magazine. 'We're just so happy he can't hurt anyone else. We miss our mom; we'll never see her again. But that courtroom was full of so many people who loved her,' she told The Associated Press. For the murder conviction, he faces 15 years to life, and the obstruction of justice charge could add one to 15 more years onto that sentence. MacNeill, 57, showed little emotion when the verdict was read. He hugged his lawyer and said, 'It's OK.' Deputies led him back to Utah County jail. Randy Spencer, one of his lawyers, said he was disappointed before declining further comment.","Martin MacNeill faces 15 years to life for the murder of his wife .

Though widowed 22 years ago he still lives in the house he built in Texas after the end of the war. Overton was in his 30s when he volunteered in 1942 and saw action in the Pacific with the Army's 188th Aviation Engineer Battalion. Obama elaborated on Overton's proud record to the crowd.

This is the moment a hungry mongoose was sent running for his life after trying to capture an adder. The feline prowling South Africa's barren desert crept towards the unsuspecting reptile as it lay curled up in the sand. But just inches away, his dinner fought back, baring its venomous fangs. Petrified, the attempted attacker leaped into the air and bounded away to his companion. It is a rare moment of prey trumping predator in Africa's harsh and wild animal kingdom. Pounce: The yellow mongoose, normally prey for big snakes, is sent running after trying to grab this adder . Amateur wildlife photographer Hennie Lacock was having a picnic with his wife when they saw the fight about to break out. But he was stunned when he actually . managed to capture the exact moment dinner decided to fight back - and . the mongoose fled empty handed. The stunning photo shows both animals mid-pounce - although both eventually escaped unharmed. Although its cousin, the Indian Grey, is . famed for being able to single-handedly kill and eat lethal cobras, . this species is not famed for its hunting. This mongoose had been circling Mr Hancock's table with a pack of companions on the hunt for crumbs. However, they all fled in one moment after catching sight of the puff adder. Mr Lacock said: 'Suddenly their . attention was not on our fried eggs and bacon anymore, and the group of . mongoose rushed over to the other side of the gravel road with real . purpose in their stride - something was up. Approach: The attempted attacker creeps across the South Africa desert with a companion for support . Confident: Finally ready to go it alone, it seems like the cost is clear, with the reptile lying still in the sand . 'All the yellow mongoose were gathering in a circle, snarling, yapping and biting at something. 'I rushed to grab my camera to capture some of the action. 'The yellow mongoose kept crawling up to the puff adder, launching into attack mode, but then retreating back as fast as anything as the puff adder struck back from his coiled position. 'This went on for quite a while as the puff adder made his way into the dirt road. It was time for us to leave when I told my wife: ""Just a couple more shots!"" 'By now there was only one yellow mongoose harassing the snake. As I was about to take my final shot, the Puff Adder launched at the one remaining mongoose one final time with brilliant speed. 'I was lucky enough to take the picture at just the right time to capture the moment, catching the Yellow Mongoose as it jumps away from the puff adder's venomous fangs, and the puff adder pressing hard against the sand for traction to strike out as fast as possible. 'It was an amazing moment to capture and one I will treasure forever.' Hungry: They hung around photographer Hennie Lacock's wife, Kirsten, as she ate before going for the snake . Small: The Yellow Mongoose species is not famed for hunting, unlike the Indian Gray which can kill cobras . Sometimes referred to as a red meerkat, it is a small creature - growing up to half a kilogram in weight and 20 inches in height at most. They are carnivorous, feeding off eggs, small snakes, and lizards - but bigger snakes and birds of prey are their predators. Meanwhile adders, found everywhere from Richmond Park in London to the outback of Australia, can be highly dangerous to anyone that comes into contact with them. The only deadly snake to live in Britain, they have the most highly developed venom-injecting mechanism of all snakes worldwide. Normally not aggressive, animals that leave them alone do not have to live in fear. But when attacked, few predators will get away scot-free.","The feline tries to creep up on an adder in Kalahari desert, South Africa .

Especially when a group of council health inspectors are amongst the unlucky diners. Almost half of the ten-strong group of inspectors fell ill after dining at the Kayal eaterie on a work night out earlier this month. As a result, the south Indian restaurant . has been closed until further notice until tests confirm the source of . an outbreak which has claimed 19 victims in total. Four health inspectors fell ill after eating at the Kayal restaurant in Leicester/ Last month council inspectors awarded the eaterie five stars . The restaurant, in Leicester, has received five-star ratings in its last three council inspections - the most recent of which was just last month. It has also won awards for its service and standards and has featured on Hairy Bikers’ Best Of British BBC2 show. Earlier this year the Great British Bake Off’s Paul Hollywood also visited the restaurant to learn how to make spinach dosa. As part of the episode for his BBC2 series, Bread, Hollywood told viewers: ‘We have here a very good Indian restaurant called Kayal and they make some of the best tasting bread I have ever had. ‘Rice-based, lentil-based, flour-based, it doesn’t seem to matter to these guys, they produce pure magic.’ The restaurant was closed on November 6 . after 19 people reported feeling unwell over the previous fortnight. Samples of food have been taken away for analysis. The Kayal in Leicester has featured on the BBC show Hairy Bikers . Owner Jaimon Thomas said the group of 10 Leicester City Council officers visited the restaurant for a social event on November 2, and four became ill. He added: ‘It was unlucky that we had the council in, and that it included health inspectors, but we would obviously be concerned if anyone at all reported feeling ill. ‘We’ve been open since 2008 and this is the first time we’ve had any problems whatsoever with people getting sick. ‘We had a number of people come to us and say they had stomach aches. We refunded the money straight away and offered them a free meal, which they gladly accepted. ‘The fact the council health inspectors chose to eat there is testament to how highly they rate the restaurant.’ Mr Thomas said the restaurant has high standards and a ‘very good reputation’, and he was ‘determined’ to discover what had gone wrong. Last month, a Leicester City Council health inspection team rated the business ‘very good’ and awarded it five stars. On-the-spot visits in May 2012 and October 2010, also resulted in five-star reports. David Barclay Rhodes, food safety team manager at the council, said: ‘Kayal has always achieved a high level of compliance with food hygiene law. We asked it to close while we investigated a suspected food poisoning outbreak. ‘We do not know what’s made people ill and await the results of samples taken. We can’t comment further.’ Mr Thomas said the restaurant would be using the time it is closed to refit the kitchen. The council said it did not comment on personal information relating to staff, but confirmed there was an outbreak of illness. The restaurant, part of a small chain with branches in Nottingham, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, and West Byfleet in Surrey, is rated 14th out of 664 city eateries on the TripAdvisor website, with a string of positive reviews. However, the most recent review, posted on Friday, warned of the food poisoning outbreak. The reviewer, called ‘Hannah C’, said she and her partner both fell ill for at least a fortnight after an anniversary meal at the restaurant on October 13. In a post headed ‘food poisoning’, she wrote: ‘I had to miss work for a week and unfortunately has put me off eating Indian food and chicken.

Susan Hammond, who was allergic to penicillin, died after doctors and nurses missed seven warnings against using the antibiotic, an inquest has heard . But when Ms Hammond was admitted to hospital with a suspected chest infection, despite her allergy being marked on all of her notes and even a bright red warning wristband, she was still prescribed and given penicillin-based antibiotic Augmentin, it was said. Notes from Accident and Emergency . A letter from her nursing home; . Ambulance notes . Emergency Admissions Unit (EAU) form . Prescription chart . Doctor’s notes . Bright red allergy band she was wearing . The Mirror reports that her allergy was marked on her notes from Accident and Emergency and the ambulance, a letter from her nursing home, and an Emergency Admissions Unit (EAU) form. The inquest heard it was also highlighted on her prescription chart, doctor’s notes, and the allergy wristband. Dr Viv Gunasekera prescribed the penicillin-based drugs and nurse Susan Elliott administered it, it was said. The inquest heard the widow died after suffering a massive anaphylactic reaction. Coroner Stuart Fisher told nurse Susan Elliott that while the fault did not entirely lie with her, there had been a 'number of occasions' when she should have been aware of the patient's allergy to penicillin. He said: 'Despite those seven indications... you carried on and administered Augmentin.' It also emerged at the inquest that attempts to save Ms Hammond's life had been ended because a doctor thought she did not want to be resuscitated - unbeknown to distraught members of her family. Nurse Diane Payne told the hearing Dr . Nivedita Ghosh made the decision to halt resuscitation, and that her . feeling was that they 'stopped it too soon'.

It was said that on July 3, at 3.10am, nurse Elliott then administered the antibiotic containing penicillin, despite a telephone conversation between Dr Viv Gunasekera and members of staff at the care home. Ms Hammond's daughter Alison Wane and son Paul Hammond, had also been unaware that attempts to save Ms Hammond's life had been ended because a doctor thought she did not want to be resuscitated . The medic - who is now a registrar - was said t have concluded that the reaction could not have been severe as no-one at the nursing home knew what it was. Ms Hammond died shortly after the injection. Nurse Elliot told the inquest of her 'upset' at delivering the injection and Dr Gunasekera said she was 'very, very sorry', according to the paper. The week-long inquest is expected to finish today. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Susan Hammond had twice previously suffered bad reactions to drug .

The widower of a nurse who died in a car accident after a grueling 12-hour shift is now suing her former hospital for allegedly 'working her to death'. Jim Jasper's wife Beth died last March 16, after falling asleep behind the wheel while driving home after a night shift at The Jewish Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio. Mr Jasper is now suing the Mercy Health Group for causing her death, claiming that the stress of extra hours caused by under staffing led to the fatigue that caused her accident. Worked to death: Wife and mother Beth Jasper died last March 16 returning from a 12 hour night shift at a hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio. Her widower Jim is now suing the hospital for causing her death . Fell asleep behind the wheel: According to the lawsuit filed last week, Beth's supervisor voiced concern to hospital management that the nurse was being 'worked to death' Beth was the mother of their two young children, a 6-year-old son and an 11-year-old daughter, who have been having a hard time dealing with her untimely passing. 'It's been rough on them, expecting mom to come home from work and she didn't come home from work,' he told WLWT. According to the lawsuit filed by the family's attorney Eric Deters, Beth's supervisor Mary Alliston 'expressed concern to her superiors' that Beth was being 'worked to heath'. Hurting: Mr Jasper (pictured) says that his children have been having a hard time processing their mother's untimely death . The day after Beth's accident, the hospital held a meeting for the nurses and the Hospital's Director of Nursing, Kathy Smith, said she 'was so sorry about the death of Beth' and 'sorry that they had dropped the ball'. Nurses who worked with Beth during her shift leading up to the accident said she complained about being 'really stressed' and said she 'hadn't eaten' at all during the shift. Before joining the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit at The Jewish Hospital in 2000, Beth worked at another Mercy Health hospital but left for better hours. 'Nurse-to-patient ratio, it was just not at safe levels, so she went to Jewish,' Mr Jasper said. The Jewish Hospital is owned by the Mercy Health company. Before going to Jewish, Beth worked at another Mercy hospital. She left that hospital because the nurse-to-patient ratio was 'not at safe levels' but Jewish was soon bought by the same company . But soon after, the hospital was bought by her old employer and staffing went down again. The Ohio Nursing Association said these nursing shortages are becoming a real problem. 'Shortages mean nurses are routinely stretched too thin because they are expected to work longer shifts and care for a larger number of patients. This path often leads to nurse fatigue and is dangerous practice that compromises the safety of both the nurses and the patients they service,' Gingy Harshey-Meade of the ONA said. In court last Thursday, Mr Jasper said that something needs to change about nurse staffing. 'They're passionate about their work. They don't want to make a mistake, but when you're working under those conditions, it's going to happen,' he said.","Beth Jasper died March 16 returning from a 12-hour night shift at Jewish Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio .

Banksy appears to be trying to win New York back by helping raise money for a local charity with his latest artwork. The elusive artist has taken a painting from a charity shop and added a seated Nazi officer before returning it to the same shop and allowing them to auction it off for a six-figure sum. The British street artist took his cues from The Thomas Crown Affair remake as he purchased a painting from the Housing Works shop on 23rd Street before adding his own spin to the work and donating it back to the same store. Scroll down for video . Banksy bought this painting from a charity shop and then added the Nazi officer and signed his signature below that of the original artist, titling his new piece 'The Banality Of The Banality Of Evil' Drawing a crowd: Throughout the day on Tuesday, spectators began to realize that the picture hanging in the charity shop window was actually made by the famed graffiti artist . The store is now auctioning the piece off online for six-figures, the subject matter may ruffle some feathers. The original landscape picture showed sun breaking through clouds above an unspecified mountain range by a river in the woods. Courting controversy: Banksy signed below original artist K. Sager . Banksy then added a Nazi officer with his back facing the viewer, sitting on a bench looking at the scene. As verification, the artist posted a picture of the work to his website where he chronicles his daily contribution to New York's art scene. He titled the work 'The Banality Of The Banality Of Evil' on his website. He also added his signature beneath that of the original artist, K. Sager. A spokesperson from Housing Works has confirmed the sale and said that they had no idea who the man was when he dropped off the painting. 'I don't know all the details, it was all done very secretively. But someone came in and dropped it off as an anonymous donation,' Housing Work's Rebecca Edmondson told The New York Post. The charity, which is dedicated to helping end homelessness and those living with HIV/Aids, received a call confirming the Banksy connection on Tuesday. It is being sold via an online charity aution website. It was initially listed Tuesday evening with a starting price of $76,000 according to The Village Voice. As of 11pm local time, it was already up to $201,200.

Protecting the goods: A security guard will be posted in front of the painting until an online auction is completed on Thursday evening. The price is already up to six-figures . That also marks the last day of the British artist's self-imposed 'residency' in New York, where he debuted a new piece of art every day during the month. One exception was made on October 23 when he posted on his website that the day's art had 'been cancelled due to police activity'. His new philanthropic turn comes after he penned an op-ed slamming the 'Freedom Tower' design that is being built as a replacement for the World Trade Center. His critique- where he called the building a 'shyscrapper'- landed him in hot water, but he is now earning back goodwill by helping out one of the city's most popular charities. 'It’s such a great gesture, what he did today is really special. He may be controversial,  but there is no controversy in the fact that it goes to something good,' Ms Edmondson told The Post.

A 93-year-old former Prisoner of War was separated from his wife for seven months after a mix-up over accommodation at a care home left them living miles apart. Gerry Sinclair hadn't spent a night away from wife Kate, 90, since the end of the Second World War 68 years ago during which he was detained at a Stalag concentration camp in occupied Poland. But when Mrs Sinclair discharged herself from their Bucklow Manor nursing home in Knutsford, Cheshire, her husband wasn't in a fit enough state to follow.

Happily married: Kate and Gerry, who met during the war, on their wedding day in 1945 . Mrs Sinclair tried to return but her place had been taken. It meant the couple, who met during the war, had to live apart. That was until their family enlisted the help of Soldiers' charity SSAFA Forces Help and the couple's favourite team Manchester City which raised money to help pay for the couple to be reunited under the same roof. Now Mr and Mrs Sinclair from Knutsford, Cheshire, have been transferred to the Tabley Nursing Home and are back together again. Mrs Sinclair, who has three great grandchildren, said: 'It has been very tough not living in the same care home but our friends and family have been so kind and worked so hard for us. Mrs Sinclair at Tabley Care Home in Cheshire, seven months ago she discharged herself and wasn't able to go back .

Since the war we've been utterly devoted to each other and it was hell when we split up - although we don't blame the care home. We are just so happy to be back together.' Mr and Mrs Sinclair met at a dance in Leicester in 1942. Gerry who trained paratrooopers was stationed there with the Royal Signals and Kate worked in the land army. During the Second World War Mr Sinclair saw active service across Europe and fought as a Desert Rat in North Africa. He fought in the Battle of Alamein where 100 tanks went out and the Germans wiped them all out but seven. After that he was sent to 6th Airborne Division Parachute Regiment and trained to jump. He himself trained a group of Polish airmen to jump over Tatton Park in Cheshire and they dropped with him at the Battle of Arnhem . As dozens of his colleagues were shot down Mr Sinclair landed and hid under a dead airman as the Germans walked by, then he heard the click, all clear Germans gone. He then fought in Operation Market Garden at Arnhem in a battle recreated in the 1977 film A Bridge Too Far. Happier times: Kate Sinclair at Shanklin Cliff, on the Isle of Wight, in 1945 .

They walked with very little food, hardly any clothing and were covered in lice when they arrived. On arrival at Stalag he discovered someone had found his photo and pinned it up on the door of one of the cells. Mr Sinclair saw it and said 'that's my girl' - something he still says today when he sees that picture. Mr Sinclair was taken prisoner in September 1944 and liberated by the Americans in April 1945.

In . what her family said was her first time in hospital, Mrs White was . admitted in December 8 last year and after seven hours in A&E was . placed on a ward with 19 other patients.

Barclays is being investigated for rigging the ‘Wild West’ foreign currency market, in yet another blow to its reputation. Regulators are looking into allegations that traders at banks across the world conspired to manipulate the £3trillion-a-day market by rigging benchmark rates used when buying and selling currencies. Barclays confirmed it is reviewing its trading going back several years as part of the international inquiry. Chief executive Antony Jenkins, who took the helm 14 months ago after the bank was fined £290million for rigging Libor interest rates – used for inter-bank loans – said he was unable to comment on the ‘ongoing discussions’. ‘From time to time these legacy issues will arise and will have to be dealt with,’ he said. ‘We are in the process of changing the culture of Barclays. I’ve said it will take five to ten years to deeply embed that cultural change, and we are on track.’ The news comes as Barclays revealed a slump at its ‘casino’ bank – the investment arm – helped drag down profits by 26 per cent to £1.4billion in the three months to the end of September. Chris Leslie, Labour’s shadow Treasury minister, said yesterday it would be a ‘devastating blow’ if more wrongdoing is discovered at the High Street giant. ‘Massive damage was done to the reputation of the UK financial services sector with Libor manipulation,’ he said. ‘It would be a devastating blow if Barclays is found to have been engaged in more scurrilous behaviour.’ Barclays becomes just the latest lender to be dragged into the deepening investigation, which began in the summer. Whistleblowers likened the unregulated foreign exchange rate market to the ‘Wild West’. Banks buy and sell foreign currency on behalf of clients but traders can also bet on whether a currency will move up or down in value. Accusations: Barclays traders are being accused of conspiring to manipulate the foreign currency market by rigging benchmark rates used when buying and selling . Regulators in the United States, Asia and Europe suspect that traders have manipulated benchmark currency rates so they can rig their own bets. The investigation centres on claims that bank staff are making foreign currency trades before processing customers’ orders. This week it emerged that a senior currency trader at emerging markets specialist Standard Chartered, formerly employed at Barclays and then Swiss bank UBS, had been suspended. It is not thought the suspension is linked to the trader’s work at Standard Chartered. Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS and Deutsche Bank have all confirmed they are being investigated. But the news that regulators have turned their attention to Barclays comes as another setback for the bank. Efforts by Mr Jenkins to overhaul its tarnished image have been hampered by a series of scandals. The bank is currently fighting a £270million fine in the US for manipulating energy prices and is being investigated by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic for rigging a number of benchmark rates. The Mail, June 28, 2012 . The Mail, November 1, 2012 . The Mail, September 17, 2013 and June 14, 2011 . The lender confirmed yesterday that it is appealing against a £50million fine imposed by City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority over fees paid to Qatar investors during two emergency fund-raisings in 2008. Barclays was forced to go cap in hand to shareholders earlier this month to bolster its capital this month, raising £5.8billion. It had fallen foul of safety standards set by the Bank of England’s watchdog, the Prudential Regulation Authority, governing the amount of capital it has to hold. And earlier this year an independent report headed by veteran lawyer Anthony Salz, commissioned in the wake of the fine imposed in the Libor scandal, criticised its practices. Barclays’ investments bankers were branded arrogant for fostering a ‘win at all costs’ culture and deserting its values in the relentless pursuit of growth. Earlier this month Barclays announced that Hector Sants, the former boss of defunct City watchdog the Financial Services Authority, was taking time off from his new role at the bank. Mr Sants, who was said to be suffering from ‘stress and exhaustion’ was brought in as compliance chief to improve the bank’s reputation. There was some good news for Barclays yesterday. It said it did not need to set aside more money to compensate customers missold payment protection insurance. It has racked up a £4billion bill for the scandal so far.","Barclays traders across the world under investigation after claims .

Britain's most senior family judge was yesterday asked to annul 180 divorces granted to Italian couples after they were exposed as being fraudulent. Sir James Munby, president of the Family Division, heard that couples from the devoutly Roman Catholic country had assumed fake residencies in the UK to avoid the lengthy and often costly Italian divorce process. The scam was exposed when court officials realised that, in 179 of the cases, one of the divorcing parties had given the same home address in High Street, Maidenhead, Berkshire, which was not a residential property, but a post office box, the High Court was told. Quickie split: Italian couples have been found to go abroad to divorce to avoid the lengthy and expensive process in their home countries . The petitioner in the 180th case gave an address in Epsom, Surrey. All the spouses being divorced claimed to live in Italy. Simon Murray, for the Queen’s Proctor – the lawyer whose job is to protect the integrity of the divorce process – is asking Sir James to overturn the decrees nisi and decrees absolute that have been granted in all 180 cases. Couples wishing to get divorced in Italy face a mandatory three-year legal separation period, but they can avoid this by taking advantage of European Union legislation that recognises divorces granted in any member state. After obtaining foreign residency, they can in many countries file for divorce after six months. Romania, in particular, has reportedly become a destination of choice for Italian divorce tourists. But it is illegal to use a bogus residency for these purposes. Until lies do us part: The scam was exposed when officials notices that in 179 of the cases, one of the divorcing parties had the same Berkshire address. Mr Murray said: ‘Italian couples were charged some 4,000 euros in each case for a fast-track divorce, with a post office box in Maidenhead being used to establish residency. It seems that this was a fraud. The decrees should be rescinded. ‘It is a requirement of the law of England and Wales that a person seeking a divorce in the English and Welsh courts has been habitually resident in England for a period of at least one year immediately before issuing a petition of divorce, or that the respondent was habitually resident within the jurisdiction. ‘The English and Welsh courts have no jurisdiction to consider divorce applications by parties who are both resident abroad.’ Mr Murray said that, of the 180 couples, all but two said they would not oppose their divorces being rescinded. He added that a representative of the Italian government was in court to observe proceedings, along with Thames Valley Police officers. The hearing continues.","180 divorces granted to Italian couples exposed as being fraudulent .

As austerity continues to bite and metal prices soar, the sight of scrap metal men hurling old microwaves into the backs of vans is an increasingly common one. The job's not glamorous, but what few realise is that while other industries are struggling, Britain's scrap metal industry is a thriving, £10billion-a-year business that makes serious money for those who work hard. A fascinating new documentary lifts the lid on the secret world where the Rolex-wearing, Mercedes-driving scrapyard boss turns over £7million a year, and the rag and bone man makes £12 a day trawling the streets with his pony and cart. Doing well: Michael is the Rolex-wearing, Mercedes-driving scrapyard boss who turns over £7million a year . Lucrative: Staffed by a team of nine, Sydenham Scrap Metal turns over 10,000 tonnes and £7million a year . Called Getting Rich In The Recession: Scrappers, the show focuses on the characters who make their living at Sydenham Scrap Metal in south London. Packed with compacted old cars, vacuum cleaners, cables, washing machines and other sort of metal junk, the yard is a thriving business run by 31-year-old Michael (his surname is not given) and his staff of eight. The yard turns over 200 tonnes of scrap metal each week and pays out £60,000 a week to an army of self-employed scrappers, who scour London's streets for rubbish they can turn into cash. Tattooed Michael, whose grandparents set up the business with just £50 decades ago, now makes millions from his business buying metal from scrappers and selling it on to be recycled. They use a magnet to sort the metals - if it sticks it's iron and not worth much, and if it doesn't it's precious metal - copper, brass or lead - and worth up to 100 times as much. Michael said: 'I started here at 14, no exams, nothing, and I turned over £7m last year.  This is my life, but I'm happy. 'I'm 31.  Who runs a multi-million pound business at 31?' Going straight: Adam has done time for his part in a violent criminal gang - now he makes £700 a day . Family business: Charlie and his grandson Alfie, 15, scour south London in a pony and cart for scrap . One of Michael's busiest scrappers is Adam, who turned to scrapping after he found it hard to get a job when he got out prison. Former criminal gang member Adam, 26, said: 'It was going in houses tying people up to make them open their safes - it was all stockbrokers, footballers, really wealthy rich people. 'A lot of people got hurt, traumatised by it, things like that.' Sentenced to 10 years in prison for burglary, theft and possessing prohibited weapon at just 18, Adam got out three years ago after serving five years and now makes up to £800 a day scrapping. He said: 'No-one wanted to give me a job.  This isn't what I wanted to do but it's easy, it's good money and it's not really against the law.' Grandfather and grandson work full-time collecting scrap metal to sell at Sydenham, earning up to £30 a day . Metal theft is a problem that grows alongside the price of metal, and results in lead being taken from churches' roofs, bronze statues being stolen, and vital cables stripped from railway lines. One of the UK's fastest-growing crimes, the problem is barely addressed in the show, but Sydenham Scrap Metal has always refused to buy goods they believe to be stolen. Keen to stay on the right side of the law, Adam concentrates on working hard to earn as much as he can, getting up early to beat competitors to the old printers and radiators he finds left on the streets overnight. He said: 'I don't really know what a recession is.  The most I've earned in one day is about £700 or £800, and I can earn up to £100,000 a year. 'I want the nice things in life. I  want to be eating steak three times a week, I want a nice car, I want to buy stuff.' Form of therapy: Single mother of three Cheryl goes out scrapping all night while her children sleep . Rachel is the scrapyard boss' fiancee - people ask her if she is a footballer's wife when she's out in her car . But Adam said he didn't see scrap metal as a long-term career for him, and hoped instead to make enough money from his 'embarrassing' trade to set up on his own as a car dealer. He said: 'I don't want to do this much longer really but I don't want to go back inside and see my son growing up outside. 'I'm doing this for him.  I want my son to be driving around in a brand new M3 when he's 18.' While Adam has a white van, grandfather and grandson scrappers Charlie and Alfie trot through the south London streets in a pony and cart, as their ancestors have done for five generations. Charlie estimates he makes around £12-14 a day, or maybe up to £29 by collecting old washing machines and saucepans and taking them to the yard. Dream job: Forklift operator Jamie, 21, used to come to the yard when he was 10 and beg for a job . At 15, Alfie left school last year to work full-time collecting scrap metal with his grandfather and their piebald pony, Crackerjack. Charlie said: 'He's a little bit streetwise  so what can you do?  Look at the size of him, how can a little teacher tell him what to do? He added: 'It's in the blood.  We're like scavengers.' Cars are the most prized items to be brought to the yard, as the men enjoy crushing them, but old tumble-dryers from laundrettes are also popular, particularly if they still have coins in them - the record is 880 pound coins in one machine they crushed. The only female scrapper to visit the yard at Sydenham is Cheryl, a newly-single mother of three in her 30s who goes out scrapping all night when her children sleep to take her mind off her marriage breakdown. Cheryl, whose father was in the same trade, is undeterred by her male competitors. She said: 'Everything that someone throws away is something I can make money from.  I'm going to register as self-employed and I'm going to be taking all the scrap from those men.'

Betrayal: Richard Hallam, 32, ordered drugs to bring on a miscarriage from China and then secretly administered them to his pregnant girlfriend . A cheating boyfriend who tried to abort his unborn child by secretly giving his pregnant partner miscarriage-inducing drugs has been jailed for 10 years. Richard Hallam, 32, had been seeing another woman when he found out his girlfriend was pregnant with a child he didn’t want. So he purchased an abortion drug called Mifemiso from a website in China, a court heard. While he waited for the drugs to arrive, his partner who can’t be named for legal reasons began suffering complications with the pregnancy. Hallam comforted her but the court heard he was also texting the company supplying the drug, saying he was ‘desperate’ to receive them. Hallam, from Poole, later gave his unsuspecting girlfriend the drug without her knowing. The horrified woman only discovered that she had taken it when she was later told by police who were investigating Hallam for an unconnected attack on another woman. The court was told Hallam had masterminded two savage hammer attacks on a fitness instructor his girlfriend suspected he was sleeping with. Kelly Batchelor, then 31, was hit on the head with a lump hammer by thugs Hallam hired in two separate attacks in Poole, Dorset. Hallam was arrested for ordering the attacks, carried out by three of his friends, andwas jailed for eight years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to cause GBH at Winchester Crown Court. While police investigated Hallam for the attack, they discovered his plot to poison his unborn child. He pleaded guilty to one count of administering poison or other noxious things to procure a miscarriage and was jailed for two years at Bournemouth Crown Court. Both sentences are to run consecutively. Medication: It is not known whether the abortion drug - similar to that shown above - caused any damage to the unborn child or to Hallam's girlfriend's ability to have children . It is not known whether the tablets had any detrimental affect on his girlfriend’s unborn child or her ability to have children in the future. Rebecca Austin, prosecuting, told Bournemouth Crown Court that Hallam began making inquiries into Mifemiso after his girlfriend told him she was pregnant last November. On November 9, Hallam began texting the drug supply firm in China. Miss Austin said: 'Messages were found on Hallam’s phone which were sent to a number, the dialling code of which suggested was in China. He sent a message saying, ""Please try. I’m desperate"".' Miss Austin continued: 'Hallam was arrested in relation to this offence where he made a comment to officers indicating that she had wanted him to give her ""it"", obviously a reference to the Mifemiso.' After Hallam's allegation his girlfriend had wanted to take the drug, she was also arrested by police, but denied having any knowledge of it and was released without charge. In court: Hallam was jailed for two years at Bournemouth Crown Court for administering poison or other noxious things to procure a miscarriage. The sentence will run consecutively with an eight year jail term for another crime . James Martin, defending, said: 'Mr Hallam had been taking a large amount of Valium and mixing it with alcohol, and it is right to say was not someone who was really in the right state of mind.' In sentencing Hallam for the poison plot, Judge John Harrow imposed an order to keep the victim anonymous because of the horror and trauma she has suffered. He told Hallam: 'You now admit administering drugs, intending to cause her to miscarry. 'I have to stress it cannot be established how many times you did this or whether it caused her to bleed. 'The effect of these events were clearly traumatic on (the victim) to say the least, not just what I am dealing with now but the fact that she was arrested twice. 'The case is serious, so much so that custody is inevitable because you put the life of anunborn child at risk.'","Richard Hallam, 32, purchased an abortion drug called Mifemiso from a website in China .

A drug dealer has been jailed after police raided his flat and found a loaded gun hidden in a box of breakfast cereal. Damion Murray, 27, concealed the revolver inside a box of Nestle Cheerios which he hid on the top of his fridge. Officers stormed the ground floor flat in Balsall Heath, Birmingham, following a tip-off that drugs were being dealt from the property. They found a loaded handgun wrapped in a green bandana and placed inside the box of £3.19p multigrain hoops. Sixteen wraps of heroin and cocaine were also found in his bedroom along with £2,500 in cash. A court was told Murray was overheard bragging to friends at a party that he was recruited to be a drug runner. West Midlands Police uncovered phone records linking the painter and decorator to drug dealing activity across the city. Murray was found guilty of supplying Class A drugs with intent to supply following a two day trial last week. At Birmingham Crown Court, Murray was jailed for seven years. After the case, Detective Constable Darren English, from Birmingham CID, said: 'The court saw through his lies and convicted him and we are pleased with the sentencing outcome. 'The evidence supplied to the court was overwhelming and proved that Murray was connected to drug dealing and had links to a local gang. 'Getting guns and gangs off our streets is a priority for West Midlands police and this gun has now been destroyed.

A missing five-year-old British girl at the centre of a tug-of-love dispute has been found in Russia and should be back in England by next week, a High Court judge said today. Alice Davies has been found safe and well with her teacher mother Jacqueline, 49, following the publicity surrounding her disappearance two years ago. Ms Davies is due to appear at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in Birmingham on Tuesday, Mr Justice Keehan said. Alice Davies has been found safe with her mother Jacqueline in Russia after disappearing two years ago . Ms Davies had become involved in family court proceedings after separating from former partner and Alice's father Julian Brown. A judge had ruled that Mr Brown should have contact with his daughter and there followed a dispute, when Ms Davies disappeared with Alice. 'I’m delighted,' Mr Brown said after today’s hearing. 'I haven’t seen Alice for nearly two years. I’m just keeping my fingers crossed that everything goes to plan and I’ll see her next week.' News of Alice’s discovery emerged today at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London, where the little girl’s grandparents were appearing after the judge found them in contempt of court. A High Court judge ruled that Ms Davies' parents and sister were in contempt of court for not having revealed all they know about her disappearance . Brian and Patricia Davies - who are both in their 70s and come from Pentyrch, Cardiff - were remanded in custody on Friday after Mr Justice Keehan concluded that they had lied when asked for information about the child’s whereabouts. Melanie Williams - Alice’s aunt and a mother-of-two - also appeared after being remanded in custody on Friday when the judge concluded that she had also lied and was in contempt. Mr Justice Keehan said in the light of Alice’s discovery all three could be released. The judge imposed a 12-day prison sentence on each and said they should serve half that sentence. He said time spent on remand would form part of the sentence and therefore all three could be released today. Mr and Mrs Davies and Ms Williams, who had been arrested late on Thursday, were led into court in handcuffs by security staff.

Facing jail: Simon Kinney, 49, from Liverpool, gave a £50,000 stash of heroin to a grandmother who hid it among her Cornish pasties . A drug courier who was part of a £1million conspiracy is facing jail after he gave a stash of heroin to a grandmother who hid it among her Cornish pasties. Simon Kinney admitted driving the £50,000 consignment from Liverpool before it was passed on to 75-year-old Michael and 63-year-old Teresa Wood, who drove it back to Bodmin, Cornwall. Three generations of the Wood family have already been jailed for their part in the plot to bring heroin from the north-west to the West Country. Kinney, 49, was arrested after being traced through his family by detectives and encouraged to give himself up. Kinney admitted conspiracy to supply class A drugs and his sentence was adjourned until next month. A pre-sentence report was ordered by Judge Francis Gilbert, QC, and he was remanded in custody. The judge at Exeter Crown Court warned him: 'You must expect a custodial sentence.' Kinney was part of a gang which brought an estimated £1million of heroin into Devon and Cornwall from Liverpool. Three generations of the same Cornish family took part in the plot by which a stream of couriers brought drugs to Torbay and Bodmin. Grandparents Michael and Teresa Wood helped two of their three sons and their grandson run the supply chain which was disrupted by a lengthy and sophisticated police surveillance operation. It resulted in the couple being stopped as they drove from Torbay back to Bodmin with £50,000 worth of heroin in grandmother Wood's shopping bag alongside the Cornish pasties she had bought for their supper. Kinney's role was as courier and he . made two trips. The first was to Torbay, where his package of heroin was . passed to Michael and Teresa Wood before they were intercepted as they . drove back to Bodmin. At a . hearing earlier this year Michael Wood, was jailed for six and a half . years; his wife Teresa and grandson Jake, 24, were both jailed for four . years. The couple's two sons were also jailed. Ivan Wood, 43, was handed nine years behind bars and his 41-year-old brother Calvin six. Exeter Crown Court (pictured) heard Kinney was part of a gang which brought an estimated £1million of heroin into Devon and Cornwall from Liverpool . The main organiser in Torbay, Mark Gale, 41, from Torquay, was jailed for eight years and street dealer Richard Heywood, who sold drugs from various addresses for three years and eight months. One of the gang leaders Craig Corrigan, 23, was jailed for nine years. Couriers John Pogue, 27, Keith Anderson, 30, and Vincent Toohey, 29, all from Liverpool, were jailed for six, six and four and a half years respectively. Money launderers Ryan Morgan, 29, and Brian McDonald, 48, also from Liverpool, were jailed for two years and 16 months respectively.

A nightclubber was run over outside Buckingham Palace by an illegal taxi driver after she had already been hit by another motorist, an inquest heard today. Student Stacey Cooke, 22, of Shoreham, Kent, had been out partying with friends at Mahiki in Mayfair, central London, and was ‘very drunk’ when she ran out onto The Mall and was hit by a car. She had been having a ‘great time’ downing shots and drinking cocktails and wine with friends, but was hit by a chauffeur-driven Mercedes car at 2.20am, Westminster Coroner’s Court heard. Death: Stacey Cooke, 22, of Shoreham, Kent, had been out partying with friends at Mahiki in Mayfair, central London, and was 'very drunk' when she ran out onto The Mall and was hit by a car . Within seconds she was hit again by a second Mercedes which ran over her body as she lay on the ground, and continued down the road - pulling over around 100ft further down. In a court statement, the first driver Michael Florence, a chauffeur who works for diplomats and VIPs, said: ‘A pedestrian emerged from the curb and ran, and ran straight in front of my vehicle. ‘We are talking about an incident where a pedestrian has run headlong against the front of my car.’ He said he swerved his car full lock to the left to try to dodge her - but ‘still didn’t quite miss her, she was going that quickly’. He added: ‘I heard a clip, I heard a thud as my mirror clipped her arm.’ Mr Florence said within seconds of the incident last November he saw headlights in his rear view mirror and heard a second Mercedes car hit Miss Cooke with a ‘thud’. He said: ‘I heard a bang. There was a lot of crunching and crushing of the body when the rear wheels went over the curb and the pedestrian. The driver made no attempt to stop and drove on.’ Tamir Uzan, the driver of the second car, is serving 20 weeks in prison for driving without due care, failing to stop, driving without insurance and taxi touting. He told the inquest he saw what he thought was a bag lying in the road and a split second later went over something. Uzan said: ‘Just before I went over, the . split second before, I can remember seeing something that I thought was a . plastic bag in the road. Probe: Miss Cooke was hit by a chauffeur-driven Mercedes car on The Mall near Buckingham Palace at 2.20am . ‘I remember thinking it was nothing, it was pitch dark. I just went over thinking it was probably a bump.’ Asked why he didn’t notice it was a person lying in the ground, he said: ‘She was dressed all in black lying flat on the road with her face on the opposite side and it was very, very dark. ‘It is surprising Buckingham Palace had . roads like that with ongoing traffic and bad lights. I think now the . lighting has changed because of this accident.’ 'I heard a bang. There was a lot of crunching and crushing of the body when the rear wheels went over the curb and the pedestrian' Michael Florence, first driver . He pulled over up the road and his two passengers rushed back and tried to give her CPR, but she died at the scene. The driver went back home where he was later arrested. Samantha Molyneux, a friend of Miss Cooke, said in a statement: ‘Stacey was very drunk, she was silly, happy, bouncy, energetic and loud. ‘She was fine on her feet, not unsteady at all from what I remember. I can remember us singing and dancing, badly, but having fun. It seemed like she was having a great night, we all were. ‘That night we were mixing shots with cocktails. Stacey had also told me that she had not eaten and had been out with work for a drink before meeting us.’ Miss Cooke - who was studying planning and property development Nottingham Trent University after leaving Walthamstow Hall School in Sevenoaks - had ‘very high’ levels of alcohol in her body. Investigating: Miss Cooke - who was studying planning and property development Nottingham Trent University after leaving Walthamstow Hall School in Sevenoaks - had 'very high' levels of alcohol in her body . Alcohol: The coroner raised concerns that Mahiki nightclub (file picture) in Central London served such strong cocktails and later let Miss Cooke stagger away without her bag . She had been working at chartered surveyors firm Mann Smith, based in Whitehall, at the time of her death. Martyn Urquhart, the coroner’s officer at the court, told the inquest: ‘She was a very hard working pupil and was the first to win a scholarship to a local private school. ‘At school she grew into a confident and happy young lady. When she left school she spent three months volunteering in Fiji where she built a school. She had a lot of friends and a positive attitude. 'I remember thinking it was nothing, it was pitch dark. I just went over thinking it was probably a bump' Tamir Uzan, second driver . ‘Stacey had a wonderful perspective on life. It was expected Stacey would go far in life, she lived life to the full and grabbed every opportunity that came her way. ‘She was an inspiration to her friends and family. She was a wonderful daughter and sister and she is dearly missed.’ The student loved swimming, tennis, and had been one of the best football players at her school. She had been working in London on a year’s placement when she was hit by the cars last winter, and had been planning a trip to Columbia. Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox said: ‘It is my understanding that the first vehicle was driven by Michael Florence. ‘The main impact between Stacey and the car was on the wing mirror and her body went down the side of the vehicle before she hit the floor. When she was on the floor the second vehicle went over her.’ Reasons: The coroner blamed the death on drinking too much alcohol and bad street lighting, and said she is considering writing a report to urge to change the lighting on the historic Mall . Miss Cooke had downed shots, drunk wine and cocktails and shared a ‘Treasure Trove’ cocktail, containing nearly two bottles of rum, at the club with two friends in the hours before her death. Towards the end of the night she went outside into the smoking area to try to find her friend, but was not let back in by bouncers, and so left alone and without her handbag or purse and staggered off in the direction of The Mall. 'Had Stacey not been intoxicated with alcohol she wouldn't have been staggering around the Mall. It may be that this death would have been entirely avoided' Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox . Today Dr Wilcox blamed her death on drinking too much alcohol and bad street lighting, and said she is considering writing a report to urge to change the lighting on The Mall. She said: ‘Had Stacey not been intoxicated with alcohol she wouldn't have been staggering around the Mall. It may be that this death would have been entirely avoided. ‘The low lighting in this area contributed to this incident, I'm sure, as it prevented Mr Florence from seeing her in time to avoid the incident. ‘And the low lighting on the balance of probabilities stopped Mr Uzan from identifying what was in front of him. ‘The lighting was too poor for Mr Uzan at that point to have taken any reasonable action to have avoided Stacey's body.’ Concerns: In the 36 months until August 2012 there were 28 collisions around The Mall, leading to two deaths. In both of these cases poor lighting was one of the factors blamed . She added: ‘The lighting is poor, compounding that there is a considerable amount of street furniture, flag poles, trees and a lot of things that can obstruct the view.’ Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox also raised concerns that . Mahiki nightclub in Central London served such strong cocktails and later let Miss Cooke . stagger away without her bag. She said ‘one would see it's pretty obvious problems would arise’ after selling cocktails with two bottles of rum in it. She . added: ‘I can't speculate because I don't know why she wasn't let back . into the club to collect her bag. I don't know if she asked. ‘It . is clear a minicab wasn't called for her despite her inebriated state . which appears to be against the policy of Mahiki. But we have no idea . what the conversation was.’ She said neither of the drivers would have a realistic opportunity of seeing Miss Cooke and avoiding her. Delivering a verdict of accidental death, Dr Wilcox added: ‘I find it incredibly sad that a young woman of such enormous potential has lost her life from a culmination of too much alcohol and poor lighting. ‘I will consider this outside court but I'm almost certainly going to write a report in relation to whether the street furniture and lighting on the Mall should be reviewed. ‘There have now been two fatalities close by and poor lighting has been indicates as a factor in each. ‘I'm sure that Miss Cooke's family and all the officers and London Ambulance crews would like me to make a report in these circumstances.’ In the 36 months until August 2012 there were 28 collisions around The Mall, leading to two deaths. In both of these cases poor lighting was one of the factors blamed.","Stacey Cooke, 22, of Shoreham, Kent, had been out at Mahiki in Mayfair .

Nick Buckles, above, is the former Group Chief Executive of G4S, who paid no corporation tax in the UK last year . Controversial outsourcing giants G4S and Atos paid no corporation tax in the UK last year, despite receiving more than a billion pounds from the taxpayer, auditors reveal today. The National Audit Office (NAO) says the two firms received a total of £1.4 billion from the taxpayer for providing services that range from running prisons to assessing the health of the disabled. But the spending watchdog says that neither firm paid a penny in corporation tax. G4S made gross profits of up to 32 per cent on some of the £718million of contracts it operated for the Government last year. But the firm was able to write-off against tax an £88 million loss on its disastrous handling of security at last year’s London Olympics –leaving it a corporation tax bill of zero. Fellow giant Capita, which has more than £1 billion a year in public service contracts, is thought to have paid about £50 million in tax, while Serco, which received £1.8 billion from the taxpayer, returned just £25 million in tax. None of the firms would disclose its overall UK profits, making it impossible to work out tax rates. The NAO report reveals that outsourcing accounts for £40 billion a year of public spending. Some £10 billion is spent with a small group of 40 ‘strategic suppliers’. Successive governments have sought to outsource services once provided directly by the State, arguing that the private sector is often better at cutting costs and driving innovation. But critics claim firms have run rings around civil servants and ministers who lack commercial experience. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said it was ‘galling’ that contractors receiving huge sums of public money were paying no tax. And she added that it was unacceptable they were allowed to keep details of their profits secret. No tax: G4S was able to write-off against tax an £88¿million loss on its disastrous handling of security at last year's London Olympics . Serco, who won the operational contract for the Boris Bike scheme in London, is paid around 1.8bn by the tax payer, but paid £25m in tax last year . Mrs Hodge said: ‘There is something particularly galling about the idea of a company who gets its income from the public purse not putting its rightful contribution back in.’ The NAO said the lack of . transparency about profits, together with concerns about the quality of . some services was fuelling a ‘crisis of confidence’ in outsourcing. Its report warned there was a need for more checks to ensure that public service contracts were ‘sufficiently competitive’. Until this year G4S had been led by Nick Buckles, who was accused of presiding over a ‘humiliating shambles’ when the company failed to provide enough security guards for the Olympic Games. A spokesman for G4S said it had paid no corporation tax last year as a result of several ‘exceptional losses’. A spokesman for Atos said: ‘Due to significant investment in the UK to maintain our business here as well as pension contributions, we did not make enough profit last year to qualify for corporation tax.’","Security firm offset tax against cost of their Olympic blunders .

The Marquess of Bath, who is said to have acquired as many as 75 ‘wifelets’ to share the romantic side of his eccentric life, wants to install a cable car to encourage tourists to visit picturesque Cheddar Gorge in Somerset. The 81-year-old owns the southern portion of the gorge but the north belongs to the National Trust, which fiercely opposes the plans, claiming the £10m scheme will 'destroy' the three-mile-long site. His plan has been hatched in response to a huge decline in visitor numbers to the site over the past four decades. Epic: Cheddar Gorge in Somerset is ranked among Britain's most beautiful scenery. A company owned by the Marquess of Bath wants to build a cable car at the site, which would look similar to this mock-up above . The plans: The 600m cable car would run from either point A or point B through a small section of the . three-mile long Cheddar Gorge to the Top Station. Longleat also hopes to build a viewing . platform and sky bridge at the top . The conservation body's views are echoed by locals, who feel the gorge, which also boasts ancient caves, would be made more vulgar if the cable car was built. Helen Bonser-Wilton, Assistant Director of Operations at the National Trust, said: 'The National Trust is objecting to the proposal by Longleat Estates to build a cable car in Cheddar Gorge. 'We are working with CPRE and other organisations to drive business in the Gorge without destroying the very asset that people come to see. It is far better to retain the uniqueness of the place. 'We welcome and support the initiative to take a fresh look at how Cheddar Gorge can regain its reputation as a one of the UK top visitor attractions, and would like to play a full and active part in exploring this further.' The Trust has already denied permission . for the car to run over its portion of the gorge but has no authority . over the Lord Bath owns.  However, it is set to lobby local planning authorities over the proposals. Wonder of the world: The National Trust fiercely opposes the plans, claiming the £10m plans will 'destroy' the three mile long beauty spot . Sketch: An artist impression of the how the top station of the cable car in the Cheddar Gorge may look . Hugh Cornwell, director of Cheddar Gorge . and Caves for Lord Bath, said the estate needs paying tourists as it is . not funded by grants - like the National Trust - and tourist numbers . have dwindled from 400,000 a year in the 1970s and 80s to just 150,000. 'Visually the cable car is a downside although the visual signature is quite small,' Mr Cornwell said. He added that the extra income from the cable car will benefit the area as the money can be ploughed into conservation, wildlife protection and maintenance. However, he admitted some of the income would be profit for the Marquess, who in 2011 had an estimated wealth of £157million. He continued: 'Longleat Estate share the view that Cheddar Gorge is the finest limestone Gorge in Britain, that it is a Site of Special Scientific Interest for its rare calcareous grasslands, that it is a Special Area of Conservation for bats, amongst other endangered fauna, and with six caves that are Scheduled Ancient Monuments it is definitely a prehistoric site of national importance. The 81-year-old marquess of Bath, pictured with long-term mistress Trudi Juggernauth-Sharma, owns the southern portion of the gorge. His representative says the extra revenue will help towards upkeep . Local economy: The representative for Lord Bath, pictured at the reopening of Longleat Safari Park after the foot-and-mouth crisis in 2001, said tourism is vital to the area . 'However looking after Cheddar Gorge, and cherishing its values, costs money. The Government, at a time of national austerity, has more immediate calls on Tax Payer funding to provide education, health care and decent pensions for British people, rather than spending money on re-establishing rare grasslands and protecting karst limestone cliffs from erosion. So we have to look to ourselves to earn the money. 'Many local people, directly or indirectly, rely on tourism for their income – just as Longleat Estate does. They also know that Longleat Estate has a long history of re-investing in both tourism facilities, the Museum, the buses, car parking, etc, and in conservation - having spent £2 million in recent years on conserving the 450ft high cliffs. 'Improving the Cheddar Gorge tourism product, for the needs and expectations of the 21 Century visitor, as a means to protect the natural beauty and wildlife of Cheddar Gorge for future generations to enjoy, is what we have been doing and what we want to continue to do.' Mr Cornwell is planning to make a formal planning application next spring and hopes for it to be operational in spring 2016. Longleat Enterprises suggests the Cheddar Gorge cable car would be similar to that used for the last 30 years at the Heights of Abraham, in Matlock, Derbyshire, pictured above .","Marquess of Bath wants to attract more visitors to Cheddar Gorge .

The owner of a care home where elderly residents were dragged across the floor has dismissed a damning inspection report claiming it was based on a 'bad day'. Care inspectors found residents were left lying on filthy mattresses at Teme Court Residential Care, in Worcester, while poor cleanliness also exposed them to the risk of infection. The Care Quality Commission report said poor staffing levels meant patients were at risk of being neglected while inspectors also found 'unpleasant odours', stains on patients' mattresses and filthy commodes which had not been cleaned properly. A damning report has revealed elderly residents at Teme Court Residential Care, in Worcester, were dragged across the floor and left lying on filthy mattresses . But owner Sharanjit Purewal has defended the care home, saying: 'It was just one of those bad days where certain things weren't right. It was nothing major and I am dealing with the CQC on it. 'There are other homes in the area which have had much worse reports but they don't get taken out of proportion like this. 'The CQC has changed the goal posts slightly and that is something we are dealing with. 'We can't have changed overnight and our report in February was good, we have exactly the same staff.' Mr Purewal, who has owned the home since 2009, said: 'The staffing has improved since I have been here. 'The families like what we do and we move people on if we can't care for them.' CQC inspectors gave the care home a deadline of October 30 to improve its standards. Inspectors from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) demanded improvements at the home, which caters for 18 residents who mainly suffer from dementia . Inspectors have not yet revisited the home to check if the standards are being met but will publish a further report in due course when they have. The care home failed all six requirements and for five of these areas the CQC said action was needed. These included the residents consenting to any care and treatment given, the care and welfare of people at the home, the home's cleanliness and infection control, the home's staffing and how their records are kept. 'It was just one of those bad days where certain things weren't right. It was nothing major and I am dealing with the CQC on it' - Care home owner Sharanjit Purewal . But for assessing and monitoring the quality of service the CQC has taken enforcement action against the home - the most severe warning the watchdog can issue. On three occasions staff 'dragged' patients across the floor of the care home by their walking frames while ordering the residents to 'come on' if they were too slow. Another patient was also left lying on the floor after falling during the night. Poor records meant staff had no idea how long the person had been left stranded. The report said: 'We found the items listed were not clean and had sustained heavy soiling. 'For example, some of the commodes had stains to the pans and dried brown matter to the frames and under the seat of the chairs.' Inspectors also found dirty laundry stored in an open laundry basket with more heavily soiled items stored in the washing machine because 'staff told us they were only allowed to wash clothes at night'. The report added: 'We found that all of the mattresses we looked at were stained and had unpleasant odours.' The care home failed in all six of the inspection criteria . Staffing levels were deemed inadequate to deal with the needs of all 18 residents in the home and relief workers were not called in if staff failed to arrive for a shift - piling 'more pressure' on staff on duty. The report said: 'We noted from one person’s care records that they had fallen during the night but staff were unable to determine the time this person had spent on the floor. 'For example, this person had been observed at 2.30am and found on the bedroom floor at 4am. 'We saw three instances where staff led people by dragging their frames. They encouraged people by saying: ""Come on X"" to hurry people along. 'This was because there were not enough staff to help people to the dining rooms.' The inspectors flagged the incident as 'unsafe' and received assurances it would be immediately addressed. The inspection also found care plans were not reviewed regularly and kept up-to-date and that monitoring and record-keeping of the service provided was inadequate. Many of the residents at Teme Court suffer from dementia-related illnesses and the CQC ordered owner Teme Care Limited to make improvements or face possible closure. The report concluded: 'We have taken enforcement action against Teme Care Limited to protect the health, safety and welfare of people using this service.' Worcestershire County Council and the county’s three clinical commissioning groups have also been informed of the inspection. In a joint statement, they said: 'Worcestershire County Council is aware of the concerns that have been raised and is working with South Worcestershire CCG to support the home to improve the quality of care provision.'","Residents at Teme Court Residential Care were exposed to infection risk .

Gliding across 95 feet of smooth white, Nitzan Benhaim looks like he's snowboarding down a towering mountain. But rather than landing on a sludgy pile of ice and muddy snow, he hops gleefully onto the sun-soaked beach of northern Portugal. A keen surfer who relishes a challenge, Hawaii-based Mr Benhaim  has ventured to Nazare, famed for its enormous waves. After the waves break, a bright white blanket covers the water - making it look like a ski slope. Tempestuous: Hawaii-based Nitzan Benhaim rides the whitewater in Nazare . in Portugal. The huge walls of water look more like a mountain . than the sea . Control: The conditions are incredibly dangerous for surfers, requiring . the utmost control. Waves this size require the riders to be towed-in using jet-skis . When St Jude's storm battered its way across Britain, huge waves battered Portugal. Surfers flocked to Nazare after monitoring . weather data before the storm but the biggest waves created . by the storm actually hit overnight before sunrise. British surfer Andrew Cotton was among the surfers riding the storm. He said he could hear the waves . pounding the shoreline overnight from inside the beach house he is . staying in, saying the monster swells were even making the walls shake. Mr Cotton and his team were in the water before light at 6am, . along with scores of other surfers all tried to ride the biggest wave. Height does not make a wave more deadly - it is the force of the shallow currents that thrill-seekers have to worry about. Risky: It is notoriously difficult to stand at full height - with hands . in the air no less - one a wave this tall. But Mr Benhaim, who has . trained for years, felt confident . Crouch: To get the force and strength to turn into the wave, Mr Benhaim . bends to touch his board as the sea slowly becomes engulfed in white . foam . But it brings its own challenges. Judging when to stand up to catch it in its prime is not as clear-cut as shorter waves. And as surfers make their way down, they need stamina to control the board as they twist and turn for longer than usual. Photojournalist Rui Caria from Nazare, Portugal, captured the moment as Mr Benhaim powered through the Portuguese sea. A huge wall of white water coated the sea in his images as a wave crashed into water at least one-and-a-half times its depth. The 41-year-old said: 'The sea on the day was incredibly rough, which was great for the surfers because their job is to catch huge waves all over the world. 'Every wave is incredibly dangerous, and each wave was around 30 metres tall - I just can just imagine how the surfers feel in the water. 'Despite the roughness of the sea, we can see how elegant the surfers are in the tough conditions. Ease: He glides towards the bottom after a comparatively smooth ride. Later, he went on to tackle waves almost entirely made up of bustling foam . 'When you are watching the surfers, you appreaciate the beauty of what they are doing, but it is quite stressful due to the risk involved. 'The waves were between 20 and 30 metres tall and were so loud and frequent - there was a constant sound.' Mr Caria loves the photographs because of the fantastic swirls that were created by the ferocious wave. He added: 'I love everything that is in the photographs. 'I love the swirls of the wave and when you first look, it looks like you can see a snowboarder on thick white snow.'","Nitzan Benhaim tackled 90ft-tall waves in Nazare on the northern coast of Portugal .

A fresh property bubble could be inflating as the Government's Help To Buy scheme boosts demand and mortgage lending reaches pre-crash levels, experts have warned. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) today said the number of surveyors reporting house price rises has surged to an 11-year high, and warned urgent action was needed to stop demand outstripping the supply of homes for sale. Meanwhile the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) reported 'renewed strength' in the market, with home loans worth £26.1bn handed out in the third quarter of this year - the highest quarterly figure since winter 2007. On the rise, again: Figures from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) out today show the number of surveyors reporting house price rises has surged to an 11-year high . And property website Zoopla said that sellers were becoming more confident about sticking to their asking prices, with a drop in the percentage of vendors dropping their original prices. The latest RICS UK survey found that sales volumes are at their highest levels in more than five and a half years as more people flood into the property market. Nearly three-fifths (57 per cent) of surveyors reported price rises last month, the highest percentage since June 2002, reflecting the imbalance between supply and demand, RICS said. And over the three months to October, surveyors sold just over 20 homes typically, the highest average since February 2008, according to the figures published today. Looking ahead, they said they expect house prices and sales volumes to edge higher in the next three months. Meanwhile, demand for rented property is increasing at its slowest pace in over a decade as more people make the jump on or up the property ladder, RICS reported. But it said that while the new phase of Help to Buy - to give borrowers with deposits as small as five per cent a helping hand to buy a new-build or existing home - is 'widening the net' of people who can get mortgage access, surveyors across the UK are reporting a 'problematic' lack of new instructions from sellers. RICS said that as 'soaring demand' pushes prices up, almost every region is reporting an increase in sales, showing that recovery is 'spreading beyond the traditional economic powerhouses of London and the South East'. The new phase of the Government's Help to Buy scheme, which offers state-backed mortgages to people with deposits as low as 5 per cent, was fired into action last month after the start date was brought forward from January. State-backed lenders Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), NatWest, Halifax and Bank of Scotland are already offering mortgages under the scheme. Other major lenders including HSBC and Santander have confirmed plans to come on board at a later date. The Council of Mortgage Lenders said that lending to home-buyers between July-September was at the strongest levels since winter 2007, and said it would help add momentum to the market going into 2014. Figures from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) out today show the number of surveyors reporting house price rises has surged to an 11-year high, as this graph illustrates . Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist, . said: 'A greater willingness by lenders to increase loan to values on . mortgage products allied to the Help to Buy scheme has meant that more . and more first-time buyers are in a position to enter the market. 'In . spite of this, the amount of homes currently up for sale is still . nowhere near enough to keep up with demand and, in order for the market . to function correctly, this imbalance urgently needs to be addressed. 'House building starts have picked up recently but we are still well behind in terms of the amount of properties needed. 'Housebuilding . starts have picked up recently but we are still well behind in terms of . the amount of properties needed. If we are to create a more sustainable . market, it is critical that many more good quality homes are built in . areas where people want to live.' Fears . have been raised that the upward pressure on house prices could lead to . a 'bubble', with borrowers over-stretching themselves. Ultra-low . interest rates and a string of Government schemes are currently helping . to keep mortgage payments relatively affordable. RICS . recently suggested that the Bank of England should use its powers to . limit house price increases to 5 per cent a year to remove the 'froth' from price booms. It said . that an annual increase of around 5 per cent could trigger caps on how . much people could borrow relative to their incomes or the value of the . property. Help To Buy: This graph shows how the number of enquiries from new buyers has also soared with the promise of help from Government to help secure the cash needed for a deposit . Recent figures from the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) showed that house builders in England are starting more new properties than at any other time in the past three years. But housing charity Shelter has previously warned that the country is still building less than half the number of new houses it needs each year to tackle the 'chronic shortage'. Housing minister Kris Hopkins said: 'We are pulling out all the stops to get Britain building.' He continued: 'Already, we're well on track to deliver 170,000 new affordable homes by 2015, and our plans to invest £19.5billion public and private funding over this spending review, and £23billion in the three years after that, will help towards the fastest rate of affordable housebuilding for two decades. 'Housing starts are now a third higher than at the same time last year and it is clear house building will remain a critical part of our economic recovery. 'In addition, our Help to Buy schemes will help thousands of aspiring homeowners buy new homes with a fraction of the deposit they would normally require - helping to boost the housebuilding industry even further as well as supporting responsible lending. 'On average households have asked to borrow around £155,000 for houses worth about £163,000, which is below the UK average price of £247,000.'","Number of surveyors reporting house price rises is at an 11-year high .

It will further energise consumer optimism that the economy is now through the recession with improvements in the housing market, retail sales, manufacturing and job prospects. An international study published today by retail analysts Nielsen reveals UK consumer confidence is at the highest level in six years. The confidence index rating of 87 is the best since March 2007 and the fourth highest among consumers in 60 countries that were surveyed. It is significantly above the European average of 71, while it was a lower 61 in France, 56 in Spain and 47 in Italy. Germany scored higher at 92. Nielsen said this is the first time that the UK consumer confidence rating has risen to the level seen before the crash at the end of 2007 and in to 2008. It said the number of consumers who . believe the UK is out of recession is a five and half year high, while . the proportion saying they are confident enough to spend – 39 per cent – . is at its best for seven years.

By shopping differently, they have weathered the storm of rising household costs and falling real-term wages. ‘Throughout this period, British consumer confidence remained stubbornly weak, but in recent months it has finally taken an upward turn as the green shoots of economic recovery start to show. ‘Positive news around momentum in the UK housing market has added to the change in mood. ‘Looking ahead, many UK households still intend to spend carefully should economic conditions improve, so we anticipate a continuation of great offers for shoppers, and that leads us to forecast an easier ride for UK consumers over the next three years.’ Petrol prices: The average cost of petrol at the pumps compared to the wholesale price from January this year to the beginning of October, before Asda made its announcement .","Asda setting national cap of 126.7p/litre for unleaded and 133.7p on diesel .

On trial: Anxiang Du, 54, murdered a family of four with 'ruthless efficiency', a court heard . A businessman massacred a family of four in their home in revenge at losing a seven-year legal dispute, a court heard yesterday. With ‘ruthless efficiency’, Anxiang Du repeatedly stabbed university lecturer Jifeng ‘Jeff’ Ding, 46, and his wife Helen, 47, in their kitchen, before moving upstairs where daughters Nancy, 18, and Alice, 12, were cowering in a bedroom. The Dings had been former business partners with Chinese compatriot Du and his wife, but their relationship had soured, triggering a decade of legal action. Du had travelled to the £350,000 property like ‘a man on a mission’, armed with a kitchen knife and out for revenge on a couple who had left him with court costs totalling £88,000, the jury heard. The bloodbath unfolded on the day of the Royal Wedding between Prince William and Kate Middleton in April 2011. The family were stabbed a total of 51 times. A 999 call was made from Alice’s mobile phone that afternoon. Prosecutor William Harbage QC warned the jury they would have to listen to the ‘distressing’ 20-second call, in which ‘more than one female scream could be heard’. The court heard the catalyst for the horror was an injunction which had been served on Du, 54, the night before, preventing him from disposing of his assets. Mr Harbage said Du knew he ‘faced ruin’. He added: ‘He resorted to violence, to murder in order to avenge himself of the people who had caused him such grief. He did so not just by killing them – Mr and Mrs Ding – but also by murdering their wholly innocent daughters. ‘Mr Du made a plan and carried it out with ruthless efficiency.’ Deaths: Du, 55, is accused of killing Manchester Metropolitan University lecturer Jifeng 'Jeff' Ding (left), his wife, Ge 'Helen' Chui (centre), and their two daughters, Xing 'Nancy' 18 (right), and Alice, 12 (left) Mr Harbage said Du and his wife Can . Chen, both herbal medicine practitioners, had run a string of successful . shops with the Dings until the relationship soured in 2001. Du and his wife were dismissed from the business and in 2004 started legal proceedings against the ‘hard-working, decent’ Dings. Seven years of civil litigation . followed. Mr Harbage said that ‘although Du won the first battle, he . lost the last’, and was left with the five-figure costs sum to pay. Mr . Ding, who lectured in polymer science at Manchester Metropolitan . University, was stabbed 23 times, while his wife, a translator, was . knifed 13 times. Couple: Mr Ding (left) was a lecturer in polymer science at Manchester Metropolitan University while his wife (right) was a businesswoman and translator . Their daughters – both talented violinists who toured . Europe with the Northamptonshire Youth Orchestra – were stabbed a total . of 15 times. Alice was found on the bed and Nancy was in a ‘prayer . position’ on the bedroom floor. All . four had been stabbed through the heart and lungs at the property in . Wootton, Northampton. The jury heard Du’s fingerprints and other . forensic evidence littered the bloody scene. Following . the massacre, Du washed the knife and left it in the Dings’ sink before . escaping in their car. The Dings’ bodies were discovered two days . later. Du’s getaway car was found abandoned in London in May. He . travelled by coach – under his own name and passport – to Paris, from . there travelling to Spain where he took a boat to Morocco. Sisters: Xing 'Nancy' (left), 18, and Alice (right), 12, were both killed in the attack in April 2011, the court heard . He was arrested there in July 2012 and extradited back to the UK earlier this year. The . jury at Northampton Crown Court were told that Du, from Coventry, . denies murder but does not deny that he carried out the attack. He is . expected to claim that he should be found guilty of manslaughter on the . basis of either diminished responsibility or loss of control. But . Mr Harbage said the premeditated, ‘grotesque killings’ were the . ‘clearest case of murder, with the obvious motive of revenge’. He . told jurors: ‘This was a considered act of revenge executed in an . unbelievably calm and cold-blooded manner. 'He (Du) planned to kill, he . intended to kill, he did kill – four times. This is murder, nothing . less.’ The case continues. Hearing: Du is pictured (left) today at Nottingham Crown Court during his trial over four counts of murder .

Manchester United legend Sir Alex Ferguson's memoir, My Autobiography, has become the fastest-selling non-fiction book since records began. Sir Alex Ferguson's explosive autobiography was released last week, looking back on his three decades in management. The most successful manager in the history of British football's £25 hardback autobiography sold 115,547 copies in the UK last week - the biggest first-week sale of a non-fiction book since records began in 1998. Read Devil: Former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson's autobiography is the fastest-selling non-fiction book ever . Ferguson beats previous record-holder Delia Smith, whose How To Cook: Book Two sold 112,000 copies in its first week on sale in December 1999, reports The Bookseller. Sales will have been boosted by the uncompromising and candid nature of the firebrand manager. He has blasted a number of former players, including Roy Keane and David Beckham, who Ferguson claims his love for his pop star wife Victoria stopped him from reaching greater heights in his football career. Alex Ferguson's autobiography went on sale last week . ‘The big problem for me is that he fell in love with Victoria - that changed everything,’ he wrote. He also writes of the ‘relief’ that was felt in the dressing room when former skipper Roy Keane, who had ‘the most savage tongue’ left the club in a blaze of controversy in 2005. According . to Ferguson, the physio would ask what sort of mood Keane was in that . day ‘because it would affect whole dressing room’. ‘That was how . influential he was in our daily lives’. Ferguson's My Autobiography has trounced previous fast-selling memoirs, including former Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose A Journey sold 92,000 copies in its first week in September 2010. It also beat fellow former Manchester United hero David Beckham, whose My Side sold 86,000 in September 2003, as well as Princess Diana's former butler Paul Burrell's A Royal Duty, which shifted 77,000 in its opening week in October the same year. In total, £1.4m was spent on copies of Ferguson's memoir last week - almost five pence in every pound spent on all books sold. My Autobiography comfortably tops this week's Official UK Top 50, ahead of former number one Morrissey's Autobiography (26,248 copies sold) and David Walliams' Demon Dentist (25,808 copies sold). Completing the top five are actor David Jason's memoir, My Life, and Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones follow-up Mad About the Boy.","Former Manchester United manager's My Autobiography smashes all previous records .

A political reporter for the New York Times has been inundated with abuse after Twitter users mistook him for Miami Dolphins lineman Jonathan Martin. Despite having a profile clearly stating his role as a journalist, Mr Martin received a barrage of tweets after his professional footballer namesake quit his team over claims that he had been bullied. Instead of redirecting the misguided sports followers, the political writer retweeted the more family friendly messages but his amusement at their content was soon replaced with sympathy for the intended target of the tweets. Mistaken identity: Dolphins player Jonathan Martin, left, and reporter Jonathan Martin, right . Mr Martin, who has 67,000 followers on Twitter, revealed details of the mix up and his response to it, in an article for the New York Times. 'As the story has intensified and . misplaced 140-character assaults have piled up, though, the . misunderstanding has lost some of its charm. I feel bad for my fellow . Jonathan Martin,' he wrote. 'The . whole affair has also been a reminder about how ugly discourse can be on . the internet.' The abusive tweets included rants from fans who blamed footballer Martin for ruining the team's chances. The 24-year-old has said that he wants to continue playing in the NFL but said the past season and a half with the Dolphins had been unbearable for him, a source told ESPN. Quit: Miami Dolphins player Martin left the NFL team over claims that he was bullied . Misdirected: Despite a Twitter profile stating he is a political correspondent for the New York Times, Martin still received messages meant for the footballer . His attorney alleged that Martin was harassed daily, and teammate Richie Incognito acknowledged leaving a voicemail for Martin in April in which he used a racist term, threatened to kill his teammate and threatened to slap Martin's mother. Some messages of support were included in the barrage of tweets sent to the New York Times reporter, but he admitted most were further attacks on the footballer. "" 'U got a beagle dog as ur profile pic n . ur in the nfl,"" wrote @calli_631, who also used a word a vulgarity to . accuse me of ruining the Dolphins’ season,' Mr Martin wrote. 'Somebody named RunRickyRun . (handle: @LordGexs) was a bit more delicate about my namesake’s absence . from Miami’s offensive line. ""The Dolphins need ya back ASAP!!!!!"",' he added. Abuse: Reporter Martin was at the receiving end of rants from angry sports fans . Support: Some of the tweets sent to the journalist were more supportive of the footballer . But as more abusive tweets started coming in, the reporter began to feel increased sympathy for the intended target. His experiences at the receiving end of misguided abuse was shared by Gerry Sandusky, a sportscaster mistaken for former Penn State assistant Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted of child abuse. 'I have walked where fate has now taken you,'  Gerry Sandusky wrote to Mr Martin, in empathy at the reporter's current problems.","Sports fans mistake political reporter's online profile with that of NFL star .

"By . Tamara Cohen . PUBLISHED: . 19:38 EST, 30 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:46 EST, 30 October 2013 . Ed Miliband was accused of playing ‘political games’ over HS2 by Nick Clegg yesterday. His intervention stepped up pressure on the Labour leader as his party appeared to change its stance to back the £50billion rail project. The Deputy Prime Minister added that he would not compromise on HS2 in any future talks with Labour about forming a government. Under fire: Nick Clegg accused Labour leader Ed Miliband of 'playing political games' with the HS2 project . Mr Clegg said the idea was inherited from Labour and it was ‘pathetic... that when it becomes politically convenient to play games with it, they start playing games with it’. Senior sources in the party said Labour would throw its support behind it as long as the incoming chairman, former Olympics supremo Sir David Higgins, is given a free rein to bring down the costs - particularly the £14billion earmarked as a contingency fund. Both Ed Balls and the new transport spokeswoman Mary Creagh have been notably lukewarm about the project, claiming they still support the principle but not ‘at any cost’ and attacked the government for ‘mismanagement’ after the budget rose by £10bn. Ministers say the link is vital to Britain’s future prosperity as HS2 will allow trains to travel at 225mph, reducing journey times but also providing much-needed capacity on the overcrowded route. Yesterday David Cameron, who has suggested the rail link from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, will not go ahead without public support, accused Mr Miliband of ‘flip flopping’. Non negotiable: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he would not compromise on the £50billion rail project in any future talks with Labour about forming a government . At Prime Minister’s Questions, he accused Labour of putting the project at risk. He said: ‘Let us just examine what has happened with HS2 this week. The shadow chancellor touring the radio studios telling everyone it won’t go ahead. ‘Labour local authority leaders begging the leader of the opposition to stand up this infrastructure scheme. And what has he done? Cowered in his office too weak to make a decision. ‘We all know it needs cross party agreement to make this important infrastructure scheme go ahead and what a pathetic spectacle we’ve seen this week - one minute they’re for it then they’re against it and the leader of the opposition too weak to make a decision.’ As the row escalated Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, was heard to shout across the chamber: ‘I’m just doing what the chancellor should be doing.’ No 'flip-flopping': David Cameron accused Labour of putting HS2 at risk . Nick Clegg then upped the pressure by indicating that support for the rail link would be a red line in any coalition discussions with Labour at the next election, if the final decision falls after 2015. Last night a Labour sources said they would vote with the government today on a law which allocates the funds for the project, but does not give the green light to construction . The project, on which around £1billion has already been spent, faces many more parliamentary hurdles before work can begin as planned in 2017. But a party insider said: ‘We support HS2, we will support the bill tomorrow, but its right that we don’t give the government a blank cheque.’ Asked if he would ever compromise on HS2 in a future government, Mr Clegg said ‘no’, accused Labour of playing ‘political games’, and said business leaders in his Sheffield constituency were ‘absolutely appalled at the way in which Labour appears to be betraying the north.’ He said: ‘It just beggars belief for a party that constantly parades itself as the authentic voice of the north of England is now prepared to turn its back on the businesses, the communities, the families which I think all the evidence shows will benefit disproportionately from an investment in a high speed north-south railway link. ‘I just think it is miserable, it’s pathetic that an idea which we inherited from Labour and in all good faith took forward because we thought, given they were the architects of the idea they might support it, that when it becomes politically convenient to play games with it, they start playing games with it.’ Mr Clegg’s spokesman later tried to play down his remarks, saying that the party was not setting out its red lines yet. Labour MP Graham Stringer accused the leadership had misjudged the party’s enthusiasm for the project. He said: ‘I think the leadership of the labour party misjudged the mood, not just of the Parliamentary Labour Party but the Labour party in the whole of the country. Rather than just trying to undermine the project, Ed and the rest of them should be out campaigning strongly for it.’ Sir Albert Bore, leader of Birmingham City council, writing on behalf of councils in Leeds, York, Liverpool and Manchester, warned of a ‘protracted public conflict’ if Labour failed to support it.","Nick Clegg ' will not compromise' on £50billion rail project .

"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 23:20 EST, 12 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:03 EST, 13 November 2013 . Under fire: Columnist Richard Cohen faces calls that he should be fired over a recent column, but he has stood by his point saying it is being taken out of context . A conservative Washington Post columnist is under fire and has been branded 'a racist' after saying that the sight of New York City's newly-elected Democratic mayor and his African American wife would not sit well with much of the populace. Writer Richard Cohen has since argued that he was in fact trying to accuse certain members of the Tea Party of holding out-of-date views. 'People with conventional views must repress a gag reflex when considering the mayor-elect of New York — a white man married to a black woman and with two biracial children. (Should I mention that Bill de Blasio’s wife, Chirlane McCray, used to be a lesbian?),' he wrote in the column. 'This family represents the cultural changes that have enveloped parts — but not all — of America. To cultural conservatives, this doesn’t look like their country at all.' Many media outlets reacted with outrage, with some like The Huffington Post, The Atlantic and Slate calling for the 72-year-old to be fired. Esquire's political writer Charles Pierce wrote a piece titled 'Stop this man before he writes something again,' while Rebecca Schoenkopf titled her Wonkette post 'So this is the one that is finally going to get Richard Cohen Fired from Washington Post, right? Right?' The Daily Beast's Jamelle Bouie went further: 'It’s Cohen who feels disgusted when he sees interracial couples, and he’s hoisting that view on social conservatives as if they’re not his own. ' Slate reporter Matt Yglesias . wrote that Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of Amazon.com who recently . purchased The Washington Post, should consider whether or not it makes . business sense for 'the daily paper in a majority-black city' to be . 'regularly publishing racist op-ed columns'. A look at the data proves that there is . little support for Cohen's theory, as a recent Gallup poll reported that . 87 per cent of Americans approve of interracial marriages. Unnerving? Cohen argues that a portion of the Tea Party will have to fight off a physical reaction from the sight of the de Blasio family, seen here hugging after Bill was elected as the next mayor of New York City . Even fellow columnists at his own paper, like Ezra Klein, took to their blogs to contextualize- and criticize- the points made by their colleague. 'Given . the context of the column, I think that Cohen is using ""conventional . views"" to mean ""culturally conservative views."" But insofar as . ""conventional"" means ""based on or in accordance with what is generally . done or believed,"" acceptance of interracial marriage is overwhelmingly . conventional,' Klein wrote. 'And . note that the current president of the United States is the biracial . child of a white woman married to a black man. America has come a long . way.' Cohen spoke out repeatedly on Tuesday in an effort to explain his opinion- but not to retract his original statement. 'The column is about Tea Party extremism and I was not expressing my views, I was expressing the views of what I think some people in the Tea Party held,' Cohen later told The Huffington Post. 'I don't think everybody in the Tea Party is like that, because I know there are blacks in the Tea Party. So they're not all racist, unless I'm going to start doing mind reading about why those black people are there.' He went on to say that 'not a single one of my editors-- and believe me, they're super sensitive to this sort of stuff' had a problem with the column. Full court press: All of the members of the de Blasio family were heavily featured in campaign ads (seen together on election day after Chiara flew in as a surprise from college in California) Modern family: Seen here in an undated family photo, the de Blasios have been the subject of racial criticism before but the voters of New York support Bill's progressive platform and voted for him en masse . This was not even Cohen's first brush with controversial racial issues this month, as he wrote a hot-button piece about the movie 12 Years A Slave. He also wrote a column this summer from the point of view of George Zimmerman, defending the neighborhood watchman's initial suspicion of a young black teenager. While Cohen may be arguing that a portion of the right-wing Tea Party has a problem with the look of the de Blasio family, the same can certainly not be said about New Yorkers like himself (as Cohen writes for The Post but lives in New York). Bill de Blasio, the city's former public advocate, was elected to take over after Mayor Michael Bloomberg leaves office. De Blasio beat his Republican competitor in a landslide, winning 73 per cent of the vote compared to Joe Lhota's 24 per cent. First couple: Bill de Blasio and his wife Chirlaine McCray are liberal Democrats, and he will be the first Democrat to lead the country's biggest city in over two decades . His family played a major part in his campaign, with both of his children- daughter Chiara with her trademark rosebud headband and son Dante with his distinctive afro- starring in their own commercials. His poet wife Chirlaine McCray, who has previously written an article about her time as a lesbian before meeting Bill, is politically active and expected to play a major role in the administration. This is not the first time that racism has come up in relation to the de Blasio campaign, as Mayor Bloomberg made a disputed claim in an interview during the months leading up to the election, saying that the candidate was effectively using his family to earn votes in minority communities. De Blasio denied the claim, saying that he is simply proud of their close family and they were helping in the campaign because they are all actively involved in one another's lives.","Columnist Richard Cohen wrote that many would have to fight a physical reaction when seeing the mixed-race political family .

A midwife accused of dumping a crying newborn in a stationery cupboard confessed to her boss ‘I have made a mistake, I’m in big trouble’, the hearing was told. Yvonne Musonda-Malata, 35, allegedly told ward sister Martina Cheng that she had left the four-day-old infant in the storeroom and that she was in ‘big trouble’. Musonda-Malata and colleague Christine Onoade, 46, left the youngster face down in a cot in the cupboard at Queen’s Hospital, Romford, Essex, while the youngster's ill mother was getting a much-needed night’s sleep, it is said. A horrified nursery nurse allegedly discovered the infant on its stomach covered in vomit and suffocating at around 6.30am on April 18, 2011, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard. Yvonne Musonda-Malata (left) was responsible for . looking after the baby while its mother caught up on sleep. Both she . and Ms Onoade (right) are also accused of failing to record any feeds . given to Baby A . Miss Cheng told the tribunal that Musonda-Malata came to her that afternoon and confessed to leaving the infant in the stationery cupboard. ‘On April 18, 2011, I was on the morning shift on the post-natal ward,’ she said. ‘After the afternoon handover Miss Musonda-Malata approached me and said that she had made a mistake, she appeared very upset. Martina Cheng, today gave evidence in the hearing of nurses Christine Olukemi Onoade and Yvonne Musonda-Malata . ‘She said the baby was unsettled and crying which had affected the mother, it had made her anxious and prevented her from sleeping. ‘Baby A’s father requested the baby be taken out of the room and was kept in the midwives station during the night. ‘I responded if someone was looking after the baby there was no problem. ‘She said a support worker came and said there was a problem with one of the other mothers and because of this she put the baby in the storeroom. ‘Nursery nurse Alex Curtis found the baby in the storeroom and she (Musonda-Malata) was in big trouble. ‘She said in hindsight she should have asked the support worker to stay with the baby, she said she didn’t think as things happened so quickly. ‘I said to her never do that again.’ Miss Cheng said it was usual procedure to bring a baby from the mother’s room to the nurses station to feed or change it but that a baby should never be left on its own or lying on its front. ‘In my opinion the stationery cupboard isn’t a safe place to put a baby in a cot as there is no ventilation,’ she said. ‘I don’t understand why Miss Musonda-Malata would have chosen to put the baby in there even if she did prop the door open. ‘Miss . Musonda-Malata said she had made a big mistake and was in big trouble, . she must have been upset when she made that statement to me. ‘I can’t remember if the baby was inside the room or propped in the door. ‘I thought the baby was in the storeroom.’ Musonda-Malata and Onoade were both suspended after an internal investigation. Midwife Yvonne Musonda-Malata leaves the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), in central London, where she is facing allegations alongside of failing to provide appropriate clinical care to a baby . They . both face a number of charges in relation to their care of the newborn, . including leaving it unattended, on its stomach and not keeping proper . feeding records. If found guilty of misconduct they could face being banned from the profession. Derek . Zeitlin, the case presenter at the NMC, said yesterday: 'The baby’s . mother has a health condition and it is vitally important for her to get . a good night’s sleep. 'Her husband therefore invited the midwives to take the baby away so that his wife could get a good night’s sleep. 'That . decision was not taken lightly. The nurse looking after Baby A’s mother . was involved in that decision. It was the right thing to do.' Mr Zeitlin explained that the baby . became unsettled at 'various points' throughout the night, adding that . there was 'no specific place to put a baby' while it was looked after in . the post-natal ward. He . said that Ms Malata and Ms Onoade had both confirmed that Ms Malata had . placed Baby A in a cot in the doorway of the cupboard, but claim that . the door was kept open. Midwife Christine Onade is accused of failing to record any feeds given to Baby A . Rita Skeats, a midwife who was working alongside the midwives that evening, said yesterday: 'The first time I encountered Baby A was at 1.30am. I went to the midwives’ station and noticed Baby A in its cot. 'I remember that the father of the baby came out of the room [where his wife was sleeping] at 2.30am, complaining that the mother could still hear the baby crying. She could therefore not sleep. 'I recommended that the baby be cared for at the nursery, but Ms Malata and Ms Onoade said they were coping OK and would keep the baby there. This decision was made jointly between the two midwives.' Ms Skeats, who has been a midwife at the hospital since 2001, told the tribunal that she had two further encounters with the baby, when she fed and changed it. She continued: 'When I returned [to the midwife station], Baby A had been placed in darkened section of the area. Ms Onoade was looking after the baby at this time. 'She was by the desk and Baby A was fast asleep on [its] back. We do not allow babies under three months old to sleep on their front. 'At 6am I went to the nurses’ cupboard to retrieve my stethoscope, which I keep in my bag. At this time, Baby A was still in her cot in the darkened area of the midwives’ station. 'I went to to my patients and when I returned back to the midwives station later I did not know where the baby was, but I assumed it had been taken back to its mother. 'Alex Curtis said the baby was in a cupboard and it had vomited all over itself and it was suffocating in an airless cupboard. Baby A was fast asleep and the sheets were clean. There was no vomit. 'Ms Malata told me that the baby had not been in the cupboard. She told me that Baby A had been wedged in the door way.' An internal investigation was carried out by the hospital which found that Baby A had been overfed and there were poor records of the feedings. Helen Mansfield, supervisory midwife who conducted a preliminary investigation, said there were no guidelines for midwives caring for babies in that situation. Mr Zeitlin explained that the baby became unsettled at 'various points' throughout the night, adding that there was 'no specific place to put a baby' while it was looked after . She said: 'I was asked to investigate the incident, my role was to investigate the clinical care surrounding the incident. 'I looked at the guidelines on the post-natal ward and found there was no applicable policy or procedures on how to act in these circumstances. 'I discovered that Baby A had been overfed, there were no clear records of the feeding. 'I believe the baby had been overfed by the midwives. 'I concluded that there were no care issues during the incident. 'Apart from Alex Curtis not one other person saw the baby in the cupboard and it was all denied from every person I spoke to. 'If there had been more evidence of Baby A being in the cupboard it absolutely would have triggered a care issue but I had no other evidence apart from one person. 'Baby A was a well baby so there would be no requirement for that baby to have a feeding chart. 'The baby was fed although it was overfed.' A further investigation was carried out which then led to both nurses being suspended. Claire O'Toole, associate human resources director at Queen's Hospital, said: 'I was asked to investigate a complaint on April 20 in 2011, raised by Alex Curtis. 'Miss Musonda-Malata was the named midwife and was unable to provide satisfactory care explanation for the duration of the shift. 'There was a lack of clarity for who was caring for Baby A. 'Miss Onoade did have a significant level of involvement in the care of Baby A, she couldn't clearly outline the care when she had actually taken part in it. 'Miss Musonda-Malata engaged with the process well and was consistent but Miss Onoade was unresponsive and unwilling to engage. 'Miss Onade was reluctant to accept responsibility for Baby A. 'The incident brought the hospital into disrepute due to the publicity in The Sun. 'It exacerbated bad publicity we were experiencing as a trust, impacted on staff morale and the feelings of expectant mothers in the trust.' The hearing continues.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 17:01 EST, 12 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:21 EST, 12 November 2013 . Ronald Phillips is a death row inmate who raped and killed a three-year-old girl . Just 72 hours out from his long-awaited death sentence, condemned child killer Ronald Phillips has failed in his bid to donate organs to his ailing mother and sister. The death row inmate had maintained through attorneys that the request was not a delay tactic but a final gesture of good. While prison officials scrambled to review Phillips' last-minute request, which they called 'unprecedented', ultimately they could not figure out a way to get the 40-year-old to and from an offsite hospital while following security procedures leading up to an execution. Phillips is scheduled to die Thursday by an injection of a sedative and painkiller that has never been used in a U.S. execution. Phillips' mother has kidney disease and is on dialysis and his sister has a heart condition. The department says it will be up to his family whether the organs are donated after his death. However it is unclear whether they would be viable once Phillips' body is eventually turned over to his family. The prisons department 'has reviewed the options and has determined that the department is not equipped to facilitate organ donation pre- or post- execution,' said spokeswoman JoEllen Smith. Transporting an inmate so close to his execution date outside prison walls for an off-site medical procedure would pose 'significant security concerns and risks,' Stephen C. Gray, general counsel of prison risk management, wrote in a Tuesday reply to Phillips' request. Phillips had never requested to donate his organs earlier, although the option is available under prison medical policy, Gray wrote. Phillips was sentenced to death for raping and killing his girlfriend's daughter, three-year-old Sheila Marie Evans (pictured), in Akron in 1993 . Phillips will be injected with a never-been-used combination of midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller. He has been languishing on death row for 20 years . Phillips was sentenced to die for the rape and death of his girlfriend's three-year-old daughter in Akron in 1993. Ohio Gov. John Kasich last week rejected Phillips' request for mercy, and all his appeals have been dropped. Phillips' Cleveland attorney, Tim Sweeney, said that Phillips did not propose donating his organs earlier because he was hopeful his case would go another way. 'He's been very reflective and prayerful over the last several weeks,' he said. 'I think he was very hopeful that he was going to be granted clemency and/or get relief from the court, so this never really had to come to a head. 'The disappointment on those fronts made this obviously more relevant.' His mother has kidney disease and is on dialysis and his sister has a heart condition, the Monday letter said. Sheila Marie Evans was murdered in her home on January 18, 1993. Phillips had been sexually and physically abusing her for some time. He was 19 at the time . Phillips severely beat Sheila in the head, face and abdomen, threw her against walls and dragged her by the hair. He also anally raped her. Phillips later confessed the crime to police. In October, the Ohio Parole Board rejected a claim that Phillips was sexually, physically and verbally abused by his father during childhood, with no judge or court hearing such matters in the 20-year history of the case. In 1995, Delaware death row inmate Steven Shelton was allowed to donate a kidney to his mother while in prison, though he was not facing imminent execution. Following successful appeals, his death sentence was reversed and he was re-sentenced to prison time in 2011.","Ronald Phillips is due to be executed on Nov. 14 for raping and killing his girlfriend's three-year-old daughter in 1993 .

"By . Harry Mount . PUBLISHED: . 19:31 EST, 30 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:38 EST, 31 October 2013 . At a cemetery on the eastern fringes of Roman London in AD100, a sombre, yet grand ceremony was taking place. A prosperous citizen was being buried just outside the city boundaries - no Roman, however rich, could be buried within the city walls to prevent the spread of disease. Mourners muttered prayers to the sun god, Mithras, as the body was laid to rest in its dark mausoleum. Overlooking the body, at the far end of the tomb, loomed a majestic stone sculpture of a Roman eagle clutching a writhing snake in its beak. This noble eagle would guarantee the protection of Jupiter, king of the gods, in the afterlife. Beautifully preserved: Luisa Duarte cleaning the sculpture of a Minories eagle and serpent which has been unearthed in the City of London after nearly 2,000 years. Such tomb ornaments were prized by Roman nobility . The sculpture, believed to be the best-preserved ever in London, was unearthed near Aldgate just outside the Roman city wall. Not even the richest noblemen were buried inside the city for fear of disease spreading . After nearly 2,000 years buried under the silt and mud and rubble of London, that eagle has been resurrected. If it hadn’t been for a keen-eyed archaeologist, it might have remained hidden for many centuries more. On the last day of a dig in the East End, archaeologist David Sankey came across a clump of muddy stone, clogged with clay. The sculpture was found at an archeological site, pictured, run by the Museum of London . He and his team had been excavating the earth beneath a planned development of a 16-storey hotel near the Tower of London. The developers were due to begin construction the next day. The team had found a few interesting artefacts in the dig - a bit of pottery, some animal bones - but nothing as spectacular as what they were about to unearth. ‘I couldn’t tell what it was at first,’ says Sankey. ‘I washed it and came across a beak, then a gap, then a wing. And I realised it was an eagle.’ It was no ordinary eagle. It was a Roman eagle, from the first or second century AD, in mortal combat with a snake. More than that, the eagle is the most sophisticated piece of Roman sculpture ever found in London - almost complete except for a chip on its wing. The eagle - on show in the Museum of London - symbolises Jupiter, the greatest of the Roman gods. And it adds another crucial layer to our understanding of Roman Britain. At the time the eagle was carved, Londinium - as it was then known - was far from being a remote backwater of the Roman Empire. Colchester, or Camulodunum, may have been the capital of Roman Britain, but the 330 acres of Londinium - enclosed by three miles of Roman wall, much of which survives today - made it the biggest town in the country. Not long after the Emperor Claudius invaded Britain in AD43, Londinium began its journey to becoming the metropolis it is today. We are discovering more and more about everyday Londinium life, largely thanks to the development of new, modern buildings. Earlier this year, 10,000 finds were excavated on the site of the new headquarters of the Bloomberg media empire near Mansion House Tube station in central London. Among the discoveries, 23ft below ground level, were 250 leather shoes, pewter dinner plates, wooden writing tablets, copper brooches and lead plaques of prancing bulls. Not to mention the biggest collection of phalluses from a single Romano-British site. These phalluses were used as good-luck charms, carried as aides to sexual potency and even used as decorations on horse harnesses. The Romans had a much more easy-going approach to sex - and its public display - than we do today. Brothels abounded in Roman London. Young girls were often captured and forced to work as sex slaves. It was one brutal way the Romans sought to subjugate the people they had conquered. Brothel-tokens, such as this one on show at the University of London, right, were a little more racy than modern-day pound coins - routinely depicting couples in the act of love . Coins and tokens depicting sexual positions have been found in the mud of the Thames. Roman legionaries would have handed these to the brothel-keeper as payment for the act they desired. The poor girl who served them would never have seen any of the money. Juvenal, the Roman poet, wrote that the politicians in Rome kept the city’s people under their thumb through ‘panem et circenses’ - bread and circuses. The same went for the residents of Londinium. Give them food and entertainment, the thinking went, and they won’t rebel. In 1987, London’s Roman amphitheatre was unearthed in the City. Among the discoveries was a timber sliding trapdoor, used to release wild animals into the arena. Top of the bill would have been shows in which animals were set against each other, public executions and gladiator battles. If they were successful in the ring, gladiators could become pin-ups. One Roman cup, discovered by archaeologists, is signed by a gladiator and a glamorous dancing girl, perhaps at the request of an early autograph-hunter. But even if they won the adulation of the crowds, gladiators and dancing girls were still slaves. If you were lucky enough to be a free Roman, life was sweet. When the Romans arrived, they set about importing their home city’s luxuries to this damp and ill-provisioned island. Archaeologists have found elegant furniture such as marble tables, cabinets and chairs with delicately carved lion’s claw feet. Excavated under London's Guildhall in 1988, the city's Roman Amphitheatre was one of Britain's most spectacular archeological finds. Features included trap doors from which animals could spring into the arena . This artist's impression shows how the amphitheatre would have looked in AD70, its Roman heyday . Londinium jewellery was as finely worked as anything on Bond Street today. Finds include an amber amulet in the shape of a gladiator’s helmet and exquisite hairpins. The Romans were great shoppers and party-givers. Archaeologists have found wooden tablets inscribed with extensive shopping lists or invitations to lavish dinner parties. Those tablets also reveal the names of Londinium’s inhabitants - showing a mixture of Latin names and Celtic ones. Invaders lived right alongside the invaded. Tacitus - the Roman historian whose father-in-law, Agricola, was Governor of Britain from AD77 to 85 - wrote about how striking the British natives were. The Scots had red hair and big limbs; the Welsh had dark skins and curly hair. The British were a superstitious lot, he added, given to aggression. When they settled in Londinium, the Romans transformed the stodgy diet hitherto eaten in the city’s taverns, introducing exotic imports from the Mediterranean. London archeologists have been unearthing landmark finds for many years. A temple to the sun god, Mithras, was discovered in the street of Wallbrook, City of London, in 1954 . Amphorae, or urns, were brought over loaded with spices, wine and olives. Pheasants - now the most common bird in the British countryside - were introduced by the Romans, who had encountered them in south-west Asia. Differences persisted, though, between the Roman and the native diet. In AD100, Roman legionaries, serving at the Vindolanda fort in Northumberland, wrote home to their families, asking for food packages: garlic, fish, olive oil, olives, lentils and wine. They didn’t care for the northern stodge favoured by the Scottish Picts - venison, cereal and pork fat. What really got the Roman invaders down was the weather. In AD98, Tacitus said of our climate: ‘Caelum crebris imbribus ac nebulis foedum’ - ‘The British sky is obscured by constant rain and cloud’. Still, their oppressed Imperial subjects had a lot more to be grumpy about: there was no doubt they were second-class citizens. No wonder that, in AD61, a great revolt against the Romans was led by Boudicea, Queen of a Celtic tribe. During the rebellion, Londinium was burnt down. The revolt was suppressed by Roman military might - and Boadicea died, either through illness or taking poison. The Romans subsequently changed their tactics, finding more subtle ways to control the natives. Tacitus explains how Governor Agricola set up Latin schools for the sons of the native British upper class and introduced them to ‘things with a touch of sinfulness to them’: drawing rooms, hot baths and elegant dinner parties. As Tacitus writes: ‘In their stupidity, the British called this civilisation when it was all part of their servitude.’ The Romans didn’t just introduce us to baths, but also the gym. Fragments of thermae - public baths combined with gyms - survive in the City of London. We can thank them, too, for the Roman roads that head out of London. For all their brilliance, those roads left one unfortunate legacy to the modern commuter: the narrowness of train and Tube seats. The first Victorian trains were built to the same width as horse-drawn wagons, which had themselves been designed to fit the ruts left by Roman chariots. The standard British rail gauge - 4ft 8½in - still mirrors the specification for a Roman war chariot. That figure, the Romans thought, reflected the size of a horse’s bottom, with a little wriggle room on either side. As our own bottoms have grown bigger, those seats have become more and more uncomfortable. So next time you’re tightly packed into the 5.37 from Waterloo, you know who to blame: the Ben Hurs of Roman Londinium.

A 37-year-old man mysteriously collapsed and died after opening a container which bore the description ‘Pandora’s Box’ in red letters, an inquest has heard. Jason Airey was found unconscious by his parents next to the box, which contained unused synthetic cannabis, in the bedroom of their home in Carlisle, Cumbria - and no drugs were found in his system. Mr Airey’s heart had stopped beating, causing his organs to fail - and he died two days later at Cumberland Infirmary, having never regained consciousness following his collapse in May. Location: Jason Airey, 37, was found unconscious by his parents next to the box, which contained unused synthetic cannabis, in the bedroom of their home on this road in Carlisle, Cumbria . In Greek mythology, Zeus gave the box to Pandora with instructions that she should not open it - but she eventually gave in to her curiosity, and all the miseries and evils flew out to afflict mankind. Mr Airey had worked for food manufacturing business Cavaghan and Gray and construction firm Metal Box, both in Carlisle. His father Dennis told the inquest his son had been happy on May 2. According to the Carlisle News & Star, Mr Airey Snr said: ‘He was just his normal self. I think he had enjoyed himself in town. He had been shopping and said he was going upstairs to get changed.’ Mr Airey Snr said his wife Anne became worried when their son had been upstairs for a while. ‘She went upstairs and came back down saying something was wrong,’ he added. ‘She couldn’t wake him.’ Legend: In Greek mythology, Zeus gave the box to Pandora with instructions that she should not open it - but she eventually gave in to her curiosity, and all the miseries and evils flew out to afflict mankind . Ruling: Coroner Robert Chapman said Mr Airey's heart stopping 'caused the death of his brain which caused multiple organ failure' Paramedics were called and Mr Airey Snr started CPR, he said. The paramedics worked on his son for an hour before he was taken to hospital, the newspaper reported. 'We don’t really know what caused his heart to stop' Coroner Robert Chapman . His father said he found ‘a little packet’ inside the box and had originally thought it was cannabis - but ‘it didn’t smell’. The court heard that tests later revealed it was synthetic cannabis. Mr Airey Snr added: ‘It was a packet but had not been used. It was on the bed right beside him. He hadn’t taken any drugs after having a bad experience with ecstasy 13 years ago.’ Ruling a natural death, Coroner Robert Chapman said: ‘His heart stopping caused the death of his brain which caused multiple organ failure. We don’t really know what caused his heart to stop.’ Epimetheus and Prometheus were brothers who lived in Ancient Greece. The gods were upset because the duo had given fire to humans - and they now wanted to punish the siblings. Zeus created Pandora and took her to Prometheus, but he refused her because he knew the gods wanted revenge. However Epimetheus thought she was beautiful and agreed to marry her. The couple lived without worry until she received a box from Zeus, who said it must not be opened. Pandora, however, let curiosity get the better of her and opened the box. It contained the evils of disease, misery and death - which poured out of the box, shaped as tiny moths which stung her. She then shut the box again, and Prometheus ran to see her. They could hear a voice calling to be let out - and opened the lid once more. Out came hope, which healed her wounds. So, Pandora had released pain and suffering on the world - but had also allowed hope to follow.","Jason Airey found unconscious by his parents next to box in Carlisle .

Britax has revealed the Xtensafix car seat may be exchanged after it failed tests carried out by experts at Which? Britax has withdrawn its latest hi-tech child car seat – the Xtensafix – amid safety fears. The hi-tech design, which costs £216, failed tests carried out by experts at the consumer group Which? The manufacturer insists the product, designed for children from the age of nine months to the point they are big enough for the normal seat, meets all industry standards. However, it has decided to offer an exchange following a series of stringent tests carried out by consumer groups. The Xtensafix was one of 16 child car seats tested by ADAC, the German automotive club, for European consumer organisations including Which? The seat was marketed as being a safety advance in that it includes a five point safety harness, likened to those used by racing drivers. It also includes padded wings to keep a child secure, a moveable head rest and pads across the chest straps to limit any injury during an impact. Which? child car seat researcher, Victoria Pearson. said: ‘The Xtensafix looked like an exciting new product that offered a long useful life span and the possibility to use a five-point harness for longer - which was good news for parents with heavier toddlers. ‘But it did not meet all of our high expectations when we got it to our test lab and scored so poorly in one test that we had to rate it as a Don't Buy.’ The Xtensafix can be used for children between 9-36kg in four different modes, all of which were tested in simulated crash tests. Which found ‘severe weaknesses in frontal impact safety’ where the adult seatbelt – rather than the five point harness - was used for larger children. In simple terms, a child was in danger of being thrown forward and injuring themselves in a crash. Miss Pearson said: ‘Our tests are more stringent than the legal standard and Britax was not obliged to withdraw the Xtensafix from sale. ‘So we are really pleased that Britax has taken these disappointing results seriously and has acted fast to remove the Xtensafix from sale and offered to refund or replace seats that have already been sold.’ Manufacturers Britax said the hi-tech car seat, for children aged from nine months, meets all industry legal standards (stock image) Which? tests around 35 new child car seats each year and says its independent crash tests are more stringent that the United Nations regulation ECE R44 that car seats must comply with to be sold in the EU. Its front crash test is carried out at a higher speed than ECE R44 - about 40mph instead of 30mph -and it includes a side impact crash test, which ECE R44 does not require. Child car seats are tested in a real car body, not on a sledge with a car bench seat fixed to it, so the position of the seat belt anchorage points and car seat characteristics are more realistic. Britax said: ‘In the test results, the Xtensafix received sufficient scores in all usage modes with the seat's integrated 5-point harness. However, it received an ‘insufficient’ score from ADAC in usage modes with the vehicle's adult seat belt. ‘Parents should rest assured, that the Xtensafix has been fully tested, approved and certified in accordance with the legal standards applicable in the European Union (ECE R44/04) and has . passed all legally required safety and other tests in all usage modes. ADAC's opinions and ratings do not change this position. ‘However, simply meeting legal standards is not what Britax is all about and is not what our brand represents. We make premium products, work to very high standards and expect our products to deliver best-in-class performance in the most demanding tests. ‘We have, therefore, taken the decision to stop actively manufacturing and selling the Xtensafix in its current form.’ Britax is offering a full refund or a redeemable store voucher equal to the purchase price paid for parents who return their Xtensafix to the store they bought it from.","The Xtensafix, priced at £216, failed tests carried out by experts at Which?

A planning consultant has seen his career destroyed after he repaired the roof of his fire-damaged thatched home without securing planning permission. Chris Board lived with his family in a mobile home for months after his 17th-century thatched cottage was ravaged in a fire. After receiving an insurance payout, he proceeded to repair the Grade II-listed building - but was then told that he had breached planning laws. Home: Chris Board has been fined for repairing his Grade II-listed home after it was damaged by a fire . He was fined £1,000 as well as paying £3,000 in costs - and now the 37-year-old says he will not be able to find work because no one will hire a planner who has committed a planning offence. Mr Board's house in Boxted, a village near Colchester in Essex, was seriously damaged by fire in May 2011. As well as being forced out of his home, he had to stop working for a time because the fire destroyed his computer and shut off all the telecoms connections. He used insurance funds to replace unsafe roof timbers with modern timbers made from green oak. But Colchester Borough Council - where Mr Board himself used to work - ruled that the repairs 'affected the building's character'. Blaze: Mr Board and his family were forced to live in a mobile home for months after the 2011 fire . The homeowner claimed that he did not need to secure planning permission because the repairs did not drastically alter the appearance of the cottage. However, he decided to admit to breaking regulations in order to avoid the expense of a trial. 'We lost nearly everything on one side of the house,' Mr Board said. 'We were fighting every step for a payout from the insurance company. I was left in a position where I had to fix the house myself. 'I have done the minimal work required. You can class these timbers, with appropriate joining techniques, as repairs. 'I feel proud of what I have done, and proud as a family how we have held ourselves together. It was a lot of effort and a lot of money.' Damage: Many of the timbers in the roof had to be repaired following the blaze, Mr Board says . Repairs: The planning consultant failed to obtain permission for the work he carried out - and paid the price . He added: 'I have lost my career, everything I trained for. The hardest part is not having the ability to work.' Tim Young, Colchester's councillor responsible for planning, said: 'We take the conservation of our listed buildings very seriously and we will not hesitate to prosecute those who ignore these very specific building requirements.' But Mr Board said there was no need for the council to be so heavy-handed in his case. 'If I was a builder or trying to make a profit, or you ask for consent and the council say no and you do it maliciously, I could understand prosecution,' he said. 'The council can offer you a formal caution, but decided it wanted to make an example of me. You feel like you are being bullied.' He says he is planning to appeal against the decision with the ombudsman.","Chris Board, 37, had his Essex home damaged in a fire in May 2011 .

This is the moment a superyacht worth millions of pounds was destroyed today after a fire broke out on board. Nearby workers raised the alarm after smoke was seen billowing from the yacht at the East Cowes Marina on the Isle of Wight shortly after 1pm. Eyewitnesses described how flames quickly engulfed the vessel, melting its fibreglass hull before part of it collapsed into the water. The 76ft long yacht named Kahu, which was worth more than £8million, was parked up in the marina because it was up for sale. Video below... A superyacht worth more than £8million was destroyed after a fire swept through it in on the Isle of Wight . Blaze: Black smoke could be seen billowing from the vessel after the fire broke out shortly after 1pm today . Local residents were told to stay indoors and keep windows and doors closed because of the large volume of smoke. Drinkers in a nearby pub were also told to stay put while firefighters made the area safe. Fortunately, firefighters were able to stop the blaze from spreading to other yachts, with quick thinking marina staff moving any vessels immediately next to the fire. It is not immediately clear how the fire started, but no one is thought to have been injured. Morgan Strange, who works opposite the marina, said: 'Obviously there was a lot of black smoke and then the flames started to spread pretty quickly up to the fly-bridge at which point the radar dome caught fire and then collapsed onto the fly-bridge.' It was feared at one stage that the superyacht would sink beneath the surface as it was loaded with nine tonnes of diesel.

'They think the Kahu will sink due to weight of water on her, although nine tonnes of diesel could be a pain for pollution. 'It is such a shame as she was a sight to be seen at the marina.'

The Kahu, which was built in 2011 and could sleep up to six guests in three staterooms, was listed in June by brokers Ancasta. Danger: Local residents and drinkers in a nearby pub were told to stay indoors and keep doors and windows closed because of the smoke . The advert for the vessel stated that the boat was the 'highest specified and most desirable Nordhavn on the market today.' It added that the Kahu was owned by an . experienced yachtsman who was very much involved at the design, . specification and build stages and as a result, the yacht was fitted . with 'some excellent custom requests which had significantly enhanced . the desirability'.

One of Scotland’s most notorious criminals, branded the 'acid monster' for organising a horrific attack which left his ex-wife disfigured, has been jailed for life after trying to stab a nightclub doorman. Gordon Modiak was jailed for 20 years over the sickening acid attack on tragic Louise Duddy in Edinburgh in 1991. But, after changing his name to Wood and moving to Blackpool to start a new life, the 56-year-old is now back behind bars after being caught on CCTV trying to stab a bouncer in the popular seaside resort. Gordon Modiak was jailed for arranging an acid attack on ex-wife Louise Duddy in 1991. He has now been jailed again for a knife attack on a doorman . Horrific: Louise Duddy was scarred and blinded from the attack, which shocked the Scotland . The dad-of-two flew into a rage over a remark that he’d be 'more comfortable' in a gay bar. The attack comes 22 years after he masterminded a crime which shocked Scotland. After a bitter split from his wife, he paid a hired thug to throw sulphuric accident in her face - while he calmly watched from a getaway car parked in a quiet Slateford street. Ms Duddy, now 48, was blinded by the attack. Bizarrely, in his trial at Preston Crown Court, Modiak claimed he had merely pretended to stab the bouncer in order to draw attention to his continuing grievance over his conviction for the acid attack. After a bitter split from his wife, he paid a hired thug to throw sulphuric acid in her face, leaving her blind and disfigured . The court heard how his latest crime followed a similar pre-planned and disturbing pattern. Modiak was drunk and smoking outside a bar called Ma Kellys on March 16 this year when he was asked to move away by door staff. After spitting at the bouncers, he changed his clothes and put on a hat, returning in disguise an hour-and-a-half later with a large knife hidden from view. In CCTV footage, Modiak is seen walking past the entrance of the bar - sizing up his intended victim - before doubling back. He then pulls out the blade and lunges at bouncer Daniel Ursoi, 39. Speaking after Tuesday’s sentencing, Mr Ursoi said: “He walked up to me and shouted, ‘Do you remember me?’ then launched at me with the knife. 'I remember thinking, ""Oh God"". I was so lucky the knife missed me and just caught my sleeve.' Mr Ursoi’s fellow doormen held on to the the thug until police arrived. Sentencing Modiak to life in prison, Judge Graham Knowles QC said Modiak could easily have killed Mr Ursoi. He said: 'You are an extremely dangerous man, you present a serious risk of harm to members of the public. 'You have no concept of how people see you, including the jury. 'That was evident with you defence - you said you pretended to stab the man so you would be arrested and get the attention you deserve for what you call the ‘miscarriage of justice’ that happened in Scotland.' He was convicted of attempted grievous bodily harm with intent and possession of a bladed article. He was ordered to serve a minimum of five years and 124 days before being eligible for parole.","George Modiak jailed for 20 years for masterminding mutilation of ex-wife .

Martin Rainey, 39, needed 12 stitches in this gash above his eye after he was attacked in Bristol on his way home from his girlfriend's birthday party . A couple walking home from a birthday party were beaten unconscious after they chanced upon a gang of youths vandalising cars. Martin Rainey, 39, and his girlfriend Helen Wild had been celebrating her 42nd birthday at a pub in Kingswood, Bristol, when they came across five young men kicking wing mirrors off cars. These horrifying pictures show how badly Mr Rainey, a welder, was beaten - he needed 12 stitches to his face and doctors said he narrowly missed being blinded, while his girlfriend was barely able to speak for a week afterwards. The thugs launched their unprovoked attack when Miss Wild, an office assistant, turned to look at one of the vandals, who were aged between 16-20, . She said: 'I just turned around and looked at them, or huffed at them.  Suddenly one of them threw a bottle, or a wing mirror, and it hit Martin right in the face, just above his eye. 'There was blood everywhere.' The blow slashed open Mr Rainey's face and he was knocked unconscious, landing on the ground.  The young men then turned on his girlfriend. Miss Wild said: 'I think they would have done something even if I had not looked at them.  Then I remember one of them saying ""Leave it"" to the horrible one and I was hit on the back of the head. 'I don't know if it was a fist or an object, but it knocked me out.' Miss Wild fell in the street and believes she was then dragged onto the pavement during the assault, which occurred shortly after midnight on 26 October, because when she came round she had finger marks and bruises on her wrist and ankle. She added: 'I thought they had taken Martin off . and killed him because I couldn't see him anywhere. 'He had been knocked . out too and when he came round he did not realise I was on the floor, . so he had legged it up the road after them. 'I ran to a house nearby, knocked on the door and they called the police.' Doctors told Mr Rainey, pictured after the attack, left, that he narrowly missed being blinded in his right eye .

Energy giant SSE today denied putting profits before customers as it announced inflation-busting increased payouts to shareholders days before it hikes prices. The firm made profits of £354 million in just six months but dismissed accusations of greed from ministers, insisting that ‘nothing could be further from the truth’. But it announced a 3.2 per cent increase in interim . dividend payments to investors, as it prepares to put up prices by 8.2 per cent from this Friday. Profits: Energy giant SSE revealed a loss in its retail business but still posted total profits of £354million in six months . SSE was the first of the Big Six suppliers to announce its price hike for this winter, blaming wholesale price rises, increasing costs of delivering gas and electricity to homes and green levies. Most of the other big firms have announced increase up more than eight or nine per cent, but yesterday French-owned EDF Energy announced its bills will go up by just 3.9 per cent. The National Audit Office warned today that energy and water bills are set to rise faster than inflation and wages for the next 17 years, to pay for extra investment. Energy Secretary Ed Davey yesterday took aim at greedy energy bosses, likening them to bankers responsible for the financial crash. Co-operative Energy has scaled back a planned price increase amid expectations that the Government will axe green levies from bills. The supplier said its tariff increase will reduce from an average of 4.5 per cent to 2 per cent, while regional variations in prices mean that more than half of its 150,000 customers will now see no hike at all. Co-op Energy, which launched in 2011, said its decision was in response to the 'clear indication that the Government has given that it will remove the mandatory Energy Companies Obligation (ECO) green taxes on gas and electricity bills'. 'Those profits cannot come at the expense of the elderly, the vulnerable and the poorest in our society,’ he said. 'Customers are not just cash cows to be squeezed in the pursuit of a higher return for shareholders.’ But SSE insisted it was not prioritising shareholders, as it announced the increase in interim dividend payments to investors. Will Morris, group managing director . of SSE's retail business, said: ‘Some politicians and media commentators . have claimed recently that we value our shareholders more than our . customers. ‘Or to put it . another way, we're focussed on paying them a dividend on their shares, . regardless of what that means for our customers. Nothing could be . further from the truth.’ He . added: ‘Without the investment made by shareholders, we couldn't afford . to build the infrastructure or buy the equipment needed to deliver what . customers need.’ Rising gas . and electricity bills have dominated the political agenda in recent . weeks after five of the ‘big six’ suppliers have upped tariffs. The firm revealed overall underlying group profits fell 11.7 per cent to £354 million in the six months to September 30. It made a first half loss of £115million in its retail supply arm compares with a £48.3 million operating profit a year earlier. How bills will soar . Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'Despite . reporting losses on its domestic supply business, SSE as a group is in . profit and awarded above inflation dividend payments to shareholders. 'This will be of little comfort to their customers who were hit by an . average price rise of 8.2 per cent only last month. 'It's time for the . Government to turn up the heat on the energy companies and deliver the . radical changes that people need. George Osborne should use his Autumn . Statement to cut the Big Six down to size and to cut the cost of . Government energy policies to consumers.' Tom . Greatrex, Labour's shadow energy minister, said: 'Just days before . their price hike hits millions of households, these profits and the . above inflation rise in dividends to shareholders raise yet more . questions about whether this market is really working for consumers. William Morris, managing director of SSE, denied putting profits before customers . 'Labour's price freeze will save money for 27 million homes and 2.4 million businesses and our reforms will deliver fairer prices in the future.' SSE - which trades as Southern Electric, Swalec and Scottish Hydro - also revealed falling electricity and gas consumption in the half year, down 3 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively on average with weather effects stripped out. The group's customer numbers also dropped by 60,000 to 9.41 million since the end of March. Lord Smith of Kelvin, chairman of SSE, said: ‘Energy market conditions generally have been difficult for some time.’ SSE chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies called for green levies to be paid for by general taxation, which he said would reduce bills by £110 immediately. The group vowed to reduce its bills if the levies were cut, telling BBC Radio 5 Live that prices would definitely come down as a result, ‘no ifs, no buts’. SSE's retail division contributes around 13 per cent of the overall company's results, with the rest coming from its energy networks and generation capacity. Including one-off items, the group reported pre-tax profits of £336.4 million for the half-year. The group said it deployed more than 1,100 engineers and support staff to make repairs after last month's St Jude's storm when around 110,000 of its customers were left without power.","Company reveals profits of £354million for six months to September .

Murderer Jeremy Bamber would torment his magistrate father by covering himself in make-up for trips to the local shops, a new documentary will reveal tomorrow. Bamber, now 52, enjoyed doing 'outrageous' things to provoke his adoptive parents, Nevill and June, both 61, before he went on to shoot them dead at their Essex farmhouse alongside his adopted sister Sheila and her six-year-old twins. Farm secretary Barbara Wilson, who worked at the Bambers' farm before and after the August 1985 murders, told a new investigation: 'He'd wear lipstick, eye shadow, and paint his eyelashes and put on make-up.' Nevill and June Bamber, both 61, were shot dead by their adopted son Jeremy, right - Nevill foresaw his death . Farm secretary Barbara Wilson says Jeremy Bamber would wear full make-up to provoke his father, Nevill . Sheila Caffell, Jeremy Bamber's adoptive sister, and her twin sons Daniel and Nicholas, six, were killed . 'He used to do outrageous things that used to upset Mr Bamber.  He was a Jekyll and Hyde character.' Mrs Wilson said the the atmosphere at the Bambers' White House Farm in Tolleshunt d'Arcy changed dramatically a few months before the killings. It was alleged that Bamber had stumbled across his parents' wills and was outraged to discover he was to share their wealth equally with his adopted sister, Sheila. Despite being set to . receive around £400,000, worth around £1million today, it was said . that he decided to kill Sheila and anyone else who might have a claim to . the money to ensure he got it all. On the night of 7 August 1985, 25 rounds were shot at the farmhouse, leaving Nevill and June, Sheila, and her sons Daniel and NIcholas, dead.  The small boys had been shot in the head. The Bambers' farm secretary said there was 'a lot of bickering' in the run-up to the murders, and said the elder Mr Bamber, who looked tired and worried, told her he feared something appalling was going to happen. Mrs Wilson said: 'For some weeks he looked really drawn and ill.  He seemed to stoop and seemed to have the worries of the world on his shoulders. Killing scene: White House Farm, at Tolleshunt D'Arcy, where the mass murder took place in August 1986 . 'I thought he might have cancer... He said he hadn't got anything like that but he had got great problems. 'I . asked him to elaborate and he said that he thought he might die.  I . said ""What makes you think that?"" and he said there might be a serious . shooting accident.' 'Knowing what had been going on, [I] thought that he knew that Jeremy was going to perhaps shoot him.' Bamber was said to envy his sister, . nicknamed Bambi, and the attention she and her two sons got from Nevill . Bamber, a former RAF pilot, and his wife. Police initially accepted Bamber's . version that his sister had had a psychotic episode and shot her whole . family dead before shooting herself, and was seen sobbing at his . family's funerals.  He said he was alerted to the tragedy when his father rang him in the middle of the night to say that Sheila had gone mad, before the phone went dead. But detectives became suspicious of . his behaviour, and when Bamber's then girlfriend Julie told police he'd confessed to her, they pieced together the truth. Bamber, now 52, has always maintained his model sister Sheila, right, killed her family in a psychotic episode . Prosecutors said Bamber's theory was impossible because a silencer was found hidden . in a cupboard with Sheila's blood on it, and he was was found guilty on . a 10-2 majority verdict. The prosecution said he shot his family dead, . leaving the gun and an open Bible beside his sister to make it look as . if she killed herself last, before climbing out of a window and cycling . three miles home to the cottage his father had given him. Bamber was sentenced to life in prison . at the Old Bailey in 1986. In a TV interview for tomorrow's . documentary, Countdown To Murder, Mrs Wilson said that Bamber tried to . provoke his mother, June, by riding his bike round and round her in . circles, trying to knock her with the bicycle. On another occasion, he left a bag of live rats in his mother's car. Mrs Wilson added: 'Jeremy would put over a face of being a very sort of nice person and then he would go and do something really nasty... Jeremy Bamber, seen here with his then girlfriend Juilie Mugford at one of the funerals after the slaughter . She said that when Bamber took over his father's farm after the murders, she never once saw him grieving for his family. 'I wanted to shout out to him ""I know what you've done"" but I didn't have the guts to do it.... 'I think I might have ended up the same way as Mr and Mrs Bamber.' In court it was argued that without a silencer, the 25 shots that were fired would have alerted the victims to the danger.  And if the silencer had been attached to the gun, it would have been too long for Sheila to have shot herself with it. The prosecution argued that Jeremy Bamber had no interest in inheriting his father's business, but wanted the £436,000 family fortune. When Nevill Bamber offered his son a job on the farm in 1986, it was the catalyst for the younger man, who lived in a cottage provided by his parents a few miles away, to plan a way to get the money for himself. Bamber, one of only 38 prisoners in England and Wales serving a whole-life sentence, has pleaded innocence consistently since he was sent to jail in September 1986. However despite several appeals and reviews, and despite former Tory MP Andrew Hunter saying last month that he believed Bamber was innocent, the mass murderer remains in jail.

A man who became a viral sensation known as ‘Kai the Hatchet-Wielding Hitchhiker’ has been indicted on first-degree murder charges in connection with the beating death of an elderly New Jersey lawyer. Union County prosecutors say 25-year-old Caleb McGillvary could face a life sentence if he is convicted. The indictment was handed up Wednesday by a county grand jury. McGillvary is accused of killing 74-year-old Joseph Galfy, whose body was found May 13 in his Clark home. Authorities say McGillvary and Galfy met in New York City and McGillvary stayed at Galfy’s home. Scroll down for videos . Jailbird: Former Internet star Caleb 'Kai' McGillvary, 25, was indicted on first-degree murder charge . McGillvary was arrested in Philadelphia several days after Galfy’s body was found. He is represented by the public defender's office, which doesn't comment on cases. The Canadian gained online . fame in February after intervening in an attack on a California utility . worker in which he described using a hatchet to fend off a further . attack. Last month, McGillvary and one of his supporters launched a YouTube channel featuring recordings of the 25-year-old talking on the phone about his life behind bars and performing songs. In the most recent installment posted last week, McGillvary sang a ditty about surfing, talked about the books he has been reading in jail and recounted a story from his hitchhiking days, in which he spent time with an unhinged, disabled Vietnam War veteran and his dog. McGillvary also explained that he has been unable to communicate with his friends and supporters in a while because he has been denied access to writing materials - 'in violation of the 14th Amendment' - after he was accused of tempering with a rubber pen. The man concluded his monologue by expressing hope that soon he would be given access to a radio, because 'life without music is kinda boring.' One of McGillvary's friends, a woman named Donna, posted on a Facebook page that has been set up to drum up support for him that it could take up to two years before 'Kai' goes on trial. 'I can only hope that every supporter stands by his side,' she wrote Wednesday. Also on Wednesday, a friend named Echele posted on the page . that she and some of McGillvary's other fans visited . him in jail the day before. 'He looks very well and is in as good . of spirits as are possible,' the friend wrote, adding that the . 25-year-old has been whiling away the hours meditating and reading letters from his supporters. In August, the 25-year-old suspect was rushed to a hospital after suffering a self-inflicted wound in an apparent suicide attempt. Kai became an Internet celebrity after . he thwarted a deadly attack on a California woman with the help of his . hatchet last February. Staunch supporters: Following his arrest in May on a murder charge, McGillvary's many fans have been raising money for his defense fund . Promotional materials: Kai's friends have been distributing 'Free Kai' posters containing information on the donation page and the Facebook support groups . A video of McGillvary's interview after the incident has gone viral, spawning parodies and countless memes on social media sites, and earning his thousands of admirers. Following his arrest in May on a murder charge, McGillvary's numerous fans from across the country have been hard at work trying to raise money for his defense fund. Terry Ratliff, of Georgia, who has emerged as one of Kai's staunchest supporters, set up an online fundraiser on the site GoFundMe.com, asking people to donate $70,000 to help the 25-year-old homeless man cover his legal fees. As of Thursday morning, Kai's online war chest boasted just under $4,500 in donations. Kai's friends also have been spreading the word about his predicament by distributing 'Free Kai' posters depicting the 25-year-old 'homefree' hitchhiker playing the guitar and advertising the donation page and the Facebook support group.

The victim was found severely beaten and wearing only his underwear and socks by police, who went to his home to check on his well-being.

One friend who commented suggests 'hitting him with a hatchet' – and McGillvary's final comment on the post said: 'I like your idea.' Photos and a YouTube video from early March show the 24-year-old vagrant getting an elaborate tattoo on his right cheek which helped police apprehend him after a Starbucks barrista recognized it and told police.

An Arizona retiree expecting a shipment of photos from her dying father was floored by what she ended up receiving instead: 1,000 love letters he’d sent her mother after World War II forced them apart. Jane Bartow says the lovesick and strikingly intelligent dispatches from the warfront were likely included by her fiercely private father, Darrow Beaton, accidentally. But the error revealed an unbelievably complete account of what war was like for the young Merchant Marine and his wife Elinor. ‘In one of his letters he said he remembered kissing her in the snow that first night they met,’ said Bartow, whose book details the initially desperate but ultimately triumphant tale of her parents’ early years as a couple fighting to stay together during WWII. Scroll down for video... Love during wartime: Jane Bartow got a surprise lesson in history and in her own parents' emotional courtship when her father, as he was dying from cancer, accidentally sent her a box of the private letters he'd sent her mother as a Merchant Marine at sea during WWII . ‘My dad was a little bit wild and my mother was attracted to that as a bishop's daughter,’ Bartow told MailOnline. ‘He was from the other side of the tracks.’ Her father was even the leader of a gang, Bartow said, and her mother's father was a national church leader, so the stakes were high. Both for Elinor and Darrow. While Darrow may have been the frontrunner in the quest for Elinor’s affections, she had many other men vying for her. One thing that shocked Bartow while reading her father’s letters was learning that her mother had received marriage proposals from many men during the war. ‘She had so many other boyfriends,’ said Bartow. ‘She was very beautiful and very talented.’ 'He remembered kissing her in the snow that first night they met': Bartow immersed herself in the 1,000 pages of letters, which showed her a side of her parents she otherwise never would have known . While he was dying of cancer in 2008, Darrow Beaton accidentally sent his daughter 1,000 pages of love letters he'd sent his wife while he was at sea during the war from December 1941 to November 1945. Jane Beaton Bartow was so moved by the riveting, emotional courtship the letters revealed that she used them to write a book To Elinor: A Romance in Two Voices. She also has started a project dedicated to preserving the stories of WWII veterans called World War II Daughters. Bartow provided the excerpts below, taken from her father's many letters: . A 1942 photo of her father shows the Merchant Mariner in his sailor's uniform. Over the course of several years, the letters Darrow Beaton wrote to Elinor show their budding romance, their near break-ups, and ultimately their marriage . May 1, 1943You write that you wonder if the world will ever be the same again. Of course, the world is going to settle down again. We’ll all live those very normal lives—the sort of lives that we used to hate at times because they seemed to be so dull and uninteresting. I must keep believing that. We all must, or there is no use fighting.May 14, 1943You’re now reading a letter from the happiest fellow in the world! I’ve got a brand new queen of the seas for my ship. Honey, she’s a huge Liberty cargo ship. I’m so excited that I’m jumpy.May 1943It’s getting late. There are many things on my mind tonight. I want to lie here for a long while and figure things out. There’s this business of secret codes, quite a load on my mind. But by tomorrow I’ll have this ol’ Irish mind cleared up, things in their right notch.February 11, 1944Mid-PacificThings have eased up with us, and I can now sit here and listen to a broadcast station again after dark. As I sit here, something somehow demands of me to remember how darn lucky I have been so far in life. Things could be so different with me, couldn’t they? But here I am. Alive. Feeling great, working at a good job, feeling as if I have a bit part in the war, and looking forward to a leave at home. There are luckier guys, I guess, but they can’t feel any happier than I do tonight.February 25, 1944Sitting here with the static beating a regular tattoo on my ears, I suddenly got the brilliant idea to read over some of your letters again. Maybe it’s just that I happened to get the wrong letters, but in the three I picked up, Im branded for life—a cynic, unfaithful dog, drunkard, etc.May 13, 1944I suppose that everyone at home is watching for the news of the invasion. I know that we all are hoping that they put it off for a while so we can get at least close to it when it starts. It’s going to be something huge, and I can’t help but think that peace will come shortly after it starts. Let’s just hope that things go perfectly for the boys when they hit the beach over there.It is dark. I have a small desk lamp on, and the radio is playing static to me. The ship is asleep and quiet except for the throbbing of the thousands of horsepower pushing us along. There’s a cigarette burning in the ash tray sending smoke up to be scattered by the fan which is spinning this hot, moist night. The ports are down, the huge steel doors are closed about me. I’m quite alone with all of these dials, meters, trimmers, and gadgets. Alone with my thoughts and my work. And my thoughts, quite naturally are about you. Happy mistake? As Darrow Beaton was dying from lung cancer in 2008, the World War II veteran mailed his eldest daughter four bankers' boxes, each one overflowing with a lifetime of family photos. But in one box was something even more precious . She’d even accepted two rings. But Bartow said that’s just what women did in order to preserve soldier morale. 'She was being a good girl and listening to Emily Post,’ Bartow said, referring to the famous etiquette writer of the day, who encouraged women to ‘Just say yes.’ So what made her mother say yes to at least two other men but ultimately marry her father? It wasn’t just his bad boy behavior, Bartow said. ‘If you have the opportunity to read all the letters, you see he’s so intelligent,’ Bartow said. ‘I think that attracted her.’ HIYA SWEETS: The letters were typed on a mill, which was often used by seamen in order to translate Morse code . Beautiful and talented: While her father was smitten by her mother, Bartow says that her mother often dreamed of bigger things outside marriage and family and nearly walked away from the relationship . Code: The couple used a code when describing geography, presumably as a way to reveal information soldiers were supposed to keep secret . The couple met just after Pearl Harbor, Bartow told KVOA, and the letters spanned from December 1941 to November 1945. In between, there were hardships. Darrow was at sea for long stretches and there was even a time when Elinor nearly chose another man. ‘He almost lost my mother,’ Bartow said. But on his final leave in 1945, after Elinor lied to her parents in order to go see Darrow, something changed. ‘She was just swept off her feet on . that last leave he had,’ she said. ‘She gave up her dreams of being . something big like a movie star.’ At . midnight on July 14, 1944, Elinor and Darrow Beaton were married in . Seattle. Two hours later, Darrow was shipped out to sea for the final . time. Thankfully, the . couple would have a joyous reunion in due time and go on to raise a . family together. One that included a daughter who, until both were dead . and gone, had no idea how romantic her parents’ courtship had been. Her . historical novel To Elinor: A Romance in Two Voices is based on that . courtship and was as much a means of understanding her parents as it was . a way to celebrate them and other couples like them. ‘I . learned so much about the war. I learned how tough it was. I learned . how hard it was for these men, and how lonesome it was for them,’ Bartow . said. ‘But I also learned how tough it was on the women. It's like . their lives stopped because all of the young men were gone.’ Darrow signed his letter 'Beat,' for his last name, which was Beaton. According to his daughter, Darrow numbered the letters so that Elinor could line them all up in proper order . Smitten: Darrow Beaton was fiercely intelligent, says Bartow, and his bad boy 'other side of the tracks' attitude made him fascinating to her bishop's daughter mother . Married: Despite the obstacle of a world war and several falters, the couple eloped in 1944 just hours before Darrow was shipped out to sea for the last time . To Elinor: Jane Bartow (pictured) has written a book about her parents based on the letters she discovered and describes the experience of uncovering their past an emotional one . 'I learned so much about the war': Bartow says writing her historical fiction around her father's touching letters became a lesson about the war's high cost on the then youthful Greatest Generation .","Arizona retiree Jane Bartow was shocked to find the reams of emotional letters her father sent her mother while the war kept them apart between 1941 and 1945 .

Trade union influence on Labour has turned the party into a ‘Monty Python parody of the Soviet Union’, Nick Clegg claimed yesterday. The Deputy Prime Minister said something ‘seriously dodgy’ had  happened in the safe Labour seat  of Falkirk, where the Unite union  is accused of trying to fix the selection of the new parliamentary candidate. Ed Miliband has refused to reopen an abandoned internal inquiry into Falkirk, despite the emergence of fresh evidence of wrongdoing, which is now being investigated  by the police. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Labour leader Ed Miliband had to 'come clean' about what had happened in Falkirk . Mr Clegg said it was time for the Labour leader to ‘come clean’. ‘It’s like some sort of Monty Python parody of the Soviet Union,’ he said on Call Clegg, his weekly phone-in on LBC radio. ‘The Labour Party leadership appear to be puppets on a string run by these trade union bosses. ‘Something seriously dodgy clearly happened in Falkirk. It really is time for the Labour Party leadership to come clean.’ Unite is alleged to have signed up people in Falkirk to the Labour Party without their knowledge in a bid to fix the outcome of the selection. The union, Labour’s biggest donor, has furiously denied any wrongdoing. Parody: Mr Clegg joked that Labour's complex relationship with the unions was like something out of Monty Python . The Falkirk row centres on claims the Unite union tried to influence the selection of Labour's candidate in the Scottish town. Karie Murphy is an old friend of Unite boss Len McCluskey, and was the union's preferred choice. There are claims that Unite signed up people to become Labour members in the seat in the hope of influencing the result, without their knowledge. The Labour constituency chairman is Stephen Deans, the Unite official at the centre of a dispute which nearly closed the Grangemouth oil refinery. Mr Deans and Ms Murphy were suspended from the party after Labour called in the police, but were reinstated in September after a Labour investigation concluded without finding evidence of wrong-doing. Since then whistleblowers have denied claims they withdrew their evidence and demanded action. But Mr Miliband has refused to reopen the inquiry. It . follows the publication of emails from constituency chairman Stephen . Deans which opponents claimed raised fresh questions about alleged . attempts to rig the vote in favour of a candidate backed by the Unite . union. Union official Mr . Deans and Unite's favoured candidate, Karie Murphy, were reinstated in . September after a Labour investigation concluded without finding . evidence of wrong-doing. Mr . Miliband has refused to publish the inquiry's report amid questions . over its key finding that allegations of members being recruited without . their knowledge had been withdrawn. To add to the row, yesterday another former candidate for the Falkirk nomination, Gregor Poynton, told The Guardian that he had paid for 11 members to join the Falkirk constituency party with a single cheque of £137 last July, adding: ‘I believe that I have at all times acted within the rules.’ It emerged this week that Unite handed Labour almost £800,000 after Mr Miliband dropped his inquiry into claims it had been involved in vote-rigging. Official figures revealed that Unite donated £777,740 a fortnight after the Labour leader reinstated Mr Deans and Ms Murphy who had been suspended. The huge cheque was almost a quarter of the £3.1million donated to the party in the third quarter of this year.","Deputy Prime Minister says Labour must 'come clean' about Falkirk .

Zoe Eckersley branded Cheshire East Council's decision not to empty her green bin because she had disposed of pumpkin seeds, a 'joke' Having scooped out the seeds from a pumpkin so her children could make a Hallowe'en lantern, Zoe Eckersley thought she was doing the right thing by putting them in her green bin. After all, she reasoned, pumpkins grow in gardens, so their seeds surely belonged with the hedge trimmings and dead leaves. However the mother-of-two hadn't reckoned with the bureaucratic machine which today polices exactly what rubbish should go in which bin. Her bin - brim-full of garden waste for the final collection before next Spring - was left unemptied, with a lurid yellow form identifying the pumpkin seeds she had left at the top as the culprit. When she complained, the 40-year-old was told she had risked spreading disease - and that no home-grown fruit or vegetables could be put in the green bin either. Yesterday the property developer's wife said that even as a conscientious supporter of recycling, the rule was a 'joke'. 'The ridiculous thing is that the actual pumpkins had to go in my neighbour's green bin because ours was full, but because they were covered up by grass from the lawn, the binmen didn't spot it,' she said. 'If I'd put the seeds in with the general waste, everything would have been taken away as normal, but because I tried to do the right thing I've got a full green bin which no-one will collect. 'They say mixing food and garden waste can spread foot and mouth disease, but plenty of councils allow you to mix them. 'And if it's so important to keep them separate, surely the council need to inform people rather than just catching the odd person by lifting up their bin lid?' Mrs Eckersley, of Knutsford, Cheshire, who works for her 41-year-old husband Matthew's property firm, asked the council if they would come back and empty the bin if she removed the seeds, but they refused. She now faces waiting until the Spring for the next garden waste collection or laboriously emptying the bin into bags and taking them to a recycling centre. In addition, she has been told by Cheshire East Council that no fruit or vegetables grown in her garden can be put in the green bin. The council said Mrs Eckersley risked spreading disease by mixing food waste with garden cuttings . 'We grow strawberries and I asked what I should do if I need to dispose of berries that have been pecked at by birds or spoilt,' she said. 'Apparently the berries themselves need to go in the black bin or be composted. 'Only the strawberry plant and leaves can go in the green bin. Rhubarb leaves are OK though, apparently. 'Another friend had ten pumpkins to dispose of. They took them to Knutsford tip and were told to put them in the garden waste section. A yellow note left on her bin, informed Mrs Eckersley of the collection team's decision. The next collection date is not until next spring . 'I just find it absolutely bizarre. It's an absolute joke.' In an email from the council's customer services team, Mrs Eckersley was told: 'The waste department are unable to return to empty your bin because the crew found food waste in your bin. 'We cannot accept any food waste, including vegetables/seeds from your garden. This is because of foot and mouth restrictions on the farmland we use to dispose of your waste.' As Mrs Eckersley does not receive a kerbside food waste collection, she uses a waste disposal unit instead. The only other separate bin the family have is a silver one for paper, cardboard, plastic bottles and cans, which they use so much they have been allocated a second. Councillor David Topping, cabinet member in charge of the environment, said: 'All of our waste collection crews are trained to assess the contents of garden bins before they are emptied into the collection vehicle, and they will not be emptied if the crew find any waste that could be considered as food waste.' As garden waste was sent to local farms for composting, they could face prosecution if food waste was mixed in, he added. Councillor Topping said the council's household waste recycling centres were the only exceptions as they did accept home-grown fruit and vegetables in the garden waste skip. The council hopes to save £1million by stopping green waste collections between November and March. In 2009, John Mason of Connah's Quay, Flintshire fell foul of the bin police by putting bruised windfall apples from his back garden in his green bin. Householders who persistently flout the rules could be hauled to court and fined up to £1,000.","Cheshire East Council said Zoe Eckersley risked 'spreading disease'

Spared jail: Clairvoyant Christina Green, 56, was given a suspended prison sentence after being found guilty of five counts of fraud . A clairvoyant who failed to foresee that she would get caught cheating the taxpayer out of more than £100,000 in benefits has escaped a prison sentence despite being found guilty of fraud. Self-declared 'spiritual medium' Christina Green, 56, failed to declare that she owned two houses in Herne Bay, Kent, dodging thousands of pounds of council tax. At the same time Green, who travels the country giving spiritual readings in churches and theatres, and promoting her book, claimed income support, jobseekers' allowance, and housing and council tax benefit. She conned a total of £114,000 in benefits and was only caught when she applied for more benefits and officials from Canterbury City Council and the Department for Work and Pensions investigated her. The psychic told Maidstone Crown Court the second house belonged to her ex-husband and denied five counts of fraud, but a jury still convicted her of five counts. Today Judge Jeremy Carey let the mother-of-three walk free, sentencing her to 12 months in jail suspended for 18 months. The judge said: 'This sentence I have imposed should not be construed as some kind of charter for any offender, male or female, that no-one goes to prison even though they defraud the state in relation to substantial sums of money. 'Each case must be determined on its own facts and courts do not sentence by rote but by the particular circumstances of each case.' Judge Carey said that Green would have been entitled to some benefits over that time, so the sentencing had to be in proportion.  And he said it would impose a further burden on the taxpayer if he sent her to prison. The judge said the impact on her children and her own 'precarious' mental state had been taken into account. Hannah Eales, prosecuting, told the court: 'It is the Crown’s case that when she completed a form and was asked about her circumstances she declared she was a lady with three children and had no savings, investments or capital, including property.' Spiritual: The clairvoyant's website describes her as 'one of Britain's most exciting spiritual mediums' As part of her sentence Green must carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and attend a women’s programme activity. Confiscation proceedings are to be held at a later date. A spokeswoman for Canterbury City . Council, who were defrauded out of housing and council tax benefit . money, said: 'We obviously frown upon any kind of fraud against the . council.'","Christina Green, 56, falsley claimed £114,00 in various benefits .

Just hours after he had breathed his last, the great Belgian detective - played by David Suchet - was back from the dead to be grilled by Today presenter Jim Naughtie. Confused listeners tuned in to hear the actor, still in character as Poirot, meditate on life, death and how he had died by his own hand after committing a murder. 'I died with a feeling of great guilt, . because of what I have done', he told Naughtie. 'And I died asking my mon Dieu for . forgiveness because I had committed the ultimate crime of all.' SCROLL DOWN TO HEAR THE INTERVIEW . 'Bizarre interview': David Suchet and Radio 4's Jim Naughtie after an interview where the ghost of Hercule Poirot spoke about his life and death . Poirot admitted he never fell in love and said he hoped his fans believed he had 'rid it (the world) of a certain amount of disharmony and evil and made it perhaps, humbly, a much better place'. Unsurprisingly, people flocked to Twitter . to express their confusion with some admitting they were unsure if they . were 'still dreaming'. David Suchet made his final appearance as Poirot last night after starring in the ITV series for 25 years. In a virtuoso swansong, he shocked viewers by murdering a psychopath who was planning to kill again before committing suicide.

But these must-have Christmas toys have left many parents in a cold sweat over the past 50 years. The items were often in such high demand that shoppers struggled to find them in time for December 25. Cabbage Patch Dolls were a firm favourite in the list. Originally made in the eighties, the toys were relaunched in 2004 (left) Debenhams has compiled a list of the top ten Christmas toys of the past five decades, based on the store’s takings for them each year. Top of Santa’s deliveries were Cabbage Patch Kids dolls, the soft toys with pudgy faces, which today sell for up to £30. Created by American art student Xavier Roberts in 1978, they dominated toy charts through the 1980s and remain popular. The fiendishly difficult Rubik’s Cube took second place. The puzzle, invented in 1974 by Hungarian professor of architecture Erno Rubik, became a craze in British school playgrounds. The biggest selling toy in 1987, Sylvanian Families, made a slight comeback in the digital age. It claimed tenth place on the Debenham's list . The infuriatingly tricky Rubiks Cube invented in 1974 is still a popular choice according to the research . Third place went to Monopoly, the board game which can trace its roots back to 1903 when it was invented by an American woman, Lizzie Philips. Her goal was to create an educational tool to explain tax theory and it was not until 1933 that it was launched by Parker Brothers as a family game. It has been updated over the generations and even this year a new version, featuring big brand names like Coca-Cola and McDonald’s, is tipped to be a success. Behind Monopoly come Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle figures, also still popular, followed by a Buzz Lightyear robot figure from the Toy Story films. In 1996, the year the first film was released in the UK, the demand for Buzz Lightyear toys had parents touring high streets desperate to find one. It was a pattern followed in later years for the Teletubby soft toys from the popular pre-school BBC series and the owl-like Furby. Dolls inspired by the popular nineties television programme, Teletubbies, were also featured on the list put together by Debenhams . The original barbie 1959 (left) and a more recent model (right).

But the brand also maintains strong sales throughout the year. James Ford, toy buyer for Debenhams, said: ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Lego are still as popular today as they were when they first launched. 'These brands have stood the test of time.’ But he said there has been a shift towards hi-tech gifts, such as the £90 Kurio 4S touch tablet. Film and television characters such as Buzz Lightyear (left) and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (right) beat the shift towards high-tech gifts .

The closures will mean the loss of about a quarter of its 264 outlets and 2,000-strong workforce. Earlier this week the chain, which has been hit hard by competition from supermarkets, the internet and delivery services like LoveFilm, went into administration for the second time this year. A Blockbuster store in London in 2010. The firm announced today that 72 UK stores will close, axing 452 jobs . It was understood that employees were being told of the job losses this morning. The firm is holding talks with potential buyers for the remaining shops and a further update is due within the next week. In a statement, the administrators Moorfields Corporate . Recovery said: 'Over the past few days our focus has been to assess the financial situation of Blockbuster in order to try and find a buyer for the business. 'As part of this process, we are today regretfully announcing the closure of 72 stores across the United Kingdom and the loss of 452 jobs. 'This has not been an easy decision to make and we acknowledge that, with Christmas on the horizon, this will be extremely upsetting news to a large number of people, most of all those affected by the store closures. A branch which closed down in Chesham, Buckinghamshire, after the Blockbuster's initial collapse in January . 'We must reiterate that, as part of our attempts to turn around the business, today's decision is necessary if parts of Blockbuster are to be saved and a buyer found. 'Discussions with potential buyers for parts of the business continue and we hope to be in a position to update staff, creditors and customers shortly with a further statement within the next seven days.' VHS: The rise of DVDs soon ushered in a new digital era which left Blockbuster at a disadvantage . Launched in 1985 in Dallas, Texas, Blockbuster set up its UK arm in 1989 when it bought Europe's largest rental firm Ritz Video for $135 million. By the time it reached its peak in 2004, it had more than 9,000 stores and 60,000 employees globally. But the firm struggled against the rise of internet streaming and home delivery services like LoveFilm and Netflix. Blockbuster's UK arm collapsed in January - at which point it had 528 UK stores and 4,190 staff - and was mostly rescued by the private equity group Gordon Brothers Europe. Trading has not picked up enough since then for it to survive, the statement said. While the administrators say parts of the business have attracted interest, many buyers only want empty shops which they can turn into something else. Supermarket firm Morrisons bought 49 former outlets earlier this year as part of its convenience store expansion. The axe also fell on all 300 company-owned Blockbuster stores in the U.S. last week, leaving the once-dominant chain with just 50 franchised shops. In a grim coincidence, footwear retailer Barratts also went into administration on Monday - for the third time in five years - putting 1,035 jobs at risk. Which services no longer exist?

Apple is under investigation in Italy for allegedly hiding 1 billion euros from the local tax authority. Milan prosecutors say the technology giants failed to declare 206 million euros in 2010 and 853 million euros in 2011 according to judicial sources. The source also claimed that checks on the size of the tax amount owed by the iPad makers is under way and said that the Italian subsidiary of Apple booked some of its profit through . Irish-based subsidiary Apple Sales International (ASI) to lower its . taxable income in Italy. The new iPhone 5C: It is alleged that Apple, which makes the phones, has avoided paying required taxes in Italy . But the firm says that it pays all the tax money that it owes, and that checks have showed that it complies with Italian tax laws. A statement from Apple said: 'Apple pays every dollar and euro it owes in taxes and we are continuously audited by governments around the world. 'The Italian tax authorities already audited Apple Italy in 2007, 2008 and 2009 and confirmed that we were in full compliance with the OECD documentation and transparency requirements. 'We are confident the current review will reach the same conclusion.' Apple is the latest prominent corporation to become the target of a tax inquiry in Italy amid a global crackdown aimed at preventing companies such as Google, Amazon and others from avoiding taxes. In crisis-hit Italy, tax authorities faced with dwindling revenues have become more aggressive with domestic and multinational companies. In June, fashion designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana were handed a 20-month suspended prison sentence and a heavy fine for hiding hundreds of millions of euros in unpaid taxes. Both deny any wrongdoing. Italian Designers Domenico Dolce (right) and Stefano Gabbana (left) were handed suspended prison sentences over unpaid Italian tax. They denied any wrongdoing . An Italian tax source said: 'There is a global process under way and the Italian tax authority is one of the most active. 'In general, the focus is shifting towards multi-nationals that are able to lower their tax base through their international operations.' To try to fix public finances, Italy's largest ruling party, the center-left PD, has proposed legislation to oblige companies that advertise and sell online in Italy to do so only through agencies with a tax presence in Italy. The proposal, dubbed the Google Tax, is meant to combat a tendency by corporations to shift revenue out of Italy and into low-tax countries such as Luxembourg or Ireland. A US. Senate investigation in May revealed that Apple structured its operations so that the vast majority of its non-US. profits are reported in Ireland, by companies which, through an unusual feature of Irish tax law, are not tax resident in that country. ASI contracts with mainly Chinese companies to manufacture iPads and iPhones. ASI then sells these products to another Irish company which resells them to retail subsidiaries in Italy and other European countries. The pricing of the inter-company transactions ensures that the lion's share of the profit ends up with ASI, the Senate report said. Low profits in countries like Italy mean low tax payments there. Countries usually consider companies registered on their territory to be tax resident there but Irish law allows ASI to be tax resident nowhere. This means its profits go untaxed.","Profits allegedly booked through Irish-based subsidy to save money .

The number of supermarkets and convenience stores selling alcohol round the clock shot up last year, new figures showed yesterday. A record total of more than 2,000 outlets are now making cheap booze available to drinkers day and night, without any of the social or legal regulation that restrains yobbish behaviour in pubs and bars. The increase led to fresh worries about the impact of Labour’s licensing reforms, passed through Parliament a decade ago, which are blamed for damaging traditional pubs and their traditional restraints on bad behaviour among drinkers. The number of supermarkets and convenience stores selling alcohol round the clock shot up last year . The licensing figures released by the Home Office show that in the 12 months to the end of March the number of shops in England and Wales with 24-hour alcohol licences went up by five per cent to 2,100. In just three years the numbers have swelled by 400. The Home Office said that supermarkets and local stores now make up more than a quarter - 28 per cent - of all round-the-clock drink outlets. By contrast, only 918 pubs, bars or nightclubs have 24-hour licences. The Home Office added that the overall increase in premises with 24-hour licences had come about because supermarkets and convenience stores are ‘driving the trend’. Among the shop licences, 1,072 were for convenience stores and 963 for large supermarkets.The overall number of hotels, pubs, bars and stores with alcohol licences went up by 500, to 202,500. Earlier this autumn chief constables declared 24-hour drinking a failed experiment and they called for drunk tanks to be installed on the streets to mop up the mess. Officers said round-the-clock opening had caused ‘significant problems’ between 3am and 6pm and demanded changes to the licensing regime. The Association of Chief Police officers said the situation was so bad that private-sector run ‘drunk tanks’ should be introduced to care for the inebriated. Drunks should be charged up to £400-a-night, including a £100 on-the-spot fine, they said.Some analysts believe supermarkets and convenience stores contribute more to disorder than all-night bars in town centres, because their alcohol is cheaper and they impose no restraints on how it is consumed. Senior police officers have said the Coalition’s promise to reverse the worst effects of Labour’s round-the-clock opening have yet to pay dividends. Under a ‘late night levy’ scheme, councils can charge bars and pubs which want to open beyond midnight an extra fee of up to £4,440 each year, depending on their size. A record total of more than 2,000 outlets are now making cheap booze available to drinkers day and night . The cash is split between councils and police to help pay for clean-up costs and put extra officers on the street. But, one year after the new rules came into force, none of the planned zones are up and running.Since 24-hour came into operation in 2005, police have fined an estimated 400,000 people for being drunk and disorderly. The Daily Mail - backed by senior police, ambulance staff and judges - opposed the change. But Labour carried on regardless - claiming it would bring a peaceful, continental-style drinking culture to the UK. Since taking power, the Tories have tried to limit the harm caused by the policy. In addition to the levy, councils have new powers to impose a blanket ban on pubs opening in the early hours of the morning. However, ministers have stopped short of returning to the traditional closing time of 11pm or midnight. Eric Appleby of Alcohol Concern said yesterday: ‘Anyone can see that our licensing laws aren’t working, you only have to visit one of Britain’s high streets on a Friday or Saturday night to see that.‘We need a full scale review of all our licensing laws if we’re to make a change to our drinking culture.’","More than 2,000 outlets are now making cheap booze available to drinkers day and night .

At the same time, tubs of Cadbury’s Heroes are down from 800g to 780g, which equates to two or three fewer chocolate treats. The smaller sizes have not led to an equal reduction in the price with the result shoppers are being hit with what amounts to a stealth price rise.

So far the recovery has been driven by increased consumer spending and housing, with export demand still lagging. 'With the recovery taking hold, our task now is to secure it. We will continue the process of repairing the financial sector. Is Britain's economy back on track? 'And . we will continue to provide exceptional monetary stimulus so that . British households and businesses have, for the first time in a long . time, the confidence not just that the glass is half full, but that it will be filled.' Mr Carney stressed that hitting the 7 per cent target for unemployment would not trigger an automatic rise in interest rates. However, later Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg signalled that as the economy the historically low rates of 0.5 per cent would come to an end. Speaking at a Tesco store in West London, Mr Clegg said: 'I really don't think it helps for me to start trying to second guess how interest rates may or may not be set in the future. 'All I would say is that interest rates are at an unprecedentedly low level because of the unprecedented economic challenges the country has faced. 'We are going through abnormal times and so interest rates have been set at very unusually low levels. 'At some point we hope normal life will be resumed in all senses of the word.' Boast: David Cameron took to Twitter to express his delight at the good jobs nfigures . More than 18 per cent of people working part-time would like a full-time job, new figures show. The number of part-time workers stood at 7.89 million in July-September, of which 1.457million said they could not find full-time work - the highest figure since records began in 1992. The number of men in part-time employment increased by 41,000 to reach 2.15 million while the number for women fell by 22,000 to 5.94 million. Bank of England governor Mark Carney said: 'It is welcome that the economy is growing again, but a return to growth is not yet a return to normality. 'Nearly one million more people are out of work than in the years before the financial crisis. 'Many others in part time work would prefer to be working full time.' The number of people on the dole has fallen dramatically, down by 41,700 to reach 1.31 million in October. Since October last year the number of people claiming Jobseekers Allowance has fallen by 266,500, the largest annual fall since May 1998. David Cameron hailed the figures as evidence that the coalition’s economic strategy is paying dividends. ‘There are now 1.1m more people in work since the election - more proof our long-term plan for Britain is working,’ he wrote on Twitter. However, 1.46 million people are working part-time because they could not find a full-time job, an increase of 24,000 over the quarter, and the highest figure since records began in 1992. Almost a third of working men are in . part-time employment because they cannot find a full-time job, compared . to 13 per cent of women. Chancellor George Osborne struck a cautious note last night, telling the Telegraph Festival of Business: 'I think we are on the path for prosperity, I think we have got the fundamentals right. We have got an economic plan which is delivering what very many countries in the world would crave, which is certainty, stability and competitiveness. 'It is making this country a much more competitive place to do business. But we have to deliver that plan and there is still a lot to be done. There is a huge amount to be done to reduce the deficit.' Year-on-year price rises continue to outstrip pay increases, new figures show . Pressures on family finances continues, with pay rising by just 0.7 per cent, compared to the 2.2 per cent rise in living costs as tracked by the Consumer Prices Index. The Bank of England said inflation is on course to fall back to around its 2 per cent target 'over the next year or so' after figures yesterday showed it fell to 2.2 per cent in October, a 13-month low. The gap between pay in the public and private sector has narrowed. In September 2013 average pay in the private sector was £473 a week, £14 a week lower than the public sector figure of £487 a week. Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, said: ‘Today’s fall in unemployment is welcome, but families facing a cost-of-living crisis need a recovery that benefits them, and these figures show we are still far from achieving that.’ TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'Britain's workforce is getting larger but poorer. 'It is encouraging that more jobs are being created but job quality is falling and close to a 20-year low. A record number of people are stuck in part-time jobs because they can't find full-time work, while real wages continue to shrink fast despite falling inflation. 'We need better jobs and healthier pay rises to tackle the living standards crisis and ensure that the full benefits of recovery reach working people.'","Upbeat Bank of England increase growth forecast for 2013 to 1.6% .

It works by . exploiting an existing method for printing liquid crystal lasers with . inkjet printers, which gives the user a very precise level of control . over the laser’s pattern and colour combination. The . detector takes advantage of this by shining a second, laser pulse onto . the printed one. It then reads the wavelength of the light emission . from the printed laser through a piece of dedicated software and reproduces that . reading as a pattern on a spectrograph.

It was loaded with 11 bullets, however none were in the chamber, police said. She was arrested and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and held on a $1,500 bond . An internal investigation decided Justice would be suspended without pay for three days, pending any further disciplinary decisions. According to local police, Justice yelled at Metz - a long-time journalist for WESH-TV who didn't have a microphone or camera in hand - to get off her property in Jungle Rd, New Smyrna Beach, at about 12.30pm on Tuesday. 'When Justice answered the knock, she pointed a gun at the reporter's head through the exterior storm door and yelled at the reporter to get off of her property,' a statement from the Volusia County Sheriff's Office said. Metz quickly backed away, telling Justice to calm down, she told KSN.

Mr Beaty served with 2nd Battalion Scots Guards in the Falklands where he pulled a wounded colleague Steve Duffy to safety during a heavy Argentinian bombardment . He added: 'His is one of the many untold stories of valour and courage in the face of adversity. It was strangely appropriate that I was there with him on Sunday. 'He was courageous and unselfish to the end being more concerned with not letting his colleagues in the band or the parade down rather than look after himself.' Mr Beaty lived with his wife Diane, 52, and three children, Claire, Lynn and Max. Mr Duffy said: 'He had huge enthusiasm for everything he did and his infectious and mischievous humour endeared him to everyone that he met.

The security consultant who told CBS that he was inside the American consulate during the attack in Benghazi has now gone into hiding over death threats. 60 Minutes aired a segment on November 2 based on the story that Dylan Davies told them- saying that he fought off a terrorist and saw the dead body of Ambassador Chris Stevens- that they were forced to retract after it was proved to be false. Davies stood by his story even though it was not the same version of events he told both his employer and the FBI, but his book publisher has already stopped selling it in light of the findings that emerged last week. Now Davies has gone into hiding and does not know when he will emerge. In hiding: Dylan Davies told a story that has now been proved to be false during a 60 Minutes interview and has since received death threats against his family . The Daily Beast reports that on the same day that they decided to pull his book from the shelves, he sent an email to his publisher saying that he was sent a hand-delivered note to his home in Wales threatening his family. Sunday November 2: 60 Minutes airs their segment where Lara Logan interviews Dylan Davies- then going by his pseudonym Morgan Jones . Monday November 3: Davies receives a hand-delivered note to his home in south Wales threatening his family . Friday November 8: Davies sends an email to his publisher saying he is going into hiding. Lara Logan makes an apology and retracts their story that morning. Simon & Schuster announces that they will be pulling his book. He told Jennifer Robinson, the vice president of Simon & Schuster, that he received a note at 4am on November 3 that read: 'Stop talking now or your wife and son will disappear.' 'Due to this threat I will not discuss the book with anyone under any circumstances for the foreseeable future, I am not prepared to put my family in danger. I stand by my story however I understand that it continues to be rubbished, which I expected,' he wrote in the email. The book, The Embassy House, had already been on sale online and an unknown number of people had already bought the book. Simon & Schuster announced Friday afternoon that 'in light of information that has been brought to our attention' they will no longer be selling it. The Daily Beast reports that the local police chief confirmed that a threat is being investigated in connection to Mr Davies and his family. Apology on Nov.8 : Lara Logan said that they were wrong to air her interview with a man called Dylan Davies who, it has since been revealed, lied about his role on the night of the attacks on the American mission to Benghazi . After the CBS segment originally aired, reporter Lara Logan was forced to make a public apology following further investigation because it became clear that there were discrepencies in his story. Pulled: The publisher announced on Friday that it will stop selling Davies' book . The network initially stood by him- believing his claims that he was the subject of a slander attack by the State Department- but scrutiny by other news outlets proved too compelling for them not to launch their own investigation, and, eventually, admit their mistake. ‘The most important thing to every person at 60 Minutes is the truth, and today the truth is we made a mistake. That's very disappointing for any journalist, that's very disappointing for me,’ Logan said when she gave an on-air mea culpa during CBS This Morning. ‘Nobody likes to admit that they made a mistake, but if you do, you have to stand up and take responsibility and you have to say that you were wrong and in this case we were wrong.’ During the original interview, Davies- who went by the pseudonym that he used while writing a book about his version of events, Morgan Jones- said that he scaled a 12 foot wall and fought off a terrorist when he arrived at the consulate on the evening of the attack. ‘The most important thing to every person at 60 Minutes is the truth, and today the truth is we made a mistake.

He also said he saw the dead body of the American ambassador . During the original interview, Davies- who went by the pseudonym that he used while writing a book about his version of events, Morgan Jones- said that he scaled a 12 foot wall and fought off a terrorist when he arrived at the consulate on the evening of the attack. ‘His boss is someone he cared about enormously. He cared about his American counterparts in the mission that night, and when his boss told him not to go, he couldn't stay back. So that was always part of the record for us,’ Logan said. She made it clear that what they did not know was that Davies had given that account to the FBI in their incident report. His involvement with the FBI report came via The Washington Post after the 60 Minutes piece aired, and Logan said that when they confronted him over the claims, he denied it. Logan said that they have since tried contacting Davies about the situation and they have not been able to get in touch with him. ‘We were misled and we were wrong and that's the important thing and that's what we have to say here: we have to set the record straight and take responsibility,’ she said.

Residents of several Florida homes have been evacuated due to a sinkhole that opened up in a Dunedin, Florida backyard, near St Petersburg Thursday. Dunedin Deputy Fire Chief Trip Barrs said the hole appeared to be about 12-feet wide when officials arrived on the scene around 6am, but grew to 40-feet-wide and 30-feet-deep by 9am. Residents of seven neighboring houses were evacuated as a precaution and power has been shut off in the area. No injuries have been reported. Scroll down for video . Into the earth: A sinkhole opened up this morning in Dunedin, Florida, swallowing up parts of two homes . Expanding: When fire and rescue responders arrived on the scene around 6am, the sinkhole was 12-feet-wide but soon grew to 40-feet-wide and 30-feet-deep . Breakfast: The sinkhole gobbled up a boat, pool and one home's master bedroom. No one was injured from the sinkhole . Homeowner Michael Dupre said they heard the sinkhole open up in their backyard around 5:15 this morning. 'It sounded like banging against the windows. I thought someone was trying to break-in,' his daughter Ivy Dupre told Fox 13. Ivy Dupre said that there seemed to be two sinkholes, one that opened up in the backyard and one near her bedroom, but that has not yet been confirmed by fire and rescue officials. The sinkhole has swallowed up the master bedroom and in-ground pool of one home, while another home lost their deck and boat. After the sinkhole opened up, the Dupre's called 911. Fire and rescue officials told them to grab whatever they could and get out of the home. Sinkhole alley: Sinkholes are common in this area of Florida, nicknamed 'sinkhole alley' for the type of porous rocks that cause the earth to shift . 'We grabbed only the important stuff. Insurance information - stuff like that,' Mr Dupre said. 'You don't really think about this kind of stuff happening.' Sinkholes are common in Florida because the peninsula is made up of porous carbonate rocks such as limestone that store and help move water underground.

When relatives of James ‘Whitey’ Bulger’s many victims finally got a chance to address him in court during today’s sentencing hearing, they held nothing back, hurling abuse at the 84-year-old convicted killer. At least a dozen family members of people Bulger was convicted of executing were expected to speak at the two-day hearing. The first to do so was Sean McGonagle, the son of Bulger victim Paul McGonagle. He called Bulger ‘Satan,’ a ‘domestic terrorist’ and a ‘sad, lonely and irrelevant old man.’ In this courtroom sketch, convicted murderer James 'Whitey' Bulger sits at his . sentencing hearing in federal court in Boston with his face turned away . from the testifying relatives . Emotional: Steven Davis, second right, brother of slain Debra Davis, is comforted by his wife, right, as he testifies . Bulger, wearing an orange prison . jumpsuit, stared down at the papers littering the defense table and did . not look at victims' relatives as they spoke. Monster: Former mob boss and fugitive James 'Whitey' Bulger, 84, was called a 'little sociopath' and 'Satan' by his victims' relatives and prosecutors during the sentencing phase of his trial . When asked by the judge if he wished to address the court, the mobster curtly replied, ‘No.’ The . octogenarian was convicted in August in a broad indictment that . included racketeering charges in a string of murders in the 1970s and . '80s, as well as extortion, money-laundering and weapons charges. Assistant . U.S. Attorney Brian Kelly called Bulger a ‘little sociopath’ as he . urged a judge to sentence the infamous South Boston gangster to life in . prison. ‘The defendant has . committed one heinous crime after another,’ the prosecutor said. ‘The . carnage that he has caused is grotesque.’ His attorneys said he refused to . provide any information to probation officials preparing a report for . Judge Denise Casper, who will sentence him Thursday morning. Closure: Steve Davis, brother of murder victim Debra Davis, said in court today that he would have like to strangle Bulger so he could feel what his sister felt in her last moments . Devastating outcome: In August, jurors could not agree whether Bulger was involved in the 1982 killing of Steven Davis' sister, Debra . Attorney J.W. Carney Jr. said he would make no sentencing recommendation because his client believed his trial was a sham. Bulger also called his trial a sham in August after he was not allowed to use as a defense his claim that a now-deceased federal prosecutor gave him immunity to commit crimes. He did not testify. The federal jury that convicted Bulger found prosecutors proved he played a role in 11 of 19 murders. Jurors found the government had not proven Bulger participated in seven other killings and were unable to reach a verdict in another. But Casper ruled Wednesday that relatives of all 19 people can speak at the sentencing too, despite objections from Bulger's attorneys. Widow: Patricia Donahue, wife of Michael Donahue, center, arrives for James Bulger's sentencing hearing . Defiant: Attorney J.W. Carney Jr., left, said he would make no sentencing recommendation because his client believed his trial was a 'sham' Opposties: Jack Bulger, brother of convicted mobster James Bulger, leaves the courthouse (left); David Wheeler, son of murder victim Roger Wheeler, talks to reporters . Bulger, the former head of the Winter Hill Gang, fled Boston in 1994 ahead of an indictment and spent more than 16 years as a fugitive before being captured in Santa Monica, Calif., in 2011. In court Wednesday, emotions ran high as sobbing and enraged widows and children of those Bulger had killed in the course of his long career as a mobster offered their impact statements. Sean . McGonagle addressed Bulger as 'Satan' before recalling in 1974 how the . defendant had murdered his father, Paul, when Sean was 11 years old. 'In . 1975, you called and said ""Your father is not coming home for . Christmas."" When asked who this is, you stated, ""Santa Claus,""' McGonagle said. 'Today I hope we find some semblance of peace and . closure.' Painful memories: Sean McGonagle addressed Bulger as 'Satan' before recalling in 1974 how the defendant had murdered his father . Steven Davis, whose sister Debra was allegedly strangled to death by Bulger in 1981, said that he would have liked to repay her accused killer in kind. 'This man has built up so much hate in my heart I’d like to strangle him myself,' a sobbing Davis said. 'I hope Whitey dies the same way my sister did - gasping for breath.' In August, the jury was unable to reach a verdict in Debra Davis' killing. Patrick Callahan, whose father was killed by an assassin on Bulger's orders in 1982, called the criminal a 'coward' for refusing to turn around and face him and other witnesses, Boston.com reported. Better days: Whitey Bulger wrote in a recent . letter from prison that the 16 years he spent on the run with his . girlfriend Catherine Greig were the best of his life (pictured together . here in an undated photo) Spotted: Greig and Bulger were captured in 2011 in their then-apartment in Santa Monica, California . David Wheeler, son of Roger Wheeler, . held up a picture of his slain father as he called Bulger a 'punk' and . stated that he and his family have nothing but contempt for him. 'And you don’t even matter anymore,' Wheeler said. 'You're a bag of jailhouse rags on cold steel.' The . aggrieved relative also had some choice words for the FBI, saying that . corruption within the agency was as much to blame for his father's death . as was Bulger. ‘The . government claimed that my family was at fault. The FBI won the first . round, but they won't win the second,' he said, adding that he lost his . faith in the American government. Marie . Mahoney, daughter of William O'Brien, was 11 years old when her father . was killed some four decades ago. She recalled crying for months when . the family got the news. Bulger's story has captivated the city for years. He rose from a South Boston housing project to become the most feared person in the city at the same time as his brother, William, became the president of the Massachusetts state Senate. Traveling man: Bulger, seen here in an . undated photo that was shown at his trial, was on the run from about . 1995 to 2011 but now he will spend the rest of his life behind bars . Helped by a relationship with a . corrupt FBI agent who shared Bulger's Irish ancestry and was willing to . turn a blind eye to his crimes in exchange for information on the . Italian-American Mafia, Bulger ruled violently over Boston's criminal . world. In 1994, on a tip that arrest was imminent, he fled the city.

The changes have been in place in the US since November 1, but the European Aviation Safety Authority announced that it is to follow suit this week. Devices were allowed on some European aircraft in the past, but only at certain stages of the flight amid concerns over safety.

European planes, including the Airbus A380 will soon offer passengers the opportunity to use mobile phones and other gadgets during take-off and landing . Airlines who want to offer the service for the first time will now have to install technology onto the planes to enable devices to be used. Some companies may choose to charge passengers if they want to use their mobile phones, laptops or other gadgets while on board. Iilias Maragakis, policy officer at the European Aviation Safety Agency, said: 'What is important is that we give European airlines the ability to use new technology.

Simon Cowell's pregnant girlfriend Lauren Silverman reached a divorce settlement with estranged husband Andrew in August, and now new details of the rather unusual agreement have emerged. The terms included a clause that states the X Factor mogul cannot go near Lauren's son Adam, aged seven, until January 2015, according to TMZ. If he does, Lauren will be fined $50,000. A spokesperson for Lauren declined to comment to MailOnline. TMZ also reported on Thursday the exes are using mutual friend Sir Philip Green, the billionaire CEO of the Arcadia Group, as well as attorney Martin Edelman to settle any future disputes over the next five years. From friends to foes: On Thursday TMZ reported Andrew Silverman (left) doesn't want his son Adam, aged seven, to be around his old pal - and now ex-wife's soon-to-be baby daddy - Simon Cowell (right) until 2015 . Also, if Lauren allows her son and Simon to interact three times, she will lose all contact with her child until a court decides what to do. Andrew and Simon used to be friends, and the New York City businessman is allegedly so upset that his pal has romanced and impregnated his wife (she's six months along) that he added a few other unusual clauses into his divorce. Lauren has to make sure her son doesn't call Simon - who UsWeekly claimed this week has a ring and will propose to the Manhattan beauty next year - 'father.' Andrew has to make sure the child doesn't call anyone but Lauren 'mother.' Baby (and ring?) in 2014: UsWeekly reported Simon (seen here with his pregnant lady love in September) will pop the question next year . The man in the middle: Sir Philip Green, seen here in September, will help Andrew and Lauren settle any issues that come up over the next five years . TMZ also reports, 'The settlement agreement also provides Andrew cannot trash Simon to Adam and has a legal obligation to make sure no one else around him talks smack.' As far as child support, Andrew is paying his socialite ex only $3,000 a month. The site speculates that 'Simon will become the cash cow.' The British TV personality is reportedly worth $370m. Finally, Lauren and Andrew altered the the cause of divorce from adultery to 'broken down irretrievably.' Simon, who was spotted with Lauren in West Hollywood on Wednesday evening, has never looked happier. News that Simon had impregnated Lauren broke in late July when the beauty was 10 weeks along. E! reported Lauren, Andrew and Simon had been longtime friends, having met on a vacation years ago. In 2012 the trio was photographed looking like very close friends while aboard a yacht. But in early 2013 a romance reportedly blossomed between the reality icon and the stunning brunette. 'He was friends with Lauren and her husband but things developed between them,' E!'s source explains. 'Lauren and her husband had a messy split and Simon became a shoulder to cry on for her.'

Controversial union giant Unite handed Labour almost £800,000 after Ed Miliband dropped his inquiry into claims it had been involved in vote-rigging. Official figures yesterday revealed that Unite donated £777,740 a fortnight after the Labour leader reinstated two union members who had been suspended over allegations of trying to fix the selection of a new parliamentary candidate in the safe seat of Falkirk. The huge cheque was almost a quarter of the £3.1million donated to the party in the third quarter of this year. The Unite union, run by Len McCluskey, was Labour's biggest donor in the third quarter of 2013, despite the public spat with Ed Miliband (right) over allegations of vote-rigging in Falkirk . Labour sources insisted there was . ‘absolutely no link’ between the donation and the dropping of the . inquiry into the Falkirk scandal. A source said the cash was a regular . instalment of affiliation fees taken from union members’ subs. But . Tory chairman Grant Shapps seized on the payment as evidence that Mr . Miliband is compromised by his financial dependence on Unite and its . militant boss Len McCluskey. Mr . Shapps said: ‘Despite Ed Miliband’s promises of change, nothing has . changed. The union bosses still buy the policies, fix the selections and . pick the leader. It’s the same old Labour. ‘If . Ed Miliband is serious about standing up to Len McCluskey, he should . reopen his inquiry into the Unite union’s attempt to fix the Labour . Party selection in Falkirk. If he’s too weak to  govern his party, Ed . Miliband is too weak to govern the country.’ A . Labour source said the bumper payment was a regular instalment of . affiliation fees, adding: ‘These payments are made on a scheduled basis . at agreed times throughout the year, unrelated to any other matter.’ The . source went on: ‘There is absolutely no link. Throughout the Falkirk . matter our motivation has always been, and will continue to be, to . uphold the integrity of the Labour Party.’ The . party faced further discomfort over the Falkirk scandal yesterday after . leaked emails suggested Labour’s general secretary Iain McNicol had . struck a secret deal with Mr McCluskey to allow the union to sign up new . members in the constituency in the run-up to the selection meeting. Unite is alleged to have signed up a number of local people in Falkirk . as Labour members without their knowledge. The . emails show that Unite’s favoured candidate Karie Murphy, who is . employed as office manager for Labour’s former deputy chairman Tom . Watson, was pushing for these new members to be formally recognised by . the party in time for the selection meeting. She . said a deal had been ‘agreed’ between ‘Lennie’ and Mr McNicol for their . direct debit details to be collected after the selection process had . taken place. David Cameron's Conservatives received the most donations in the three-month period, with a total of £3,275,185 . In July, Mr Miliband attacked the selection process in Falkirk for fuelling ‘growing mistrust in politics’. But . an internal inquiry was dropped in September after evidence was . ‘withdrawn’. Mr Miliband has ruled out reopening the inquiry, despite a . string of fresh allegations, saying it is time to ‘move on’. Yesterday’s . donation figures from the Electoral Commission show Mr Miliband remains . heavily dependent on the unions, which gave Labour £2.6million in the . third quarter – equal to 75 per cent of its total donations. The . figures also reveal that Labour has had its overdraft limit cut to just . £90,000 after  running up debts totalling £12.3million. By comparison, the Tories now have an overdraft limit of  £10million, along with debts of just under £1.8million. The . largest Conservative donors were Addison Lee taxi boss John Griffin, . with £500,000, City financier Michael Farmer, with £250,000, and . investment banker James Lupton, with £250,000. The party also received . £14,000 from Scottish Power, which angered customers last month by . increasing bills by 8.6 per cent. Labour . shadow Cabinet Office minister Michael Dugher said: ‘It looks like big . money donations get you a seat at the Prime Minister’s top table.

Liberal Democrats received £798,408 in donations, including £167,000 . from the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust. Other donors included the London .

A man who sneaked into a tanning salon to spy on a half-naked women as she used a sunbed has been banned from entering beauty salons throughout the UK. Craig Moorhouse, 29, hid in a cubicle at Kwik Tan in Castleford, West Yorkshire, while a woman undressed to her underwear, a court heard. Magistrates in Wakefield heard how Moorhouse, who was a member at the salon, was traced by police after staff reviewed CCTV footage which showed him entering the cubicle before the victim. The woman heard the cubicle's door open when Moorhouse left, and reported the incident to management. The 29-year-old admitted voyeurism, saying 'I might have been hoping to get sexually aroused' when asked why he went into the cubicle. Moorhouse however claimed he did not watch the woman undress and hadn't taken pictures of her while he was in the room, saying he was sure she would have felt 'disgusted and sickened' if she'd known he was there. The court heard the woman told police officers: 'I just can’t get it out of my head that another person has seen my body without my consent. 'I feel horrible and fat and look at myself thinking I’m really ugly.' Prosecutor Laurie Scott told the court the victim suffered a lack of sleep and was prone to waking up with 'palpitations'. 'I’m extremely nervous about staying in the house alone. Each time someone passes the window I feel they might be looking in at me,' the court heard. The 29-year-old who was also a member at Kwik Tan in Castleford said he was 'very sorry' about the incident .

Prosecutors today asked for Amanda Knox to be jailed for 30 years during a retrial into the murder of her former housemate Meredith Kercher in Italy. Knox is being judged in absentia for the 2007 murder of the British student as she has now returned to the U.S. Prosecutors at the trial also requested that her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito be given 26 years, saying the punishment should be harsher for Knox because she initially accused someone else of the crime. Amanda Knox's (right) retrial for the murder of former housemate Meredith Kercher (left) has been done in absentia as she returned to the U.S. Italian prosecutors have called for a 26-year jail sentence for Raffaele Sollecito, right, and 30 years for Knox . Knox and Sollecito have already served four years in prison for the murder of Miss Kercher, who was found half-naked in a pool of blood on November 2, 2007 in the house she shared with Knox. The pair, who have always protested their innocence, were acquitted on appeal in 2011 but the supreme court earlier this year overturned that ruling, sending the case back to the appeals stage at a court in Florence. The retrial is expected to reach a verdict in January. Knox is now back in the U.S. and experts say it is highly unlikely that she could ever be extradited even if she is convicted and even if that conviction is upheld in another appeal to the supreme court. Rudy Guede, a local petty thief and drug . dealer, has been convicted separately and is serving a 16-year sentence . for the gruesome murder which shocked the university town of Perugia and . has divided opinions. Prosecutor Alessandro Crini told the . court today that the DNA evidence, which is highly disputed in the . case, showed that Sollecito and Knox had stabbed Kercher while Guede . sexually assaulted her. Prosecutor Alessandro Crini told Florence's Justice Palace that DNA evidence found on a kitchen knife prove Sollecito and Knox stabbed Miss Kercher to death . Crini . said he believed Knox had used a large kitchen knife that was later . found by investigators in Sollecito's home, pointing to faint DNA traces . of Kercher found on the blade and of Knox on the handle. He said the sexual element became 'marginal' as the drug-fuelled violence increased. 'They were trying to get rid of someone who had to be shut up,' Crini said. Knox during one interrogation accused Patrick Lumumba, the owner of a bar where she worked as a waitress, of being in the house at the time of the murder. But Crini said a phone wiretap had overheard Knox telling her mother that Lumumba was not there. 'What gave her the certainty if not the fact that she was there?' Crini asked, saying that the young woman's version of what happened had 'little credibility'. Meredith Kercher was killed at this house in Perugia, Italy, in November 2007 . Crini said Knox claimed she had returned to the house after sleeping at Sollecito's when Kercher was already dead but claimed she had not noticed anything and even showered in a bathroom dirty with Kercher's blood. He also said Knox's initial and later retracted statement to police that she had heard 'a scream and violence' in the house 'contained elements of truth'. 'Where do these elements come from if not having been directly involved in the incident?' he said. Crini also said that Sollecito's claim that he spent most of the evening at home on his computer was not backed up by analysis of the computer. Criticising the previous appeals court ruling that acquitted Knox and Sollecito, Crini said it had made the mistake of 'isolating' individual pieces of evidence without looking at the full picture. The supreme court had 'wiped out' that ruling, he said.","Knox is being retried in absentia for murder of her former housemate in 2007 .

Ban: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling will stop officers from giving 'slap on the wrist' cautions to repeat offenders . Nearly 5,000 thugs, shoplifters and vandals have received multiple police cautions for similar offences within just two years, figures have revealed. Ministry of Justice figures show that 4,763 adults received two or more cautions for identical or similar offences in the two years to March 31. They included around 1,500 people who committed common assaults, 750 drugs offenders, 500 shoplifters and 700 people guilty of criminal damage. But Justice Secretary Chris Grayling yesterday announced plans to ban officers from giving out the so-called ‘slaps on the wrist’ to repeat offenders. Victims campaigners have long . complained that police cautions are overused and allow too many . criminals to escape formal justice. A simple caution means that the . offender receives no punishment, and a record of their offending is kept . only for a limited period of time. The only requirement is that they . accept their guilt. Ministers have already announced plans to abolish simple cautions for serious offences including rape and robbery. Last night Mr Grayling said: ‘The . current range of out of court disposals are confusing and the system is . overly bureaucratic, that is why we are reviewing all out of court . disposals. 'They should be consistent, straightforward and something in . which victims and the wider public can have confidence.’ Ministry of Justice figures show a . total of 4,763 adult criminals received two or more cautions for the . same or similar offences in the two years to March 31 this year. Changes to the law brought in next . year will mean officers cannot give out a second caution for a similar . offence within two years. Only in exceptional circumstances will it be allowed - and must be signed off by an officer of Inspector rank. Magistrates and victims groups will . also be given new powers to inspect how forces give out cautions to make . sure they are not used excessively. Soft touch no more: Police officers will be stopped from routinely giving offenders a second caution for similar offences within two years . The decision follow a major review of . cautioning conducted by the Ministry of Justice. Also under review are . spot fines and cannabis warnings. Earlier this year Mr Grayling warned . spot fines had allowed gangs of yobs to commit crime and anti-social . behaviour ‘regardless of the consequences’. He said thugs even put aside cash to . pay the penalty notices, then carry on offending, and claimed high . streets have become ‘fair game’ for low level offenders who make life a . misery for the public. Lynne Owens, of the Association of . Chief Police Officers, said: ‘It is in everyone’s interests that the . justice system is as simple and clear to understand as possible. 'The current range of out of court disposals is too complicated and bureaucratic - we recommended and support its review. ‘It is important that there is room . for officer discretion in any system to ensure the punishment is . proportionate to the offence. Criminal justice minister Damian . Green said: ‘The current police guidance for dealing with crimes . on-the-spot has evolved over time and is totally disjointed, no wonder . we see a dramatic variation in their use. ‘That is why we are clamping down on . the use of cautions and reviewing the whole spectrum of out of court . disposals so we have clarity and consistency and most importantly we . have a system that victims and the public have confidence in.’ The review of all out of court disposals is set to conclude in spring 2014.","Chris Grayling announced a ban on repeat offenders being given cautions .

A Southern California man standing trial for a grisly revenge massacre on the family of his ex-girlfriend said he was 'high on drugs' when he made threats against them and 'didn't want to kill them'. Iftekhar Murtaza, 29, is accused of stabbing and beating his ex-girlfriend's father and sister to death, slashing her mother's throat and burning down the family's Orange County home in May 2007. Murtaza said he had been 'upset' after being dumped by his girlfriend, then-18-year-old Shayona Dhanak, in March of 2007 because her parents had threatened to stop paying her college tuition if she continued seeing him. Delusional: Prosecutors said Murtaza was hoping that after the attack, his ex-girlfriend would see him as a 'white knight' and come back to him. She allegedly broke up with him because she was Hindu and he Muslim . Dhanak's parents were practicing Hindus and told her Murtaza and his Muslim family came from a line of 'beggars and servants'. He . is alleged to have started planning a murder plot, which involved . paying a friend $30,000 to assist him in killing Dhanak's parents, so he . could be with her. Murtaza . said he went home after the break-up, took ecstasy and starting chatting . with a friend online about how he wished Dhanak's parents were dead. 'I didn't want to kill them,' he told the court, according to Fox News. 'It was just a figure of speech. 'I was frustrated, I was upset. I just wished they would accept me. 'It's almost like I am not human to them, based on the family that I was born into.' Murtaza said he repeated his wish that the Dhanaks would die or disappear to dozens of friends out of his sense of frustration and despair and that his relationship would be fine if not for them. However the prosecution said that, in reality, Dhanak wanted to end the relationship with Murtaza because he had become controlling and violent. Inferno: This is all that was left of the Dhanka family's mansion in Anaheim Hills, California, which was burned down after becoming the scene of a double homicide . Alleged killer: Leela Dhanak testified how Iftekhar Murtaza, seen in this August photo, murdered her husband and elder daughter in a failed attempt to win over her younger daughter . Bloodbath: Autopsy reports showed Jayprakash Dhanak (left) suffered 29 stab wounds to his body, while a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak (right) was alive when her throat was slit and her body set alight . Murtaza's testimony came following . weeks of testimony by witnesses for the prosecution, including Shayona . Dhanak and her mother Leela, who survived the attack. Leela Dhanak broke down on the stand as she talked about still hearing her spouse’s screams of terror in her sleep years later. Mrs Dhanak told the Orange County courtroom that she was attacked when she came home in May 2007 and fell unconscious, according to the Orange Country Register. She was found on the front lawn of a neighbors property by police, who had responded to a fire at Mrs Dhanak's home. The woman woke up from a coma three weeks later to discover the family’s Anaheim Hills mansion had been burned, and her husband, 56-year-old Jaypraykash Dhanak, and elder daughter, Karishma Dhanak, 20, killed. Last month, a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak was alive when her throat was slit and her body was doused with gasoline and set on fire. Autopsy results showed Jayprakash Dhanak suffered 29 stab wounds to his body. He also had his skull fractured, resulting in a fatal brain injury. Their bodies had been found in a park in Irvine about two miles from the University of California dorn where Shayona Danak lived. Several days after the killings, Murtaza was interviewed by police. The next day, prosecutors say he was arrested at the airport in Phoenix with a ticket to his native Bangladesh and more than $11,000 in cash. Ball and chain: In 2011, Murtaza (left) tied the knot with fellow suspected murderer Marissa Star Bilotti (right), 20, in a jailhouse ceremony where the newlyweds were separated by a chain-link fence . He was expected to return to the witness stand Wednesday. Two of Murtaza's friends have been convicted of the killings and one of them has been sentenced to life in prison. During her testimony, Mrs Dhanak admitted she didn't particularly like Murtaza, but had her daughter truly loved him, she would have supported the young couple. ‘She was too young to fall in love with any guys,’ she told the court. In June 2011, Murtaza married 20-year-old suspected murderer Marissa Star Bilotti in a jailhouse ceremony after exchanging letters for five months. Bilotti is charged with first-degree murder, burglary, and robbery. She faces 32 years to life in prison for helping a friend, Derek Christopher Adams, murder a man in 2010.","Iftekhar Murtaza, 29, is on trial in California in connection to a fiery attack on the Dhanak family in Orange County in 2007 .

The Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin in Wauwatosa reported an 'active shooter' on the seventh floor in the neonatal unit around noon on Thursday. Milwaukee Police officers were apparently conducting a warrant pickup for a man who was . wanted for 'felon in possession of a firearm' while he was holding a baby. Scroll down for video . A distraught couple talk to an emergency responder on the scene of a shooting at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin on Thursday . The Children's Hospital of Wisconsin in Wauwatosa reported an 'active shooter' on the seventh floor around noon on Thursday but had since been given the all-clear . When he was told he was under arrest, the suspect fled and ran down a hallway pulling out a handgun, according to Fox. He turned to the officers and showed the handgun several times. The number of shots fired by the suspect was not revealed. Officers fired several times and wounded the suspect. He was taken to Froedtert Hospital in a stable condition. Police officers attempted to arrest a felon in the neonatal ward on Thursday before he took off running down the hall. He was shot by officers but his injuries are non-life threatening . The mother and baby involved in the incident were fine, according to police and no hospital staff or officers were injured. Sheriff Clarke would not comment on the appropriateness of trying to pick up a wanted man for a gun offense in a children's ward. He said: 'It's too early to be second-guessing... Here's a better question: ''What is this idiot doing in a neonatal care unit with a handgun?''' The sheriff said that the hospital does not have metal detectors to search visitors for weapons. The hospital has now been given the all clear and tweeted: 'Law enforcement has issued an all-clear for all Children's Hospital buildings. There is no danger to patients, families or employees.' Sheriff Clarke said outside the hospital that no one other than the suspect had been wounded in the neonatal unit . Sheboygan resident Chad Starkey, 29, said he was on the seventh floor and down the hall from his son's room when he heard an announcement over the loud speaker that there was someone on the floor with a gun and that staff and visitors should hide and barricade themselves. 'My first thought was to protect my son,' Mr Starkey said. He, his wife and a few nurses hid in a small closet for about 30 minutes. The whole time, he said, he worried someone might hurt his son. 'This is a disgrace. This hospital has to have some kind of security. If one person can get in with a gun, then anyone can,' Mr Starkey said. Irma Blazek, an interpreter, was in the cafe on the first floor of the hospital when she heard a code for an active shooter over the loudspeaker. Blazek said she and 10 to 15 other people hid in a stairwell for over an hour. 'It was just bizarre,' Ms Blazek said. 'This is the last place you would think something g like this would happen.' Mike Sanfellippo, 39, of Random Lake, was in the hospital with his 11-year-old son who was being treated and on crutches. Sanfellippo said they were ready to leave for the parking lot, but were sent to an administrative building across the street after being told of the lockdown. Sanfellippo said his first instinct was to 'get the hell out of here and protect the kid'.","Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin in .

The Princess Royal has suggested Britons should consider eating horse meat – because it would improve standards of care for  the animals. Princess Anne said those in the trade ‘value their horses and look after them well’. She added: ‘Should we be considering a real market for horse meat and would that reduce the number of welfare cases if there was a real value in the horse meat sector?’ Princess Anne has suggested people in Britain should consider eating horse meat as it would help to improve the welfare of the animals. Above, the royal with a horse, Annie, she rehomed last month . Rescue centres have seen a rise of up to 40 per cent in admissions since it was revealed in January that some supermarket food labelled as beef contained horse. Experts say there are owners who let their horses breed indiscriminately then become overwhelmed with the numbers produced. But whereas the unwanted horses might once have gone to the meat trade, now their owners abandon them rather than pay up to £100 a week to care for and feed them. Speaking at the annual conference of . the World Horse Welfare charity in London yesterday, the former eventing . champion said owners might take better care of their horses when they . were alive if they thought they could later sell them for meat. Her . comments come after the scandal in January when it emerged horse meat . was present in products from a number of UK supermarkets including Asda, . Tesco and Iceland. It was later revealed that horses from countries such as Romania were being slaughtered after suffering appalling cruelty and then shipped into the UK as beef products. The Princess Royal, who is president of the charity, told the Daily Telegraph: 'Our attitudes to the horse meat trade and the value of horse meat may have to change.' Animal charities around the country have warned of a horse welfare crisis, with around 7,000 of them at risk of neglect and abandonment. The royal cited Poland as an example of a country that does properly care for the animals - adding that it was only when they were destined for consumption and transported alive in trucks that they suffered neglect. And in some cases, they entered the British food chain. She said: 'If that is true then, and they value their horses and they look after them well because they are in the horse meat trade, should we be considering a real market for horse meat and would that reduce the number of welfare cases? 'We have to understand if value has a part to play in how we reduce welfare cases… if it has real financial value then you look a little bit further ahead in the way you look after your animals.' Following the horse meat fiasco, questions were raised over the merits of eating horse in Britain. Former eventing champion Anne (seen here in 1987) said owners might take better care of their horses when they were alive if they thought they could later sell them for meat . Some countries, such as France, China and Italy, already eat large amounts of it. The princess added that part of the problem was how the public had been misled. She said that retailers should have corrected the labels on the products before putting them back on the shelves. The purpose of the annual conference at the Royal Geographical Society was to debate the future of horses over the next 100 years. Princess Anne rehomed 14-year-old Welsh Cob Annie after spotting her on an official visit to the World Horse Welfare charity in Somerset . Last month, Princess . Anne rehomed a 14-year-old horse called Annie after spotting her on an . official visit to the World Horse Welfare charity in Somerset.

The Welsh Cob is now helping the princess herd sheep and hack her 200 acres of woodland. It . marks a dramatic change in fortunes for Annie, who came to . the charity three years ago when her owners were no longer able to care . for her. 'She's perfect for me,' said Anne. 'She's 14 and she's not wanting to be too ambitious and I don't want to be very ambitious either. 'She will be a really useful nanny - I have young stock.' The . princess added: 'She fits in really well and as far as I'm concerned I . was really glad they didn't find someone else for her. She is just the . size of horse that I could do with now. 'Living here and going across the farm I . like to get off relatively easily and needed a horse that was . reasonably reliable when it comes to rural activities.' Princess Anne first met Annie during a tour of the charity's stables in Kingsdon, Somerset. 'She had a very good reputation and it seemed silly for me to go off and get something else,' she said. 'I hope Annie enjoys it here with me. We will be doing some hacking and she will be helping me herd the sheep and cattle.'","Royal spoke at World Horse Welfare charity conference .

A widower who buried his wife's body in their front yard in accordance with her dying wishes has told a judge that he will follow a court order and remove it. James Davis, 74, told Jackson County . Circuit Judge Jenifer Holt during a hearing in Scottsboro, Alabama on Wednesday that he would . comply with an order she issued last year. 'I'm gonna take Mama up and have her cremated and keep the remains in the house,' he said. Davis had previously vowed to never remove the remains of his wife, Patsy Davis, after promising her before her death in April 2009 that he would bury her just yards from their front porch. Devoted: James Davis, left, has agreed to remove the body of his wife Patsy, right, which is buried in their front yard in Stevenson, Alabama. The body will be exhumed on Friday and will be cremated . He maintained the city shouldn't be able to force him to remove the grave, which is marked with a headstone and decorated with plants and flowers, from his longtime residence in Stevenson. But he has now conceded defeat and said he will hire a contractor to remove the body of his wife on Friday and will then have it cremated. Davis said the exhumation and an urn would cost $2,745, and the judge also ordered him to pay $678 for a legal transcript the city said it needed. The couple both grew up in Dayton, Tennessee, and first met when she was seven and he was 11 and he asked her to accompany him to a strawberry festival. 'We went on that one date, and it was me and her the rest of the time,' he said. They were married for 48 years and had five children. In her later years, his wife suffered crippling arthritis, and Mr. Davis retired from his job as an electrical worker to take care of her until her death in April 2009. Remembered: In an image from August 2012, Davis stands in front of his wife's grave by their home . Memorial: He has been fighting to keep her body there - in accordance with her dying wishes - for 4 years . Shortly . before her death, Mr. Davis said, she expressed her wish to be buried . in the yard of the house where they had spent three decades together. The . City Council rejected Davis' request for a cemetery permit for his yard . after his wife died, but he buried her a few feet from the front porch . anyway. The city sued to . make Davis remove the grave, arguing that laws prohibit people from . using their yards as burial grounds inside the city limits, and a judge . last year ordered Davis to move the remains to a licensed cemetery. The Alabama Supreme Court recently refused to intervene in the case, and Holt held the hearing to determine how the exhumation would occur and how the costs would be covered. Outside court, Davis said he, his children and grandchildren were 'at ease' with the decision to remove the body and have it cremated. 'They can't hurt us anymore in this thing and there's been so much hurt, so much hurt,' he said. Missed: Davis, holding his wife's picture, said there has been 'so much hurt' from the court battle . City attorney Parker Edmiston said the . town tried to work with Davis, offering him two plots in the town . cemetery for Patsy and himself, but the man refused to cooperate. 'He said it was easier to ask for forgiveness than permission, and that's what he did,' Edmiston said. Davis' attorney, Tim Pittman, and Edmiston agreed that the body, casket and burial vault would be removed and the grave refilled immediately, but Davis said he would not move the stone tombstone that has marked the grave. Edmiston said a city ordinance prohibits markers like the tombstone at homes, 'but that's an issue for another day.' Davis said he had dropped a plan to declare his house a church so he could keep the grave as is.","James Davis buried his wife Patsy just yards from their front porch in Stevenson, Alabama in 2009 in accordance with her dying wishes .

A bank manager and her half-brother defrauded their own family and friends the the tune of £2million pounds in a bogus investment scam. For four years Caryn Bates, 41, and Matthew Sullivan, 53, duped close friends and relatives into handing over their life savings for stock market shares and bonds that did not exist. As investors anxiously waited for a return on their investments, the pair blew the cash on gambling, luxury holidays and living the high life. Con artists: For four years Caryn Bates, 41, and Matthew Sullivan, 53, duped close friends and relatives into handing over their life savings for stock market shares and bonds that did not exist in a Ponzi-style scam . To maintain the illusion that the investments were paying off, some of the cash they took from investors was used to fund monthly returns to others - the modus operandi of a classic 'Ponzi scheme'. Bates, a former bank manager, was jailed for five-and-a-half years, and stockbroker Sullivan received a seven-year sentence at Maidstone Crown Court, Kent, yesterday. A judge heard the pair ran their bogus scheme from March 2006 to October 2010. They traded off their expertise in the financial markets to convince their victims they were running a genuine investment company called World Trading. They knew many of their 40 victims personally, and persuaded them to pour their life savings into the project, which they promised would deliver a guaranteed return of between two and five per cent per month. Go directly to jail: After pleading guilty to investment fraud, Bates, a former bank . manager, was jailed for five-and-a-half years, and stockbroker Sullivan . received a seven-year sentence at Maidstone Crown Court . Named after one of the most notorious conmen in US history, the Ponzi scheme is an elaborate version of the oldest scam of them all - pyramid selling. In its classic form, a Ponzi fraudster sets up a fund with a 'fail-safe' business plan. Investors join in their droves, lured by the huge returns on offer. But the fraudster will merely pay off old investors with new money that comes into the fund. Eventually, all Ponzi schemes are doomed to collapse under the weight of new money flooding in. The fraud was named after Charles Ponzi, pictured above right in a 1910 police mugshot, an Italian who emigrated to America in 1903 with $2.50 in his pocket. After a spell in prison for fraud, he set up an investment scheme to exploit differences in the price of postage stamps in Italy and the U.S. At the height of his success in 1920, Ponzi was making $250,000 a day - a mammoth sum for the era. When his scheme collapsed, Ponzi pleaded guilty to fraud and was sentenced to five years in a federal prison. The scheme ran along the lines of the fraudulent investment scam made infamous by Charles Ponzi at the beginning of the 20th Century, paying returns to investors from the money paid by subsequent victims. But, the court heard, most of the cash was used to fund Sullivan's gambling habits and maintain lavish lifestyles for him and Bates. When a growing number of clients started to ask for their money back in 2009, Sullivan started offering them three month bonds, offering a guaranteed return of five per cent per month. It was not until late 2010 that the majority of investors realised that something was amiss. Sullivan and Bates tried to hold off disgruntled investors with excuses about the length of time to release money from offshore accounts. The fraud was brought to a halt in 2011 after clients upset at being unable to get their money back started to make complaints to police. After they were sentenced, Detective Constable Mark Agnew, from the Serious Economic Crime Unit said: 'Sullivan and Bates conned their family and friends out of millions of pounds. 'Their clients trusted them to invest their money wisely and legally with the promise of solid returns on their capital. 'What they didn’t realise, until it was too late, was Sullivan and Bates used the cash to fund their lifestyle. 'They were happy to live off their family and friends’ life savings without a care in the world.' Bates, of Edenbridge, Kent, and Sullivan, from Dymchurch, Kent, had pleaded guilty to the investment fraud at an earlier hearing. As well their long jail terms, the pair were banned from being company directors for 10 years. Sullivan will also be subject to a crime prevention order for five years after his release.","Caryn Bates and Matthew Sullivan defrauded their own friends and relatives .

Heart failure that kills thousands of Brits every year could be cured by a simple jab which shrinks the vital organ, according to a new study. Scientists who have reversed the condition in animals by injecting them with a gene now hope tests on patients will be just as successful. They found the ‘SUMO-1’ gene therapy can shrink enlarged hearts, improving their function and increasing blood flow. Heart failure happens when the heart is unable to pump blood adequately. It affects over 750,000 people in the UK - mainly the elderly - and claims 140,000 lives a year. The ¿SUMO-1¿ gene therapy can shrink enlarged hearts, improving their function and increasing blood flow. There are treatments but no cure. In the final experiments before human clinical trials SUMO-1, a gene which is 'missing in action' in heart failure patients, was delivered directly into the organ. Dr Roger Hajjar, who led the study, said: 'SUMO-1 gene therapy may be one of the first treatments that can actually shrink enlarged hearts and significantly improve a damaged heart’s life-sustaining function. 'We are very eager to test this gene therapy in our patients suffering from severe heart failure.' Dr Hajjar is already on a path toward approval from the Food and Drug Administration in the US to test the revolutionary treatment on patients. It will be the second gene therapy treatment launched by he and his colleagues at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. The first, named CUPID, is in its final phases after successful tests on animals and substantial clinical improvements in patients. In that project, a gene known as SERCA2 which produces an enzyme critical to the proper pumping of calcium out of cells, is injected via a harmless virus. In heart failure SERCA2 is dysfunctional forcing the heart to work harder and in the process grow larger. The virus carrying SERCA2 is delivered through the coronary arteries into the heart using tiny tubes. Studies show only one dose is required to restore healthy production of the gene’s beneficial enzyme. But a study by Dr Hajjar and his researchers published two years ago showed SUMO-1 is also decreased in failing human hearts. The injection could reduce the need for invasive heart surgery, scientists hope . Dr Hajjar said: 'The key reason for this translational medicine speed is the outstanding infrastructure we have in the Cardiovascular Research Centre at Mount Sinai where we are able to replicate human heart failure models to test our novel gene therapies. 'I think this is a really very unique example of rapid translation of a promising medical therapy from an initial discovery to pre-clinical trials.'","Researchers have successfully tested the injection on animals .

Egypt has sent out a global appeal for the return of a prized statuette of Tutankhamun's sister which went missing when a museum was looted over the summer. The 3,500-year-old limestone figurine of 'A Daughter of the Pharaoh Akhenaten', has not been found since Mallawi City Museum in central Egypt was completely ransacked and 1,000 precious goods were stolen in August just days after protests were held against President Morsi in Cairo. The 'masterpiece' was due to be transferred to a new museum but experts believe the riots were used as cover to steal it and now fear the precious piece could be sold on the black market. Stolen: A statue of Tutankhamun's sister went missing when the Mallawi Museum was looted in the aftermath of the uprising in Cairo this summer . Destroyed: Looters ransacked the museum leaving exhibits empty and ruining precious goods . Looters walked off with everything that could be carried from the museum with only 46 out of 1,089 exhibits remaining when the clashes died down. Items which were too heavy to carry off were smashed and burned while some wooden sarcophagi simply split open. More than 600 pieces have since been returned or seized by police, but hundreds, including a collection of Greek gold coins have still not been recovered. Relics of the Akhenaten era, source of the most celebrated finds of ancient Egypt, fetch the highest prices on the international black market and families of antiquities smugglers are known to operate in the area, the The Daily Telegraph reported. Emptied: Around 1,000 precious items were stolen during the riots which lasted for three days . Monica Hanna, an Egyptian archaeologist who has campaigned to protect the country's heritage, said the looters knew they were taking the 'highlight of the museum'. Jaihan Nessim, a curator at Mallawi Museum, said: 'We heard what had happened in Cairo and started to see the gangs gather,' said. Then there were big crowds, and they started firing into the air.' The staff eventually closed the museum and brought in the tourist police to protect it, but they were attacked and driven off allowing the looting to continue for another three days. Eventually, . the provincial chief of tourist police, Col Abdulsamie Farghali, called . members of his own family to stand guard while she and colleagues . inspected the damage and took what could be salvaged to safe storage. She . said she asked two teenagers what they were doing. 'They said, ""The . government is destroying their people, so we are destroying this because . it belongs to the government"",' she said. Ancient: Some of the items that were stolen are more than 3,500 years old . Col Farghali agreed that the looting was organised under the cover of the protests by local criminal gangs. He has now alerted UNESCO, the UN cultural organisation, and Interpol fearing that the remainder of the pieces, including the statuette of Akhenaten's daughter, would be taken abroad and sold on the black market. Akhenaten is celebrated for the unusual style of the many images of him and his wife, Nefertiti, and for having founded a new, monotheistic religion worshipping the sun. The pharaoh also founded a new capital at Tel al-Amarna, near Mallawi, the finds from which are due to be concentrated on a new museum being built at the provincial capital, Minya. Egypt's museum service is self-funded from tourist receipts and international collaborations, both of which have collapsed since the 2011 uprising. A spokesman for UNESCO said the damaged caused by the looters was 'catastrophic' and said it was 'working closely' with the authorities  such as Interpol and the International Council of Museums to fight the 'illicit traffic of these stolen objects'.","3,500-year-old limestone figure went missing when museum was looted .

Ford Motor Company said Wednesday there is absolutely no way they’ll allow embattled crack smoking mayor Rob Ford’s allies use their famous car logo. Just a week after finally admitting he smoked crack and one day before announcing he’s purchased illegal drugs, Mayor Ford was photographed signing his loyal fans’ t-shirts emblazoned with the logo. While self-described denizens of ‘Ford Nation’ cling to their support for the mayor, the carmaker made it clear yesterday that they in no way support Ford. And not just because he drives a GM. Anything for the fans: Toronto's crack smoking mayor Rob Ford was photographed signing shirts brought by his fans to a charity event Tuesday that featured the carmaker's logo in place of his last name . 'We view it as an unauthorized use of our trademark': On Wednesday, Ford spokespeople quickly denied any associations with those making the shirts and said they'd made moves to stop the use of their logo . ‘We view it as an unauthorized use of our trademark and have asked it to be stopped,’ spokesman for the carmaker, Jay Cooney, told Bloomberg. The scandal of the crack-smoking mayor broke six months ago, when the Toronto Star newspaper and media blog Gawker said they had been shown a video of the mayor smoking crack, an allegation that Ford spent six months denying. Then, last week, he announced he had in fact smoked the crack during one of his ‘drunken stupors.’ Nonetheless, supporters lined up at a United Way charity event on Tuesday to get the mayor’s signature on bobble-head dolls of himself that Ford had made for the cause. And some brought with them the ‘Ford Nation’ shirts that featured the auto company’s recognizable logo. ‘Ford did not grant permission for use of its logo,’ Cooney emphasized. Meanwhile, the Mayor doesn’t even drive a Ford, he drives a GM. And that Cadillac Escalade even played a part in the mayor’s long list of scandals after he was snapped reading a document while at the wheel of the Cadillac Escalade. Ford tough: Despite admissions of drugs use and purchases, video of erratic drunken behavior, and alleged ties to organized crime, Ford continues to cling to office and even retains loyal supporters who believe Ford has helped them . Escalading: The mayor doesn't own a Ford, but this Cadillac Escalade which he was photographed driving while distracted by a handful of documents . In addition to his admitted crack use and dangerous driving, Ford has been accused of having organized crime ties. And just days for smoking crack cocaine, he admitted on Thursday he was ‘extremely, extremely inebriated’ in a short expletive-laden video posted online. The news hit as a campaign by some city councilors to ask the Ontario provincial government to remove Ford from office gathered steam. Toronto city council does not have the power to remove Ford itself. The blurry, 80-second clip, posted on the Toronto Star newspaper's website and shown on Canadian television, shows a clearly agitated Ford ranting, making threats and pounding his hands together, while at least one other person seems to be goading him on. Ford's tenacity has not come without criticism, but unlike in the United States, the city council of Toronto does not have the power to oust him no matter how much they might loathe the mayor's behavior . The Star said it had paid for the video, and said the context of the clip was not clear. ’He dies or I die,’ Ford says in the clip, which also refers to something happening ‘in that ring’. He adds: ‘I need fucking 10 minutes to make sure he's dead. It'll be over in five minutes.’ It is difficult to force a mayor of Toronto out of office, unless he or she violates election or conflict of interest rules, or goes to prison. There are no recall elections of the sort that take place in the United States. And even if there were, the mayor’s continued and inexplicable popularity—which by some counts had even risen following his admission of crack use—suggests a vote may not even help the cause of the city council desperate to oust him.","The carmaker isn't thrilled with sharing their name with the embattled mayor .

The boat had left the Whitehall terminal at 2pm bound for Staten Island, but then turned back after an unspecified mechanical problem. Hard landing: The ferry crashed into the dock but no one was injured on impact . According to SI Live, the ferry had neared the Statue of Liberty before it began to slow down. Passengers tweeted from the ferry after the crash. 'We were almost halfway to SI and the ferry headed back to Manhattan. Had to lay on the ground as we docked because of the impact,' wrote one passenger. Delays: The crash caused delays at rush hour; authorities are still investigating what caused the problem . Venerable: The first motorized ferry between Staten Island and Manhattan began running in 1817 . Ed V told SI Live that ferry workers told passengers to brace for impact. 'We hit really, really hard,' he said. A Department of Transportation spokesperson told CBS that the vessel ran into the pilings and the lower level of a bridge at a low speed. The evening rush hour ferry service was running on a modified schedule due to the incident, causing delays for commuters. October 15, 2003 - The Andrew J.

A convicted killer who allegedly murdered and mutilated a teenage girl was arrested 30 years later after his 'terrible secret' was discovered following a DNA match, a court has heard. Colin Campbell, 66, who is already serving a life sentence for the manslaughter of Deirdre Sainsbury, denies murdering Claire Woolterton in August 1981. The 17-year-old’s naked body was found one morning on the promenade by the River Thames on Barry Avenue in Windsor, Berkshire, by a man on his way to work. Killer: Colin Campbell pictured by police in 1981 is already serving a life sentence for the manslaughter of Deirdre Sainsbury but denies murdering Claire . Victims: Deirdre Sainsbury, left, was murdered in December 1984 and her body dumped on a golf course in  Buckinghamshire, it is believed that Campbell may also have killed Claire Woolterton, right three years earlier . Prosecutor Peter Wright QC said the teenager had been initially attacked at another, unknown, location and was found to show physical signs consistent with having been strangled into unconsciousness. Addressing the jury at Reading Crown Court he recounted gruesome details of how she said she had then been sexually assaulted and then murdered. He told jurors, who were shown photographs of the teenager’s body, they would hear evidence 'inevitably distressing and unpleasant to receive by way of detail.' He added: 'You’re going to hear evidence of two terrible crimes in which two young women met an untimely and dreadful death. 'One of which the defendant has already admitted his responsibility for, namely Deirdre Sainsbury. 'At the time, DNA comparison didn’t even exist. 'For 32 long years the identity of her killer remained unknown, her murder unsolved. But her killer had left his mark on her body. 'Little did he know then the advances in medical science and scientific technology would eventually be his undoing. Mr Wright told the court an 'adhesive tape lift' had been used on Claire’s body to take 'debris from the surface of her skin.' It was then stored by police for 30 years until the case was reviewed in 2011. The court heard that Claire, left, was last seen alive walking towards Hanwell after spending the evening in Ealing while 29-year-old Deirdre while hitchhiking in December 1984 . Behind bars: Colin Campbell is currently serving a life sentence for the murder of Deirdre Sainsbury . He told jurors that expert scientists now believe the DNA discovered was 'one million times more likely to have been obtained from Colin Campbell', while another found it 'one billion times more likely.' The court heard that Claire, who lived in Northolt, north west London, with her mother and her mother’s partner, was last seen alive at around 10pm on August 27 1981, walking towards Hanwell after spending the evening in Ealing with the older married man she was seeing. Usually after meeting her he drove her home, dropping her off nearby. Mr Wright went on: 'Sadly, on this night, she and he having had a disagreement, she decided to make her own way home and set off at around about 10 o’clock that evening. 'It was a journey, sadly, that she did not complete.' Claire, who had left school at 16, was reported missing by her worried mother the next day. That evening she saw that a girl’s body had been found and realised it could be her daughter, the court heard. Mr Wright said Campbell, who pleaded guilty to hitchhiker Ms Sainsbury’s manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, killed the 29-year-old in December 1984. Her body was found in a wooded area of Denham Golf Course in Buckinghamshire, after Campbell picked her up in his car in Upper Richmond Road, Roehampton, on the evening of December 22. Mr Wright told jurors there were many similarities between the two killings: both women had been mutilated with sharp instruments, both had their clothes removed by their attacker and both bodies had been left in public places where they could easily be found. The trial continues tomorrow. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Colin Campbell, 66, who is already .

A woman who famously pledged to 'spend, spend, spend' after winning big betting on football is holding a charity sale of memorabilia from her life. Viv Nicholson, 77, won £152,000 in 1961 alongside her husband Keith, and promptly used it all to buy expensive clothes, cars and houses. The win, on a football betting pool, in which gamblers predict the results of football games across a season, would be worth £2,870,000 today. Then and now: Viv Nicholson poses, left, with her husband Keith with their winnings in 1961, and, right with her brother Geoff Asprey today ahead of the auction of memorabilia from her life . Joy: Mrs Nicholson, centre, celebrates with her husband as Bruce Forsyth, right, presents their winnings . The couple frittered away half of their wealth within four years of winning. Mr Nicholson tragically died at the wheel of his blue Jaguar in 1965, which led to Mrs Nicholson being declared bankrupt, as the tax authorities reclaimed most of her husband's wealth. She managed to reclaim some after a lengthy legal battle, but lost it all again from poor investments on the stock market. Mrs Nicholson married three times more, though she is now a widow again, and battled with alcohol and depression. A shot-lived attempt to start a new life in Malta was soon curtailed after she was deported for fighting with a police officer. In desperation she took to performing 'Big Spender' in a Manchester strip club, but was fired when she refused to take off her underwear. In 1984, The Smiths asked her to pose for the cover of their hit single Heaven Knows I'm Miserable now. Glad rags: Mrs Nicholson's camel-coloured maxi coat, seen left and right, and her wide-rimmed blue hat, left, will be among the items at auction . Memorabilia: Mrs Nicholson and Mr Asprey will auction items from her left, pictured. The proceeds will help fund a project to buy iPads for the elderly . Hits: These records, recorded by Mrs Nicholson and her family, feature in the auction . Fashion show: Many of her vintage clothes, shown here on the catwalk in 2009, will be sold to raise money . Her story has had an enduring fascination, and was turned into a televised BBC play and later a West End musical - both called Spend, Spend, Spend. Mrs Nicholson received royalties of around £100,000 from the musical, which were spent, and revealed in an interview with the Daily Mail in 2007 that she was living off of her state pension and seeking work. Mrs Nicholson has suffered three strokes, and has now returned to her hometown of Castleford, Yorkshire, where she lives in a care home. Her brother Geoff Asprey, 71, who wrote a single entitled Spend, Spend, Spend based on her experiences, is now planning to auction off items from his sister's colourful life, which he has kept. The money will be used to buy iPads for the elderly so that they can stay in touch more easily. The pair have set up the Asprey Nicholson Foundation and plan to use some of the proceeds to form an 'e-village' and stay connected. Fame: Mrs Nicholson's life was immortalised in the musical Spend, Spend, Spend. It debuted on the West End in 1999, where Barbara Dickson, left, played Mrs Nicholson . Mr Asprey said: 'The object of the foundation is to buy iPads they can use in a sort of e-village and talk to each other the internet. We’re hoping to raise as much as we can. 'Viv’s a figure who stands there to show what can happen when you have got nobody when you are old.' The siblings are exhibiting the memorabilia at an empty unit at Carlton Lanes Shopping Centre in Castleford, and plan to hold the auction in the new year. Items on sale include photos of the two in their various club bands, along with microphone stands and other stage equipment, items from her home before the big win and even a drawing by Mrs Nicholson. Mr Asprey added: 'I wanted Castleford people to see what she has been left with. 'Viv doesn’t have anything herself, all these items are ones I’ve saved or collected over the years.'","Viv Nicholson, 77, won £152,000 in 1961 with her husband Keith .

A professional football player has become the latest person to reveal far too much on social media after a video of his penis was uploaded to his Instagram.

His girlfriend posted on his verified Twitter account explaining the situation on Wednesday morning. Didn't catch this one: DeAndre Hopkins, 21, claims his Instagram account was hacked on Wednesday . Explicit: The video showed Hopkins holding his penis but only a still remains after certain websites took a screen grab of the image . 'Instagram was hacked, this is his girlfriend he's in meetings with no phone, have some respect ppl,' the post read. A screengrab of the video was taken by Deadspin. Black Sports Online reports that the video showed Hopkins masturbating, but it has since been deleted in its entirety and the still is all that remains. He posted an inspirational quote on his Twitter account hours later: 'No weapon formed against me shall prosper.' He is not the first football player to accidentally post a picture of his genitals on the internet- whether he himself did it or it was the work of hackers. Redskins player Chris Cooley came under fire in 2008 for posting a picture of the team playbook while studying for a pre-game quiz. The problem there, aside from revealing the team's plays, was that he chose to study in the nude and his penis was visible in the photo. Hopkins, whose nickname is 'Nuk', was drafted by the Texans this year after playing at Clemson University in South Carolina for two years. This is not his first public relations issue since leaving college, however. New addition: Hopkins, seen here with his mother in front of his locker, was drafted to the Houston Texans earlier this year after playing for two years at Clemson University . The Big Lead reports that in February, in the time ramping up to the draft, Hopkins was accused of staying in a hotel room that was 'trashed', with urine and feces. Hopkins, who was staying in the room at The Crowne Plaza hotel in Indianapolis with fellow recruit Mark Harrison, denied his involvement in the incident. He told Fox Sports that the room was in good condition when he checked out of it. 'Luckily, thank god, my agent got my flight booked early or it really would’ve been questionable if I did (it) or not,' Hopkins said. 'I got done before Mark Harrison, so I was already packed.

A French court today found German safety standards firm TUV liable in a worldwide scare over defective breast implants and ordered the company to compensate distributors and hundreds of victims. The court in the southern city of Toulon ruled that TUV Rheinland had 'neglected its duties of checking and vigilance' after having certified that implants made by French firm Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) conformed to safety rules - even though they were subsequently found to contain substandard, industrial-grade silicone gel. The scandal first emerged in 2010 after doctors noticed abnormally high rupture rates in PIP implants and gathered steam worldwide in 2011, with some 300,000 women in 65 countries believed to have received the faulty implants. Victory: French lawyer Jackye Petitot (centre) speaks with unidentified plaintiffs in the courthouse of Toulon, which found German safety standards firm TUV liable in a worldwide scare over defective breast implants . Colombian lawyer Nathalie Lozano (centre) speaks with unidentified plaintiffs after the court ruled TUV Rheinland had 'neglected its duties of checking and vigilance' after having certified that the PIP implants conformed to safety rules . Six distributors of the implants from Bulgaria, Brazil, Italy, Syria, Mexico and Romania sued TUV for a total of 28 million euros ($38 million). Nearly 1,700 women who were fitted with the implants - most of them from South America but also from France and Britain - also asked the German firm for 16,000 euros each, taking the total claims against TUV to 53 million euros. The court ordered the German firm to compensate 'the damage (done to) importers and victims', telling TUV to give them 3,000 euros (£1,700) each while waiting for individual medical or financial assessments to be conducted on each plaintiff. Only when these assessments are finished will TUV know the exact sum to be paid out. More than 16,000 women have had the implants removed since the scandal came to light, but health officials in various countries estimate they are not toxic and are not thought to increase the risk of breast cancer. French lawyers Cecile Derycke (right) and Olivier Gutkes (left) who represent the German quality control company TUV speak to journalists in the courthouse . The court ordered the German firm (above) to compensate 'the damage (done to) importers and victims', telling TUV to give them 3,000 euros (£1,700) each . Civil proceedings against TUV took place in March, and came on top of a high-profile criminal court case in April and May in the nearby city of Marseille against PIP founder Jean-Claude Mas and four other executives. All five are charged with aggravated fraud and a ruling on that case is expected on December 10. In the TUV case, lawyers for the distributors and victims had condemned the German firm for not ever having checked the implants despite all the means at their disposal, such as unannounced inspections or sample testing. But lawyers for TUV retorted that it was never the German firm's job to check the actual implants, and their task was only to inspect the manufacturing process. The scandal first emerged in 2010 after doctors noticed abnormally high rupture rates in PIP implants . Cecile Derycke, who was defending TUV, said the company was 'shocked by the judgment' and had decided to appeal. 'TUV had strictly conformed to the regulations in force,' she said. The case prompted the European Commission to set out new rules in September saying inspection bodies will now have to randomly carry out unannounced factory audits and check for the substitution or adulteration of raw materials. Mas, a former life-insurance salesman, founded PIP in 1991 to take advantage of the boom in cosmetic implants and built the company into the third-largest global supplier. But he came under the spotlight when plastic surgeons began reporting an unusual number of ruptures in his products, and health authorities later discovered he was saving millions of euros by using the industrial-grade gel in 75 per cent of the implants. PIP - which has since been liquidated - had exported more than 80 per cent of its implants, with about half going to Latin America, about a third to other countries in western Europe, about 10 per cent to eastern Europe and the rest to the Middle East and Asia.","French court finds German firm liable in worldwide scare of faulty implants .

A college student who was left with a paralyzed face after being diagnosed with Bell’s Palsy found an inspiring way to deal with the condition, using it for a Halloween costume mimicking 'not-impressed' gymnast McKayla Maroney. Leslie Barrett had been struggling to cope with the condition, which causes temporary paralysis in one side of the face, after being struck down in August while a student at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas. After she posted a picture of herself on Facebook, someone pointed out that the Bell's Palsy had left her looking like Maroney after she took a tumble and only won the silver medal in the vault finals at the 2012 Olympics. Bell's Palsy sufferer Leslie Barrett, left, turned her . condition, which causes paralysis on one side of the face, into a . brilliant Halloween costume based on 'not impressed' U.S. gymnast McKayla . Maroney, right . It quickly became a popular internet meme with even President Obama getting involved and pulling his own 'not-impressed' look in the Oval Office. The condition was named after Charles Bell (1774-1842), a Scottish anatomist and surgeon known for a number of neurological finds, including the discovery that the inflammation of the facial nerve that travels through the skull in a narrow bony canal can cause temporary paralysis of the facial muscles on one side. Bell’s Palsy is a rare condition, affecting one person in 5,000, and has no known specific causes, though it’s thought that viruses might play a part. When a nerve is not functioning or missing muscles in the face do not receive essential signals to work properly. This results in paralysis of areas of the face . Each side of the face has its own facial nerve, so damaging the left facial nerve will only affect the left side of the face, and vice versa. The condition can also be triggered by surgery, Lyme disease, neurological conditions, traumatic injuries to the brain, skull or face, birth trauma and congenital conditions. After dressing up as Maroney for Halloween, Miss Barrett posted a picture to the gymnast's Facebook page. She wrote: 'Two months ago I was diagnosed with Bell's Palsy, which means the right side of my face is temporarily paralyzed and I can only express emotion on my left. 'Last week at a party someone pointed out that I normally look like your ""not impressed"" face. I decided to incorporate my disability into my Halloween costume and dress up as you. 'This has hands down been the best costume I've ever had. It was the first time in months I got to look like I was intentionally making a face and it has helped me deal with the slow recovery a little better.' Miss Barrett also went on a first date at what she described as 'the apex' of the palsy, which caused her to constantly blink out of one eye while attempting to make small talk. Bells Palsy is a condition with affects around one in 5,000 people with most making a full recovery.  Although the exact cause is unknown, it's thought to be because the facial nerve becomes inflamed, possibly due to a viral infection. George Clooney had Bell's Palsy when he was at Middle school and got called ‘Frankenstein’ as s a result. Fellow actor Pierce Brosnan also suffered from the condition - both made a full recocvery .","Leslie Barrett was struck down with Bell's Palsy in August .

The Archbishop of Canterbury rowed back on a suggestion that popular church schools are planning to admit more pupils from non-churchgoing families . The Archbishop of Canterbury yesterday rowed back on a suggestion that popular church schools are planning to admit more pupils from non-churchgoing families. The Most Reverend Justin Welby said that remarks on Church schools in which he suggested radical changes were on the way should not ‘be seen as revealing any changes nor dissenting from current policy'. The retreat followed his assurance to journalists that ‘there’s a steady move away from faith-based entry tests’ for children hoping for places at Church of England’s schools. It was the third occasion in nine months in which Archbishop Welby has made a controversial statement, only to soften his line later in the face of wide publicity. In March he modified his criticism of the Government over benefit reforms and during the summer, and during the summer the Archbishop struck out at payday lenders, only to have to admit a ‘serious inconsistency’ when it was discovered that the CofE held investments in Wonga. Archbishop Welby’s views on changes in Church schools were given to The Times during a conference held by the CofE charity the Church Urban Fund. The paper reported that he said: ‘What you are seeing in the Church schools is a deeper and deeper commitment to the common good. ‘There’s a steady move away from faith-based entry tests.’ CofE schools - the Church is responsible for one in four primaries and one in 25 state secondary schools - have a high reputation and middle-class parents are often anxious to win places for their children. Families are frequently accused of filling the pews on Sunday mornings to solely to impress vicars, who give preference to regular churchgoers. Critics say the system encourages hypocrisy and is a form of selection, because it favours the children of largely middle class congregations. Archbishop Welby - an old Etonian whose five children went to state schools - told The Times: ‘It is not necessary to select to get a really good school. ‘There are unbelievably brilliant schools that are entirely open to all applicants without selection criteria apart from residence, where you live, and which produce staggeringly good results. ‘It’s a question of - and you can point to them all over the place - it’s a question of outstanding leadership.’ However shortly after his remarks were published, the Archbishop reversed direction. He put out a statement that said: ‘I fully support the current policy for schools to set their own admissions criteria, including the criterion of faith. Nothing in my wider comments to The Times on this subject should be seen as revealing any changes nor dissenting from current policy.’ The statement left a question mark over Archbishop Welby’s thinking and provoked demands for reform from critics of the selection procedures of church schools. The Accord Coalition, which aims to remove ‘religious discrimination’ from school admissions, said the CofE should fulfil promises to keep a quarter of school places open for non-churchgoing families, and re-write its guidance on admissions to encourage the acceptance of pupils from a wider range of backgrounds. The group’s spokesman, Rabbi Dr Jonathan Romain, said: ‘The Archbishop’s comment that schools better serve the common good by being open in their admissions, is a breath of fresh air. However, the Church has made commitments towards greater inclusivity at its schools in recent years, but not delivered, and it remains to be seen whether church schools really are shifting in their approach in pupil admissions. ‘The Church needs to offer clear leadership to bring about a lasting cultural change.’ Justin Welby said that remarks on Church schools in which he suggested radical changes were on the way should not 'be seen as revealing any changes nor dissenting from current policy' In March Archbishop Welby opposed the Government’s one per cent cap on benefit increases, saying: ‘These changes will mean it is children and families who will pay the price for high inflation, rather than the Government. Politicians have a clear choice. By protecting children from the effects of this Bill, they can help fulfil their commitment to end child poverty.’ However, hours afterwards, he wrote a blog on the Lambeth Palace website which sounded a different note. ‘It’s a very complicated area, and the first thing to say is that the current Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Iain Duncan Smith, has spent hard years turning himself into a leading and principled expert on welfare, its effects and shortcomings,’ the Archbishop said in the blog. ‘He is introducing one of the biggest and most thorough reforms of a system that most people admit is shot full of holes, wrong incentives, and incredible complexity.’ In July the Archbishop attacked payday lenders, saying: ‘I’ve met the head of Wonga and we had a very good conversation and I said to him quite bluntly, “We’re not in the business of trying to legislate you out of existence, we’re trying to compete you out of existence”.’ Shortly afterwards a newspaper reported that the Church Commissioners, the financial arm of the CofE, had money in one of Wonga’s major backers. Lambeth Palace said: ‘We are grateful to the Financial Times for pointing out this serious inconsistency of which we were unaware. ‘We will be asking the assets committee of the Church Commissioners to investigate how this has occurred and to review the holding.’","Justin Welby said remarks on schools in which he suggested radical changes were on the way should not ‘be seen as revealing any changes’

Police said Umadevi's mother Sarojini, her son Sivaraman and her brother Sellampillai had always kept their house locked and did not speak to neighbours. They had been living on the family pension of Sarojini's husband Subramaniam Pillai. As Sarojini did not appear for a renewal of life certificate, they did not get the pension in recent months. Police originally suspected the body had been kept in the house because they couldn't afford to pay for a cremation but then officers suspected they may be unwell. Spirits: Sellampillai told police his father died after seeing a ghost in the house and he kept his sister's body in the house to stop spirits from entering . 'All the three looked like they had psychological problem. That is also one of the reasons why we referred them to the hospital,' police said. However, graduate Sellampillai told police his father died after seeing a ghost in the house and he kept his sister's body in the house to stop spirits from entering. 'My brother, Perumal, also died and now my sister, Umadevi, has died. Someone said that if there is dead body in the house, then the ghost will not come.'

'Qualification inflation': Vince Cable said professions should relax the demand for qualifications from workers . Vince Cable yesterday attacked the demand for ‘superfluous’ degrees in a range of careers that act as a barrier to applicants. The Business Secretary said ‘qualification inflation’ was holding back people who wanted to become police officers, nurses or accountants. He argued it should be easier to be accepted into professions with lower qualifications such as A-levels and apprenticeships. Talks were being held with professional associations to relax minimum requirements, he added, but it was becoming difficult to ‘de-graduate’ some jobs. The comments come at a time when the number of young people entering higher education has soared to almost 50 per cent. Dr Cable, whose department is responsible for higher education, told a conference in London on improving social mobility through education that the issue was a ‘major problem’. He said: ‘The idea that in order to be a police officer or a nurse you have to have a degree - that’s just qualification inflation. ‘There may be some qualitative improvement associated with it but arguably not. I think we have passed that barrier. It’s very difficult to de-graduate a lot of the big professions of that kind.’ He added: ‘For a whole lot of fairly standard professions - not elite professions - a degree is like a basic qualification. ‘We are conscious of some areas like accountancy and elsewhere where degree qualifications appear to be superfluous. ‘We are trying to persuade professionals associations to relax their qualifications.’ Officially, there are no formal qualifications needed to join the police, although entry requirements differ between forces. But the explosion in the number of graduates means talented applicants who have not gone to university may be overlooked. University-leavers are also able to take advantage of fast-track schemes that allow promotion through the ranks much quicker than usual and in some cases by-passing lower ranks altogether. 'Superfluous: The Business Secretary pointed out professions where degrees do not seem to be of use . Nurses’ training moved into higher education from the 1990s. Most applicants have to complete a three-year course, with around half their time studying at a university and the rest gaining experience on a ward. The surge in university applications began under the last Labour government, which set a target of half of young people studying for degrees. It has been continued by the Coalition, although critics warn many end up taking worthless degrees or are unable to find suitable work at the end of their course because so many graduates are chasing jobs. The government is trying to promote apprenticeships and other schemes as an alternative to the traditional university route into many careers. Steve White, the vice-chairman of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said large numbers of officers now were graduates. ‘There’s a feeling that you have to get a degree in order to do anything,’ he added. He also warned fast-track schemes could rob senior officers of vital experience, saying: ‘You’ve got to understand the grass roots in order to get the necessary grounding to go through the ranks.’ But Dr Peter Carter, General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said the job had ‘traditionally created social mobility and this has continued with the introduction of an all-graduate work force’. He added: ‘Last year the Willis Commission into nursing education found that the increasingly technical nature of nursing and added responsibilities such as prescribing meant the move to an all-graduate profession was essential. ‘A degree has been a requirement for other professions such as midwifery and physiotherapy for many years with very few claims that it is unnecessary or undesirable.’","Dr Cable pointed out degrees are needed for many 'fairly standard' jobs .

To his three children Horace Stokes was simply their adored father, a genial greengrocer who later switched to pulling pints as a pub landlord. He never spoke about his harrowing experiences as a soldier during the Second World War, not even with his close family. It was only on his deathbed, after decades of silence, that Mr Stokes passed on to his children a dusty old diary to which – 20 years after the war – he had secretly committed the memories of his wartime exploits. Extraordinary: Just before the death of Horace Stokes (pictured left in 1944) he asked his son Peter (right) to come to his bedside because he had 'something important' to leave him - and presented him with a diary . Memories: The journal left by Horace Stokes to his son Peter detailing the extent of his time in the SAS . Teenager: At the age of 18, Horace Stokes (left) volunteered to join the Territorial Army's 121st Artillery and was mobilised two weeks into his training at the outbreak of war . To their astonishment and pride, the journal revealed an extraordinary tale of heroism – and that modest Mr Stokes had actually been a founding member of the SAS. For the first time, his children learned how their father had fought the Nazis behind enemy lines, and escaped from two PoW camps. Because he was in the Special Air Service – formed in July 1941 – Mr Stokes was sworn to secrecy and never discussed his time on secret missions across occupied Europe. It was shortly before he died from cancer at the age of 64 that he presented his children with the stories of his time with the Who Dares Wins regiment. By then his son Peter was 24 and had already embarked on own distinguished, military career. He has now published his father’s memoir as a book entitled No Ordinary Life. Posing: Horace Stoke (right) with colleagues in 1941, at the time when he was a Lance Corporal in the SAS . Diary entry: Horace Stokes was a Sergeant in the army who parachuted behind enemy lines and battled Nazis . Detail: Horace Stokes grew up in Birmingham and was just 18 years old when he signed up with the Territorial Army in 1939 . Journal: Mr Stokes was sworn to secrecy and never discussed his time on secret missions across occupied Europe . Recalling the days before his father’s death in 1986, Peter Stokes, said: ‘He wanted me to come home to talk to me because there were things he needed to tell me. 'He handed me the journal and I could barely believe what it contained. I was filled with pride and totally awestruck. ‘He was involved in some of the most famous raids during the Second World War, and yet he’d never mentioned a word of it. 'At the end of the war he closed the door on what he had done. 'He had killed many, many people and had seen his best friends killed. ‘But while he had closed the door I know there was not a night that passed where he did not sit and reflect on what had happened.’ Peter Stokes went on to become a decorated serviceman, earning an MBE as Commander of No. 1 Squadron RAF Regiment, based at RAF St Mawgan in Cornwall. He said of his father: ‘He was never decorated, he never received a medal. 'I didn’t do half of what he did and ended up with an MBE and a Queen’s Commendation.’ Horace Stokes grew up in Birmingham and was just 18 when he signed up with the Territorial Army in 1939. He went on to serve with 12 Commando, with the Small Scale Raiding Force and eventually with the newly-formed 2nd Special Air Service. SAS hero: Horace Stokes (right) fought the Nazis behind enemy lines, and escaped from several PoW camps . Family: Royal Air Force veteran Peter Stokes is pictured with his children from left, Sophie, Joelle and Ben . His secret journal recalls daring missions across Europe, describing in detail how he parachuted behind enemy lines before blowing up or sabotaging strategic Nazi targets. It also documents his capture and imprisonment in two different PoW camps and the harrowing moment a Gestapo agent placed a gun to his head during an interrogation. Sgt Stokes took part in legendary raids including Operation Basalt, a raid on the German-occupied British Channel Island of Sark in 1942, and Operation Speedwell, an early SAS assault against Italian rail targets near Genoa in 1943. But when ‘Stokey’, as he was known, was demobbed, he settled into life as a greengrocer and later a publican, never breathing a word about his missions. Peter Stokes said yesterday: ‘Leading up to his death he was very strong and had a real spark. 'I read the journal and we discussed many of the stories. 'He was landed by parachute, submarine and boat in enemy-held territory time and time again and the fact that he survived is incredible. ‘One that really stuck with me was how he cycled 230km throughout the night in enemy-held territory while very close to death. 'He managed to survive living off the land.’ Despite his modesty, Horace’s journal makes clear how highly he valued his wartime comrades. One extract reads: ‘There were nights practising landings in the Outer Hebrides. And through it all a deep sense of comradeship and terrific pride in our superb physical fitness and toughness. 'A knowledge that we were to be classed amongst the finest soldiers in the world.’ Describing how he came to learn of his father’s past, Mr Stokes, a father of three from Cornwall, said: ‘I was getting ready for a Christmas party in 1986 when my sister phoned me in floods of tears and told me that Dad was dying. ‘He had come to my graduation in RAF Cranwell in 1984 and was very proud – but even then I had no idea what he had done with his life. In the end I think he wanted to unburden himself.’ Horace Stokes had just a few weeks to discuss his secret life with Peter, his other son Graham and daughter Pat, before he died. Peter said: ‘I wanted to publish the book so my children can learn about their grandfather’s incredible wartime experiences.’ No Ordinary Life is on sale at Amazon and other leading book stores priced £6.99.","Horace Stokes lived an anonymous life as a greengrocer and pub landlord .

A hospital trust at the centre of a police investigation over allegations staff were forced to change cancer waiting times data has been placed in special measures. Last week it was revealed the head of cancer services at Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust had been put on leave after a report from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) suggested a number of cancer patients had suffered 'undue delays'. CQC inspectors found that there were 'inaccuracies' with waiting time data relating to cancer treatment. Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust has been placed in special measures after a Care Quality Commission report found a number of cancer patients suffered 'undue delays' Staff told inspectors they were 'pressured or bullied' to change data relating to patients and their treatment to make it seem as though people were being treated in line with national guidelines. As a result some patients may not have had the treatment they needed in time, according to the CQC. The Daily Mail last week reported how Rachel . West, who is in charge of cancer services at the trust, had not been seen at work for several weeks, although the trust . denied she had been suspended. Insiders said, however, she was on . 'special leave'. The health sector regulator, Monitor, has now put the trust in special measures 'to ensure all its patients receive good quality care'. A formal investigation by Monitor found the trust had breached its licence to provide health services. Under special measures, the trust will be required to 'put right the patient quality, safety and governance concerns highlighted by the CQC', Monitor said. Trust chief executive Dr Gordon Coutts (left) said the trust was contacting all 30 patients - or their next of kin where patients have died - identified by the CQC report. Chief inspector of hospitals, professor Sir Mike Richards (right), welcomed Monitor's decision to accept the recommendation to put the trust in special measures . An improvement director will also be appointed by Monitor to ensure the trust turns itself around. The hospital will also be matched with a high-performing trust which can offer support and expertise. The trust must also publish and update an action plan that can be viewed by the public, Monitor said. Adam Cayley, regional director for Monitor said: 'Following the urgent actions already taken to safeguard patients at the trust we have stepped in formally to assure the health and wellbeing of patients using the cancer pathway at Colchester. 'The trust has been given an explicit set of actions to improve the service it offers patients. We will be monitoring progress closely and we will not hesitate to take further regulatory action if required. 'The leadership of the trust will be reviewed as part of our scrutiny of the trust's governance arrangements and, if necessary, further regulatory action will be taken.' Trust chief executive, Dr Gordon Coutts, said: 'Everyone at the trust was extremely concerned about the problems identified in the CQC report. 'We are truly sorry that in some cases . cancer patients, their carers and families have not been given the high . quality of care this trust always aims to provide. - Monitor has ordered the trust to 'put right the patient quality, safety and governance concerns highlighted by the CQC' - The regulator will appoint an Improvement Director to ensure the trust 'turns itself around' - The trust will be matched with a high-performing trust which can offer support and expertise 'in delivering improvement to the cancer pathway' - The trust will be required to publish and regularly update an action plan that can be viewed by the public . - The regulator has also imposed an additional licence condition to make sure the trust has the 'necessary capability in place to run the trust'. The regulator said: 'If the leadership of the trust fails to act appropriately, this condition allows Monitor to take further action' 'We have already taken action in response to the findings of the CQC report and we are continuing to address all of the concerns that were raised. 'Our priority is the safety and well-being of all our patients.' Dr Coutts said the trust was contacting all 30 patients - or their next of kin where patients have died - identified by the CQC report. Chief inspector of hospitals, professor Sir Mike Richards, said: 'We welcome Monitor's decision to accept my recommendation to place Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust in special measures. 'I am pleased that information from CQC's inspection has resulted in the action that is being taken by Monitor to improve services at the trust. CQC will continue to monitor the trust in line with its regulatory responsibilities and this will include further inspections.' Last week a spokesman for Essex Police said it had been contacted by the CQC and was reviewing the information to establish whether a criminal investigation was necessary. Every year around 6,000 people go to Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust to be treated for cancer. Unison . regional head of health Tracey Lambert said: 'The decision to take . Colchester Hospital into special measures is the right one. 'The trust board has lost the confidence . of patients and the public in north east Essex and people want to see . strong, positive action to improve health care at the hospital. 'Unison members alerted executive directors at the hospital that they were being bullied into falsifying data relating to the treatment of cancer patients, but their concerns were not dealt with. 'We know that our members in other departments also believed they would not be listened to if they spoke out about their fears. Unison repeatedly made this point to the trust . 'In light of what has happened at Colchester, there is a need for a significant change of leadership and we look forward to working with the new regime.' A police officer died following a 'disastrous' childbirth at Colchester General Hospital, an inquest has today heard. Diane Patt, 34, died just hours after giving birth to her second child at the hospital in September 2011. Mrs Patt, a police constable based near to her home in Colchester, Essex, suffered a ‘massive haemorrhage’ losing five litres of blood. Today an inquest at Chelmsford Coroners’ Court heard damning criticism from hospital staff about failures to replace lost blood. Professor Mohammed Khaled, consultant on call at the hospital on the night PC Patt died, said: 'I did not have any concerns because I thought the blood had been replaced. 'We expect most women to recover, even from such blood loss, and it is very unfortunate that she did not get the blood replacement. I do believe if she had been given blood, she would still be with us.' PC Patt was admitted to Colchester Hospital on the evening of September 18, 2011. She gave birth by ventouse at 8.20pm, following a failed forceps delivery, but sadly died just hours later at 11.57pm. Her newly-born daughter survived. A post-mortem gave the cause of death as a massive haemorrhage which triggered cardiac arrest. PC Patt had been keen to have a normal delivery following a caesarian section for the birth of her first child. But problems came when a qualified registrar conducted a failed forceps delivery with Neville Barnes forceps. Professor Khaled said: 'Seeing the report, it could have been better. The registrar was not able to use Keilland’s forceps - she should have called me. 'I was busy in another room. She did not even tell me she was going to use them.' Prof Khaled had been busy writing notes yards away in a neighbouring room. He explained his weekend on call had been ‘horrendous’ with only brief opportunities to catch up on paperwork. He said: 'I commenced duty at 8.30am on Saturday, September 17. 'Unfortunately, that weekend was a horrendous weekend where I spent most of my time in hospital.' Prof Khaled returned home shortly after helping stitch up PC Patt following her daughter’s birth but was called back by panicked midwives. He said: 'She rang me and said ""Khaled they did not ask me to call you but I would like you to come straight away as we need your calming hands"". 'That call indicated disaster as she is not someone who panics. For her to call me without the doctors asking means a big problem.' Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray suggested notes revealed ‘a bit of light-heartedness’ between staff as they looked to stabilise PC Patt’s condition. Widower Sergeant Major Jason Patt, of Colchester’s 7th Parachute Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery, was in court alongside other members of PC Patt’s family. The inquest, which is scheduled for three days, continues.","Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation trust in special measures .

Evidence: This is footage from the video, where the officer, who has been blurred, asked the potential informant for details about students in return for cash . Police are spying on Cambridge students, with one undercover police officer secretly filmed asking a potential informant to relay information about political activities on Facebook for £30-a-time, it emerged today. The plain-clothes detective was caught on camera offering cash to an undergraduate to provide details about his friends and any links they might have to political or environmental groups. Focussing on social media the officer, who has not been identified, asked him: 'Can you have a look on Facebook and let us know?', adding: 'We cannot hack accounts... It would be more of an education for me'. The officer explained his force is hungry for inside information on groups at the 800-year-old institution, so they could disrupt or manage any protests. He said it is ‘impossible’ to infiltrate the student union and other organisations with undercover officers so they must recruit informants instead. But his potential recruit instead wore a hidden camera and captured every word on tape to expose the undercover officer’s tactics. The video raises fresh questions about the scale of police undercover activities targeted at legitimate and mostly peaceful protesters. It is also an utter humiliation for the officer who is . likely to work for an intelligence unit responsible for policing public . protests. Cambridgeshire Police tried to defend his actions claiming . officers can use ‘covert tactics’ to help in the ‘prevention and . detection of criminal activity.’ But senior officers nationwide have . repeatedly signalled that such intrusive tactics should only be used . against the most dangerous criminals. There have been a series of . scandals in which undercover officers ran amok among protest groups, . fathering children and adopting the identities of dead babies. Protest: Anti-Chinese protesters, none of whom are linked to today's revelations, are controlled by police in Cambridge as they fight for a free Taiwan . Message: A Cambridge University proctor walks though the middle of the protest, as students, again not linked to today's story, stage a sit-in in opposition to Government plans to introduce student fees . The latest controversy emerged after the activist, aged in his 20s, was approached by the police officer by telephone. He . attended a police station twice and was asked to launch a secret spy . operation on the political activities of his friends and students. The . officer asks the man to target ‘student-union type stuff’, claiming . this would be of interest to police because ‘the things they discuss can . have an impact on community issues.’ During a lengthy chat, he . asked for the names of students who attend protests, the identities of . their leaders and details of their vehicles. The potential informant . is told to also focus on UK Uncut, Unite Against Facism and . environmentalists, including those opposed to fracking. Wearing a . blue and white striped T-shirt, the burly officer also asked the student . to monitor Facebook for details of forthcoming events. He said that . when groups hold meetings they may ask the potential informant to attend . and pay him around £30 for his time and effort. The officer said: . ‘Let’s keep it small, you know little things that go on, little meetings . that happen where they are going to discuss different issues in . Cambridge, whether it be, such as at the university or those sorts of . things.’ Targets: Footage of the interview reveals that police are want information on Canbridge students, which the force says helps the 'prevention and detection of criminal activity' The activist was first contacted at the beginning of . October, before contacting The Guardian newspaper which helped record . the meeting. He believes he was chosen because he was a member of anti-nuclear groups and had been arrested three times on demonstrations. Last night, the failed attempt to recruit the activist was blasted as a ‘a gross abuse of surveillance powers.’ Big . Brother Watch director Nick Pickles said: ‘For the police to pay . students to infiltrate and spy on anti-fracking or educational campaign . groups, where there is zero suspicion of any wrongdoing, is a gross . abuse of surveillance powers. ‘Coming after attempts to discredit the . family of Stephen Lawrence and undercover officers fathering children . with activists this episode makes clear why the police should not be . able to approve their own undercover surveillance operations.’ ‘Were . it not such a stark reminder of the weak oversight of police . intelligence operations you’d be forgiven for thinking this was the plot . for a student film, albeit inspired more by David Brent than James . Bond.’ Rachel Wenstone, of the National Union of Students, said the move undermines the legitimate right to protest. She said: ‘This revelation is an absolute scandal. We now need to know just how widespread this practice is.’ Cambridge University Students’ Union said it was ‘absurd’ that its members were a focus for the police. A . spokesman said: ‘Tactics such as these are not only intrusive, they . also waste time targeting groups which are involved in making important . and positive change in our society.’ Cambridgeshire Police said: . Officers use covert tactics to gather intelligence, in accordance with . the law, to assist in the prevention and detection of criminal . activity.’","Undergraduate approached by detective filmed meeting on secret camera .

The Science Museum’s three-day festival celebrates 13 incredible robots from across Europe, many of which have gone on display for the first time. Scroll down for video . Bat-Bot uses extremely light artificial muscles to move. Its wings change shape during flight to efficiently manoeuvre. It was created by the Centre for Automatic and Robotics of the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Spain and will go on show for the first time in the UK . Visitors to the exhibition, which opens on November 27 and runs for a long weekend until December 1, can trek through the unnatural habitats of robots inspired by nature, interacting with creatures that swim, flap, and crawl, in a ‘unique’ safari experience. The exhibition includes an underwater turtle robot, a robotic cheetah-cub, a shoal of luminous robotic fish and the unveiling of Pleurobot, a mechanical salamander. Roboticists will demonstrate their robots from helping visitors interact with the fish to stretching the bat's wings, while explaining the latest developments in biomimetic robotics.

The robot was created to better understand how neural circuits . inside a salamander’s spinal cord enable movement . There are also lessons to help people programme, build and race their own simple robots. Nicola Burghall, Content Developer for Robot Safari at the museum, said: ‘Visitors to Robot Safari will see not just how nature can inspire innovative robotic designs, but also how these biomimetic robots are actually advancing our understanding of the animals and plants they mimic.’ The cheetah robot, may not look that much like its furry inspiration, but it mimics the cat’s legs so it can walk and trot.

Lightweight, compact and self-stabilising, the robot mimics a cat's legs and is currently being used to investigate the mechanics of cat locomotion . Lightweight and self-stabilising, the next-generation cat is not just a novelty item, but is a research tool that has the potential to be used by scientists to explore rough terrains. The robot, which is built by the robotics laboratory at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland, the cub is the fastest four-legged robot that weighs under 30kg, in the world and can run at 1.42 metres per second. The researchers are also debuting their robotic salamander – the Pleurobot – for the first time. Tallinn University of Technology, Centre for Biorobotics, Estonia, has created 'Arrows' - an archaeology robot designed to dive to dangerous depths. The robotic turtle can operate independently, inspecting wrecks for hours before resurfacing, and has not been shown in the UK before . Professor Auke Ijspeert of EPFL, said: ‘Cheetah-cub mimics much of cat morphology – featuring significant simplifications and better performance than traditional quadruped robots – while the salamander-like Pleurobot represents the next stage in our quest to understand how the nervous system controls rich movement. ‘We aim to use Pleurobot for paleontology and robotics research, as we attempt to bring early tetrapods to life.’ The Bat-Bot uses extremely light . artificial muscles to move and its wings change shape during flight, . while Robo Spyder moves like the real thing and can negotiate obstacles . as well as react to sound.

Plans for a multi-million pound ‘space port’ in Britain were yesterday enthusiastically backed by the science minister David Willetts. He hailed the ‘very exciting ambition’ to construct a mini UK Cape Canaveral as a launching base for space tourists and satellites into orbit within five years. Possible locations are already being considered in the West Country, Wales and Scotland, with the plan for around one mission blasting off a month. Future: A space port similar to Cape Canaveral in Florida could be built in Britain . The portal, which would cost hundreds of millions of pounds, would be entirely privately funded but the government would be required to change existing regulations because of the dangers of space travel. Mr Willets said he hoped it could provide a European hub for Sir Richard Branson to base his Virgin Galactic space tourism programme which intends to take passengers on suborbital joyrides for around £200,000 a time. He said: ‘The space portal is a very exciting ambition. ‘It’s very important that Britain is a driving force for the growth area of low cost space travel.’ He said possible locations included a former RAF base in Scotland or a site nearer to a commercial centre. Andy Green, Chairman of the UK Space Leadership Council said if built it would be near a coastal area. Plans: The new port could provide a European hub for Sir Richard Branson to base his Virgin Galactic space tourism programme . He said: ‘For a space portal you need to be beside a long body of open water where you can’t annoy anybody. ‘You don’t want to be launching over land. It’s much safer and better for people to running out to the sea. ‘What we are asking the government is not to fund the space portal but to set a regulatory regime that allows it to be delivered.’ ‘if you’ve got crafts going up into space they need to be coordinated with the Civil Aviation Authority and everything else that’s going on in our already crowded air space. ‘You definitely need to be prepared for a higher risk profile than you have in civil aviation. ‘When you go up into space things can sometimes go wrong. That’s life.’ He added: ‘It’s important to understand that the space portal is not just for people going for jaunts into space. ‘It would enable us to put up a range of satellites which would make it easier for us to expand broadband coverage, for example. Optimism: Mr Willets said the proposals were a 'very exciting ambition' ‘These sort of things could be resolved by low cost access to space.’ ‘There are groups of people debating the possible location. ‘The belief is there is a commercial opportunity. We believe 2018 is feasible.’ He spoke at the central London launch of the UK Space Growth Action Plan, which warned: ‘Access to space is a barrier to growth for UK companies as well as a commercial opportunity. ‘The ability of UK companies to secure timely launch slots is degreasing and launch costs are increasing... ‘The UK must take action now if it wishes to host commercial space flight.’ The UK Space Agency, CAA and two government departments are currently researching plans for safe commercial plane operations in the UK, and are due to report next summer. Tycoon Sir Richard revealed last month that his Virgin Galactic division has already sold 700 tickets for people to travel into space.

Shake up: Jeremy Hunt announced yesterday that elderly patients will be assigned a GP personally responsible for their care . Elderly patients are to be assigned a GP personally responsible for their care, Jeremy Hunt announced yesterday. In a radical shake-up of care for the nation’s four million over-75s, the Health Secretary also promised telephone consultations day and night. He said he was ripping up the controversial contract Labour struck with GPs in 2004 because it ‘broke’ the direct link between patient and practitioner. Writing on this page, the Health Secretary says a new contract will make sure elderly patients have a ‘strong, personal and regular relationship with their GP’. The GP will know their medical history and circumstances ‘just like the old family doctor knew everyone on their patch’. The reforms are expected to ease the huge pressures on casualty units. A third of emergency admissions are for over-75s and most of these could have been avoided with better primary care. Mr Hunt added: ‘Labour did terrible damage to out-of-hours care. Putting that right will take time. 'But this Government has a plan to do it. Today we take a step forward.’ Crucially, over-75s who want advice or reassurance will be guaranteed a same-day telephone consultation. Surgeries will be responsible for ensuring patients can get through at all hours of the day or night, with many expected to run a shift system staffed with doctors and practice nurses. Those that choose to contract out the service will be responsible for its quality – and subject to an inspection regime modelled on Ofsted’s oversight of schools. Round the clock care: In a radical shake-up of care for the nation¿s four million over-75s, the Health Secretary also promised telephone consultations day and night . The Health Secretary has created a new ‘chief inspector of GPs’ who he says will come down hard on surgeries that fail to provide a good service. Mr Hunt says this means that even if a GP is not on call at weekends or evenings ‘the buck stops’ with them: ‘This is about fixing the long-term pressures on our A&E services, and improving care for those with the greatest need.’ Under a deal agreed with doctors’ leaders yesterday, GPs’ new responsibilities will take effect from April. As well as offering patients same-day telephone consultations, they will have to coordinate care for elderly patients discharged from A&E and regularly review emergency admissions from care homes to avoid unnecessary call-outs in future. Paramedics, A&E doctors and care homes will have a dedicated telephone line run by a GP practice so they can advise on treatment. This avoids the need for a patient admitted to hospital having to undergo a barrage of unnecessary tests because their medical history is unknown. Future hopes: Mr Hunt says he hopes a similar service will eventually be offered to millions more patients, such as children or those with long-term conditions . Mr Hunt says he hopes a similar service will eventually be offered to millions more patients, such as children or those with long-term conditions. The trade-off for doctors is the scrapping of a series of ‘tick box’ targets they say hamper their  professional judgment and waste their time. Labour allowed GPs to opt out of responsibility for patients outside office hours – and at weekends – as part of the botched deal that came into force in 2004. hitting back: Andy Burnham, Labour¿s health spokesman, said: ¿No amount of spin can hide the fact that David Cameron has made it harder to get a GP appointment' Since then, private companies have taken over cover and in many cases have been forced to employ foreign doctors, often with little grasp of English. The Daily Mail has repeatedly highlighted the deterioration in the service since the contract was changed. The number of attendances at A&E has increased from 17.8million before the 2004 contract to 21.7million last year. Ministers say the rise has been fuelled by the failure of doctors to provide a good service around the clock. Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, said: ‘The BMA has sought to positively engage with the Government to address the difficult financial and workload pressures facing general practice in order to find new ways of improving patient care, while at the same time freeing up GPs and practice nurses from pointless bureaucracy. ‘Our agreement will deliver real benefit to patients and build on the work already carried out by GPs. ‘This will not only free up GPs to spend more time focusing on treating patients, but will also mean that valuable resources will be reinvested in general practice to improve frontline care.’ The deal also means patients will be able to book appointments or repeat a prescription online. But Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘No amount of spin can hide the fact that David Cameron has made it harder to get a GP appointment. 'There is nothing in this new contract to correct that. ‘David Cameron cut Labour’s scheme of evening and weekend opening and the guarantee of seeing a doctor within 48 hours. ‘This announcement will not put an end to patients phoning the surgery at 9am and finding it impossible to get an appointment many of whom, not happy with a phone consultation, will still turn to A&E.’ Taking a step forward: The Daily Mail is right to criticise Labour¿s 2004 GP contract. It broke the personal link between GP and patient, writes Jeremy Hunt . The Daily Mail is right to criticise Labour’s 2004 GP contract. It broke the personal link between GP and patient. It piled target after target on doctors – and many of these targets were useless and distorted clinical priorities. Over the past ten years, GPs have been de-professionalised – robbed of the right to make their own judgments and prevented from looking after their patients in the way they know best. Labour’s 2004 contract also took responsibility for out-of-hours care away from GPs. As a result, 90 per cent of GPs do not provide it. Inevitably, many people feel they have no choice when they want medical attention but to go to accident and emergency. This puts huge pressure on our A&Es, especially during winter. The Government has a plan to sort this out. Today, we are ripping up Labour’s old GP contract. A new contract has been agreed. Labour may have destroyed the family doctor, but this Government will bring them back. This is about fixing the long-term pressures on our A&E services, and giving elderly people the care and dignity they deserve. Our priority has been the over-75s. This is because around two thirds of over-75s are living with a long-term condition such as diabetes, asthma, or dementia. This can lead to preventable problems in A&E. One third of A&E visits are from over-75s, for example. Many of these would be avoided if there was proper GP care in the evenings and weekends. A&E staff don’t always know their underlying conditions or circumstances, or even where to discharge them to. Cutting queues: It is hoped the shake up will ease pressure on A&Es - a third of admissions are aged over 75 . That is the problem we have to solve. Our new GPs contract will make sure that Britain’s over-75s have a strong, personal and regular relationship with their GP. Their GP will know them, and their conditions and circumstances – just like the old family doctor knew everyone on their patch. But we also need to plan for the longer term. This is why Sir Bruce Keogh’s review of urgent and emergency care is so important. In fact it chimes with much of what the Daily Mail has been calling for. Sir Bruce wants to see a fundamental shift in provision of urgent care. Important: NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh's review of emergency care is much needed, according to Jeremy Hunt . He has called for more extensive services outside hospital (which will help reduce A&E queues) and for patients with life-threatening or serious conditions to be treated in centres with the best clinical teams, expertise and equipment. We know that certain conditions are better treated in fewer, more expert centres. For example, being treated in a stroke specialist centre reduces the chance of people dying. Quite rightly, Sir Bruce says this approach will give people peace of mind: knowing the NHS will be there for them when they need it. I know Daily Mail readers want that for their families. So do I. Along with the biggest reforms to the GP contract since 2004, this Government has a plan to invest £3.8billion in integrating health and care, to stop patients falling between the gaps. When elderly people have to go to hospital, there will now be quicker arrangements for their discharge – meaning more beds are free – and better arrangements when they come back, meaning fewer re-admissions. To help A&E doctors, paramedics and care homes know more about elderly patients when they are unwell, GPs will – with proper consent – share medical records. And they will be at the end of a dedicated telephone line for out-of-hours care. Better communication will be underpinned by a locally-led IT revolution. This will mean the NHS can be paperless by 2018. And it will contrast with the billions of pounds wasted by Labour on a top-down system that was a disastrous failure. The Daily Mail is absolutely right that Labour did terrible damage to out-of-hours care. Putting that right will take time. But this Government has a plan to do it. Today we take a step forward.","The Health Secretary also promised telephone consultations round the clock .

Bloodhound: Riley, pictured with veterinary nurse Rebecca Pearce, is thought to be one of the leading blood donor dogs in the US . Lifesaver: The crossbreed has helped save the live of hundreds of dogs by donating blood over the past seven years .

The dog donates every six weeks - the recommended time frame by vets - meaning he has donated the maximum amount of blood possible and saved more than 200 dogs' lives. With America's canine blood banks currently experiencing a shortage in supplies, more dogs like Riley are desperately needed, especially as he is close to retirement. Dogs will usually donate between 230cc and 430cc of blood, which, if they donate as regularly possible for the seven year donation period, means they can save between 112 and 224 lives. Given Riley's age, size and the frequency of his visits, it is believed he is one of the most prolific blood donating dogs in the country, with the biggest donor unknown. Helping hand: Donor handler Chris Oldt holds Riley down as a veterinary nurse prepares to take blood from the dog . Happy donor: Riley remains calm as the nurse begins to extract some of his blood . Result: The canine blood is stored in a freezer carton ready to be donated to a dog in need . Jocelyn Pratt, from the Blue Ridge Veterinary Blood Bank in Virginia, where Riley's blood is sent, estimates he has saved around 224 lives and counting. His owner, Deanna Wilson, 33, from Dunkirk in Maryland, USA, said: 'The first visit he spent in my lap - he was just a little unsure about what was going on and they just took a small sample for testing. 'Ever since then he has been fine and happily follows the vet out to the room. 'When he thinks we're going to donate he starts barking in the car close to the vet office in excitement. 'He actually pulls me into the donation room and jumps right up on the table. If he has to wait for another dog to finish, he'll bark to let them know he's ready for his turn. Devoted: Owner Deanna Wilson, pictured here with Riley, has been donating blood since he was one . She added: 'We think Riley can donate for another year - probably until he turns 9. We're so proud to think of all the other dogs he has been able to give a longer life to.' Dogs can replenish their blood in about three weeks so vet Jocelyn has dogs donate once every five to seven weeks to make it convenient for their owners. She said: 'Our schedule changes - sometimes it's seasonal, sometimes it relates to nationwide disasters.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has admitted he is a 'Neanderthal' who believes that men should not feel pressure to help bring up their own children. The outspoken tycoon has vowed to improve his airline's notorious customer service - but in a bullish interview, he compared himself to Jesus and insisted Ryanair only punishes customers who fail to comply with its rules. Mr O'Leary recently announced that Ryanair would introduce pre-assigned seating and overhaul its website in a bid to improve its reputation for rudeness to passengers. 'Neanderthal': Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has asserted his controversial traditionalist views . However, in an interview with The Times he showed that he had not completely reformed as he refused to back down from a number of controversial views. He said that having to grant male staff statutory paternity leave drives him 'mad', pointing out that he never took time off following the births of his four children. 'I don't want to be at home with young babies, breastfeeding and changing nappies,' he said. 'That is not my function in life. 'This bonding stuff is rubbish. Men tend to bond with their children when they are walking, talking, following football - then we have something to say to them.' He continued: 'What are men doing on the delivery ward? Once the contractions kick you are entirely bloody irrelevant.' No frills: Ryanair has developed a reputation for poor customer service despite its low fares . Couple: Mr O'Leary with his wife Anita, a former investment banker, at a racing meet in 2006 . Mr O'Leary, 52, added that although he thinks women should always have the opportunity to work, he believes most would prefer to raise their children instead. 'We sow the seed, women have the babies and after that we provide,' he said. 'Most women, if given the choice, would actually stop working when they have young children.' His wife Anita, 40, was an investment banker before giving up work to raise the couple's children. He also denounced metrosexual trends such as men using moisturiser or carrying 'man bags', saying: 'I'm certainly not a new man. Neanderthal more like.' The businessman has courted a reputation as a spiky, controversial figure, and he told The Times that most people see him as 'Jesus, Superman or an odious little s***'. He said that he considers himself to be most like Jesus - but joked that like the lead character in Life of Brian he is in fact 'a very naughty boy'. Queues: The airline penalises passengers who arrive at the airport without their boarding passes . Mr O'Leary admitted that the no-frills airline needs to improve its customer service, pledging to make its website easier to navigate and crack down on oversized fees for minor infringements such as forgetting a boarding pass. But he still placed the blame on passengers who fail to follow instructions: 'I have always said that the customers who comply with the rules are always right. 'They don't moan. It's the customer who shows up not having checked in online who is a nightmare.' He admitted he acts like a 'cheeky chappy', but said he never meant to be 'intentionally rude' and confessed that many of his outlandish suggestions about slashing services are nothing more than publicity stunts. 'I am soft, cuddly, misunderstood, with huge concern for my fellow human beings,' he said as he insisted Ryanair promoted European integration by making travelling cheaper. Mr O'Leary also used the interview to call for three new airport runways to be built as he criticised the HS2 rail line and insisted that global warming is a myth.","Michael O'Leary says most women prefer to stay at home raising children .

On June 4, an unsupported four-story wall crashed down onto a Philadelphia Salvation army, trapping workers and shoppers for 13 hours and killing six people. Despite an architect's warnings that the wall might collapse the night before, demolition contractor Griffin T. Campbell decided not to brace the wall in order to cut costs. He ended up cutting limbs. Mariya Plekan was one of those victims, and remembers being trapped in the store for 13 hours. She took the bus to Center City in Philadelphia hoping to find shopping deals, but found disaster instead. Her story was made public for the first time yesterday by her lawyers who are helping her to sue responsible parties. Mariya Plekan, who lost her legs after being pulled from the Salvation Army rubble, told her story for the first time yesterday . Now the twice Widowed Ukrainian woman will be in a wheelchair for the rest of her life after losing her legs to amputation after her bloodied body was pulled from the rubble by a rescue team. 'They started to move things around, then I had a hope, I had a hope that they will save me shortly. But it didn't happen,' she said. 'I was screaming, 'Help, help.' But nobody heard me. And I remember everything.' Philly.com reports that Common Pleas Judge Mark Bernstein put a stop on civil cases so that the criminal investigation could unfold, but he made an exception for Plekan due to her serious medical condition. She was caught beneath the rubble for 13 hours before a rescue dog heard her cries for help . Her Lawyer Andy Stern of the Kline & Specter firm was there with her on Wednesday night as she spoke through a translator. Stern said her medical bills are already millions of dollars and will continue to rise. 'I was looking through the clothes and all of a sudden I heard the noise,' said Plekan, 52. 'And the only thing that I had a chance to say is, 'Why?' and the roof collapsed. . . . And my limbs, my legs were pinned down,' she continued. Plekan said she was stuck under the rubble but that she could see a tiny light and was able to hear distant voices of the rescue team above her. She cried for help but no one heard her at first. Finally, a search dog heard her cries and led a firefighter towards her. 'The . dog followed my yell...And they started pulling things apart and they . pulled me out. And I didn't realize that it was night because the . spotlights were on. I was so happy that I was saved,' she said. The collapse could have been prevented if the 40 foot free standing wall had been secured the night before . She was a healthy mother of two and grandmother before she was brutally injured during the building collapse . 'My children and my granddaughter - because of them, I want to live, I want to live,' she said. 'But it's so hard. 'Pain, pain, pain, and that pain is still going on . . . the pain of my flesh, but as well of my soul,' she lamented. 'I have a normal memory and I have a normal understanding of how I am living right now. And every day I understand how hard it is to be without legs. When you cannot take care of yourself when you constantly depend on other people to take care of you, and I do not know how to live after that because it's so hard for me,'she told lawyers. Griffin T. Campbell and his team of . demolition workers never warned the Salvation Army of possible dangers. Had the building been deemed unsafe, Plekan said she would not have . entered. A lawyer for . the Salvation Army, Eric Weiss, told Philly.com that the building's . owner Richard Basciano is also to blame for the collapse. 'They never gave the Salvation Army a chance and they never told the Salvation Army that they had a change in plans,' he said. Griffin T. Campbell has been charged with murder, manslaughter and reckless endangerment after choosing 'greed' over safety . There was a huge communication issue between Basciano's company, STB investments, and the Salvation Army. Salvation Army reps were communicating with STB  out of New York and couldn't see STB's unsafe methods. Lawyers are ensuring that those responsible for the tragedy are persecuted. Griffin T Campbell, The contractor who oversaw a botched building demolition that killed six people in a Salvation Army thrift store in Philadelphia has been charged with murder, manslaughter and reckless endangerment after choosing 'greed' over safety. Griffin T. Campbell was also charged with risking a catastrophe and criminal conspiracy in addition to the six counts of third-degree murder, six counts of involuntary manslaughter and 13 counts of endangerment. Campbell alone chose the demolition method, cutting corners to meet a deadline and cut costs, as he was being paid a flat fee, Williams said. He was also given the right to salvage floor joints and other material, so he pulled the valuable floor joists out first, destabilizing the exterior walls, Williams said.There was also no scaffolding in place to remove an unsupported 40-foot brick wall, which tumbled onto the one-story thrift store, burying the six dead and 13 survivors. Basciano's architect, Plato Marinakos, who had secured the demolition permit, testified before the grand jury after he was promised immunity. Basciano, once dubbed the pornography king of New York's Times Square, owned the three run-down storefronts being razed. Several lawsuits have been filed against Basciano, a commercial developer hoping to redevelop the block, along with Campbell, Benschop and others. The victims' lawyers also accuse the city of lax oversight of the demolition process, but the city is generally immune from such lawsuits. One of the victims was the 24-year-old daughter of the city treasurer. Building owner Richard Basciano was not charged with any crimes Monday, and Williams declined to comment on his fate. However, the grand jury will continue to hear evidence in the case.","Mariya Plekan told her story for the first time yesterday in an effort to help sue those responsible for the collapse .

The King is depicted as Charles II, who was on the throne . Made by well-known map maker Robert Morden in 1676 each card has the name of the county at the top, along with the card number on the left, translated into large Roman numerals on the right. The face cards feature King Charles II, his wife, Catherine of Braganza, as the Queen, and various male heads on the Jack cards. The decorative playing cards feature a map of each county along with a list of data including width, breadth and circumference. Catherine Slowther, maps and atlases expert at Sotheby’s auction house, who are selling the cards, said: 'The first set of playing cards bearing maps of English and Welsh counties was thought to have been produced by William Bowes in 1590. While the cards had some educational value they were mostly made for decoration and as a way for cartographers such as Morden to make money . 'As playing cards were normally a gambling device, one might not expect to find them adapted to educational uses. 'The output of playing cards was seriously curtailed in Cromwellian times, when both cards and play were regarded as sinful. 'This puritanical attitude resulted in the wholesale destruction of many fine sets of cards.' The cards were owned by the former head of the World Bridge Federation Jaime “Jimmy” Ortiz-Patino, who also created the Valderrama golf course in Spain. A previous set made in 1590 also featured pictures of counties, but with nowhere near as much detail and without road networks . The previous set produced by Bowes featured green ink drawings of counties, though without roads or cities, and a bit of detail about each, with the four suits are represented in a pattern around image. The eight introductory cards have the royal arms of Elizabeth I, a portrait of Elizabeth, a map of England and Wales, and a bird's-eye plan of London. Four text-only cards describe the history, governance and character of England. The 1676 deck will be auctioned at Sotheby's next week.","Robert Morden, a map maker, created the cards in 1676 .

'Thrill kill': Colin Lowrey, 22, is charged with what prosecutors say was the 'thrill' killing of 23-year-old Las Vegas woman Cherish Pincombe on October 22 as a still unknown person watched on video chat site . A Nevada Army reservist will stand trial for murder in the October 22 ‘thrill kill’ in which he shot his friend in the head as an anonymous stranger watched on a video chat site. Colin Lowrey, 22, told police he and Cherish Pincombe were using the worldwide video chat website Omegle.com at his Henderson home when the 23-year-old Nevada woman was killed. Authorities say somebody in the world witnessed the shooting, but they don’t know who. Lowrey is charged with knowingly killing Pincombe despite telling police he believed the gun was not loaded. The Las Vegas Review Journal reports . that police subpoenaed Portland, Oregon-based Omegle.com for footage of . the chat turned deadly. They received snapshots, but only of chats that involved Pincombe, Lowrey, and one of Lowrey’s three roommates, Patrick Duffy. Officer . Chad Mitchell, who responded to the scene and interviewed Lowrey and . his roommates, said the snapshots revealed little because ‘everything . looked happy.’ None of Lowrey’s roommates actually saw the alleged crime. But Mitchell maintains there was at least one witness. And they saw it on their computer monitor. Murdered? Pincombe was shot in the head with a .45 caliber handgun at close range at Lowrey's Henderson, Nevada home. She was rushed to an area hospital and died shortly thereafter . 'Somebody saw the gun discharge': Police and Lowrey say there was an active chat window open on the worldwide video site Omegle.com, but the witness could be anyone, anywhere in the world . ‘Somebody saw the gun discharge,’ he testified in a Henderson court on Monday. ‘There was an active chat going on.’ Lowrey told police Pincombe’s death was just the unfortunate outcome of a game gone terribly wrong. He . told detectives he and Pincombe were chatting with a girl who said she . was from Norway. He said she asked if they had any guns. That’s when he retrieved a rifle and a .45 caliber handgun. Prosecutors said at the Monday hearing they are ‘looking at this more as a ‘thrill kill’ than an accidental death.’ Lowrey’s . roommates testified that everyone in the house, including Lowrey, had a . playful relationship with Pincombe. Duffy told the court he’d never . seen Pincombe angry at Lowrey. Premeditated? Lowrey, a Nevada Army reservist, told police he didn't know the gun was loaded when he pulled the trigger but investigators believe that he slipped a magazine into the handgun unbeknownst to Pincombe . Mystery: Lowrey claims the deadly game began when they were chatting with a girl from Norway, who asked the Americans if they had any guns. But he says that's not who saw the gun go off . Lowrey’s . attorney Stephen Stein used the testimony in an attempt to argue his . client should be tried for involuntary manslaughter. ‘I heard no evidence whatsoever of premeditation, and I heard no evidence whatsoever of malice,’ Stein said. The judge disagreed and ordered he be tried in on an open murder charge. Lowrey remained in jail in lieu of $200,000 bail. An arraignment was set for December 10. He claims he left the weapon with Pincombe and then went to the bathroom. When he returned, he says she asked him to point it at her head, presumably as a joke. ‘Without her asking, he decided he would pull the trigger,’ Mitchell told the court of Justice of the Peace Rodney Burr. While Lowrey claims he still thought the gun wasn’t loaded, investigators think he likely took it with him to the bathroom where he inserted the magazine. By the time Pincombe was shot, Lowrey . believes they were chatting with someone new, not the girl from Norway . who started the deadly game. But as of Monday’s hearing, investigators were still at a loss as to who that witness was.

NFTA bus driver Darnell Barton poses in front of a bus in Buffalo, N.Y. He has been awarded $10,000 from Donald Trump for saving a woman's life . Donald Trump heard about the incident and wrote a letter to Barton, saying he should be rewarded . Although Trump didn't personally hand Barton the reward check, the $10,000 was passed through Mayor Byron W. Brown's office to be handed to the bus driver. Trump wrote: 'Although I know to you it was just a warm-hearted first response to a dangerous situation... it saved her life.' Barton was also interviewed by celebrity chef Rachael Ray on Wednesday for her daytime TV show. Barton has not spoken to the woman he helped save since the incident, but says he plans to do so when the situation deserves. He has not yet decided what to do with his check but has spoken of starting a foundation. 'I have my personal executive board, called my wife. We haven't sat down and had an opportunity to plan or anything of that nature yet', he said to the Buffalo News. After the incident in October, Barton said: 'It didn't seem real because what was going on around, traffic and pedestrians were going by as normal.

Trick: 'Bogus princess' Sarah Al Amoudi, outside the High Court at a previous hearing, and today she has been accused of faking a foreign accent to influence a judge in her £14m fraud case . A self-styled Saudi princess is being sued for £14million by former associates who say she faked a 'ridiculous' accent to bamboozle a judge in her fraud case, the High Court heard. Sarah Al Amoudi is accused by developers Amanda Clutterbuck and Ian Paton of being an ex-prostitute who tricked them into transferring six prime London properties into her name. They claim she posed as the daughter of a billionaire Saudi sheikh to pull off an elaborate scam. But Al Amoudi claims her wealth and royal status is genuine, with pocket money of £100,000-a-week secretly sent from Saudi Arabia to London in suitcases by her mother. On one occasion she said she spent £1million on perfume, and told the judge she had the receipts to prove it. In the latest twist in a long-running legal battle, Barrister Stuart Cakebread, for Ms Clutterbuck and Mr Paton, has accused her of faking her accent in court. Reminding Mrs Justice Asplin of the 'ridiculous pidgin English which [Miss Al Amoudi] adopted in her evidence', he said: 'I invite a finding that that was an act which she put on for your benefit.' The so-called 'vamp in the veil' claims the string of Knightsbridge properties, which Mr Paton transferred into her name, are rightly hers in settlement of a massive debt he owed to her. Miss Al Amoudi, who usually arrives at court in a Rolls Royce Phantom with 'HRH' registration plates, earlier told the court in evidence that she had handed large sums of money to Mr Paton, but not received all of it back. Aggrieved: Business partners Amanda Clutterbuck . and Ian Paton say that Miss Al Amoudi tricked them into transferring . homes into her name in an elaborate fraud . Accused: Sara Al Amoudi, pictured with her bodyguard, told the court in evidence that she had handed large sums of money to Mr Paton, but not received all of it back . Expensive: Al Amoudi has regularly turned up to court in a Rolls Royce with a personalised number plate, and says her royal mother sends cash stuffed in suitcases to London . She said she had regular deliveries of cash from rich relatives in Saudi Arabia, which she kept under her bed and some of which she gave to Mr Paton to look after for her. Shrouded: Al Amoudi leaves the High Court with her retinue . Reading and writing very limited English and without a bank account, she had come to trust Mr Paton, with whom she claims to have had a long-lasting affair, more and more with her money, she said. But Mr Cakebread told the London court today: 'It is a farrago of lies: lie upon lie upon lie to cover up the truth.' Miss Al Amoudi, whose age is variously reported as between 30 and the mid-40s, had claimed in court that she could not reveal the name of her husband, because it might put her in danger, he continued. 'This is the most preposterous nonsense,' said the barrister. 'This is a lady who drives around in the most identifiable car in London and with bodyguards to make sure no one makes a mistake about who she is. 'It is all part of this absurd performance where she pretends to be a Saudi princess, pretends to be in danger, and that gives her exemption from answering questions that might unfortunately show she might be a liar.' In July the mysterious ‘princess’ wept in court as she assured the judge she had never been an impoverished prostitute, that her wealth was genuine and that she had been on the shopping sprees to prove it. Miss Al Amoudi told judge Sarah Asplin her shopping addiction was so serious she had sought medical help. In heavily accented English, Miss Al Amoudi said: ‘I have a problem with shopping – I go to doctor. In the last two months my perfume, only the perfume – $1.4million (£912,000). I can show you the pictures.’ Miss Al Amoudi arrived at court in a full burka and five-inch platform heels. At the suggestion of the judge she removed her veil in the witness box, but still attempted to keep her face hidden from onlookers. She claims she had an affair with her alleged victim Mr Paton, 45, behind the back of his lover and business partner Ms Clutterbuck, 56, and that he borrowed and stole some £5million of pocket money she received from Saudi Arabia. Giving evidence in the summer, Mr Paton denied having an affair with Miss Al Amoudi. The hearing continues.","Sara Al Amoudi is accused of posing as a Saudi royal to con two developers .

A judge said the crew were like 'rabbits in headlights' A Royal Navy lieutenant who became an internet hit after he crashed his racing yacht into a bright red 870ft oil tanker was today ordered to pay more than £100,000. Roland Wilson, 32, was the skipper on the 33ft pink-sailed yacht Atalanta of Chester, which he 'inexplicably' allowed to collide with the Hanne Knutsen tanker - despite seeing it from five miles away. The yacht’s crew comprised Royal Navy officers with experience in some of the world’s most prestigious sailing races, including the Fastnet and Sydney-Hobart race. But they failed to predict the tanker’s movements off the coast of the Isle of Wight, Southampton Magistrates’ Court heard, despite seeing it almost 15 minutes earlier. By the time married father-of-one Wilson, from Stanley, Perthshire, realised his predicament, he and the crew were 'like rabbits in the headlights'. One crew member, a Navy commander, jumped overboard while another, a serving petty officer, was taken to hospital with head injuries. Footage of the incident, which happened on the first day of world-famous Cowes Week racing regatta in August 2011, went viral and has now been viewed almost one million times. The crash ripped off the yacht's mast in front of thousands of spectators, many of whom can be heard gasping in shock in the video. Wilson denied charges of contravening naval regulations while responsible for a vessel, telling the court the tanker had sounded its horn to indicate it would turn to starboard but then did not, leaving him in front of it. District Judge Anthony Callaway, himself a keen sailor, confessed it was an 'isolated incident' and it was unlikely anybody could have 'fielded a better team, at least on paper'. But he said the accident should have been easily avoided, adding: 'Anyone in the eastern Solent that afternoon would have seen the tanker.' Wilson was today fined £3,000 after he was convicted of three counts of breaking maritime regulations, and made to pay the full prosecution costs of £100,000 - much of them incurred by expert witnesses reconstructing his route. Scroll down for video . 'Infamous' footage of the crash shows Wilson's boat, Atlanta of Chester, sailing close to the 870ft oil tanker during the first day of Cowes Week racing regatta in August 2011. Spectators can be heard gasping . The footage then shows Wilson's yacht hitting the tanker, ripping off the mast and the pink sail . He told the court he had no formal yachting qualifications but claimed: 'Experience is more important than paper qualifications.' The court heard Wilson, a Durham University physics graduate, can no longer afford to sail the Atalanta because he no longer has a job and is living off savings. He gave no comment outside court. The judge questioned why the crew had sailed into danger rather than away from it, and criticised them for not starting their engine to motor away from the vessel despite having 'plenty of time' to do so. Judge Callaway said: 'This was a serious yacht, crewed by serious people, who were in the regatta for a serious purpose. They were well-equipped in terms of their experience and ability to deal with any situation. 'This was not some Saturday afternoon jaunt by some inadequate vessel, crewed by inexperienced, clueless, and foolhardy people, who frankly have no business being on the water at all. 'The potential for even greater and tragic consequences is in my judgement apparent.' He said, however, that Cowes Week as a whole was safe. 'Attempts to call into question Cowes Week in its present form are unjustified and unnecessary,' he said. He added it was 'exceptionally busy' in the Solent at the time and said: 'Nobody sets out in Cowes Week to have a collision, let alone with a tanker.' Responsibility for the incident lay entirely with the skipper and not the event's organisers, he said. Solent shipping by-laws prevent yachts sailing any closer than 0.6 miles in front and 328ft either side of a vessel longer than 492ft. Yet the court heard the yacht crew had spotted the 120,000-tonne tanker up to 15 minutes before the collision. One crew member abandoned ship and another suffered head injuries in the collision with the Hanne Knutsen . Spectators can be heard screaming in video of the collision as the mast of the yacht snapped . Prosecutor Charles Row said the incident 'could potentially have catastrophic consequences resulting in manslaughter or death as a result of an unlawful act.' David Giddings, then principal race officer at Cowes, described visibility on the day as 'very good' said he had not seen a similar incident in 20 years. Maritime Coastguard Agency expert Roger Towner had also branded Wilson’s actions 'inexplicable', saying the eight-man crew broke 'all the rules of the road'. Captain Jeremy Smart, head of enforcement with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, said after the case: 'It was very fortunate that Mr Wilson’s actions did not result in very tragic consequences. 'This case should serve as a reminder to all who use the water that a good lookout, a full appraisal of the situation and early action is essential to avoid incidents like this.' The court heard Wilson joined the Royal Navy in 2006 and left in February this year, but remains a reservist. The day of the collision was the fifth time he had raced at Cowes and he had a flat on the Isle of Wight overlooking the Solent. He said he had a short-lived position at financial services company Credit Suisse after he left the Navy, until the impending court case came to light. He is now working on new designs for inflatable boats. Wilson was fined £2,000 for one offence of failing to keep a proper lookout, and £500 each for two offences of impeding the passage of a vessel. He was ordered to pay a £15 victim surcharge and full prosecution costs of £100,056.68.","Roland Wilson, 32, crashed the yacht despite seeing tanker five miles away .

Tragic: Hilda Fairweather, who froze to death in the grounds of the care home were she lived after staff failed to notice she gone missing or carry out checks . A 91-year-old woman with dementia froze to death in the grounds of the care home where she lived after being 'completely overlooked' by staff, a court heard. Hilda Fairweather was not reported missing from the Abele View home in Iverley, near Stourbridge, West Midlands, until the morning after she wandered outside through a fire door. Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard that only two staff were looking after 29 residents on the freezing January night in 2009 when Mrs Fairweather died of hypothermia. Although the fire door was found ajar shortly after Mrs Fairweather disappeared, the court heard a head count - which would have taken seven minutes - was not carried out. Checks on her scheduled for during the night were not done and staff didn't even realise they'd failed to put her to bed. The company that owns the home, Abele View Ltd, pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to failing to ensure the safety of its residents and making an insufficient risk assessment. Today it was fined £133,000 and ordered to pay £122,412 in costs. Prosecutor Bernard Thorogood said the safety breaches at the isolated home were committed despite numerous previous incidents in which confused residents had wandered off. On one previous occasion an elderly man had left the building barefoot and plunged into a ditch, the court heard. Mrs Fairweather, originally from Kidderminster, was last seen by staff at 7.30pm on January 29, 2009, and was found dead at 7.45am the following morning. Mr Thorogood told the court: 'In the intervening time she should have been put to bed, and she should have been checked for other purposes through the night.' Records which should have shown the scheduled checks were missing, said Mr Thorogood, who outlined 18 instances of 'accepted criminality' on behalf of Abele View. As well as accepting that its failures caused Mrs Fairweather’s death, Abele View also acknowledges it had inadequate staffing levels, and that risks were created by poor supervision and management. Previous incidents in which residents were allowed to wander off represented a series of wake-up calls for the home and its management, Mr Thorogood said. utlining how Mrs Fairweather’s absence went unnoticed, Mr Thorogood told the court: 'The sad and deeply unattractive facts are that she had frozen to death outside the home on a freezing night in January when she should not have been able to get out. 'For a variety of reasons she should have had substantial contact with the staff through the night.' The lawyer, prosecuting on behalf of South Staffordshire District Council, added: 'The fault here that is accepted is a corporate fault. 'We submit it goes right to the top of this company. Any attempt to blame individual staff failings would not be right - this came from the top.'","Hilda Fairweather wandered out on a freezing January evening .

A 39-year-old man pimped a teenage runaway out on Craigslist for more than two years in exchange for meth and cash until she escaped by jumping out of a speeding car, police said today. Robert Felix Gonzales, from Denver, was charged on Thursday with multiple violent and sex crimes, including trafficking in children and sexual assault. Investigators say he met the girl when she was 14 and living with a foster family. The grandmother told Arvada police that the teen ran away but lived with Gonzales during 2011 and 'had been approved by social services'. Gonzalez is accused of having sex with her and later pimping her on Craigslist to at least 30 strangers in various hotels throughout the district. Pimp or boyfriend? Robert Felix Gonzales has been accused of prostituting a teenage runaway for nearly two years until she escaped by jumping out of his speeding car . According to the Denver Post, investigators repeatedly tried to rescue the girl but they say she would always return to Gonzalez - who would keep her hidden behind a false wall in his basement. The teen eventually jumped out of the car to escape Gonzales in July, but initially wouldn't cooperate with authorities. In September of this year she confided in them. She said she met the 39-year-old through her foster family and fell in love with him. She believed he had the same feelings but shortly after they ran away together things changed. He would make her stay in motels, give her drugs and alcohol, have sex with her and often have men join in their sexual encounter, according to the affidavit. He started to advertise her on Craigslist and often used naked pictures of her, she said, adding that Gonzales assaulted her if she tried to refuse and that he . participated in approximately one-quarter of the sex acts. The Denver Post reports that Gozalez would beat her so hard he broke his hand after hitting her face with such force. Hideout: Police were called to Gonzalez's home several times but could never find the teen because he had erected a false wall and hid her behind it in a crawlspace . The teen told police she would accompany him to the hospital and though she had visible cuts and bruises, no one ever treated her or asked her about anything. She was finally rescued from Gonzalez's home on July 25, 2012, and was placed in a group home - which she also ran away from. One officer noted while he was interviewing her that she had the same tattoo as Gonzalez - a Chinese symbol which means 'eternity'. Gonzalez was arrested and pleaded guilty to harboring a minor in May of this year. On July 24, he was sentenced to three years' probation with a suspended jail sentence. It was two days prior to this the teen jumped from his speeding car, saying she had had enough of being used. She only told police about the relationship in September. Gonzalez is being held at the Jefferson County Jail on a $500,000 bond. He has been charged with trafficking in children, pandering of a child, two counts of a pattern of sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust, soliciting for child prostitution, procurement of a child, keeping a place of child prostitution, pimping of a child, inducement of child prostitution, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, harboring a minor and four counts of committing a violent crime.","The teen told police she was in love with Robert Felix Gonzalez and ran away to be with him .

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is in line for a £17 million windfall from the sale of his private company, which will make him the richest millionaire in Cabinet. The Tory minister is close to striking a deal to sell Hotcourses, an education listing service set up by Mr Hunt before he became an MP. Private equity firm Inflexion is believed to be the potential buyer, with a rumoured offer of £35 million. Windfall: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is in line for a £17million payout when his firm Hotcourses is sold . Mr Hunt, MP for South West Surrey, is believed to own just under half the company, which means he would get around £17 million if the takeover is completed. But the revelation sparked debate about whether millionaire ministers could relate to ordinary families struggling with soaring bills. The Prime Minister’s spokesman refused to comment on the sale, but said: ‘One of the strengths the Prime Minister points to in the Cabinet is the range of experience reflected within it.’ Analysis of the government's senior figures reveals they are worth tens of millions of pounds between them. If Jeremy Hunt does net £17million from the Hotcourses deal, he would easily become the richest person at the Cabinet table.  The current value of the 10 wealthiest cabinet ministers is: . 1. Philip Hammond £8.2m . 2. William Hague £4.8m . 3. Jeremy Hunt £4.8m . 4. George Osborne £4.5m . 5. David Cameron £3.8m . 6. Francis Maude £3.2m . 7. Dominic Grieve £2.9m . 8. Nick Clegg £2m . 9. Theresa May £1.8m . 10. Owen Paterson £1.7m . (Source: Wealth-X, May 2012) Asked if he believed wealthy ministers . should be ‘philanthropic’, he said: ‘The Prime Minister thinks one of . the strengths of Britain is a long tradition of charitable patronage.’ Unlike others in the Cabinet – including Chancellor George Osborne and David Cameron - Mr Hunt’s wealth is self-made rather than inherited. His father, Sir Nicholas, was an admiral in the Navy and Mr Hunt attended the private Charterhouse school before going on to get a first from Oxford. After working as a management consultant, he moved to Japan to teach English. While living in the Far East, he came up with the idea of the listings business. He helped to set up the firm in 1996 with his childhood friend, Mike Elms, but stood down as director in 2009. Hotcourses employs more than 200 people. In six months, its turnover was £6.5 million, with pre-ta profits of just under £2 million. Mr Hunt has reaped dividends from the firm and his fortune was estimated at £4.8 million by the consultancy Wealth-X last year. If Mr Hunt sells his stake, his wealth will balloon to more than £20 million – putting him ahead of the current richest Cabinet minister, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond who is worth around £8.2 million.

A former soldier who lost his right eye after being shot by a rogue Afghan policeman in Helmand province has been warned he faces a 'significant' jail sentence after admitting killing his 19-month-old daughter. Liam Culverhouse, 25, who at the time was a Lance Corporal, was injured at an Afghan National Police checkpoint in Nad-e-Ali in November 2009. Five of his comrades were killed in the attack. Eighteen months after returning home, Culverhouse assaulted his then seven-week-old daughter Khloe Abrams at the family home in Northampton. She was left fighting for her life in hospital for nearly 18 months. Liam Culverhouse (above) has been warned he faces a 'significant' jail sentence after admitting killing his 19-month-old daughter, Khloe Abrams. Culverhouse lost his right eye during a rogue attack at an Afghan National Police checkpoint in Nad-e-Ali, Helmand province, in November 2009 . Culverhouse pleaded guilty to causing or allowing the death of the toddler at Nottingham Crown Court . Today at Nottingham Crown Court, Culverhouse, who was medically discharged from the Army in April, pleaded guilty to causing or allowing the death of the toddler. Khloe was admitted to Northampton General Hospital on May 8, 2011 with severe injuries. She never recovered and died at the Rainbow Children’s Hospice in Loughborough on November 7 last year. In a statement, Northamptonshire Police said: 'Khloe Abrams died at the Rainbow Children’s Hospice in Loughborough on November 7, 2012. She was 19 months old. 'Khloe died as a result of a severe trauma following an assault which took place in May 2011 when she was seven weeks old.' Acting Corporal Steven Boote of the Royal .

Nad-e-Ali, Helmand province . Warrant Officer Class 1 Darren Chant, who was also one of five soldiers shot and killed by a 'rogue' Afghan policeman . Culverhouse, of Kingsthorpe, Northampton, appeared in the dock at Nottingham Crown Court today alongside his former partner, Khloe’s mother Clare Abrams. Wearing a black suit with blue shirt and tie, he showed no emotion during the hearing. Sally Howes QC, prosecuting, told the court Culverhouse had pleaded guilty 'to causing or allowing the death of Khloe Abrams under the heading of causing the death of Khloe Abrams'. She said: 'Mr Culverhouse is accepting that he is responsible for the unlawful act that caused the death of the child.' No details of the assault were heard in court. Miss Abrams, wearing a black suit and . pink top, pleaded not guilty to the joint charge of causing or allowing . the death of her daughter. After a review of the evidence, Miss Abrams, of Abington, Northampton, was cleared of the charge. Miss Howes said: 'The Crown would . offer no evidence against Miss Abrams in relation to these counts and . invite a verdict of not guilty.' A documentary on the attacks in Afghanistan in which Culverhouse was injured featured footage of the critical care air support team treating the Grenadier Guards injured . David Howell, defending Culverhouse, told the court his client was an ex-member of the military who had suffered extensive injuries as a result of operational service in Afghanistan in 2009, including the loss of his right eye. Culverhouse was granted bail to allow him to receive rehabilitation support, the court heard. Adjourning the hearing for pre-sentence and medical reports, the judge Mr Justice Jeremy Baker told Culverhouse: 'Please understand, and I am sure you do, it is extremely likely you will be facing a significant custodial sentence when you return to court.' Culverhouse will be sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court in December. In March 2010 he appeared in a Channel 4 documentary in which he told how he played dead during the attack in Afghanistan when the gunman shot him six times in his face and both arms and legs as he tried to escape. 'Please understand, and I am sure you do, . it is extremely likely you will be facing a significant custodial . sentence when you return to court' - Mr Justice Jeremy Baker . He described the moment he heard the footsteps of the gunman pacing over to him to make sure he was dead. The shootings sent shockwaves through the Nato mission in Afghanistan. Those killed in the shooting were Warrant Officer Class 1 Darren Chant, 40, Sergeant Matthew Telford, 37, and Guardsman Jimmy Major, 18, of the Grenadier Guards, and Corporal Steven Boote, 22, and Corporal Nicholas Webster-Smith, 24, of the Royal Military Police. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the killings but British military sources suggested it was more likely that the incident was a one-off and unconnected to insurgents. The rogue gunman has never been caught. Doctors attend to one of the soldiers lying on an air ambulance stretcher following the attack in which Culverhouse lost his right eye . In the documentary, Culverhouse said he and his colleagues picked up a 'funny atmosphere' at the checkpoint before the shooting but could not have predicted what happened. The soldier revealed that the troops were having a competition to see who could catch the most mice when the policeman opened fire. He said: 'I remember getting hit in the face with something and I remember shouting and swearing. 'I remember saying, ""f****** hell, what was that?"" and I covered my face and turned around to see the back of an Afghan, one of the police officers, shooting the lads.'","Liam Culverhouse pleaded guilty to causing or allowing death of toddler .

A millionairess dentist whose 'strong mutual antipathy’ with her 'controlling' former mother-in-law took them to the High Court has won a key dispute at the heart of her bitter divorce battle. Anushika Sharma, 36, and her 45-year-old former husband Sunny, worked . together running their ‘niche’ dentistry business and are believed to . have had assets worth up to £10million. They raised two children together as their empire of 12 practices spread across London and the Home Counties. When the couple divorced last year, Mrs Sharma took ownership of seven of them, which upset him and Mr Sharma's ‘strong-willed’ mother Kesh Sharma. Divorce battle: Dr Anushika Sharma has won a High Court wrangle after an 'acrimonious divorce' battle with her ex-husband Sunny, right, and his 'controlling' mother . But Mr Sharma insisted that five of those surgeries belonged to them, but the High Court today said they did not agree. Anushika's barrister, Alan Gourgey QC, told the court about the deep rift between her and her mother-in-law at the heart of the expensive court battle. 'At . the heart of the case, lay a strong mutual antipathy between two very . strong-willed women, the husband's mother Kesh and the wife,' he said. 'Kesh . had been the driving force of the Sharma family businesses and she held . a dominant and highly controlling position within the Sharma . family...she expected deference from her family, which she regarded as . her due, both as a mother and one of the founders of the family . fortune.' Richard Snowden QC, for Kesh and her sons, confirmed that Anushika was 'a daughter-in-law for whom she had no warm feelings.' Family breakdown: The High Court heard that at the heart of the legal row was 'strong mutual antipathy' between Anushika Sharma and her mother-in-law Kesh Sharma . Today judges sided with the younger party and handed her victory. Mr Justice Jackson said the business had depended on her dentistry expertise and her husband’s family had invested no capital and 'no more than minimal effort' in the venture. Decision: The judge ruled Anushika should keep seven of the practices because the other side made 'no more than minimal effort' in the venture . The case hinged on what was said at a 2007 family meeting at which it was agreed to set up a company - Aspire Dental Care Limited (ADC) - of which Anushika would be sole director. The shares in the company were to split in quarters between Anushika, Kesh, Sunny and his brother, Raj. Over the next few years, Anushika was enormously successful in building the business, buying or setting up a string of practices on behalf of the company. However, she also took on five surgeries herself and they were the focus of the family mud-slinging in court. Anushika said she had started her own 'parallel' company, alongside ADC, to escape 'interference' in her commercial affairs by her 'dominant and highly controlling mother-in-law'. However, Kesh and her sons insisted she had violated her duty as a director by going it alone instead of working for the benefit of ADC. As 75 per cent shareholders, they said they were entitled to the lion’s share of the five practices. However, dismissing their appeal, Mr Justice Jackson said it had been agreed at the meeting that Anushika would 'run the company as she saw fit'. Observing that the whole set-up was 'extraordinarily favourable' to Kesh and her sons, he added: 'They were receiving 75% of the shares of a potentially valuable company in which they were investing neither capital nor more than minimal effort'. Anushika not only had clinical control over the business, but also responsbility for its day-to-day management, and her view that “she did not need Kesh’s permission” to acquire new surgeries for herself was “perfectly understandable”. He concluded that Kesh and her sons had 'with full knowledge of the material facts, acquiesced in an arrangement whereby Anushika would be free to acquire some dental practices for the company and others for herself'.","Feud centred on Dr Anushika Sharma and her mother-in-law Kesh Sharma .

An artist has explored the light and dark aspects of human character by shooting real-life representations of chess pieces. Italian portrait photographer Francesco Ridolfi's Chess Portraits fine art series sees pieces including the Queen, King and Knight bought to life. He shot the same models in contrasting white and black outfits as a ‘set of archetypes that convey different aspects of human nature’. Rooky: Italian photographer Mr Ridolfi has brought chess pieces to life with a series of stunning portraits . The Italian-born snapper spent nine months working on the project, carefully choosing which costumes to use . The photographer explained that he's always been very interested in chess - but he's not an expert . It took nine months to realise the project, including researching the right period costume for each of the twelve characters. Mr Ridolfi said: ‘I have always been fascinated about Chess. When I was a child, my father taught me the rules of the game and we used to play together. That said, I'm certainly not an expert on it, but still today I love to play chess with friends. So, probably this is the roots of the whole idea. ‘The idea to humanise the different pieces of the chess board came to me probably a couple of years ago, and it took a while to grow and shape in my mind. Mr Ridolfi was keen to explore the light and dark sides of human nature - the dualism that exists in us all . Pawn broker: Mr Ridolfi said he had great fun - and it was inspirational - choosing all the costumes . Mr Ridolfi divides his time between Italy - he was born in Bologna - and Belgium and often shoots adverts . ‘To me, the most interesting part of the whole project was the possibility to portray the same character both in black and white. To highlight different and sometimes opposite parts of the human nature, that often coexist in each of us. 'Chess figures offer an opportunity to explore this dualism. As a portrait photographer, I've always been interested in these different feelings that could emerge in the subjects in front of my lens. ‘The fact that the chess game has a set of six different archetypes - the King, the Queen, the Bishop, the Rook, the Knight, the Pawn - to work with, gives me the possibility to explore different parts of human nature. And, actually, it was a great source of inspiration to play with period dresses and costumes.’","Italian photographer Francesco Ridolfi spent nine months on the project .

Jamie Oliver's cook books have topped the Christmas bestseller list for the last two years but can he retain his title as top TV chef with this year's offering, Save With Jamie? His latest cook book, published by Penguin, contains recipes showing families how they can cook 'tasty, nutritious food on a budget'. Released in August, it has already had strong sales - even outselling popular fiction such as Helen Fielding's latest Bridget Jones novel, Mad About The Boy. King of sales: Jamie Oliver has had the best selling Christmas book for the last two years and is in the running again with Save With Jamie. But could Paul Hollywood take his crown with his Pies and Puds cookbook? So it's no surprise Oliver's book is expected to make it into thousands of stockings this Christmas. But Bloomsbury believe they can topple the 'Naked Chef' off his perch with their contender for the Christmas number one - Great British Bake Off's Paul Hollywood. His latest recipe book, Paul Hollywood's Pies and Puds, was released this week and the publishers expect sales to soar off the back of the popularity of the BBC show. Bake Off dominance: A recipe book tied in with the popular fourth series of the show is already on sale, left, while a 'Winter Kitchen' edition will be published in November. There are also plans to publish recipes from this year's finalists . The book includes recipes for savoury dishes such as meat and potato pie, rosemary suet pudding, and sausage plait as well as sweet treats like queen of puddings and 'chocolate volcanoes'. But Hollywood will face stiff competition from other titles associated with the baking show that has made him a household name. In November, Great British Bake Off: Winter Kitchen, by Lizzie Kamenetzky will hit the shelves. The book, published by Ebury, will contain recipes for pies, breads, soups and casseroles, as well as 'showstopping' Christmas dinner and dessert ideas. The winter recipe edition follows the success of the BBC book, The Great British Bake Off Everyday, launched over the summer to coincide with the start of series four. Healthier options: Lorraine Pascal's Lighter Way To Bake will appeal to those who want a guilt free treat while High Fearnley-Whittingstall's River Cottage Fruit Every Day  will help you get your five-a-day . Contender: Tom Kerridge's Proper Pub Food is also expected to be a festive hit . Featuring recipes from Mary Berry and Hollywood (again), it contains some of the signature bakes, technical challenges and showstoppers they set for this year's contestants. After 9.1m tuned in to watch the final of the show on Tuesday, the book could see a resurgence in sales before Christmas from fans suffering withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the Great British Bake Off website states that recipes from the finalists - Ruby Tandoh, Kimberley Wilson and winner Frances Quinn - will be available in November. But they they do reveal if this will be in an entirely new recipe book or an updated version of the Bake Off Everyday title. But it's not all about Bake Off and Oliver. Other recipe books expected to be festive bestsellers include Lorraine Pascal's A Lighter Way to Bake. The HarperCollins published cookbook features ways to create lower fat versions of indulgent foods including a reinvention of her chocolate brownies. Also hoping to corner the market of healthy eaters is Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall with his book released this month, River Cottage Fruit Every Day. The recipe tome follows on from the success of his River Cottage Veg Every Day - but isn't predicted to shift as many copies as Oliver or Hollywood's offerings. Meanwhile, other contenders for the Christmas number one include Tom Kerridge's Proper Pub Food, which has already topped the charts on Amazon since it was published in August, and Rachel Khoo's My Little French Kitchen. It's a recipe for success for publishers with Bloomsbury revealing this week that they've already seen a rise in profits thanks to cookery titles.","Jamie Oliver has had the bestselling book at Christmas for last two years .

The teen was arrested on Thursday after an 8-year-old girl showed up to a Red Lion Inn & Suites in Kent, Washington wearing only a t-shirt and socks, saying a boy she recognized from her neighborhood raped her. The 14-year-old has not yet been named because he is a minor and police have not formally charged him yet. Charges are expected by next Wednesday.

Housebuilders will no longer be allowed to delay big developments after the government introduced stricter rules to prevent so-called 'land banking'. Planning minister Nick Boles has scrapped a 2008 measure - introduced in the midst of the financial crisis - which allowed three-year permissions to be easily extended. Some developers exploit the loophole and hoard plots for years as they wait for house prices to rise before starting to build homes. Getting tough: Planning minister Nick Boles has scrapped a loophole which allows developers to extend planning permission. The announcement comes weeks after Labour leader Ed Miliband, right, threatened to seize land from firms who don't build on time . Mr Boles said: 'This measure to extend planning . permission was always intended to be temporary and, while it made sense . in the aftermath of Labour's financial crash when there was no money to . build, as the economy improves the focus must be on accelerating the . number of homes being built to meet demand,' he said. 'This . ending of the measure will increase the incentive for developers to . start on site before permission expires. We are also now seeking to . tackle the inappropriate use of planning conditions and speed up the . process of gaining non-planning consents.' The policy change comes in the wake of Labour leader Ed Milliband's announcement in Septemer that the party would seize developers' land if the failed to build. He accuses developers of 'sitting on' lucrative land, pointing to research which found there were 400,000 homes that have not been built despite councils giving planning permission. Mr Boles said those policies amounted to 'heavy handed...taxes and land grabs' which would slow the process and result in fewer homes being built. 'If developers fear new development taxes or state confiscation of land, they will be less willing to undertake complex land assembly projects; they will let their existing planning permissions lapse; or they will simply be more cautious in applying for planning permission in the first place,' he said. Chelsea Barracks, located in one of the London's most exclusive districts, . was sold to Middle East property company Qatari Diar by the Ministry of . Defence for a record £959m in 2007 - but work on the £3bn development . has still not started, leading it to be dubbed 'Britain's most valuable wasteland'. The £3bn project first hit the buffers in 2009 when the firm, which bought the exclusive plot at the top of the housing bubble, withdrew its original plan for 552 flats after Prince Charles criticised it in a letter to the Qatari president. Amid . rising costs and delays, another application was then submitted in 2011 . for 600 units but, despite outline planning permission being granted, . nothing was done. Chelsea Barracks in London has been dubbed Britain's most valuable wasteland after being sold for £959m . It was stalled further earlier . this year when Qatari Diar put the entire project 'under review', before . being ordered by Westminster Council to 'start or sell' the 13-acre . site. And the message . appears to be getting through after the firm recently announced demolition work on all the site's remaining empty buildings is due to . start this month, with the latest plans encompassing 448 flats, including 123 affordable. A . spokesman said: 'Contrary to recent press reports, we . are fully committed to the Chelsea Barracks development, are are . currently negotiating rights to light with its neighbours.' Qatari . Diar’s other London projects include the purchase of the US Embassy . site in Grosvenor Square, the development of the Shell Centre building . in Waterloo and the joint venture with Delancey for the Athletes’ Village in the Olympic park. Mr Boles dismissed the 400,000 figure as a 'canard' deployed by local authority chiefs, insisting the latest data showed that of 257,200 unstarted private projects, 184,600 were 'progressing towards a start', 13,500 were 'being sold or information was not available' and only 59,100 were 'on hold or shelved'. Simon Walker, director general of the IoD, questioned the effect of ending the rollover measure - which would require fresh applications should a permission lapse. 'Obtaining permission, particularly for large projects, is a very expensive and time-consuming process,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'If builders do not have certainty that they will be able to use the land when they are ready to do so, it seems likely that it will deter some from applying in the first place.' Shadow planning minister Roberta Blackman-Woods said: 'With even the Government's own statistics showing that there are hundreds of thousands of units with permission but not being built, they should support Labour's comprehensive measures to stop land banking of sites where the local community has given permission for homes to be built but developers are not building them.'","'Land-banking' culture to be scrapped to encourage house-building .

The fluffy tabby cat, called Hades, was attacked by the venomous spider in the bathroom of his home in Dover, Kent. Owner Dawn Stephenson rushed her beloved pet to the vets where he spent two days fighting for his life on a drip while he recovered from the poison. Bitten: Hades the cat was attacked by the venomous spider after chasing it around the bathroom of his home in Dover, Kent. Owner Dawn Stephenson (pictured with twin daughters Kathryn and Rebecca) said he is now making a good recovery . The 42-year-old said Hades, named after the Greek god of the underworld, usually lives up to his name and is 'a bit of a devil' but she became concerned when he started acting strangely. She saw the feline chasing the spider in the bathroom then he leapt at it but quickly retreated and skulked back to his basket. She said: 'He’s usually very active and is always out in the garden, but he wasn’t interested in interacting with anybody after the bite. 'He had a very high temperature and a very tender stomach.' Hades, who had been bitten on the face, was taken to Maison Dieu Veterinary Centre. Puzzled vets couldn't work out what had happened as they couldn't see the bite through his fur but after x-rays and tests they concluded he had been poisoned by the false widow spider bite. The lucky tabby pulled through and is . now recovering at home with Mrs Stephenson and twin daughters Rebecca . and Kathryn, 13. She has been left with a bill of nearly £700 for his . treatment, the Dover Express reports. Hades: The cat spent two days on a drip after he was bitten by a false widow spider. He is now recovering at home but experts have warned to be vigilant and take pets to the vet immediately if you suspect they have been bitten . British Veterinary Association says although cases are rare, pet owners should be aware of the signs their animal may have been bitten, a spokesman said. 'Lookout for signs such as changes in behaviour, unwillingness to exercise, lethargy, lameness, swelling, loss of appetite and if your pet is showing any of these symptoms - seek veterinary attention as quickly as possible.' she added. She said: 'Speed is of the essence and the sooner treatment can be given, the better. The important message is to seek veterinary attention quickly.' The . false widow is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider . known to be in Britain and cases of people being bitten by the venomous . creature have been on the rise. Earlier this month, a rabbit in south Wales was killed by a false widow spider bite. One-year-old Molly was found dead in her hutch which was infested with the poisonous creatures. Humans have also suffered after being bitten by the arachnid. John Catlin, 66, from Bromley, Kent, is still recovering a year after a bite that caused his organs to start shutting down. Bodybuilder Gary Meadows from Teesville, Middlesbrough, required a skin graft when he was bitten in 2011 and has suffered severe reactions to any insect bite since. Layla Benton, 14, was off school  for three weeks after her knee swelled up when she was bitten in her bathroom in Basildon, Essex. And last month Dean Academy in Lydney, Gloucestershire, had to close its doors to pupils after the dangerous spiders were found there. Poisonous: The false widow spider has been spotted across Britain and has caused lots of allergic reactions among humans . Killer: A false widow spider killed pet rabbit, Molly, after a nest of them infested its hutch . The spiders are shiny and black with distinctive cream markings on the abdomen that resemble a horseshoe – or, to some eyes, a skull. They have long, spindly legs and are easily confused with the black widow, a far more venomous cousin not found in Britain. As with most species of spider, it is the female false widow which is the force to be reckoned with. Males tend not to grow much bigger than two centimetres, while females reach up to three centimetres. The first false widow is thought to have come to Britain  from the Canary Islands or Madeira in the 1870s in a bunch of bananas. The first recorded sighting was in Torquay, Devon, in 1879. According to experts at the National History Museum, the false widow is not an aggressive creature, but prod it or intrude accidentally on its territory and it will give a defensive bite. How dangerous that bite is, seems to depend on the victim. Most will experience nothing worse than a short stinging pain, much like a wasp or bee sting. Bodybuilder Gary Meadows from Teesville, Middlesbrough, required a skin graft when he was bitten in 2011 and has suffered severe reactions to any insect bite since . But other symptoms can include numbness, severe swelling and discomfort or burning sensations. Some victims have reported chest pains. Others report swelling, tingling fingers and occasionally a general sense of feeling unwell and fever with symptoms lasting for a couple of days. Advice from spider experts is to see a doctor immediately if you have an allergic reaction from a bite. Pip Collyer, secretary of the British Arachnological Society said: ‘Try to take the spider with you so someone can identify it. 'But don’t, of course, touch the creature again.'","Tabby cat bitten on the face as it chased spider .

Heathrow Airport will shell out £1.8 million to build sound-proof igloos in nearby schools to protects pupils' and teachers' ears from aircraft noise, after a successful trial at a school that lies within the flight path. The airport plans to give 21 local schools £85,000 each so that they can build the adobe domes to muffle the noise, so that children can play outside and enjoy lessons outdoors. Students from Hounslow Heath infants school play around one of four adobe huts designed to help minimise the noise of aircraft landing at Heathrow airport . The playground is directly under the flight path of Heathrow's southern runway and outside play for the children is interrupted every two minutes or so by landing aircraft passing over their heads . The domes are an invention of Iranian architect Nader Khalili and were originally meant for lunar settlements. They were first employed in a refugee crisis after the 1990-91 Gulf war, but they work just fine forchildren in west London too. The domes, which have also been installed in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal, are made out of bags of coiled earth tubes in an igloo-shape. The technology avoids using expensive construction materials and the cost of transporting them. Soil dug from the construction site is compressed into tubular bags which are laid one on top of the other to form walls. Barbed wire is placed between the layers to hold the bags together. The bags are laid in a circle with a decreasing diameter of the rows towards the top. Since 2005, the airport has been handing out some funds to schools to sound-proof their buildings - but local councils have argued that it is not enough to provide both noise insulation and ventilation, the Daily Telegraph reported. The airport, which is the fourth busiest in the world, sees on average 1,288 flights arrive and depart from its five terminals - the equivalent of 471,000 flights a year. Primary schools that are affected by 63 decibels and above are eligible for the adobe building funding as Heathrow says they recognise the importance of outdoor learning. Another educational establishments will be given financial help to sound proof their buildings, a Heeathrow spokesman said. The number of schools and colleges affected is 43, Heathrow said. Seven nurseries, four libraries, four community/village halls and six hospices/nursing homes also fall within the zone. The decision comes after one primary school close to Heathrow airport erected 'Teletubby' shaped domes to shut out the din. Hounslow Heath infants' school built . four igloo-like adobe domes in its grounds, a type normally used in . earthquakes and emergency zones, to muffle the noise. The playground is directly under the flight path of Heathrow's southern runway and outside play for the children is interrupted every two minutes or so by landing aircraft passing over their heads. The domes, an invention of Iranian architect Nader Khalili, were originally meant for lunar settlements . The domes have no doors so are an open space but have a 'strong psychological and physical barrier' against the noise . 'When children were playing outside, . they had nowhere to go - they were subjected to that noise,' said the . school's principal Kathryn Harper-Quinn. The . domes are an invention of Iranian architect Nader Khalili and were . originally meant for lunar settlements - but they are so effective in . shutting out noise they have been used in the playground. 'For play time it's fantastic that . they have somewhere to withdraw - even the ones that are too young to . articulate that they're feeling concerned about the noise,' Ms . Harper-Quinn said. The domes have no doors so are an open space but with a 'strong psychological and physical barrier' against the noise, she said. She estimates that when outside, teachers are inaudible to pupils for 25 seconds in every 90 because of the jets. 'You can still hear the planes in the huts but you can also hear your own voice,' she said. The school teaches 520 infants aged between three and seven and its experiment with the domes has prompted others in the area to consider following suit. The domes, which have also been installed in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal, are made out of bags of coiled earth tubes in an igloo-shape . The domes were first employed in a refugee crisis after the 1990-91 Gulf war - but have become a saviour at playtime . Planes pass just 180 metres (600 ft) over the area and their engines emit a noise level of 87 decibels. Sound . tests inside the domes showed a noise reduction of over 17 decibels and . a considerable reduction in the duration of the noise, according to the . website of Small Earth which makes the structures. Aircraft noise is a thorny political issue for the government, as it tries to establish where and how to expand airport capacity. Business leaders and airlines are pressing him to expand Heathrow, a move which would affect the 750,000 people living under the flight path. The resilient but lightweight huts have been erected in Nepal - and are now popping up in west London . The domes, which have been installed in the Himalayan foothills, are made out of bags of coiled earth tubes in an igloo-shape . Heathrow has been making efforts to tackle the noise the inevitably arises from its airport . Options for increasing capacity at London Heathrow airport include a third runway and allowing planes to land and take-off on its two runways at the same time instead of the current alternating pattern. 'Having quiet time is absolutely critical. To lose runway alternation would be a disaster,' said Harper-Quinn. Heathrow has been making efforts to tackle the noise the inevitably arises from its airport. It has launched a programme critiquing airlines according to their noise performance. Every three months a 'Fly Quiet' table will take the top 50 Heathrow airlines (by number of flights per quarter) and list them according to six noise related criteria. The airlines receive a red/amber/green rating for each criterion, as well as an overall score which allows airlines to understand how they are performing in relation to other airlines. 'If they are not meeting the minimum performance targets, Heathrow will work closely with them to improve their rating.","Heathrow will give 21 primary schools average of £85,000 each .

New York Daily News reported all the bikers except Christopher Cruz face gang assault charges and the possibility of decades in jail. Cruz, who was rear-ended by Lien, was initially charged in misdemeanor court but now faces felony level criminal mischief and up to four years in prison. Footage from the September 29 incident shows Braszczok, who was off duty at the time, getting closer and closer to Alexian Lien's car . Hiding: Braszczok leaves court in New York today with his face hidden after a short hearing into his role in the biker gang assault . Occupy jail: Wojciech Braszczok, 32, was held in custody for his alleged role in the biker gang beating. He has served with NYPD for ten years and was allegedly undercover with Occupy Wall St for five of those . Allen Edwards, who told cops he was trying to stop the . attack, was also included in the indictment. He 'was the voice of reason and was the most reasonable, courageous . person there, to stand up to these people who he's not friends with. He . doesn't know these bikers', his lawyer said. Lien was chased up the West Side Highway and was pulled out of his car . on W. 178th St. as his wife watched in horror with their young child in . the back seat. A YouTube video of the . attack shows a rider fitting Braszczok's description in the main group . chasing Alexian Lien's Range Rover. At no point does he try to stop the pursuit. At around two minutes he surges from the back and positions himself to the left of the vehicle. His red bike - which looks like the one in Braszczok's online postings - is later seen right behind the SUV boxing it in. When . Lien stops for the first time the man has moved to its driver's side . and as one biker tries to open the driver's door, he goes to get off his . bike to assist, but Lien speeds off. Then he is seen again at the end when Lien is set upon during the second, final confrontation. Biker punk: Braszczok created a very alternative online persona and he cut his hair in a mohawk to look just like those he was mixing with . The video shows the man believed to be Braszczok apparently pulling up alongside the right of the Range Rover. His . lawyers in court on October 9 claimed that he never went within 12ft of the vehicle . but he is much closer than that as his bike comes to a halt by the rear . window. Braszczok's defence . also claimed in court that the window was already broken - but in the . video it is still intact when he reaches it. The . court was told that he took part in a 'brutal and brazen' attack and . that while other members of the bike gang hauled Lien out of his car and . set upon him, Braszczok continued to 'terrorize' his family. The criminal complaint states that he punched the rear window of the Range Rover, causing it to break. He . then allegedly kicked the passenger side whilst Lien's wife was sitting . in the front passenger seat and his two-year-old daughter was in the . back. Terror: The criminal complaint states that he punched the rear window of the Range Rover, causing it to break. He then allegedly kicked the passenger side whilst Lien's wife was sitting in the front passenger seat and his two-year-old daughter was in the back . Shocking: Braszczok is charged with gang assault in the first degree, assault in the first degree and criminal mischief in the third degree . The criminal . complaint also alleges that at the time of the assault he was wearing a . black vest with the words 'Front Line Soldiers' and 'New Rochelle, NY' on it. His name, 'WOJTEK' was on the front too and he was riding a bright red Yamaha bike. The description from court appears to match him up in the YouTube video. The police are said to have another video which shows him actually hitting the windscreen. Braszczok's . lawyer John Arlia said that videos of the incident will exonerate his . client who he said was being targeted because he was a detective. But . despite the seriousness of the claims against him, a judge agreed with . Braszczok's lawyer that pictures of him in court should not be allowed. Mr . Arlia said that he was involved with the NYPD intelligence division . which deals with 'infiltrating various organizations' and 'to disclose his identity would jeopardize his life, his families'. For that reason MailOnline has obscured his identity. The claims emerged on the day it was revealed that Braszczok worked undercover in the Occupy Wall Street movement for two years. Braszczok . - who also told activists his real name was 'Al' - shaved his head into . a Mohawk and apparently pretended to be a biker bro to win the trust of . activists. He attended demonstrations and lived like the protestors. Rabble rousing: Braszczok tweeted Occupy events including this 'spring training' event in April, 2012 . Rogue? It is unclear how much of Braszczok's online personalities were part of his cover or his genuine lifestyle . Full throttle: Braszczok showed off his bright red Yamaha on his social media accounts - the complaint against him says he was riding one at the time of the incident .

The NHS has launched an unprecedented call for an army of ‘Good Samaritans’ to look in on lonely elderly neighbours and make sure they are coping this winter. It has issued a call for 100,000 volunteers to sign a pledge committing to visiting older people to check they are warm and have everything they need. The new Winter Friends pledge is being backed by the Daily Mail, which has been running a Dignity for the Elderly Campaign. A host  of celebrities, including Joanna Lumley and Stephen Fry, have already signed up. Celebrity backing: Stephen Fry (left) and Joanna Lumley have already pledged their support for Winter Friends . Last winter, there were an estimated 31,100 excess deaths due to winter conditions – a 29 per cent increase on the previous year. Most are over 75 and the majority of the deaths are entirely avoidable. Hundreds of thousands of others spend much of the winter alone and lonely. The NHS appeal comes a month after Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Britain should be ashamed of the way it treats grandparents and urged families to take a leaf out of the book of Asian nations, where they take more responsibility for elderly relatives and do not leave caring to the state. Surveys have found more than half of . over-75s live alone and five million older people say TV is their main . form of company. One study found the lack of social connections is as . likely to cause early death as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Last winter 81-year-old stroke victim . Gloria Foster starved to death after the local council failed to send . round home helps for nine days. Winnifred Green, 88, who has regular visitors . Winifred Green, 88, has lived alone on a quiet street in Liverpool since losing her husband Edward to a heart attack 15 years ago. The former interior designer’s remaining family live in Ireland and are too busy to see or speak to her. Worse still, 14 years ago a fall down a flight of stairs badly injured Winifred’s back, leaving her reliant on a mobility scooter to get around. Desperately lonely, Winifred spent months at a time barely leaving her house, let alone speaking to anyone else. ‘I have never felt so isolated in my life,’ she recalled. ‘I would cry a lot. I was just watching the television, listening to the radio and sleeping. I was desperate for company. It just went on and on.’ Finally, four months ago Winifred called the charity Independent Age that helped alert her neighbours to her predicament. Two now visit regularly. Miriam lives opposite and helps Winifred with her shopping and Pat lives around the corner and tidies her house once a week. Both make time for a cup of tea and a chat. ‘Waking up and knowing I’m going to see someone even for half an hour has changed my life,’ she said. ‘I’m happy again. The last few winters have been awful; it’s always dark and the nights last forever when you are on your own. This  is the first time in years I’m not dreading Christmas.’ In January, a nurse from a care agency visited stroke victim Gloria Foster, 81. Gloria depended on these visits four times a day for food, water and medication as she lived alone in Banstead, Surrey. Her husband, Bob, an accountant, died in a car crash 30 years ago and they had no children. After giving her some spaghetti and fruit juice the nurse left Gloria watching television. Nine days later a district nurse visited by chance – and discovered the agency that had been looking after Gloria had closed down and no one had checked on her. Gloria was found severely dehydrated, suffering kidney failure, with serious bed sores and only a faint pulse. Her walking frame was out of her reach and she had been unable to call for help. Sadly, she died in hospital 11 days later. And earlier this month, hundreds attended the funeral of Harold Percival, a 91-year-old war veteran, after an appeal for mourners in a local newspaper revealed he died with no close friends or relatives. The campaign is being led by the NHS Choices website and seeks to help by appealing to an old-fashioned sense of neighbourliness. The NHS suggests that people could agree to check in once a week, or more if it turns very cold. They could check the person’s home is warm enough, make sure they have enough food, offer to pick up prescriptions, clear the snow in front of their house, or offer to take them on a walk. Those who sign the Winter Friends pledge will receive free cold weather alerts and email tips throughout the winter to help them do their bit. One of the first to sign was Miss Lumley, who said last night: ‘A little help really does go a long way. You will also find, I’m sure, that giving a bit of your time in this way is hugely rewarding.’ Fry, host of QI, said: ‘Isolated, vulnerable and elderly people are the most at risk. It’s a tragedy when most of these deaths could be avoided, so that’s why I’ll be tweeting my support for the NHS Choices Winter Friends pledge.’ Other celebrities supporting the campaign include former weather girl Ulrika Jonsson, Olympic gold medallist Sally Gunnell, actors Sir Tony Robinson and Olivia Colman, presenters Richard Madeley and Jenni Falconer, and rapper Plan B. By ROS COWARD . Attitude: Ros Coward believes the impulse to take care of others is still there - we just need to nurture it . The man must have been in his early 80s. He shuffled towards the bar of the pub, placed his coins down and asked for a pint of beer. I watched as he tried to strike up conversation with the young barman, who barely lifted his eyes from the till. Rebuffed, the old man slowly made his way back to his table. The day before I’d felt the same pang when I witnessed the bus conductor drumming his fingers as an elderly woman struggled to get off. And again, when another octogenarian was met by indifference as she tried to exchange pleasantries with a supermarket cashier. Most of the time we are too wrapped up in our own lives to notice this kind of exchange. But when an elderly person close to you becomes dependent – as my mother did when she developed dementia – you realise how lonely old age can be. And how frightening. Social isolation in old age is no trivial matter. Recent studies indicate that lack of social interaction is as likely to cause early death as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. That’s why the NHS Winter Friends campaign is so valuable: it reminds us there are plenty around us for whom a friendly face and an offer of help is hugely important. It could even mean the difference between life and death. Like most modern families, we didn’t think of moving my mother in with us when she was diagnosed in 2008. We tried to supply all her needs by regularly visiting her and hiring her a carer. But, even with this, she was often at risk alone, and it was easy to see how losing any of those props would have resulted in isolation. Before her illness, I – like most of us with busy jobs – was guilty of not giving elderly neighbours enough thought. Not only do you become more aware when a loved one is in the same boat, you also begin to realise the value of the small acts of kindness. Condemned: Last month Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Britain should be ashamed of the way they treat grandparents . I saw the huge difference some people made to my mother’s life – neighbours who checked up on her, a caretaker for her block of flats who stopped to share a joke. These tiny deeds  cost nothing but make a huge difference. Of course, those who are still able to get out and about are relatively fortunate. There are plenty more who are housebound. I have elderly neighbours who do not have family nearby, who can no longer get out and cannot access even the fairly minimal help available. There is one couple in their 90s who, although they have each other, rely on one or two neighbours to do their shopping.Ivy was another. She is now dead but for many years she was my next door neighbour and eventually could not get down her steps. Sadly, she spent most of her last years alone in front of the television. A recent survey reveals that 51 per cent of all people over 75 live alone and five million elderly say the television is their main form of company. There are plenty who are entirely isolated – and this becomes all the more difficult when winter grips.Like many of her thrifty generation, my mother was prone to turning off all the radiators in her house except the one she was sitting beside. Ivy did the same, often barricading herself into one room and remaining static by her gas fire. Thankfully there were neighbours to check on them both, but what if there hadn’t been? By signing up to Winter Friends, you can help make sure that that is not the case for vulnerable elderly people living near you. And you’re not burdening yourself with an unachievable commitment – you’ll simply be doing your bit when the weather is cold by looking in on an elderly friend or neighbour, checking radiators are on and food is in the cupboards. I believe the impulse to take care of others is still there – we just need to nurture it. After all, one day it might be you.","The NHS want 100,000 volunteers to sign up for their Winter Friends pledge .

A two-year freeze on energy bills would save the taxpayer at least £100million, government figures reveal. Labour leader Ed Miliband said schools, hospitals and Whitehall departments would benefit now if the coalition imposed his plan to block gas and electricity rises. But he accused David Cameron of siding with the Big Six energy firms who will impose crippling price hikes of up to 10 per cent this winter. Savings: Labour leader Ed Miliband' plan to freeze energy prices would save . the taxpayer £100million over two years by helping schools, hospitals . and government departments, government figures have revealed . Mr Miliband unveiled his 1970s-style plan for the state to intervene in the energy market at the Labour conference in Brighton. He promised to freeze energy bills for 20months if Labour wins the election in May 2015, using the time to break up the market and abolish regulator Ofgem. He said the plan would save the average family £120. But new figures released by ministers also show the potential savings on heating and lighting government buildings. The NHS alone could save more than £40million, which would pay for 1,300 nurses. Schools could save £28million, equivalent to the salaries of more 700 teachers. Mr Miliband told MailOnline: . ’Labour’s price freeze will save families an average £120 and an average . small business user would benefit by over £5,000. ’But . it’s not just Britain’s families and businesses that would benefit from . this price freeze, it’s our vital public services too. ’New figures today show that if David Cameron put in place our freeze today, public services would save £100m. ’And that matters more than ever in an era when there’s less money around.’ Figures show that the NHS alone could save more than £40million, which would pay for 1,300 nurses. Schools could save £28million, equivalent to the salaries of more 700 teachers . Recently announced price hikes will hit the public sector as well as hard-pushed families . Mr Cameron has repeatedly dismissed Labour’s plan for a freeze as a ’con’ which cannot be delivered. And it is predicted that energy firms will dramatically hike prices just before the general election.Npower chief executive Paul Massara warned Britain could be hit by power cuts if Labour moves to freeze bills. He claimed the industry needed a ‘stable environment’ to commit to investment in the energy network. Four of the Big Six firms have already announced big price rises for this winter. ScottishPower . bills are going up by 9 per cent, Npower announced a 10.4 per cent . price hike, British Gas a 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern . Energy an 8.2 per cent increase. Miliband accused Prime Minister David Cameron of siding with the Big Six energy firms who will impose crippling price hikes of up to 10 per cent this winter . Mr Miliband, who is due to give a speech on living costs in Hornsey and Wood Green today, added: ’This freeze will happen under the next Labour Government and while prices are frozen we will reset the broken energy market. ’Across Britain families are struggling from the cost of living crisis and the Conservative Party just doesn’t have an answer. ’This shows how out of touch the Tories have become - they are on the side of energy companies not of families struggling with the cost of living crisis and relying on public services that are under huge financial pressure. ’David Cameron has been recruited by the Big 6. He is now part of the Big 7.’ Figures released in Parliament show how bills for Whitehall departments have soared. In 2012-13 alone the NHS spent £634million on energy costs, up 15 per cent since the election. The Department for Energy and Climate Change, in charge of keeping the lights on, spent £203,137 on electricity and £22,654 on gas in 2912-13, up from £165,782 and £16,700 respectively on a year earlier - a 22 per cent increase. Last year the Home Office spent £5.7million on electricity and £1.1million on gas, up from £5.1million and £640,000 in 2011-12, a rise of 18 per cent rise. The Ministry of Defence spent £122million on gas and £209million on electricity across the defence estate. Labour's shadow treasury minister Chris Leslie, who obtained the figures through parliamentary questions, said: 'These figures show that it’s not only households and businesses that are paying the price for a broken energy market, it’s the taxpayer too. 'We need Labour's price freeze and reforms to the energy market - not only to help hard-pressed families, but to spare the taxpayer these higher costs too.' Ministers insist efforts have already been made to reduce  costs, including energy saving measures and buying gas and electricity through a centralised Government Procurement Service (GPS) system. Energy Secretary Ed Davey said this week: ’Labour’s price freeze is a con. It damages competition and it damages investment. ’That contrasts with what the Government are offering, which is direct help to the poorest in society, radical energy efficiency programmes, and a focus on competition that the Labour party never had.’","Labour leader says NHS, education and councils would save millions .

The prosecutor seeking to reinstate the conviction of Amanda Knox for the murder of her roommate urged an appeals court on Monday not to repeat mistakes he says were made by the court that freed her. Prosecutor Alessandro Crini said Italy's highest court had 'razed to the ground' the Perugia appellate court's 2011 decision to throw out the guilty verdicts. Crini will finish his closing statements tomorrow and is expected to request a life in prison sentence for Knox and her Italian ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito. The high court ordered a fresh appeals trial, this time in Florence, saying the earlier appeals decision was full of contradictions. Guilty? Amanda Knox (right) and her Italian ex-boyfriend Raffaelo Sollecito were convicted in 2009 of murdering Knox's roommate Meredith Kercher (left). They were freed in 2011 when a court overturned the original decision but another trial was started earlier this year . In court: Raffaele Sollecito, right, arrives at a hearing in Sollecito and Knox's trial at an appeals court in Florence, Italy, on Monday . Knox and Sollecito were convicted in 2009 of killing Meredith Kercher, Knox's 21-year-old British roommate, who was found with her throat slit in her bedroom in 2007. They were sentenced to 26 years and 25 years in jail, respectively. After being freed in 2011, Knox returned to the United States and has not returned to Italy for the current trial. Knox and Sollecito denied any involvement in the killing, saying they weren't in the apartment at the time and had no motive. A third defendant, Ivory Coast-born Rudy Guede, was convicted in a separate trial of sexually assaulting and stabbing Kercher. His 16-year sentence, reduced in appeal from 30 years, was upheld by Italy's highest court in 2010. Prosecutors have argued that the murder was carried out by more than one person. House: The house in Perugia, Italy, where Meredith Kercher was killed . Crini argued that the earlier appellate court had 'pulverized the elements,' separating pieces of evidence that needed to be seen together to get a full picture of the crime. Crini said Knox and Sollecito made efforts to deflect suspicion. He alleged they staged a break-in at the apartment to make it appear the killer was an outsider; he alleged Knox cleaned up the apartment in an effort to remove any evidence linking her or Sollecito to the crime, and that she falsely accused another man of the crime. The defense has argued that the robbery was not staged and that it would be impossible to selectively remove incriminating evidence. After more than six hours of arguments, the hearing was continued until Wednesday when the hearing turns to possibly significant new DNA evidence, the main new element of the second appeals trial. The prosecutor will also make his sentencing demands. Fighting: Sollecito continued to defend himself in court while Knox remains absent in Seattle, Washington . Raffaele Sollecito's lawyer Luca Maori arrives at the appeals court (left) and Kercher family lawyer Francesco Maresca (right) was also at an earlier hearing . It wasn't me: Not guilty: Sollecito told the court there was not 'the slightest foundation' of guilt when he appeared at Florence's Justice Palace, Italy . The Florence court ordered experts to test the tiny trace of DNA not examined in the previous trials, one of the appellate trial flaws emphasized by the Cassation Court in vacating the acquittals. An expert testified that the trace on the purported murder weapon was consistent with Knox's DNA and not Kercher's. Knox's DNA had previously been identified on the knife, and her lawyers see the new evidence as confirmation that Knox had used the knife — found in a kitchen drawer at Sollecito's apartment — for cooking. The first trial had identified another trace of DNA on the tip of the knife as belonging to Kercher, but that evidence, which was key in securing the convictions, was discredited by expert testimony to the Perugia appeals court. Raffaele Sollecito's lawyer Giulia Bongiorno speaks to the media at the end of a hearing in an appeals court in Florence, Italy . Knox's lawyer, Luciano Ghirga, said there was nothing new so far in the prosecutor's summations. 'No new arguments were made, but it was a good presentation,' Ghirga said. Sollecito was in the Florence appellate court for a second time Monday, listening intently as Crini claimed that his alibi that he was working at his computer at the time of the murder was false. 'After all of this time,' Sollecito told reporters outside court, 'I just continue to confront a situation of repeated accusations that have no foundation in reality or likelihood.' A verdict had been expected on January 10, but may be delayed as the closing arguments have run longer than anticipated by the court.","Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito were convicted in 2009 of murdering 21-year-old British exchange student Meredith Kercher .

Most of the world may be struggling through another year of hard times, but, it seems, no one has told Harrods. The department store is making sure the country’s billionaires – the City bankers, hedge fund bosses, Russian magnates and Arab potentates – can look forward to a truly luxurious Christmas with this hamper, which at £20,000 costs as much as many young couples can afford to put down as a deposit on their first home. Aptly named The Decadence, this gift for the oligarch who has everything brings together some of the most expensive food and drink in the world. Harrods' hamper, aptly named The Decadence, costs £20,000 and includes caviar and fine wines . Harrods insists that it is worth the eye-watering price – but if you are considering getting one for  Christmas morning, be aware of one glaring omission. The huge hamper does not come with a turkey. And you would need to shell out for a fairly gargantuan bird to grace a table kitted out with the contents of this gift basket. There are 25 bottles of wine and spirits, including magnums of Dom Perignon, Cristal and Taittinger champagne. The wine selection includes a 2007 Chateau Margaux red and a magnum of sweet Chateau D’Yquem 2002, both world famous. For an after dinner tipple, try the Balvenie single malt whisky, which has been aged for 30 years, or the Courvoisier Initiale Extra cognac. There is a 2kg pack of exclusive Kopi Luwak coffee, which, bizarrely, is  collected from the dung of Asian palm civet cats after they have been fed a diet of coffee berries. Apparently, the cats’ digestive process improves the flavour, delivering what Harrods calls the ‘world’s finest and most expensive coffee beans’. The centrepiece of the feast is the 8kg Iberico ham, which comes with its own special carving knife. The meat, considered one of Spain’s food treasures, comes from purebred black Iberian pigs that spend their lives roaming free, foraging for a natural diet of acorns. The selection of meats also includes Capocollo di Martina Franca, an Italian salami from the hills of Apulia that is cured for up to 180 days, Iberian chorizo, Mortandella Corra from Italy, and Salame Strolghino. Established in 1824, Harrods has grown to become the most prestigious department store in Europe . There are not one, but two types of caviar, including a 125g pot of Oscietra from the prized Ossetra sturgeon, a fish that weighs up to 400 pounds and can live for 50 years. This is outdone by the even more exclusive Beluga caviar, harvested from fish in the Caspian Sea.From closer to home is a 500g royal fillet of Scottish salmon, described as ideal for a Boxing Day buffet. The hamper courts controversy with its two types of pate de foie gras with truffles, one made of duck liver and the other from goose. Animal welfare campaigners are pushing for a ban on the delicacy because it is usually produced by force-feeding birds until their livers swell to an unnatural size, taking on the soft texture that is prized by gourmets. A decent cheese board is a Christmas must and the Harrods range does not disappoint. There is a 1.15kg half baby Stilton, together with a Torta de Trujillo, made from the milk of sheep that graze freely on herbs and grasses. There is also a selection of other cheeses, including an 825g round  of aged West Country farmhouse cheddar, matured for nine months. While the traditional turkey and veg have been neglected – there’s not a sprout in sight – recipients do get an ‘extra-special three-tiered Christmas cake, decorated with resplendent ribbons’, which weighs in at 9.5kg. And of course, there is an Archive Collection Christmas Pudding, inspired by recipes from Harrods’ original 1930s range. In case pantry staples such as olive oil and orange marmalade seem a little too pedestrian after all that luxury, Harrods offers them to the discerning customer liberally sprinkled with flakes of real gold. The oil alone would set you back £750. There’s even a selection of fresh fruit – to help kickstart a post-Christmas diet, perhaps. A small 68g bottle of Leonardi balsamic vinegar, which is aged for 100 years and normally costs £235, is so exclusive that each one is numbered and presented in a gift box. The luxury presentation is finished off with mini mince pies, a box of six Christmas crackers, table decorations and a Harrods slate cheese board with a glass cloche. The £20,000 hamper is delivered in a wooden presentation trunk, rather than a wicker basket.Harrods, established by Charles Henry Harrod in 1824, grew to become the largest and most prestigious department store in Europe. Today it has more than one million square feet of selling space in London’s Knightsbridge. Its motto Omnia Omnibus Ubique, or ‘all things for all people, everywhere’, is somewhat at odds with its modern devotion to providing luxury goods to the super rich. In May 2010, long-term owner Mohamed Al-Fayed sold the store to Qatar Holdings, the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar, for £1.5billion. The deal was considered so momentous that it was finalised by the Qatari Prime Minister, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani. Bruce Langlands, director of food at Harrods, said it has a deserved reputation for the world’s finest hampers. ‘The Decadence is a showcase of the most enticing and delectable flavours available from across the globe and carefully sourced by our team of experts and suppliers,’ he added. ‘This hamper caters to those with genuine discernment for quality; from extra virgin olive oil with 24-carat gold flakes and Beluga caviar to  a selection of finest wines and champagnes.’ He stressed that cheaper options are available – for those not thinking of taking out a new mortgage for a few seasonal treats. Alternatives include a Celebration of Chocolate at £125 and The Archive Hamper at £225.","Brings together expensive food and drink from across the world .

A retired watchmaker who set up a cannabis factory in his garage shot a burglar who was trying to break in to his remote farmhouse, a court heard today. Malcolm White, 63, fired at Robert Richards when he caught him trying to smash his living room window in October 2011. The burglar, who fired back at the homeowner before fleeing in a getaway van, was so badly injured when he was arrested that doctors had to amputate his right leg. On trial: Malcolm White, pictured with his partner Josephine Merrick, is accused of shooting a burglar at his home . Break-in: Robert Richards and Darren Randall attempted to burgle the farmhouse in Herefordshire, pictured . But White insists that the shooting was an accident, and has pleaded not guilty to unlawful wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm at Worcester Crown Court. A jury heard that the retiree spent 20 minutes locking up the garage which contained his £18,000 cannabis farm before he reported the attempted break-in at his £420,000 home in Whitborne, Herefordshire by Richards, 30, and Darren Randall, 26. He told officers he believed the robbers had been after his Audi A8 sports car - but failed to inform them he had shot one of the thieves. The jury was told that White had a total of 20 firearms stashed around his home, and boasted to partner Josephine Merrick that he 'shot the bastard' during the botched burglary. Investigation: Police found £18,000 worth of cannabis plants at the house when they searched it . Prosecutor Simon Phillips said that White was 'no ordinary householder' and shot Richards in order to 'protect his turf'. He continued: 'The reality was, Mr White knew this raid was a possibility and took the initiative to shoot Mr Richards before he knew it. 'He was protecting his turf and was prepared with a number of firearms around his property. 'In Mr White's garage was a valuable and extensive crop of cannabis. He was somebody who had something to protect.' The barrister told the court that the couple's home was 'set apart from other houses', making it easier for White to conceal his drug farm, for which he had bought £20,000 worth of equipment. When police searched the garage they seized 60 plants worth up to £18,000 but capable of producing £60,000 of cannabis a year. Haul: A police officer is pictured taking cannabis plants away from White's garage . Case: Ms Merrick was sentenced to unpaid work over the cannabis factory at her home . Mr Phillips said: 'Mr White and Josephine Merrick were watching television when someone began banging on the living room window with a tool of some sort but were unable to gain access. 'Mr White turned to Josephine Merrick and said, ""I'll get the bastard"" before she escaped into the hallway. She then heard three shots - boom, crack, crack. 'She then heard a man's voice shouting ""He's got me"" and ""We've got to get him out of here,"" before a sound consistent of people moving away from the house. 'Next, she went to the living room and saw through the smashed window essentially Mr Richards and Mr Randall doing a runner. 'Mr Richards was found with Mr Randall by passersby and then police outside a Chinese takeaway in nearby Leigh Sinton. Partner: Ms Merrick, who was present on the night of the incident, is pictured outside court . 'Josephine Merrick wondered where Mr White was, she noticed the upstairs lights were on, they were previously off. Mr White then came in from the kitchen when she said, ""Did you get him?"" 'To which he replied, ""Yes I got the bastard."" She said, ""Is he still alive?"" And Mr White said, ""Yes, he's still walking, I think I got him in the leg, I wish I would have finished him off.""' During a police interview, White said he thought he had shot the gun in the air, adding that he believed the men were trying to get to his car or his partner. He said he had been growing drugs for four or five months. Ms Merrick was ordered to perform 15 hours of unpaid work and given a 12-month restraining order after she pleaded guilty to producing a controlled substance last month. Richards was jailed for 10 and a half years and Randall sentenced to 13 years and four months after they were convicted of aggravated burglary in February. The trial continues.

The number of ‘morning-after’ motorists caught over the drink-drive limit the day after a night out on the tiles  is increasing. Arrests between 6am and 8am for drink-driving following a  heavy night rose by nearly 4  per cent last year, according to police figures. Many motorists do not realise they are still at risk of being over the limit even after hours of sleeping it off. A police breathalyser: Many people do not realise that they could still be over the legal drink driving limit the morning after a night out . And with Christmas and New Year looming – the peak time for morning-after offences, accounting for 10 per cent of the annual total – arrests are likely to soar further. A separate survey of 1,688 drivers by insurers LV showed that 3 per cent – or 1.2million – admitted driving while over the legal limit the morning after a drinking session in the past two years. Some 37 per cent insisted that driving was unavoidable, 26 per cent said they were only going a short distance and 19 per cent thought they were all right to take to the road. Seven per cent even thought it was acceptable to drive because they were not on a motorway, and 13 per cent believed they were only a little over the limit so it did not matter. The report noted that most morning-after drink-drivers still have around five hours to go before they become sober enough to drive. Arrests between 6am and 8am for drink driving following a heavy night rose by nearly four per cent last year . The arrest figures were obtained by LV under a Freedom of Information Act request and were based on replies from 22 police forces. They show that 350 drivers were arrested for drink-driving between 6am and 8am in 2011, rising to 363 in 2012 – an increase of 3.7 per cent. The LV survey showed that 46 per cent of drivers underestimated how long it took for alcohol to leave the body – or did not know, while 30 per cent of men and 19 per cent of women admitted to having driven at least once after a heavy drinking session the night before. The LV report says: ‘Morning-after drink-driving is on the increase, with more motorists putting themselves and other road users at risk. 'This upward trend is being exacerbated by a lack of awareness among drivers about how long it takes alcohol to leave their system.’ The current drink-drive limit is 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood, 35mg per 100ml of breath or 107mg per 100ml of urine. This equates to approximately four units for an average man and two to three units for an average woman. Official guidelines say it takes an hour for the body to break down one unit. But experts say that this is not a reliable measure because it will vary depending on the person’s age, weight, gender and metabolic rate.","Rise in 'morning-after' drink drivers according to new study .

William Hague hailed a deal struck with Iran over its nuclear programme as good for the world after hours of ‘painstaking’ negotiations. The Foreign Secretary said the agreement, which would force Iran to downgrade its almost weapons-grade uranium in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, was a victory for diplomacy. But critics including Israel and Saudi Arabia warned it was a ‘disaster’ for world peace, lifting £4.3 billion worth of sanctions on Iran with little evidence that Tehran was serious about abandoning its nuclear programme. Deal: William Hague, who met US Secretary of State John Kerry last night, hailed the deal over Iran's nuclear programme . The deal was struck in Geneva between Iran, the United States, France, Germany, Britain, China and Russia after winning the critical endorsement of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Under the arrangement, Iran will benefit from the unfreezing of its foreign currency reserves and gain sanctions relief in trade in gold, precious metals, petrochemicals, auto and aircraft parts. There are hopes that the break-through will thaw decades of poor relations between Iran and America which started with the Islamic Revolution in 1979. It is however just the first step in a six month programme aimed at getting Iran to stop enriching its uranium. There also seemed to be confusion between the world powers and Iran as to whether the deal would stop all uranium enrichment by Tehran. Mr Hague said it would force Iran to scrap its stockpile of uranium that was enriched to 20 per cent. Announcement: Politicians including William Hague (far left) announce the deal at the UN today . He described the negotiations as ‘painstaking’ on Twitter but later insisted it was a ‘good deal’ for the Middle East and the world. It will also force Iran to stop enriching uranium beyond the 5 per cent level – slightly above what is required to run a nuclear power plant. Iran is also meant to stop development of new enrichment centrifuges but will not be forced to dismantle existing ones during the six-month negotiation period. It will however have to stop work on its heavy-water reactor near the city of Arak which could lead to the development of weapons-grade plutonium. Blessing: The deal won the critical endorsement of Iran¿s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . Mr Hague met US Secretary of State John Kerry last night alongside the Libyan Prime Minister to discuss the deal and the wider Middle East. He said the agreement should ‘give us faith in the power of diplomacy and pressure to resolve even some very intractable problems. ‘This is a change in behaviour from Iran and we should respond constructively and openly to that and that’s what we’re doing, the tone of these meetings is very different from the past, I think they are very sincere, they are very tough negotiators.’ Mr Hague said it was inevitable that countries such as Israel and Saudi Arabia would harbour doubts over the credibility of the deal. The Foreign Secretary admitted Iran has a ‘history of not revealing the truth of its nuclear programme’ but he added it was the first time Iran had entered into an international agreement about its nuclear programme. After meeting Mr Hague, Senator Kerry said the hard work could only begin now. This would involve taking the ‘enormous steps in terms of verification, transparency and accountability.’ Iran’s foreign minister and chief negotiator, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said it was only the ‘first step’. ‘We need to start moving in the direction of restoring confidence, a direction which we have managed to move against in the past,’ he said. US President Barack Obama warned the tap of sanctions relief could be turned off if Iran did not keep up its end of the agreement. ‘There are substantial limitations which will help prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon,” he said in a late-night appearance at the White House after the deal was sealed. ‘Simply put, they cut off Iran’s most likely paths to a bomb.’ Warning: US President Barack Obama, left, warned the tap of sanctions relief could be turned off if Iran did not keep up its end of the agreement. Meanwhile Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, right, condemned the deal . But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the deal. ‘What was achieved last night in Geneva is not a historic agreement, it was a historic mistake,’ he said. ‘Today the world has become a much more dangerous place because the most dangerous regime in the world took a significant step towards obtaining the world’s most dangerous weapon.’ And a Saudi Arabian official said his government was ‘very concerned about these negotiations with Iran’, adding: ‘There is a lot of worry right now about threats to the region.’ Douglas Alexander, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary, said the deal was potentially the most important announcement between Iran and the West for decades. ‘Crucially, the apparent agreement of the Iranian government to curb enrichment and grant greater access to inspectors show the important progress that appears to have been made. ‘The strength of the agreement will be tested through its implementation, and if Iran is shown to renege on its obligations then the international community should be ready to reverse sanctions relief and maintain pressure. He added: ‘In the days ahead it will be important for the British Government to provide further details to Parliament so that the interim deal can be closely scrutinised.’","William Hague said that the landmark deal was a victory for diplomacy .

The Government was last night accused of profiting from ‘vulnerable’ people by forcing them to phone premium-rate numbers. A damning investigation has found that more than 100million calls to State-backed offices by crime victims, pensioners, the recently bereaved and students were to high-rate numbers charging up to 35p a minute. Downing Street hinted that premium-rate numbers could be banned for advice lines for grieving families, after MPs condemned the widespread use of the lines which cost callers £56million in 2012/13. Frustration: Premium numbers for calling public bodies are costing the taxpayer millions - almost half of which is wasted waiting on hold . Nearly two thirds of calls fielded by government organisations were made to the higher-rate 0845 numbers, a Commons committee found. Only 40 out of the 365 customer phone lines are free to use. Anyone who phones a government line to report the death of a spouse for tax or benefits purposes pays premium rates, while the Student Loans Company also uses the numbers, saying that doing away with them would cost it £1million in revenue. Almost half the £56million was generated while callers were on hold, waiting to speak to advisers. Last night Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said:  ‘Customers of government services should be able to contact these services easily and cheaply. ‘Charging customers higher rates by making them use 0845 or other high-rate numbers is not acceptable, especially when the customers are often vulnerable.’ Pocketed by the taxman: HMRC was held up as an example of 'astonishingly bad' customer service, keeping callers on hold for an average of seven minutes . She said the Cabinet Office had to urgently establish rules for charging, adding: ‘There should be low-cost alternatives for all services used by a lot of vulnerable people.’ Callers should also be informed of the costs involved in phoning particular numbers, her committee concluded. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘It’s ridiculous that people face a bumper bill to call a public body, especially when they have to wait on hold. ‘Almost 60,000 people have supported our Costly Calls campaign for all companies and public bodies to provide either freephone or local rate numbers for their customer service and complaints lines. ‘This practice has been costing cash-strapped consumers millions of pounds.’ 'Not acceptable': Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said new rules were urgently needed . The committee also found that many departments were ‘astonishingly bad’ at answering calls. HMRC answered only 16 per cent of the calls it received on its tax credits helpline on the deadline day for notifying the department of changes of circumstances. Customers to the tax department were put on hold for an average of seven minutes. The Cabinet Office told the committee that the current situation was unacceptable. It has set up a working group to define new rules for premium-rate numbers within government. David Cameron's official spokesman said the Prime Minister was concerned about the use of costly phone lines for people looking for advice when a loved one dies. The spokesman added: 'He does understand concerns that people have, particular when it comes to advice people are taking at challenging times of their family’s lives such as bereavement. ‘That is something that should be looked at closely.’ Outside central government, NHS trusts and GPs have also faced criticism for using premium-rate numbers. Mrs Hodge said that one of her East London constituents spent £30 to make an appointment for her 30-year-old disabled son with a GP. She added: ‘I don’t know how many calls she had to make. That is a shocker.’ Jeff Gardner, head of Victim Support’s help line, said: ‘We are currently looking at ways of reducing the cost to people calling Victim Support’s support line.’ A DWP spokesman said: ‘The DWP provides free telephone numbers (0800) for all of our claim lines. The DWP does not earn any revenue from 0845 numbers.'","Almost two thirds of calls fielded by the Government are premium rate .

The European Space Agency (ESA) claims one of its sleek research satellites, dubbed the 'Ferrari of space', has plummeted somewhere into the South Atlantic ocean. ESA said the 1,100-kilogram (2,425-pound) GOCE satellite, which ran out of fuel in October, re-entered the atmosphere at about 0000 GMT Monday. It followed a descending orbit that extended across Siberia, the western Pacific Ocean, the eastern Indian Ocean and Antarctica. The European Space Agency (ESA) claims one of its sleek research satellites, dubbed the 'Ferrari of space' has plummeted somewhere into the South Atlantic ocean . Most of the satellite disintegrated in the high atmosphere, but tracking data from both the U.S. and Europe suggests the surviving debris fell just off the coast of South America, south of the Falkland . Islands. With a sleek, aerodynamic design responsible for its Ferrari nickname, GOCE was the first uncontrolled re-entry of a European Space Agency (ESA) satellite since 1987. Prior to its descend, ESA estimated that the chance of an individual being struck by the debris would lower than being hit by a meteorite. GOCE re-entered the atmosphere at about 0000 GMT Monday on a descending orbit pass that extended across Siberia, the western Pacific Ocean, the eastern Indian Ocean and Antarctica . Full name: Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer . Launched: 17 March 2009 . Launcher: Rockot (with Breeze-KM upper stage) by Eurockot Launch Services GmbH . Launch site: Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia . Nominal life: 20 months . Cost: $466million . Orbit: About 161.5 miles altitude, polar, Sun-synchronous . Mass: 2,000lbs . Dimensions: 17.4 feet long, about 3.3 foot body diameter . Propulsion tank: 88.2lbs of xenon gas . Mission: Measuring Earth's gravity field and modelling the geoid with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution . The Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) had been orbiting Earth since March 2009 at the lowest altitude of any research satellite. It's been gradually descending over the last three weeks after running out of fuel October 21. ESA says its information is now being used to understand ocean circulation, sea level, ice dynamics and the Earth's interior. During its mission, it has produced a unique model of the ‘geoid’, which is essentially a virtual surface where water does not flow from one point to another. GOCE’s ion engine, responsible for keeping the satellite at an incredibly low orbit of under 260 km, together with its accelerometer measurements have also provided new insight into air density and wind speeds in the upper atmosphere. An international campaign involving the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee and ESA’s Space Debris Office monitored the reentry. The above illustration shows key features of ESA's GOCE satellite which disintegrated in the atmosphere in the early hours of this morning. Around 25 per cent of the satellite is thought to have plummeted into the South Atlantic . Tracking data from both the U.S. and Europe suggests the surviving debris fell just off the coast of South America, south of the Falkland Islands . 'The one-tonne GOCE satellite is only a small fraction of the 100–150 tonnes of man-made space objects that reenter Earth’s atmosphere annually,” said Heiner Klinkrad, Head of ESA’s Space Debris Office. 'In the 56 years of spaceflight, some 15 000 tonnes of man-made space objects have reentered the atmosphere without causing a single human injury to date.' Under UN’s Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects created in September of 1972, should a space fragment cause damage upon re-entry, the country that launched the satellite would be held accountable, Fox News reported. The treaty, which has been ratified by 88 countries as of January 2013, guarantees that the state responsible will pay compensation. In the case of GOCE, the satellite was launched from Russia, so that country would be on the hook for any damage. During its mission, GOCE has produced a unique model of the geoid, which is essentially a virtual surface where water does not flow from one point to another.

If your Instagram photos aren’t getting as much attention as you’d like, it may be down to the filters you’re using and even the colour of the object your photographing. Analytics firm Curalate studied millions of Instagram photos to determine which shots proved the most popular on the photo-sharing app. The research found blue-tinted images received 24 per cent more likes than images where the predominant colour was red or orange. Philadelphia-based analytics firm Curalate analysed 8 million Instagram photos to see which were most popular. It studied each image for 30 different features including different colours, saturation levels, texture, brightness and more. Predominantly blue images were more popular than red or orange shots, by around 24% . Based on the research from Curalate, to get the most likes for an Instagram photo make sure the predominant colour is blue, and avoid reds and oranges. Make sure the blue colour takes up more than 20 per cent of screen. Leave enough background space, and don't crop in images too closely. Use filters such as Walden and Rise to lower the saturation levels and make sure a flash is used, or the image contains a large of amount of light. Finally, if you want people to share the image on Twitter, upload the Instagram photo via the Twitter app and don't click Share directly from Instagram. Equally, posts with a high proportion of background space attracted 29 per cent more likes than images that were closely cropped. The Philadelphia-based firm tested 8 million Instagram posts for 30 different features. These included different colours, saturation, how much of an image was dominated by a particular hue, texture, brightness and more. As well as checking for the popularity of certain colours, Curalate discovered photos in which one colour in particular dominated the image gained 40 per cent more likes that multi-coloured images. This maybe because one-colour images are rare – Curalate found 90 per cent of the images analysed failed to have dominant colours. Lighter photos were more popular than . darker photos, by 24 per cent, and highly textured photos got more . attention than flatter snaps, by almost 80 per cent. In . particular, images with lightness levels measured by Curalate to be . between 65 and 80 per cent got almost 25 per cent more likes than images . with 0 to 45 per cent lightness. This photo would attract a high number of likes because the predominant colour is blue and the blue colour covers more than 20 per cent of the screen, according to Curalate. However, it is dark meaning it wouldn't get as many likes than if it was colourful and the blue is vibrant, while Instagram users prefer duller colours . As well as checking for the popularity of certain colours, Curalate discovered photos in which one colour in particular dominated the image, such as the green grass in this picture, gained 40 per cent more likes than multi-coloured images - regardless of the colour . The saturation levels in a photo also influenced its popularity, and this was predominantly down to the filter that was used. Instagram offers 20 different filters and some, including Walden and Rise, drain the colour from photos deliberately. Images with low saturation received 18 per cent more likes than more vibrant shots taken through filters such as Hefe and Kelvin.

Two midwives responsible for a sick woman's four-day-old baby lay the child on its stomach and left it in a stationery cupboard, a tribunal has heard. Yvonne Musonda-Malata and Christine Onade are accused of failing to provide appropriate clinical care to a baby while working on a night shift at Queen’s Hospital, Romford, north east London. Ms Malata, 35, who has worked as a nurse since 2004, was responsible for looking after the baby while its mother caught up on sleep, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) was told. It is alleged that she tended to the baby, known as Baby A, in a cot by the midwives station before moving it into a large stationery cupboard after it became unsettled. Yvonne Musonda-Malata (left) was responsible for looking after the baby while its mother caught up on sleep. Both she and Ms Onade (right) are also accused of failing to record any feeds given to Baby A . She and Ms Onade, 46, are also accused of failing to record any feeds given to Baby A. Both midwives deny all allegations. The alleged incident, which occurred on 18 April, 2011, was reported by Alex Curtis, a nursery nurse at the hospital who found the baby alone in the cupboard at about 6:30am. She told the tribunal: 'I went to the post-natal ward to get an envelope from the stationery cupboard and found a baby lying on its tummy on its own. 'The baby was in the cot just behind the door. I cannot remember whether the light was off or on, but I saw baby on its front and went to check if it was breathing. 'This was an unusual occurrence. We always lie a baby on its back as there is a risk of cot death. 'If, as a nursery nurse, I took responsibility for a parent’s baby, I would never leave it alone. If I needed to go off and do something, I would ask another nurse to look after the baby.' Derek Zeitlin, the case presenter at the NMC, said: 'The baby’s mother has a health condition and it is vitally important for her to get a good night’s sleep. Midwife Yvonne Musonda-Malata leaves the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), in central London, where she is facing allegations alongside of failing to provide appropriate clinical care to a baby . 'Her husband therefore invited the midwives to take the baby away so that his wife could get a good night’s sleep. 'That . decision was not taken lightly. The nurse looking after Baby A’s mother . was involved in that decision. It was the right thing to do.' Mr Zeitlin explained that the baby . became unsettled at 'various points' throughout the night, adding that . there was 'no specific place to put a baby' while it was looked after in . the post-natal ward. He . said that Ms Malata and Ms Onade had both confirmed that Ms Malata had . placed Baby A in a cot in the doorway of the cupboard, but claim that . the door was kept open. Mr Zeitlin said: 'There came a stage where Ms Malata was called away to another patient and was away for about 20 minutes. 'The next thing that happened was a member of the nursing staff went to the cupboard and was shocked to find Baby A inside. Midwife Christine Onade is accused of failing to record any feeds given to Baby A . 'The door was closed. The baby was found on its stomach, but babies are always placed on their back to avoid cot death.' He . added: 'There were no feeding charts for Baby A. The reality of that . was that entries that were made about feeds didn’t coincide with what . the registrants record about the feeds. 'There was a question of whether Baby A may have been overfed.' Rita Skeats, a midwife who was working alongside the midwives that evening, said: 'The first time I encountered Baby A was at 1.30am. I went to the midwives’ station and noticed Baby A in its cot. 'I remember that the father of the baby came out of the room [where his wife was sleeping] at 2.30am, complaining that the mother could still hear the baby crying. She could therefore not sleep. 'I recommended that the baby be cared for at the nursery, but Ms Malata and Ms Onade said they were coping OK and would keep the baby there. This decision was made jointly between the two midwives.' Ms Skeats, who has been a midwife at the hospital since 2001, told the tribunal that she had two further encounters with the baby, when she fed and changed it. She continued: 'When I returned [to the midwife station], Baby A had been placed in darkened section of the area. Ms Onade was looking after the baby at this time. 'She was by the desk and Baby A was fast asleep on [its] back. We do not allow babies under three months old to sleep on their front. 'At 6am I went to the nurses’ cupboard to retrieve my stethoscope, which I keep in my bag. At this time, Baby A was still in her cot in the darkened area of the midwives’ station. 'I went to to my patients and when I returned back to the midwives station later I did not know where the baby was, but I assumed it had been taken back to its mother. 'Alex Curtis said the baby was in a cupboard and it had vomited all over itself and it was suffocating in an airless cupboard. Baby A was fast asleep and the sheets were clean. There was no vomit. 'Ms Malata told me that the baby had not been in the cupboard. She told me that Baby A had been wedged in the door way.' An internal investigation was carried out by the hospital which found that Baby A had been overfed and there were poor records of the feedings. Helen Mansfield, supervisory midwife who conducted a preliminary investigation, said there were no guidelines for midwives caring for babies in that situation. Mr Zeitlin explained that the baby became unsettled at 'various points' throughout the night, adding that there was 'no specific place to put a baby' while it was looked after . She said: 'I was asked to investigate the incident, my role was to investigate the clinical care surrounding the incident. 'I looked at the guidelines on the post-natal ward and found there was no applicable policy or procedures on how to act in these circumstances. 'I discovered that Baby A had been overfed, there were no clear records of the feeding. 'I believe the baby had been overfed by the midwives. 'I concluded that there were no care issues during the incident. 'Apart from Alex Curtis not one other person saw the baby in the cupboard and it was all denied from every person I spoke to. 'If there had been more evidence of Baby A being in the cupboard it absolutely would have triggered a care issue but I had no other evidence apart from one person. 'Baby A was a well baby so there would be no requirement for that baby to have a feeding chart. 'The baby was fed although it was overfed.' A further investigation was carried out which led to both nurses being suspended. Claire O'Toole, associate human resources director at Queen's Hospital, said: 'I was asked to investigate a complaint on April 20 in 2011, raised by Alex Curtis. 'Miss Musonda-Malata was the named midwife and was unable to provide satisfactory care explanation for the duration of the shift. 'There was a lack of clarity for who was caring for Baby A. 'Miss Onade did have a significant level of involvement in the care of Baby A, she couldn't clearly outline the care when she had actually taken part in it. 'Miss Musonda-Malata engaged with the process well and was consistent but Miss Onoade was unresponsive and unwilling to engage. 'Miss Onade was reluctant to accept responsibility for Baby A. 'The incident brought the hospital into disrepute due to the publicity in The Sun. 'It exacerbated bad publicity we were experiencing as a trust, impacted on staff morale and the feelings of expectant mothers in the trust.' The hearing continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Yvonne Musonda-Malata and Christine Onade are accused of failing to provide appropriate clinical care to a baby while on a night shift .

The NHS is 'pulling out all the stops' to deal with the impact of bad weather, flu and the winter vomiting bug, leaders have confirmed. In a desperate attempt to avoid the chaos of last winter, more staff are being hired and several thousand more beds and GP appointments have been created. Some hospitals are re-opening old wards, some are building new ones and one has even gone as far as reserving a prefab building if all else fails. Prevention: The NHS is 'pulling out all the stops' to deal with impact of bad weather, flu and the winter vomiting bug, leaders have confirmed. In a desperate attempt to avoid the chaos of last winter, more staff are being hired and several thousand more beds have been created . There are fears that the health service may fail to cope with the fallout from winter weather – and some trusts, determined to avoid a crisis, have been running their winter strategies for the past two months, the Guardian reported. While A&E departments see fewer patients in the winter, research shows they are more likely to be admitted. And as admissions soar, beds become full, operations are cancelled and staff struggle to move people on from A&E. In a bid to deal with the predicted influx of patients as best as possible, trusts are recruiting nurses from abroad to tackle staff shortages so they can cope with the expected impact of norovius (the winter vomiting bug), flu and the fall-out of the bad weather . NHS . England deputy chief executive Dame Barbara Hakin said that despite hospitals already being busy – some have been running their winter strategy since September – she was ‘not complacent. Success: NHS England deputy chief executive Dame Barbara Hakin said that A&E staff have been seeing and treating patients who weren't admitted 'in under two hours' She added that A&E staff have been seeing and treating patients who weren’t admitted ‘in under two hours’. According to The Guardian, in Leeds, St James's hospital and Leeds General Infirmary will get another 65 beds, with 14 more on standby. There had also been plans for even more expansion – but this was hampered as not enough nurses could be recruited. Instead, doctors will work longer hours. Other trusts are turning to nursing homes to plug the supply gap.  County Durham and Darlington NHS foundation trust has arranged for 10 patients who need rehabilitation rather than treatment to be cared for in a home, to free up hospital beds. In the Cheltenham and Gloucester area, hospitals have recruited 35 Portuguese nurses and opened two more wards at the trust that runs Cheltenham General Hospital. ‘In the middle of winter we can see an extra ward of patients coming in on any day,' its chief executive, Frank Harsent, told the newspaper. He admitted he wants to avoid a re-run of last year's ‘difficult’ winter. And at the University Hospital of North Durham, extra ‘temporary’ beds created last winter have remained in existence ever since due to ‘all-year-round pressures’, bosses said. Last week NHS England confirmed that . £150m will be taken from its expected surplus to ease winter pressures . on A&E departments this year. This is on top of an additional £250m . given earlier in the year. Dame Barbara told the Health . Service Journal: ‘Last winter was a tough one for the NHS so this year . we started preparing earlier than ever before, with an extra £250m given . to those local systems in greatest need to support them over winter. ‘To . support those systems not deemed most at risk, NHS England will be . distributing a further £150m to help them maintain services and reduce . the pressure on A&Es caused by cold weather.' Overwhelmed: Hospitals are expecting an influx of patients suffering from norovius (the winter vomiting bug), flu and the fall-out of the bad weather . But . experts warn that even this won’t be enough to stop a crisis. The . medical director of one trust told the magazine recently that despite . the extra £400m: ‘It's all going to go completely pear-shaped and they . know it. It's entirely predictable.’ Chris Hopson, chief executive of the Foundation Trust Network, which represents almost all England's acute hospitals, said: ‘Everything that can be done for this winter is being attempted on the frontline. 'Trusts have been putting more money into meeting this demand by recruiting more staff, buying extra equipment, building and extending wards and emergency units and improving links and working arrangements between community, mental health, ambulance and hospital teams.’ Every trust is expected to vaccinate at least 75 per cent of their staff against the flu this year.","To try and avoid the .

Alleged Shooter: Corey Dunton, 16, has been arrested by NYPD following the shooting at Bryant Park's skating rink last night in Manhattan which has left a 14-year-old boy paralyzed . A New York teenager has been charged with attempted murder after he allegedly opened fire at skaters in Manhattan's Bryant Park and then seemed to confess to the crime on Facebook. During an hour-long standoff at his Bronx apartment on Sunday morning, Corey Dunton, 16, wrote on the social media website: 'Feds trien [sic] kick down my door its over were do i go from hereeeee...[I don't know] wat to do i f----ed up.' Minutes later, he added: 'These n----s gunna have to take me out take my life … I aint goin to jail i reather [sic] take my life!!' The alleged gang member is accused of shooting two men at the ice rink because of a dispute with another man over a coveted 'biggie' jacket he was wearing. When police began banging on his door at around 8 a.m., he posted: 'Feds at my door Im goin out with a bang!!!!!!! take my soul.' He is suspected to be a member of the Bloods gang and was taken to the Midtown South precinct house in Manhattan where he refused to answer questions and demanded a lawyer. The teenager allegedly fired on Javier Contreras, 20, of the Bronx, but in doing so hit Adonis Mera, 14, of Manhattan who now faces being paralyzed from the waist down. Police believe that Contreras was targeted for the particular Marmot Mammoth 'biggie' jacket he was wearing and was shot in the hand and the hips. A source with the NYPD confirmed that Contreras and Dunton knew each other. The arrest of Dunton comes after the distraught family of 14-year-old Mera expressed their fears he will never walk again. Currently being held in Bellevue Hospital in a critical but stable condition, Mera's brother Jorge Arias told the New York Daily News he visited to see his injured sibling. 'I didn’t really try to get him to speak,' Arias, 24, said. 'I just wanted to see his face. He’s a baby. He’s a little kid.' Scroll Down for Video .

Contreras was approached by the gunman and asked to hand over his jacket. When he refused the shooter left the rink but returned minutes later to unleash three gunshots - hitting both Contreras and Mera. This is not the first time the puffy 'biggie' jacket has become a source of problem in New York. The jacket, which costs $600, is believed to be the source of a scuffle in the Lower East Side earlier this year which led to Raphael Ward, 16, being shot in the chest over the coast. The coat was discontinued by Paragon Sports last year and as such has become a desirable and rare piece of fashion. The shocking incident happened just after 11pm Saturday, on the skating rink in the heart of the popular midtown park located at 42nd Street and 6th Avenue. Desirable: Police believe that Contreras was targeted for the particular Marmot Mammoth 'biggie' jacket - which are no longer made and retailed for $600 . Witnesses of the harrowing incident took to Twitter to share their accounts and photos from the crime scene. ‘People just fell on the floor because they heard a gunshot and they had ice skating skates on so they couldn’t run,’ said Raghuram Krishnamachar, 29, of Brooklyn, who was eating dinner with his girlfriend and her family at the park’s second-floor restaurant Celsius. ‘People were scared they didn’t know what was going on,’ he said. Krishnamachar said he heard three shots ring out and saw skaters down below scramble for safety, while one person lay motionless on the rink. He posted a photo of the scene on Twitter. He said restaurant patrons were told to lie on the floor and eventually were ushered to a back room. ‘We didn’t know anything. The shooter could’ve been a lunatic with a machine gun,’ he said. Full house: The free-admission ice rink was teeming with skaters just moments before gunfire erupted . Gunned down: Police say one of the victims was hit in the back while the other was struck in the leg . A witness told the New York Times Saturday night that he saw a man skate up to another person in the middle of the rink, pull a gun and open fire. In total, three shots reportedly rang out, sending park goers running for cover, some of them wearing only socks. A young woman believed to be a victim's sister was heard exclaiming, ‘My brother 'just got shot in front of my face.' Christopher Guerrero, 19, said one of the victims was a friend named Adonis, identified by MailOnline as Adonis Mera. Victim: One of the Bryant Park shooting victims has been identified as Adonis Mera . Skating enthusiast: Shortly before the shooting, Mera posted a message on his Facebook page saying that Bryant Park was crowded . Mera's friend who witnessed the shooting said the teen told him he could not feel his legs . According to Mr Guerrero, the teenager told him he could not feel his legs as he was lying on the ice. On his Facebook account, Mera posted a message Friday about his weekend plans: 'Catch me at Bryant Park!!' Shorty before the shooting, the boy wrote on his page that the park was packed with people. Early Sunday morning, Mera's numerous friends and well-wishers took to Twitter to post messages of support for the injured young man. Arelis Marie wrote: 'The fact that people can't go ice skating without someone tryna catch a body is crazy! Pull through Adonis, we're praying for you.'

In the 1970s, Bryant Park, like much of Midtown Manhattan, had been taken over by drug dealers, prostitutes and homeless people and was considered a no-go zone by law-abiding city dwellers. The park went through a massive overhaul in the late 80s, emerging as an exemplary urban green space after a 4-year renovation, which was praised by Time Magazine as a ‘small miracle.’ Manhunt: Police are searching for a suspect with dreadlocks and a red hoodie . Quarantine: Police secured the rink and questioned the park goers before letting them leave . These days, the park is packed with office workers on fair-weather weekdays, tourists and families on the weekends and ice skating enthusiasts during the winter months. In 2005, Bryant Park introduced Citi Pond - a free ice skating rink that became a fixture in the Manhattan holiday scene. It is open until midnight on the weekends.","Coret Dunton, 16, has been arrested and taken in custody at a Manhattan police station following a shooting last night at Manhattan's Bryant Park skating rink .

Smouldering: Photographer Thomas Knights wants to show redheads can be sexy with his exhibition . Positive image: Knights wants to give redheads more heroic role models . One of his flame haired models is an Olympic hero - gold medal winning longer jumper Greg Rutherford. Naturally red-haired himself, Knights, . from London, said he was bullied growing up as a . result of his locks and said it's wrong it has become an 'acceptable form of racism'. Now he wants to change the way society views redheads. He said: 'The aim of the . exhibition is to create the image of a positive role model for ginger . men because there's a serious lack of them in the UK. In film and TV they're portrayed as weak characters. 'It's . just like any other form of prejudice - being anti-ginger is like one . of the last acceptable forms of racism left in our society.

'Red haired men are never heroes or the leading man, never the alpha male, or portrayed as sexual. They seem to emasculate and desexualise guys with ginger hair.

He found men in the U.S. are often teased for their red-hair too but that it's far worse in the UK, where people can be instinctively and unashamedly 'derogatory' to redheads. He said: 'During the course of putting this . show together, I've had some very positive feedback from Mums and Dads . and spouses from around the world showing real gratitude because there's . stigma in the U.S. too.

Jailed: Bodyguard Christopher Cooknell, 54, made threats to kill his boss and his family in order to secure a pay rise . A private security guard deliberately set out to make the family that employed him fear for their lives in a desperately cruel bid to win a pay rise and promotion. Christopher Cooknell, 54, sent an anonymous letter and a number of text messages to victim Daniel Holloway, threatening to kill him and his family. The sick threats terrified the family, who as a result promoted Cooknell and increased his salary. On Tuesday at Basildon Crown Court judge David Owen-Jones sentenced Cooknell to three years in jail after he had admitted at a previeous hearing to fraud and making threats to kill. After sentencing, Senior Investigating Officer, DCI Lucy Robinson, said: ‘Christopher Cooknell is a dangerous man in that he fails to fully comprehend the implications of his actions. ‘He has caused a great deal of suffering to the victim and his family by sending distressing text messages, and his actions have also resulted in two innocent men being arrested for no reason. ‘His motivation appears to be entirely for selfish financial gain and I have no doubt that had his text messages been allowed to continue he would have become increasingly greedy and sought to demand money from Mr Holloway. ‘Thankfully it never came to this, but I hope his sentence today reflects the seriousness of his actions.’ Cooknell, from Ryde on the Isle of Wight, was part of a security team first employed to help protect Mr Holloway’s family following an aggravated burglary at their family estate in Brentwood, Essex, in June 2009. In August 2011, Cooknell sent an anonymous letter threatening a further burglary, at gunpoint, at the home. The letter also resulted in the arrest of two innocent gardeners who he had falsely implicated in the original break-in. Cooknell has since admitted his part in sending the letter, which he had hoped would result in the gardeners being sacked. No evidence was found linking the gardeners to the burglary. Cooknell then went onto to send anonymous death threats in December last year 2012 from a mobile phone that police later traced back to him. Shameless Cooknell claimed the messages had simply been a ‘prank’ but later admitted making threats to kill and fraud. Verdict: Cooknell was sentenced to three years in jail at Basildon Crown Court (pictured)","Christopher Cooknell, 54, sent death threats to Essex victim Daniel Holloway .

The 47-year-old from Benfleet, Essex was put under two days of surveillance and caught on camera helping himself to a pot of VigRX - a penis enlargement supplement - from a parcel he had opened up. Parcel: Stephan Brooks was caught stealing a variety of items from the post . Staff watched as Brooks opened up parcel after parcel, checking contents before putting them back if they were of no interest. During a second day of CCTV surveillance he used his knife to open seven more packages and stole cash. When Brooks was confronted by security staff he resigned from his job and asked that he be allowed to turn himself in to police. CCTV: Brooks was caught on camera by suspicious managers . Brooks was handed a six-month suspended sentence at Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court after admitting two counts of theft and three charges of unlawfully opening Royal Mail packages. He was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work in the community. Other items Brooks nabbed included Ray-Ban sunglasses, a designer watch, cufflinks and a harmonica. John Downing, chairman of the bench, told Brooks: 'You have pleaded guilty to five offences of premeditated thefts which is a serious breach of trust and causes an erosion of public confidence in the postal service.' Speaking afterwards James Eadie, spokesman for the Royal Mail, said: 'Every item of mail is important to us.
