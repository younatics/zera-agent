So it was unfortunate that the 140lbs mountain lion who made it all the way from South Dakota to Connecticut met a grisly end after being hit by a sports utility vehicle on a highway last month. The animal originated in the Black Hills region of South Dakota and was tracked by DNA from its hair and droppings as it passed through Minnesota and Wisconsin in 2009 and 2010, officials said. Dead cat: A worker examines the deceased mountain lion in Burlington, Connecticut, after it made a 2,000-mile trip from South Dakota and was killed by a car last month in Milford, Connecticut . ‘It is a testament to the adaptability of the species that it can travel so far from its original home in South Dakota to Connecticut,’ Connecticut environmental commissioner Daniel Esty said. ‘It’s a symbol, perhaps a signal of a stronger bounce back of some of our wildlife species,’ he told the Hartford Courant. ‘It was an incredible journey that ended in a tragic death on our highway here.’ He was the first confirmed wild mountain lion in Connecticut in more than 100 years, but was killed on June 11 when hit by a vehicle on the Wilbur Cross Parkway in Milford, Connecticut. North America’s mountain lion population is estimated at 100,000, mostly living in western regions and seldom travelling more than 100 miles. Authorities initially believed it was a captive animal that escaped, but tests showed it was not neutered or de-clawed and had no implanted microchips - commonly used in domestic animals. Journey: The animal originated in the Black Hills region of South Dakota and was tracked by DNA from its hair and droppings as it passed through Minnesota and Wisconsin in 2009 and 2010, before arriving in Conneticut . Tests also determined the cat, aged between two and four years old, was likely to be the same one that had been seen earlier in Greenwich, Connecticut - a New York City suburb 30 miles away. ‘It’s a symbol, perhaps a signal of a stronger bounce back of some of our wildlife species. It was an incredible journey that ended in a tragic death on our highway here' State environment official Daniel Esty . The death was followed by a flurry of big cat sightings in Connecticut, but experts dismissed most as unreliable. Officials believe no native mountain lions live in Connecticut. Although it was an anomaly, Mr Esty said the presence of the wild mountain lion is a good sign of the ability of Connecticut's conserved land to sustain wildlife. He said: ‘(The discovery is) a strong symbol of what we had all hoped for who work in the conservation area, that wilderness areas and biological diversity can be preserved and protected. ‘This guy had a really adventurous spirit.’ Spotted: He was the first confirmed wild mountain lion in Connecticut in more than 100 years, but was killed on June 11 when hit on the Wilbur Cross Parkway in Milford, Connecticut . Walking: The 140lbs mountain lion made it all the way from South Dakota to Connecticut but met a grisly end after being hit by a sports utility vehicle on a highway last month . It’s believed the lion crossed a river in Connecticut. ‘Rivers do present a bit of a challenge for them,’ biologist Paul Rego told the New Haven Register. ‘Certainly not insurmountable, though.’ ‘(The discovery is) a strong symbol . of what we had all hoped for who work in the conservation area, that . wilderness areas and biological diversity can be preserved and . protected. This guy had a really adventurous spirit' State environment official Daniel Esty . Genetic testing showed the cat had the same genetic structure of the mountain lion population in South Dakota's Black Hills region. Genetics experts in Montana matched the DNA with samples collected from a cat spotted in eastern Minnesota near Minneapolis and in northern Wisconsin from late 2009 through early 2010. It was unclear what route the animal took to Connecticut, but biologists said it could have travelled south near urban areas or north through Canada. Several museums are now considering displaying the animal’s body, which is now in a freezer, but is still not known exactly why the lion decided to make the long journey.","Mountain lion's walk is one of longest-ever journeys for any land mammal .

Guilty: Mahmoud Abdel Salam Omar acknowledged he kissed the woman on the lips and neck and touched her breasts after she brought tissues to his Pierre hotel room . A prominent Egyptian banker today pleaded guilty to kissing a hotel maid and groping her breasts, as she sued him for $5million. Mahmoud Abdel Salam Omar acknowledged he kissed the woman on the lips and neck and touched her breasts after she brought tissues to his room at the posh Pierre hotel in New York. The 74-year-old chairman of state-run . salt production firm El-Mex Salines Co. has already spent five days of . community service in a soup kitchen. His case will be closed without jail time or probation if he stays out of trouble for a year. His lawyer, Lori Cohen, called the case the result of a 'big miscommunication' between the 44-year-old maid and Omar. While he acknowledged in court that . he knew he didn't have the woman's consent for his advances, Cohen said . he thought the housekeeper was receptive. 'I believe he thought something was . happening that wasn't,' she said. 'I think his lack of a great . understanding of English, and her desire to file a multimillion-dollar . lawsuit, led to these accusations.' The . woman's assault and false-imprisonment lawsuit, filed in federal court, . says Omar also rubbed his groin against her legs and groped her . buttocks. Posh: The assault took place at Omar's $900-a-night Pierre Hotel suite In New York . In . the lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court the woman has asked for . $1million for each of the three counts Omar was charged with. She also asked a judge to grant her a $2million punitive damage award, bringing the total to $5 million. Her lawyer didn't immediately return a telephone message, but prosecutors said she was satisfied with Omar's plea deal. Fighting back: The maid, who accused former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn of raping her in his hotel room, has hired a lawyer in France to help track down other potential victims of the 62-year-old . Suffering: The maid embroiled in the Strauss-Khan case who cannot be identified for legal reasons, is also expected to seek substantial damages . Omar, a former bank chairman, initially faced a felony sexual abuse charge that carried up to seven years in prison. After interviewing numerous witnesses and reviewing surveillance video and forensic evidence, prosecutors concluded the incident 'did not rise to the level of forcible compulsion,' which would have to be proven for the felony charge, Manhattan assistant district attorney Nicole Blumberg said. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly had said the case could be complicated to prosecute. Although the maid told a superior immediately that she had been attacked, the supervisor waited until the next morning to alert the hotel's security director, who then told police. The hotel suspended the supervisor and promised to buy 'panic buttons' for maids to alert managers if they are attacked. Omar's lawyer said he might well have chosen to go to trial but was eager to get home to his wife, who has recently had surgery. 'This was the most expeditious way for him to return home,' she said. Meanwhile the maid, who accused . former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn of raping her in his hotel room, . has hired a lawyer in France to help track down other potential victims . of the 62-year-old. The 32-year-old maid, who accused . Strauss-Khan of assault while in his $3,000-a-night suite at New York's . Sofitel Hotel in May, is also expected to seek damages. She has added French lawyer, Thibault de Montbrial, to her growing legal team. Montbrial said he was hired to contact other 'victims' of Strauss-Khan, according to the New York Post.

The Great Ormond Street Hospital's Million Disney Memories drive, launched today, is encouraging people to 'donate' their earliest recollections on the kids' movie franchise. When they reach one million memories, Disney will donate £1million for the charity. Scroll down for videos . Looking back: Sir Michael Caine talks about his early memories of Bambi as part of the Million Disney Memories campaign . Several stars say Bambi left them in floods of tears when they were children. Sir Michael Caine said: 'My memories were Snow White and Bambi in those days, I remember crying my eyes out when Bambi’s mother died in the forest and laughing my head off at the Seven Dwarfs. 'I grew up with cartoons. My favourite Disney villain would have to be the wicked witch from Snow White, I think she is great and my favourite Disney hero is Mickey Mouse, he was my first hero and my favourite.' Cold Feet star Fay Ripley also said one of her first Disney memories was of Bambi. Sharing is caring: Edith Bowman has shared her first Disney memory which will help to raise money for Great Ormond Street . 'I went to see Bambi and I ran into that cinema full of the joys of life and I ran out of it sobbing.' Will Mellor remembers 'crying my eyes out as a kid' during the movie. 'It was a really sad film. My kids haven’t watched it yet, but I’m going to introduce them to it, to share my tears.' Alesha Dixon was more optimistic. 'It was the most beautiful experience and highly emotional,' she said. 'Disney literally transported me to another world that I didn't want to end.' Gavin and Stacey actress Joanna Page was more scared while watching Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. 'I was quite traumatised and I cried a lot,' she said. 'I . remember thinking it was so awful for poor Snow White and I felt so . terrible about all the dwarfs and it really, really upset me. 'Then . my parents got me a Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs book and put my . name in it as if I was their friend and I remember being very frightened . by that, thinking that I was involved in the story – although I think . I’d quite like that now.' Dear deer: Cold Feet star Fay Ripley said her first Disney memory was of Bambi .

"Defendant is spared jail after her attempt to kill . Husband's Parkinson’s disease results in lack of emotion, court told . By . Luke Salkeld . Last updated at 1:12 AM on 28th July 2011 . A cat lover tried to smother her husband after he failed to comfort her about the death of her pet. Margaret Sandercock, 66, attacked her husband while grieving for 16-year-old Fluffy, who had been put down a few hours previously. A court heard that she hoped her husband Graham, who has Parkinson’s disease, would give her a ‘cuddle’. Troubled relationship: The court heard how Graham's Parkinson's disease had put a strain on his marriage with Margaret . But his illness meant he could not express his emotions, and in her rage and frustration she twice attempted to smother him with a pillow, first at midnight and again at 3am. Mr Sandercock, also 66, managed to fight her off and the next day his wife, a former  Royal British Legion standard bearer, was found drunk in a churchyard near the couple’s home in Trobridge, near Crediton, Devon. She confessed to paramedics what she had done. Troubled relationship: Margaret Sandercock wanted a cuddle from her husband . Yesterday she wept at Exeter Crown Court as she was spared jail. Mr Justice Butterfield said Sandercock had looked after her husband for 28 years without a break because he refused to go into respite care. He described looking after someone with Parkinson’s as a ‘demanding, draining and difficult’ task. He said: ‘She regrettably became dependent on alcohol to counter that very stressful and extremely debilitating role she found herself in, and she was very isolated, unappreciated and very lonely.’ The judge said Fluffy had been, for the defendant, one of the ‘sole things that gave her pleasure in this world’. He added: ‘She turned to her husband for some expression of sympathy, care or comfort. ‘She got none and reacted in the way that she did. It was a wrong thing to do.’ The court heard that the provision of a carer had been withdrawn due to cutbacks. Prosecutor Richard Crabb said that when Sandercock was arrested she told police: ‘My cat died and I just wanted him to talk to me. ‘I did not try to kill him. My cat had been put down and I had gone into his bedroom, I wanted a cuddle. ‘I cuddled the pillow. I did not want him dead.’ Sandercock was given a two-year community order after she admitted a charge of putting a person in fear of violence by harassment. She is also subject to an indefinite restraining order banning any contact with her estranged husband. He is now living away from the marital home. The court heard that Sandercock referred to her husband’s disease as ‘Mr Parkinson’ and said that ‘he’ had ruined both their lives.","Defendant is spared jail after her attempt to kill .

"By . Ian Drury . Last updated at 11:49 AM on 27th July 2011 . Major James Bowman was shot during his sleep by Talib Hussein . Three British troops were slaughtered by a rogue Afghan soldier after a row over bottled water, an inquest heard. Major James Bowman, 34, Lieutenant Neal Turkington, 26, and Corporal Arjun Purja Pun, 33, were killed after ‘incidents of friction’ between UK and Afghan forces. The murderer launched a machine-gun and rocket-propelled grenade attack against the 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles under cover of darkness. Talib Hussein, 23, later claimed responsibility for the massacre, blaming ‘anger’ at British troops’ conduct at a military compound near Babaji in central Helmand. Hussein, a sergeant, had been living, eating, sleeping and fighting with the Royal Gurkhas, who were training and mentoring the Afghan National Army (ANA). Details surrounding the attack emerged for the first time yesterday at the inquest in Trowbridge, Wiltshire. Lieutenant Colonel Gerald Strickland, the battalion’s commanding officer, told of tensions between British and Afghan troops at Patrol Base Three. Blast: Lt Turkington, left, and Cpl Pun were killed by a rocket-propelled grenade . In May last year, a Gurkha religious temple in the fortress was vandalised after an Afghan soldier was reprimanded for taking bottles of chilled water. A few weeks later a member of the ANA was accidentally shot dead by a Gurkha who mistakenly feared he was being attacked while on patrol. Lt Col Strickland said: ‘There were no . recriminations at all as a result of it. It was accepted by the Afghans . as something that happened.’ Later however, at around 2.40am on July 13 last year, Hussein shot dead Major Bowman, of Salisbury, Wiltshire, as he slept in his tent. UK troops in Afghanistan are working with and training members of the Afghan National Army . Then he fired a rocket-propelled . grenade into the shipping container used as the base’s command centre, . killing Lt Turkington, of Craigavon, Northern Ireland, and Corporal Pun, . from Nepal, and wounding four other UK soldiers. Hussein, . an intelligence officer, returned to the Afghan living quarters within . the base, telling his commander: ‘Look out, the Taliban are attacking . the ISAF.’ He then fled the base. Lt Col Strickland told the inquest that he stopped Afghan forces from hunting down Hussein. He said: ‘They were horrified. They were as surprised as we were and wanted to do anything to resolve the issue.’ Lt Col Strickland said there was no evidence that Hussein was either a Taliban infiltrator or high on drugs. The inquest continues.","Talib Hussein shot one soldier while he slept, and killed the other two with a rocket-propelled grenade ."
"Emma Bent's scam discovered after dog walker found bodies of four dogs in a ditch . Fined just £3,000 after illegal disposal of 2,800 animals . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:44 PM on 27th July 2011 . Sickening: Mother of three Emma Bent, 36, dumped bodies of pets in bin bags and set fire to animal corpses at her home in Heage . A mother who burned the bodies of pets in fields and left their bodies to rot in bin bags has been fined just £3,000. Emma Bent, 36, made £90,000 by setting up a 'pet crematorium' where she promised owners tasteful funerals for their beloved animals. Those who were duped by her scam, which she ran from her home in Heage, Derbyshire, were outraged that she 'got off lightly' for the illegal disposal of 2,800 animals. Bent served only seven weeks of her . eight-month sentence after pleading guilty to 23 charges in February. The charges included seven counts of . fraud and 16 others relating to her business Peak Pet Cremations. These included operating an illegal incinerator and disposal of . animal by-products. Bent's operation was only discovered when a dog walker came across the bodies of four dogs in a ditch. Police traced owners from microchips implanted in the animals and realised they had all used Bent's service. The bodies of four cats, a guinea pig, rabbit, chicken and badger were found in sacks in Bent's shed, as well as the charred remains of three cats and five dogs. At Derby Crown Court, a judge ruled she was to pay £3,100 despite the prosecution alleging Bent made £88,202.23 from her business. Callous: Two of the dogs that Emma Bent disposed of illegally after promising owners a 'respectful' funeral . Linda Allen's collie Bourneville was found decomposed in a Derbyshire field in August 2009 after supposedly being cremated by Bent. She said: 'She's got off lightly. There were so many people she hurt. She's starting a new life now - it just doesn't seem fair. 'It's not enough. After all, she was sentenced to eight months but she only did seven weeks. We were furious when we found out. 'Our pets were not just animals, they were part of our families. We treated them with respect when they were alive so their bodies should have been treated with respect as well.' Thrown away: Tyson the dog was much loved by her owners and was dumped by Bent who ran a 'pet crematorium' Bent, a mother of three, also conned pet owners by telling them their animals had been cremated when in fact she was handing over jars of ashes from a bonfire. Nicholas Cole, prosecuting, said Bent made £88,202.23 from her business. However Judge Ebraham Mooney said Bent only needed to pay back £3,100 as that was the value of her assets. The remains of Barbara Lambert's 17-year-old terrier, Nip, were found rotting in a shed in a field rented by Bent. Disgusted: Some of the pet owners who were scammed by Emma Bent attended Derby Crown Court to see her sentenced . Mrs Lambert, from Ilkeston, said she was 'gobsmacked' by Bent's actions. She said: 'I can't believe it, although I'm pleased they tried to get money off her because she shouldn't benefit from what she's done. 'It's nearly two years since we lost our Nip but this is still going on and I'm gutted. It's an insult to us all. She's got away with so much. 'She did something that none of us would ever dream of doing, yet she's got away with it so lightly.' The Crown Prosecution Service would not comment any further on the decision. A spokesman said: 'We can't comment on any details which did not come out in court. The court's decision is based on a valuation of the person's assets.'","Emma Bent's scam discovered after dog walker found bodies of four dogs in a ditch .

A plane passenger punched a pilot in the face then attacked him again with his brother before they were tackled by bystanders, officials said. Jonathan and Luis Baez, both of Las Piedras, Puerto Rico, were arrested last night at Miami Airport after leaving a flight bound for San Francisco. The pilot suffered cuts and bruises to his face and blurred vision, and was afraid Luis Baez would follow through on a death threat, police said. 'Fight': Luis Baez, left, and Jonathan Baez, right, both of Las Piedras, Puerto Rico, were arrested at Miami Airport after leaving a flight bound for San Francisco . The incident arose after a flight attendant noticed Jonathan Baez was unresponsive and appeared to be intoxicated or on drugs, police said. The Baez brothers had been aboard American Airlines Flight 1755 bound for the California city on Wednesday night, an arrest affidavit said. While the plane taxied away from the gate, a flight attendant noticed Jonathan Baez was sleeping and had not buckled his seat belt, police said. The attendant tried to wake him, but told police that Jonathan Baez was unresponsive and appeared to be intoxicated or on drugs. ‘As we always do with these things, . we'd much rather deal with it on the ground than in the air. He was apparently barely compliant . at that point. He was exhibiting symptoms of intoxication. He was not . walking well when he went up the aisle' American Airlines spokesman . The pilot turned the plane around and returned to a gate before Jonathan Baez was woken up and told to get off the plane, police said. ‘As we always do with these things, we'd much rather deal with it on the ground than in the air,’ an American Airlines spokesman said. ‘He was apparently barely compliant at that point,' the spokesman alleged. 'He was exhibiting symptoms of intoxication. He was not walking well when he went up the aisle.'

The brothers walked off the plane, but then Jonathan Baez returned and allegedly punched the pilot in the face. He then hit the flight attendant in the shoulder when she tried to intervene, police said. Both brothers attacked the pilot again in the jet bridge and chased him in the terminal, the arrest report said. Other flight crew members and passengers held down the brothers until police arrived. ‘There was a scuffle that took place, so about three or four of us went out there and tackled the guys,’ witness Ken Venting told KGO-TV. ‘There were two of them and I guess the pilot ended up with some contusions on his face.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:30 PM on 28th July 2011 . The world's population looks set to smash through the seven billion this year - an increase of one billion in just a decade. Findings also reveal that by 2050 the world's population will swell to over nine billion. The 10 billion mark is expected to be passed by 2100, although depending on birth rates the population could be as high as 15.8 billion at the start of the 22nd Century. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Populations of developed countries such as the UK and USA will remain flat, but will age, with fewer adults of working age to support those who have retired . Researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, USA, in conjunction with the UN, said the swelling population size would bring 'unprecedented global economic demographic upheaval.' They also claim that almost all (97 per cent) of the projected 2.3 billion increase in population will occur in less developed regions, with nearly half [49 per cent] in Africa. By contrast, the populations of developed countries such as the UK and USA will remain flat, but will age, with fewer adults of working age to support those who have retired and are living on pensions. Countries and areas classified by fertility level - large swathes of Africa have a high fertility level but most of Europe is low . While the world's population took until 1800 to reach one billion, it has grown rapidly in the past two centuries, swelling from three to seven billion in the last half century alone. In 2011 135 million people are predicted to be born, while 57 million will die - a net increase of 78 million people. There is some debate over how accurate the projections are, with changes in birth rates meaning that by 2050 the population could be two billion lower than predicted, at eight billion, and by 2100 it could be as low as 6.2 billion, or as high as 15.8 billion. Experts claim that almost all (97 per cent) of the projected 2.3 billion increase in population will occur in less developed regions, with nearly half in Africa . Study author Professor David Bloom, from the department of economics and demographics at Harvard University, said: 'Although the issues immediately confronting developing countries are different from those facing the rich countries, in a globalized world demographic challenges anywhere are demographic challenges everywhere. 'The world's population has grown slowly for most of human history. It took until 1800 for the population to hit 1 billion. 'However, in the past half-century, population jumped from 3 to 7 million.  'In 2011, approximately 135 million people will be born and 57 million will die, a net increase of 78 million people. Considerable uncertainty about these projections remains. Population for countries grouped by fertility level 1950 - 2100 . 'Depending on whether the number of births per woman continues to decline, the ranges for 2050 vary from 8.1 to 10.6 billion, and the 2100 projections vary from 6.2 to 15.8 billion.' Prof Bloom, whose teams' results are printed in journal Science added: 'Population trends indicate a shift in the 'demographic centre of gravity' from more to less developed regions. 'Already strained, many developing countries will likely face tremendous difficulties in supplying food, water, housing, and energy to their growing populations, with repercussions for health, security, and economic growth.' He concluded: 'The demographic picture is indeed complex, and poses some formidable challenges. 'Those challenges are not insurmountable, but we cannot deal with them by sticking our heads in the sand. 'We have to tackle some tough issues ranging from the unmet need for contraception among hundreds of millions of women and the huge knowledge-action gaps we see in the area of child survival, to the reform of retirement policy and the development of global immigration policy. 'It's just plain irresponsible to sit by idly while humankind experiences full force the perils of demographic change.'","Population expected to reach 10billion by 2100 .

An eight-year-old triplet died after suffering serious head injuries while horse riding on a holiday to celebrate his birthday with his parents and siblings. Hugh Moss-Wilcox had been on holiday with his parents and brother and sister in the U.S. to celebrate a birthday when the accident happened in April. The family, from Dorset, are now taking legal action against the ranch at a park near Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri. Tragic death: Hugh Moss-Wilcox, known as Ted, was killed while riding with his family in Missouri . His parents are also launching a safety campaign in Britain to make stables safer for inexperienced riders. Hugh Moss-Wilcox, known as Ted, was riding with his parents Terrence Wilcox and Christine Moss and his brother Jack and sister Amy at a park near Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri. An inquest was told today that the horses spooked and Ted's saddle became dislodged. As a result he fell off the horse sideways and was then kicked in the head before he fell off. Mrs Moss told the inquest that Jack fell off instantly, Amy stayed on for a few seconds but Ted was dragged behind the horse. The boy died in University of Missouri Hospital the following day from blunt force trauma to the head. A post-mortem examination was carried out in the U.S. He was buried next to his grandfather in Great Dunmow, Essex. The family lives in Wimborne, Dorset. Essex assistant deputy coroner Eleanor McGann recorded a verdict of accidental death. Mrs Moss, a freelance social worker, . told the hearing in Chelmsford that they were pursuing legal action . against the riding establishment. She said that the three children and her husband were all riding as she watched. But . she continued : 'Ted was kicked while he was still on the horse. I . didn't actually see him come off but I'm pretty certain he was kicked as . he was hanging. He had started to slide off. It was the back foot of . the horse [which struck him]. The horse was determined to get him off.' She added that she also felt Ted's helmet might have been too loose. Hugh Moss-Wilcox died in an accident near Lake of the Ozarks . 'I'm not a horse rider. Nobody helped us check the helmets. It was a bit looser than I would have liked but it was the third one he tried on and we ended up doing it ourselves without any advice,' she said. 'I feel as if the riding establishment was negligent in teaching children who were first time riders, which he was. The only reason we are taking legal action in the States is to try and prevent it happening to another child.' The inquest was told that the American authorities had treated it as a tragic accident.  After the hearing Mrs Moss said they were not pursuing legal action for the money. She added that she was also concerned about the state of children's horse riding in England. 'The more I find out the more scared I am for children in this country. We live in a horsey area and everybody I have spoken to knows about incidents of children on horses who have had very serious accidents. It's more dangerous than motorcycling.' She said that unless parents are riders themselves they don't know what questions to ask. 'Given I know it's dangerous I want children to have a licence and riding establishments to train them up to a riding standard.' The triplets were born in Missouri and she and her husband, Terry, a retired social worker, had taken them back for a four-week holiday on 31 March. They were also planning to visit other states.

There are 1.5 million bats living under a . bridge in Austin that make up the world's largest urban bat colony, and . a historic drought is making them hungrier than ever when they come out . for food. It’s good news for the people who gather each evening just a few blocks from the state Capitol building to watch their spectacular nightly trips into the nearby Hill Country to find nourishment. Spectacular sight: There are 1.5 million bats living under a bridge in Austin that make up the world's largest urban bat colony, and a historic drought is making them hungrier than ever when they come out for food . The drought has killed off crops in Texas, and that in turn has killed off those delicious pests the Mexican free-tailed bats consider dinner. They are leaving home earlier than usual each night to find food, giving the locals in the bat-crazy city a few more minutes to watch the normally-nocturnal critters fly before the sun goes down. Each night they stream from under a bridge by the hundreds of thousands in a black cloud so large that it shows up on a local weather radar. ‘It's wonderful for people to be able to see them, and they are really spectacular,’ said bat conservationist James Eggers. ‘But it's an indicator that things are a little tougher for the bats.’ Austin resident Lawrence Collins joked: ‘They're attracting the tourists to the bridge earlier in the evening. That becomes a serious impediment to getting across the river for Happy Hour.’ The daylight departure is a bittersweet phenomenon, enjoyable to bat lovers only because naturalists do not see any negative long-term effects if the drought ends soon. Crowds: People watch millions of the Mexican Freetail Bats emerge from the Congress Avenue bridge in Austin, Texas. The Mexican free-tailed bats have been flying from the bridge for more than 20 years . Mr Eggers said up to two years of drought is a natural cycle and won’t affect the species as a whole. But some scientists fear it’s not a regular drought but a change coming thanks to global warming. ‘If we have an extended drought for many years, that could affect the population of the Mexican free-tails,’ he said. ‘It's wonderful for people to be able to . see them, and they are really spectacular. But it's an indicator that things are a little tougher . for the bats' Bat conservationist . James Eggers . An extended drought could be a double whammy for central Texas farmers, who depend on the bats to remove some 1,000 tons of insects and pests from the air each night. A study in 2006 showed that area cotton farming, which was a $4.5million-a-year industry at the time, saved some $750,000-a-year from pestilence thanks to the Mexican free tails. Some 100 million bats live in Central Texas. The largest bat colony in the world resides in a cave northwest of San Antonio, with more than 20 million bats living there. The Mexican free-tails summer in central Texas and winter in Mexico. Big eaters: The bats under the bridge consume 10,000 to 30,000lbs of bugs every night and bring in about $8million in tourist revenue every year from the nearly 100,000 people who visit the bat colony each summer . Around March, about 750,000 pregnant females come to downtown Austin and nest under the Congress Street bridge, just blocks from historic Sixth Street and the governor's mansion. A few months later, they have their babies - one offspring per year - and their numbers double to 1.5 million. ‘If we have an extended drought for many years, that could affect the population of the Mexican free-tails' Bat conservationist . James Eggers . The nightly spectacle, which draws visitors from all over the world, lasts through about October, when the bats return to Mexico. The bats moved into Austin in the . 1980s when the bridge, then 70 years old, was reinforced with beams that . surprisingly turned out to be a perfect habitat for them. At first, locals were revolted by the . idea, and ignorant of the benefits of having them as neighbours. There . was even talk of extermination. But then an education campaign by the . founder of Mr Eggers's group Bat Conservation International, Dr. Merlin . D. Tuttle, turned that around. Now, Austin embraces its friends under . the bridge. New arrivals: Around March, about 750,000 pregnant female bats come to downtown Austin and nest under the Congress Street bridge, just blocks from historic Sixth Street and the governor's mansion . There is a huge bat sculpture next to . downtown. The Official Drink of Austin is the Bat-ini and the bat . conservation group moved its headquarters from Milwaukee to Austin. The once-reviled bats are now a point of pride for Austin and coveted by neighbouring cities. ‘The bats are our unofficial mascot. We even had a minor league hockey . team (the Icebats) named after them at one time. Their return each . spring marks the beginning of festival season. And, they're weird. Just . like Austin' Austin resident Susan Floyd . The Texas Department of Transportation works closely with Mr Eggers's group now to adapt new bridges and roadways across Texas in the same manner as Congress to attract bats. In Austin alone, the bats bring in some $8million from eco-tourism. But that's not the only reason Austin, which loves to brag about its individuality, adores them. ‘The bats are our unofficial mascot,’ Austin resident Susan Floyd said. ‘We even had a minor league hockey team (the Icebats) named after them at one time.

Fundraising: Suggested fundraising ideas include finding ways way to extort money from foreign oil, construction, transport and cell phone companies . Al Qaeda militants in Iraq made an online appeal today for new fundraising ideas to help thousands of widows and children of slain fighters. Insurgents of the Islamic State of Iraq - an umbrella group for Sunni militants - said they are in dire need of money after their main source of funding has dried up. In the past the group have funded their operations by robbing jewellery stores, banks and offices where the government pays out monthly salaries. But the main source of money, funding from abroad, has diminished leaving the group strapped for cash. In . an Arabic statement posted on Al Qaeda in Iraq's online forum, website . administrator Seif Saad lamented the state of the group's finances. He launched an urgent appeal for money to 'feed the widows and the orphans' of mujahedeen, or holy warriors. He wrote: 'A few days ago a brother was martyred, leaving behind a wife and children. 'There is no need to explain how we were running here and there to collect money for their minimum requirements of life,' Among the new ideas to raise funds, Saad suggested insurgents find a way to extort money from foreign oil, construction, transport and cell phone companies, as well as international media agencies. If the companies refused to pay, insurgents would disrupt their operations. He did not elaborate as to how. He said businessmen and wealthy families should be forced to pay annual zakat, or charity, which Islam stipulates should be roughly two percent of assets. He also called for imposing fines on wealthy Shiites in Iraq 'who receive aid from America and the West and steal the country's oil revenues.' Mohamed Abdel-Hadi, who identified himself online another administrator for the website, dismissed the idea of taking money from foreign companies, but said he strongly supports fining Shiites. 'All the Shiites, including merchants or government officials, are infidels and confiscating their money is part of jihad,' he wrote. A visitor on the website posted a comment suggesting militants kidnap company executives in return for hefty ransoms that could finance a prolonged insurgency. Islamic State of Iraq: One suggestion was the kidnapping of company executives in return for hefty ransoms that could finance a prolonged insurgency . Another contributor advised recruiting specialized Internet hackers to transfer money from U.S. banks to trusted people. The contributor did not elaborate. The Islamic State of Iraq claimed responsibility for last year's heists of the Central Bank of Iraq and a state-run investment centre. The global arm of Al-Qaeda has itself appealed for funds in the past. One request was made by Al-Qaeda's Ayman al-Zawahri, who became the leader of the group after the death of Osama bin Laden. Last year, Al-Qaeda's top commander in Afghanistan, Mustafa Abu al-Yazeed, also appealed for more funding, saying militants battling NATO forces were hampered by a lack of money and equipment. Osama bin Laden, who was killed by U.S. forces in Pakistan in May, also appealed for more funds in some of his statement, urging businessmen to direct their alms to Al-Qaeda. The latest appeal comes as U.S. officials said they believed Al Qaeda was on the 'brink of collapse'. Defence Secretary Leon Panetta said during his recent visit to Afghanistan that the U.S. was 'within reach of strategically defeating Al Qaeda'. His comment was dismissed by sceptics as an attempt to energise troops,  while at the same time defending the administration’s decision to wind down a decade-old war. But senior officials from the CIA, the National Counterterrorism Center and other agencies have expressed similar views in classified intelligence reports. Republican Senator for Georgia Saxby Chambliss said: 'There is a swagger within the community right now for good reason. 'Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is nowhere near defeat. 'But when it comes to Al Qaeda [core leadership in Pakistan], we have made the kind of strides that we need to make to be in a position of thinking we can win.'","Ideas included insurgents find a way .

"By . Sanjay Jha . Last updated at 5:43 PM on 27th July 2011 . Saved: British-born Catholic nun Jacqueline Jean McEwan was to be forced out of India after three decades of caring for lepers . She became known as a modern-day Mother Teresa after spending three decades caring for leprosy patients in India. Yet British nun Jacqueline Jean McEwan still found herself facing deportation back home when her application for a new resident permit was turned down. Despite protestations and a huge public outcry, the 63-year-old was about to board a plane yesterday that would have taken her away from a life treating the sick and needy in Bangalore. It was only then - amid warnings that the ‘heart’ would be ‘ripped out’ of the Catholic mission where she served - that the Indian government carried out a u-turn. She has now been given a last-minute temporary reprieve to stay on in the country while her visa problems are sorted out. The country’s home secretary P Chidambaram said this means ‘Sister Jean’ should be able to stay ‘without limit of time’ ‘I am overjoyed and very confident that I would live here forever,’  the Newcastle-raised Catholic nun said yesterday. ‘I love the people here and have a strong sense of attachment to this place. ‘It feels great to be with my well-wishers, my own kith and kin, mostly those inflicted with leprosy. Welcome back: Jacqueline Jean McEwan was about top board a plane before the last-minute u-turn by the Indian government . ‘I will strive for their welfare. There is no meaning in going back to UK when my people are here.’ Sister Jean has been working for leprosy patients in Bangalore city in the southern Indian state of Karnataka after arriving in 1982. Belonging to the Montfort Missionaries, a congregation of the Catholic church founded in France in the 18th century, she came from England as part of a batch of nurses and medics to the Sumanahalli Society in Bangalore. She chose never to go back, and her work in the last 29 years means she is now called Sumanahalli’s ‘Mother Teresa’. Sister Jean said she wasn’t given any reason by authorities for being kicked out and was simply told to leave the country by 25th July. Caring: At the mission 'Sister Jean' has helped treat thousands of people . Some critics fear that Indian authorities do not like attention being drawn to a debilitating disease that they officially claim to have eradicated. When she first arrived she hadn’t need any visa as at that time citizens of Commonwealth countries could travel to each other’s country without Visas. When she applied for renewal of her resident permit to live in India in December 2010, she was denied permission to stay. She said: ‘I still don’t know the reason. I’ve been living with the poor and needy all these years with the resident permit issued by Indian authorities.’ Before yesterday’s official u-turn, the Society’s director, Father George Kannanthanam, said: ‘We don’t have anybody to take care of our clinics who is as trained and committed as Sister Jean. ‘She’s wonderful – she knows every leprosy patient by name, even though Indian names are difficult. ‘They call her “Amma” (mother) – she’s like a mother to them. It’s as if Sumanahalli’s heart is being ripped out.’ Famous: Sister Jean is known as the British Mother Teresa for the work she has done in the country, and her proposed expulsion was national news . Sister Jean along with other Montfort sisters working at the centre provides treatment, education, housing and medical care. She said she not only remembers each and every patient’s name, but also their treatment and even their family members. She remembers most of the 5000 odd patients’ names that Sumanahalli has treated in the past 29 years. Even though the Indian government officially claims to have eliminated leprosy, there are still an estimated 130,000 Indians diagnosed with the disease every year – more than every other country put together. Leprosy Patients are often pushed outside city limits and many also face lifelong rejection and discrimination. Due to lack of awareness in Indian society, there remains a widespread fear that the disease is highly contagious. Sister Jean said that she only visits home occasionally now, to see her fellow nuns or her brother back in Newcastle. They will have to wait a little longer before they next see her, and the Sumanahalli wore a festive look yesterday at the news. ‘The patients came and greeted me and one of the patients gave me a ring and a little cross...They welcomed me with garlands and bunches of flowers” said Sister Jean. Her co-worker Mastan saab said: ‘We hope she remains here us for the rest of our lives. Without her, we are in the dark. Nobody would look after leprosy patients like her here if she’d left Bangalore.’ Setup in 1978, Sumanahalli Society is on a 63-acre plot near the Beggar’s Colony in Bangalore. The organization has residential accommodation for about 120 poor leprosy patients and the mobile clinic looks after about 1,000 leprosy patients in the village in the heart of the city with funds from donors, trusts and philanthropic organizations and individuals.","63-year-old says her heart is in Bangalore .

Costing £4million, the 7,000 panels have been installed at the Promens plastics plant near Beccles, Suffolk. With a capacity of 1.65MW, the panels produce enough energy to power 480 homes. Harvester: The UK's biggest rooftop solar plant - the size of 2.5 football pitches - at the Promens plastics plant near Beccles, Suffolk . The UK's largest solar roof installation went live in time to . beat a Government deadline next week to withdraw Feed-in Tariff funding for larger sized schemes. Adrian Banks, engineering manager at Promens, said: 'This is really another step along the path of commitment to reduce our impact on the environment and this is the most significant step Promens Beccles has done in the last 12 months.' Almost all of the power produced from the sun's energy falling on the plant roof will be used on-site, with any surplus feeding into the national grid. The scheme was paid for by hundreds of small investors from across the UK who contributed sums starting at £3,000. They were brought together by fund manager Octopus to cash in on a Government subsidised scheme, that has now had its rules changed to allow individual households to benefit. The installation was developed by Lightsource, a renewable energy installer and operator, and built by Grupotec, a Spanish engineering and architectural consultancy which specialises in green power generation. Blue-sky thinking: The UK's biggest roof-top solar plant in Beccles, Suffolk . Nicholas Boyle, chief executive of . Lightsource, said: 'This roof-top solar plant highlights the important . role solar generation has to play in our future energy mix, particularly . when the energy it produces is used at source, removing the need for . wasteful distribution networks.' 'Getting . this site online before the August deadline was a considerable . achievement and it is a real credit to Grupotec, for their speed and . coordination during design and construction, and to Promens as a company . for their commitment to the project and a willingness to do what was . needed to get it completed.' Paul Latham, managing director of . Octopus said: 'The Promens installation isn’t just a great achievement . in its own right, but also a validation that Octopus can deliver to its . investors what we said we would. Given the tight deadline set by the . Government, we were one of very few investment houses able to provide . funding for solar projects such as this one. 'However, none of it could have been . done without the support from our investors, who recognised that solar . offers a unique opportunity to benefit from Government-approved . incentives by investing as little as £3,000.' It . is the largest initiative of its kind to date and changes to Government . subsidies are expected to limit future developments on this scale. Ministers . were becoming concerned that solar farm developers would drain the . limited funds that are primarily intended for domestic rooftop . installations. The Government has dramatically reduced the subsidies available for any solar . scheme over 50KW coming online after August 1, so it is likely that this . will be the UK’s largest roof-top installation ever.","The size of 2.5 football pitches .

A record £161m worth of assets, including watches, diamonds, sports cars and other luxury goods was seized by criminals in Britain last year, it has been revealed. The Home Office revealed the record recovery of stolen goods after announcing plans for a new strategy to tackle organised crime, which is said to cost the UK up to £40bn a year. Diamond earrings, designer clothing and fine china were also among the items recovered in Britain last year in the biggest recovery since the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Prized possessions: A luxury red Ferrari sports car is displayed as one of the items seized from organised crime gangs last year . All that glitters is not gold: These eye-catching gold Gucci shoes were also recovered as ill-gotten gains by officials . Proceeds of crime: A white Audi sports car is given a 'seized' number plate after being taken in as assets . Officials say there are an estimated 38,000 organised criminals active in Britain today, working in 6,000 groups involved in the drugs trade, human trafficking, child exploitation and cybercrime. Many are also involved in more conventional areas of crime such as organised vehicle theft and armed robbery. As part of the figures for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in 2010/11, the Home Office said law enforcement agencies recovered, froze or returned over £1bn worth of criminal assets. Luxury goods: An expensive Rolex watch is displayed as another items taken in from an organised crime gang . A further £49m was returned to victims, while around £831m in assets were denied to criminals in the same period. Home Office Minister James Brokenshire said: 'Organised crime has a local impact, but a global reach. 'The reality is, it seems as if it's very distant, but actually it's very real.' The . organised crime strategy, to be published today, promises to make a . difference by 'ensuring a co-ordinated national approach across . government, law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies'. Mr Brokenshire said the impact of . criminal activity can be seen on the streets through drug dealing and . affects people by online fraud. He told the BBC: 'Part of the . challenge I think, is to ensure that we follow the cash, follow the . proceeds of those who are involved in organised crime in whatever form . it may take, and ensuring those who are involved don't gain from the . benefit of being involved in criminality. 'There . are issues of money laundering, and then whether it be buying property, . buying fancy cars and actually denying those criminals those assets and . ensuring that they realise the police and other agencies will really . follow through on this. 'Global reach': Home Office minister James Brokenshire said organised crime has both national and international consequences . 'There are freezing orders that can be obtained. Actually ensuring that the criminals, whilst we may not be able to realise the cash from the immediately, part of what we're doing is how we can speed up that process from having identified that assets are linked to say an organised crime group to ensure that they don't have the benefit of it.' He said the Organised Crime Strategy was looking into assets kept abroad and police are looking into 'sophisticated elements' like the front companies, and working with the tax authorities and insolvency authorities.",Organised crime costing UK up to £40bn a year .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:47 AM on 25th July 2011 . With the space shuttle now history, Nasa's next great mission is so audacious, the agency's best minds are wrestling with how to pull it off. They have presidential orders to to send astronauts to an asteroid in less than 15 years. The challenges are innumerable, but many Nasa brains are thrilled to have such an improbable assignment - and believe civilisation may even depend on it. The asteroid Vesta, as photographed by the orbiting Dawn spacecraft on July 17. Nasa now aims to place astronauts on an asteroid within 15 years . An asteroid is a giant space rock that orbits the sun, like Earth. And someday one might threaten the planet. But sending people to one won't be easy. You can't land on an asteroid because you'd bounce off - it has virtually no gravity.  Astronauts couldn't even walk on it because they'd float away. Reaching it might require a Nasa spacecraft to harpoon it. Nasa is thinking about jetpacks, tethers, bungees, nets and spiderwebs to allow explorers to float just above the surface of it while attached to a smaller mini-spaceship. Such a ship - something like a Star Trek shuttle craft melded with a deep sea explorer with pincer-like arms - is needed just to get within working distance of the rock. That craft would have to be big enough for astronauts to live in for a week or two. They'd still need a larger habitat for the long term. Nasa has also announced details of plans to determine if Mars has or ever had the ingredients for life. A robotic science laboratory, being prepared for a November 25 launch, will land in August 2012 near a mountain in a crater on the planet most like Earth in the solar system. Touchdown point: Nasa's rover will land at Mars' Gale crater in August 2012 . The announcement came after the final curtain fell on Nasa's 30-year-old space shuttle programme with Thursday's landing of Atlantis at the Kennedy Space Center. A detailed blueprint of Nasa's follow-on space exploration strategy is still pending and many Americans fear the demise of the shuttle program means the U.S. is relinquishing its leadership in space. But President Barack Obama has said the objective is to build new spaceships that can travel beyond the shuttle's near-Earth orbit and eventually send astronauts to asteroids, Mars and other destinations in deep space. At a Cape Canaveral briefing on Wednesday, Nasa officials will discuss preparations for the agency's upcoming Juno mission to Jupiter. The unmanned spacecraft, set for launch in August, is expected to reach Jupiter's orbit in July 2016 and should further understanding of the solar system's beginnings by revealing the origin and evolution of its largest planet. Among the most sophisticated probes in the offing, the plutonium-powered roving Mars Science Lab, nicknamed Curiosity, is being prepared for launch in November. Twice as long and five times heavier than previous Mars rovers, Curiosity packs ten science instruments, including two for on-site chemical analysis of pulverized rock. With it, scientists hope to learn if Mars has or ever had the organics necessary for life - at least life as it appears on Earth. Scientists spent five years mulling 60 possible landing sites before narrowing the list to four: Eberwalde Crater, Mawrth Vallis, Holden Crater and - the winner - Gale Crater, which sports a stunning three mile-high mountain of rocks rising from the crater floor. That's about twice the height of the stack of rocks exposed in the Grand Canyon. Analysis from Mars-orbiting spacecraft shows the base of Gale Crater's mountain includes both clays and sulphate salts, the only site among the four finalists with both types of materials available. Scientists do not know how the mountain formed, but it may be the eroded remnant of sediment that once completely filled the crater. Though Curiosity's mission is scheduled to last two years, scientists hope the rover will live past its warranty. One of a pair of Mars rovers that arrived for concurrent three-month surveys in January 2004 is still working. Its twin succumbed to the harsh Martian environment only last year. They returned evidence that Mars was once far wetter and warmer than the dry, cold desert that exists today. It would take half a year to reach an asteroid, based on current possible targets. The deep space propulsion system to fly such a distance isn't perfected yet. Football field-sized solar panels would help, meaning the entire mothership complex would be fairly large. It would have to protect the space travellers from killer solar and cosmic ray bursts. And, they would need a crew capsule, maybe two, for travelling between the asteroid complex and Earth. And all those parts - mini-spaceship, habitat/living area, crew capsule, solar arrays and propulsion system - would have to be linked together in the middle of space, assembled in a way like the International Space Station but on a smaller scale. Beyond all those obstacles, Nasa doesn't even know which asteroid would be the best place to visit. All this has to be ready to launch by 2025 by presidential order. Kent Joosten, chief architect of the human exploration team at Johnson Space Center, said: 'This is the big step This is out into the universe, away from Earth's gravity completely... This is really where you are doing the Star Trek kind of thing.' It has the dreamers of Nasa both excited and anxious. Bobby Braun, Nasa chief technology officer, said: 'This is a risky mission. It's a challenging mission. It's the kind of mission that engineers will eat up.' This is a matter of sending 'humans farther than ever before', said Nasa Deputy Administrator Lori Garver. It is all a stepping stone to the dream of flying astronauts to Mars in the mid-2030s. 'I think it is THE mission Nasa should embrace,' said University of Tennessee aerospace professor John Muratore. 'To be successful at this mission, you've got to embrace all of the technologies that you need for Mars.' Critics, including former Apollo astronauts and flight directors, have blasted President Barack Obama for cancelling George W Bush's plan to return astronauts to the moon. They dismiss talk of asteroid visits. But that's because Nasa has not done a good job of outlining the fascinating details and explaining why it is important, said astronomer and former astronaut John Grunsfeld. 'Nasa doesn't have a story right now,' said Mr Grunsfeld, deputy director at the Space Telescope Science Institute. 'Exploration is nothing if not the articulation of a great story.' The story begins with why Nasa would want to go to an asteroid. The agency has sent small spacecraft off to study asteroids over the years and even landed on one in 2001. Just last week, a space probe began orbiting a huge asteroid called Vesta, which lies beyond Mars. Scientifically, an asteroid is a remnant from the birth of the solar system, offering clues about how our planetary system began. Logistically, Nasa wants to go to Mars, but that is distant and more difficult. So the argument is that going to an asteroid is a better testing ground than returning to the moon. The reason Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden and others give is that this mission could save civilisation. Every 100million years or so an asteroid six-miles wide - the type that killed off the dinosaurs - smacks Earth, said Nasa Near Earth Object program manager Donald Yeomans. If Nasa can get astronauts to an asteroid, they can figure out a way of changing a potential killer's orbit. They'll experiment with the safe one they land on, Mr Braun said. Getting to an asteroid will be tough - huge powerful rockets are needed to launch spacecraft and parts out of Earth orbit. Nasa promises to announce its design idea for these rockets by the end of the summer and Congress has ordered that they be built by 2016. It will take two or three or maybe even more launches of these unnamed rockets to get all the needed parts into space. An anaglyph image of the south polar region of Vesta put together from two clear filter images taken on July 9 by the framing camera instrument aboard Dawn. Nasa officials have yet to decide which asteroid to land on . The crew capsule is the farthest along - with $5billion already spent - because Nasa is using the Orion crew ship it was already designing for the now dead moon mission and repurposing it for deep space. Once in space, the ship needs a propulsion system to get it to the asteroid. One way is to use traditional chemical propulsion, but that would require carrying lots of hard-to-store fuel and creation of a new storage system, Mr Joosten said. Another way is to use ion propulsion, which is efficient and requires less fuel, but it is enormously slow to rev up and gain speed. It would also require an electrical ignition source, thus the giant solar power wings. If Nasa goes to ion propulsion, the best bet would be to start the bulk of the ship on a trip to and around the moon without astronauts. That would take a while, but if no one is on it, it doesn't matter, Mr Joosten said. Distant journey: An artist's impression of the ion-drive propelled space probe Dawn arriving in the asteroid belt . Then when that ship is far from Earth, astronauts aboard Orion would dock and join the rest of the trip. By this time, the ship would have picked up sufficient speed and keep on accelerating. Orion isn't big enough for four astronauts to live on for a year. They would need a larger space habitat, a place where they can exercise to keep from losing bone strength in zero gravity. They would need a place to store food, sleep and most importantly a storm shelter to protect them from potentially deadly and radiation-loaded solar flares. Much of the habitat could be inflatable, launched in a lightweight form, and inflated in space. On Friday, Nasa announced a competition among four universities to design potential exploration habitats. Meanwhile Nasa is pursuing its concept for a mini-spaceship exploration vehicle, about the size of a minivan. And it's planning an underwater lab for training, an effort to mimic an asteroid mission's challenges. End of an era: Atlantis and her crew were welcomed back as heroes on Thursday after landing at Kennedy Space Center and bringing Nasa's shuttle programme to a close .","It will take a spacecraft six months to reach an asteroid .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:42 PM on 27th July 2011 . A narcoleptic student who abandoned her degree when she couldn't stay awake during lectures is demanding £34,000 compensation. Shelley Maxwell, 49, has taken her disability discrimination case against Salford University to the Court of Appeal - and attended the hearing with a duvet and pillows in case she needed a nap. Mrs Maxwell says the university did not do enough to help her while she studied for a degree in military and international history. Narcoleptic: Shelley Maxwell, pictured arriving at court with a pillow yesterday, claims that Salford University discriminated against her . She suffers from a disorder which means she needs up to 16 hours of sleep every day and is prone to nodding off in the afternoons. Her problem - described as 'narcoleptic in nature' - meant she could not complete her degree and left the university at the end of her first year in 2005. While her classmates were taking notes during lectures, the mature student was often fast asleep, oblivious to her lecturers' teaching. She complained that the university's provision of written notes for the lectures she slept through was insufficient support to enable her to take her end-of-year exams. The university offered to let her . restart her course, with her tuition free of charge, but Mrs Maxwell was . unhappy and complained to the students' watchdog, the Office of the . Independent Adjudicator. Salford University: Mrs Maxwell claims that the provision of lecture notes was inadequate to enable her to take her exams . After an investigation, the OIA recommended that the university pay for Ms Maxwell to restart her first year, give her £2,500 compensation for inconvenience and distress, and to review its procedures in relation to helping disabled students. But the decision did not go far enough, Mrs Maxwell claimed, because it did not express a view that she was a victim of disability discrimination and left her far short of the £34,000 payout she hoped to receive. At the High Court last year, Mr Justice Foskett rejected a judicial review challenge to the decision, in which Mrs Maxwell's lawyers argued that the OIA should have recommended compensation at a much higher level. Today - clutching a pillow - she took her case to the Court of Appeal, where her lawyers began a challenge to the OIA's refusal to make a discrimination finding. In a case which he says could have wide-ranging effects for other disabled students, Gregory Jones QC said a refusal to express a view on the central issue meant it is possible that universities could get away with discrimination. 'In refusing to express a view about disability discrimination that may have been suffered by a complainant, where its procedure may be the only forum the complaint is likely to be aired in, the OIA may inadvertently be enabling discriminatory behaviour to continue without being exposed as such,' he said. He added that, if the OIA came to its decision to recommend compensation and a review of procedures based on discrimination, then it should have made that clear. OIA barrister Sam Grodzinski QC said it had considered the substance of Mrs Maxwell's complaint about how her disability was addressed by the university. It had taken into account the Disability Discrimination Act and made findings about a failure to provide sufficient assistance, then made recommendations on how to deal with it, he said. It was not obliged to do more. Speaking outside court, Mrs Maxwell said that, despite getting promising marks for the two essays she wrote during her first term, she felt unable to take the end-of-year exams. She said she needs at least 12, and up to 16, hours of sleep every day, but knows when she is going to fall asleep and does not do so unexpectedly. The judges reserved their decision on the appeal until a later date.","Shelley Maxwell turned down Salford University’s offer of restarting her course free of charge .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:17 PM on 28th July 2011 . A gunman who injured three tourists when he fired live ammunition instead of blanks during a mock Wild West shoot-out show was a convicted criminal, it has emerged. Paul Doering, 49, is now facing a federal weapons charge because he should not have been carrying a gun. The tourists were hit during the June 17 re-enactment staged by the Dakota Wild Bunch, who usually use blanks when performing several times a week on a street in Hill City, a tourist town in South Dakota's Black Hills. The show has now been suspended. End of the road: The Hill City shootout was performed by the Dakota Wild Bunch Re-enactors, who have called time on the gun fights in light of the incident . The bullets shattered a leg bone of Carrol Knutson, 65, of Birchwood, Minnesota; hit the forearm and elbow of John Ellis, 48, an optometrist from South Connellsville, Pennsylvania; and caused minor injuries to Jose Pruneda, 53, of Alliance, Nebraska. Doering, of Summerset, is now facing a federal weapons charge because of his previous criminal record. He today appeared in a federal court in Fargo, North Dakota, but did not enter a plea. He will re-appear in a federal court in Rapid City on August 11 for arraignment. Chief deputy state attorney Lara Roetzel said her office would not be filing state charges against Doering. Horror: Blood from one of the victims pools in the street where the shootout happened . Investigators will not say why the incident happened, but Hill City Administrator Brett McMacken said it appeared to have been accidental. The mock shootouts between lawmen and outlaws, sponsored by the Hill City Chamber of Commerce, have been held in the town in front of crowds of around 160 people for at least 20 years. The Dakota Wild Bunch has been doing the show, which has since been suspended, for four years. Investigators earlier this month found Doering had served more than five years in Minnesota prisons on multiple felony convictions. Scene: The event took place on the corner of Main St and Elm St, in Hill City, South Dakota . But South Dakota law prohibits convicted criminals from possessing or having control of a firearm for 15 years. He served 14 months for two first-degree assault convictions in the early 1980s, according to John Schadl of the Minnesota Department of Corrections. He returned to prison in 1990 after he was convicted of second-degree burglary. While serving a 14-month sentence, he was charged with escape and ordered to serve additional time. Aftermath: Pennington County deputies question a member of the shootout . Doering then went back to prison in 2000 and late 2001 after he was convicted of fleeing from law enforcement. His lengthy criminal history includes numerous arrests for traffic violations and at least one conviction for driving with more than the legal limit of alcohol in his system. Court records also show that Doering pleaded guilty to violating a protection order in 2004. He was placed on probation and was only released from probation in April 2010. He still owes the Hennepin County Clerk of Courts $158 for the cost of his prosecution. Victim: Carrol Knutson, 65, from Birchwood, Minnesota was one of three people shot in a Wild West-style shootout in South Dakota . Mr McMacken said he did not know whether background checks were carried out on the re-enactors. George Heywood Jr, of Hill City, was once a part of the shootout re-enactments, and said many residents were not fans. He said: 'Certain people in Hill City have never cared for it. At one time, it was really neat.' Heywood said local support for the shootout has declined as new people joined the business district, and there was much more control over the shootout when local businessmen were actively involved in the performances. He added: 'I think they had a lot more into it, so safety meant more than when you have someone hired or brought in that no one really knows.' When asked about Doering's criminal record, he said: 'I think that’s a big mistake by somebody. Whoever’s in charge of that group, that’s definitely a big mistake.'","Show suspended after Paul Doering, 49, used live ammunition instead of blanks in staged gun battle ."

An AWOL Muslim soldier who 'plotted to an attack' on Fort Hood shouted the name of a military psychiatrist accused of a 2009 shooting rampage at the base in his first court appearance today. Pvt. Nasser Jason Abdo, was arrested yesterday near the base after police were alerted by a local gun shop owner that Abdo had been acting 'suspicious'. The 21-year-old was formally charged with illegal possession of a firearm two days after his arrest in a Killeen, Texas, motel room in possession of suspected bomb-making materials. Scroll down for video . Arrested; According to reports, Nasser Abdo has been arrested and found with explosives near Fort Hood . 'Abeer Qassim al-Janabi Iraq 2006; Nidal Hasan, Fort Hood, 2009,' Abdo shouted at the media as he was led out of the Waco courtroom. Nidal Hasan is a military psychiatrist charged with killing 13 people and wounding 32 at a medical facility on Fort Hood in 2009. Booked: U.S. Army soldier Naser Jason Abdo, 21, was arrested today after a tip from a local gun store owner . Hasan, who is in a wheelchair after being shot by police during the attack, faces court martial next year. Abdo's outburst was the first public indication of his possible intentions when he was arrested. The news follows reports Al-Qaeda magazine 'Inspire' was also found by investigators in Abdo's hotel room. Abc reported police found the article titled 'How to Build a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom' in the issue. The network also reported that Abdo had mentioned the name of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula during interrogations. The FBI that his plan was to attack Fort Hood and blow up a local restaurant, according to an FBI affidavit filed with the charges on Friday. It previously emerged Abdo was already being investigated for child pornography before he went AWOL on July 4. After being detained, police say they recovered possible bomb making materials from his hotel room. According . to abc news, police reports said Abdo told them he was targeting the . base to 'get even,' possibly after his discharge from the army was . delayed until after the child porn trial. Alert: Greg Ebert of Guns Galore, warned police about Abdo . He was arrested Wednesday afternoon after a call from Greg Ebert, an employee at a Killeen gun shop, who told Reuters he was concerned when Abdo bought ammunition and smokeless powder. It was the same gun shop where Hasan bought his weapons two years ago. An affidavit by FBI agent James Runkel said Abdo told police he intended to conduct an attack against Killeen and Fort Hood. He also indicated in response to questions that there were explosives in his backpack and in his hotel room, Runkel said. Scroll down for video .

As the first funerals were held for the 77 killed  by Anders Breivik - Norwegian police today revised the death toll UP by one victim - Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg told a memorial service in Oslo: 'Today it is one week since Norway was hit by evil. 'The bullets hit our young, but they also struck an entire nation. We have to live with July 22, but together we will make it.' Black day: The casket of Bano Rashid is carried to Nesodden church during her funeral ceremony near Oslo . Grim procession: Friends and family at the funeral in Nesodden of Bano Rashid, the first of Breivik's victims to be buried . First in a long line: Bano Rashid was said to have devoted her life to fighting racism . Speaking from a stage adorned with red roses, the symbol of the governing Labour Party, he called the massacre an 'attack on democracy'. Flags around the nation flew at half mast to mark the day a week ago when Breivik set off a bomb in central Oslo that killed eight people followed by the shooting of 69 people, mostly Labour Party youth members, at a summer camp on the island of Utoya. Today police revised upwards the death toll from last Friday's terrorist attacks to 77 after an unidentified victim died at a hospital of wounds suffered during the shooting rampage on Utoya island. The first to be buried today was 18-year-old Bano Rashid, a Muslim girl originally from Kurdistan, who was the leader of the Labour . Party's youth wing in Nesodden, near Oslo. Bano, whose younger sister survived the massacre, was said to have dedicated her life to . fighting for democracy and against racism. Norway's Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere attended her funeral in . Nesodden. 'We have to stand united and carry . their dreams forward,' Nesodden mayor Christian Holm said of Bano and . another Nesodden youth, Diderik Aamodt Olsen, who also died in the . attacks. Bano's mother said: 'The answer must not be hatred, but even more love.' Another victim, 19-year-old Ismail Haji Ahmed, was being buried at Hamar, in the south-west of Norway. Killer Breivik meanwhile was today facing his second interrogation since his bombing and shooting spree.This morning he was escorted by armed guards from his jail to police headquarters in Oslo. Tears flow: Sad friends of Utoya Island victim Bano Rashid pay their respects at her funeral . Sorrow: Friends struggle to comprehend the loss of the talented 18-year-old . The day after the atrocities in the . Norwegian capital and on the island of Utoya last Friday, Breivik was . questioned for seven hours, and another long interrogation is expected. In . a speech at the People's House, Labour Party youth-wing leader Eskil . Pedersen said the gunman attacked Norway's core values, such as . democracy, tolerance and fighting racism. 'Long before he stands before a court . we can say: he has lost,' Pedersen said. He vowed that the youth . organisation would return to Utoya island - where the shootings occurred . - next year for its annual summer gathering, a tradition that stretches . back decades. Another memorial service was being held at a mosque in an immigrant district of Oslo. Much missed: Mourners sit facing a casket with a picture of Bano Rashid during her funeral . United in grief: Friends of Bano Rashid at the small church in Nesodden, near Oslo, where she was buried today . Norway's . police said today that all those killed in the terror attacks have . been identified and that those who had been reported missing have been . accounted for. The Prime Minister has urged his . increasingly diverse Nordic nation to show unity at the services in the . face of the deadliest assault on his country during peacetime. Norwegian . news agency NTB said that Breivik was picked up at a . jail today and transported to police headquarters in Oslo for a session . of questioning. Investigators . believe the 32-year-old Norwegian acted alone, after years of . meticulous planning, and haven't found anything to support his claims . that he's part of an anti-Muslim militant network plotting a series of . coups d'etat across Europe.

Breivik was questioned for seven hours on Saturday, the day after the twin attacks targeting the government district of Oslo and the youth camp of the Prime Minister's left-leaning Labor Party on the island north-west of the capital. He admitted to carrying out the attacks but has pleaded not guilty to terror charges, saying he is in a state of war, according to his lawyer and police. Police have charged Breivik with terrorism, which carries a maximum sentence of 21 years in prison. However, it is possible the charge . will change during the investigation to crimes against humanity, which . carries a 30-year prison term, Norway's top prosecutor Tor-Aksel Busch . said. Questioning: Anders Behring Breivik, partially visible in the rear of the vehicle, is transported in a police vehicle from prison to police headquarters today . Close-up: Breivik has confessed to the bomb attack and to the massacre on the island youth camp. He was today being taken for further questioning . 'Such charges will be considered when . the entire police investigation has been finalised,' he said. 'It is an . extensive investigation. We will charge Breivik for each individual . killing.' A formal indictment isn't expected until next year, Mr Busch said. Breivik says his murderous rampage was an attempt to save the Western . world from Muslim colonisation. He tried to justify the massacre in a . 1,500-page anti-immigrant manifesto. His lawyer has said he considers himself a 'saviour' and that it is likely he is insane.

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 10:37 PM on 29th July 2011 . If Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein were looking for a follow-up story four decades on, then this could be a very helpful new source. More than 36 years after Richard Nixon told a secret grand jury about the Watergate scandal, his testimony was ordered to be released by a judge because of its significance in American history. Stanley Kutler, who has written several books about Mr Nixon and Watergate, put in a request with others to unseal the testimony given by the former president on June 23 and 24 in 1975. Out there: More than 36 years after Richard Nixon told a secret grand jury about the Watergate scandal, his testimony was ordered to be released by a judge because of its significance in American history . Mr Nixon was questioned about the 1970s political scandal that resulted from the break-in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington D.C. The scandal caused him to leave office in August 1974 and he remains the only U.S. president to resign. It also resulted in the indictment, trial, conviction and jailing of some of his top officials. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth ruled that special circumstances, especially the undisputed historical interest in Mr Nixon's testimony, far outweighed the need to keep the records secret. ‘Watergate significance in American history cannot be overstated,’ Judge Lamberth wrote. Scene: Mr Nixon was questioned about the 1970s political scandal that resulted from the break-in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington D.C., pictured . ‘The disclosure of (his) grand jury . testimony would likely enhance the existing historical record, foster . scholarly discussion and improve the public's understanding of a . significant historical event.’ Judge Lamberth added that the scandal continues to attract both scholarly and public interest – and it is right to reveal the testimony despite the fact that grand jury proceedings typically remain secret. President Barack Obama’s Justice Department had opposed releasing the testimony, citing privacy interests of individuals named in the testimony - but Judge Lamberth said these were minimal. He said Nixon died 17 years ago, many other key figures likely to be mentioned were deceased and most of the surviving figures have spoken publically or testified under oath about their involvement. Allison Zieve, director of the Public . Citizen Litigation Group and the lead attorney for those seeking the . testimony, said this will be a significant step toward completing . Watergate's historical record. ‘President Nixon's knowledge of the . events and role in the cover-up remains a subject of speculation for . historians, journalists and others,’ she said. Journalists: Reporters Bob Woodward, right, and Carl Bernstein, left, pictured in the newsroom of the Washington Post in May 1973, won a Pulitzer Prize for their reporting of the Watergate case . Mr Nixon answered questions about the . 18-and-a-half minute gap in a White House recording of his conversation . with a top aide after the break-in, according to news reports at the . time. 'The disclosure of President Nixon's grand jury testimony would likely . enhance the existing historical record, foster scholarly discussion and . improve the public's understanding of a significant historical event' U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth . He also reportedly talked about altering White House tape transcripts turned over to the House Judiciary Committee during its impeachment inquiry. Other subjects included using the Internal Revenue Service to harass political enemies, and a $100,000 contribution from billionaire Howard Hughes. Mr Nixon's grand jury transcript will not be released immediately because the government will have the opportunity to appeal. Government lawyers are now reviewing the ruling.","Judge orders release 36 years after Richard Nixon's grand jury testimony .

"By . Anna Edwards . Last updated at 3:35 PM on 29th July 2011 . A former English Defence League activist has admitted he may have inspired Norway gunman Anders Behring Breivik. Paul Ray said his anti-Muslim blog entitled Richard The Lionhearted could have helped inform Breivik's exhaustive 1,500 page manifesto in which he justifies the atrocities. But he condemned the murder of 76 people in twin attacks in Oslo and Utoya on Friday as an act of 'pure evil.' Rant: British extremist Paul Ray quotes from a Bible as he discusses why Prince William should fight the 'invasion' of Muslims from his self-imposed 'exile' in Malta . Mr Ray, 35, told The Times: 'I am being implicated as his (Breivik's) mentor. I definitely could have been his inspiration. It looks like that. But what he did was pure evil. 'I could never use what he has done to further my own beliefs. What he has done does not equate to anything I am involved in.' It has been widely reported that . Breivik made postings on British nationalist websites and in the . manifesto released before the attacks he refers to a 'mentor'. Parallels . have since been drawn with blogger Mr Ray, who leads an anti-Islam . Knights Templar movement, but he vociferously denies having anything to . do with the attacks. The former EDL member, who calls himself 'Lionheart', left the UK to live in Malta in 2008 after being arrested over internet postings allegedly inciting racial hatred. Mr Ray's extremist views call for . Prince William to answer his 'destiny' and 'defend' his country against . the 'modern invasion' of Muslims. He took to his blog to further . himself from Brievik, insisting: 'I might be a Christian fundamentalist . who has a deep dislike for Islamic fundamentalism who looks to . Templarism as an example. Former EDL member Paul Ray insists that he has 'nothing to hide' and has branded Breivik's actions as 'pure evil' Denial: Mr Ray says gunman Anders Behring Breivik, pictured, may have been inspired by him, but he does not condone the mass murders . 'But anyone who knows me knows that I personally would play no part in such inhumane . savagery that has no place in the civilised world. 'My mind cannot comprehend the mass murder inflicted upon the people of Norway, even though I am forced to confront the reality of it due to the fact that I have been implicated in the story surrounding it. 'Why this man could have based key bits of his manifesto on myself and others I am connected with is something I am sure the police are now trying to work out as they wonder whether we are involved with any of these ‘figment of his imagination’ cells based upon our belief in true Templarism and our political beliefs.' In an earlier interview with website . VBS before the Royal Wedding, he ranted that he lived in 'exile' for his . beliefs and how Holy War was inevitable between Christians and Muslims, . which chimes with Breivik's Islamaphobic rants. He . said: 'There's an influx, an invasion of Muslims from the Middle East . and from all around the world, coming into our countries. The former EDL member then bizarrely . said that Prince William was the 1,000th knight of the garter and should . take after King Arthur. 'Now more than ever we need to have a . King Arthur. And I believe Prince William has to embrace the calling . and divine destiny that's been given to him to assume that role.' In the interview, he said Princes' William and Harry were 'prepared' for war against Muslims. 'They have a grasp of the enemy we're now facing.' Bizarre: Paul Ray, right, walks with German right winger Nick Greger in Malta, while he discusses 'Holy War' and how there has been an 'invasion' of Muslims . Before launching his attacks, which . killed a total of 76 people, Breivik wrote of his allegiance to the . Knights Templar - which he described as a secret society created to . carry out a crusade against Islam in Europe. In . his manifesto, Breivik claimed the group was created at a meeting in . London in 2002 and he was mentored by a man called 'Richard (the . Lionhearted)'. The medieval Knights Templar was a . Christian military order founded in the early 12th century whose . members, wearing white mantles with a red cross, became one of the most . formidable fighting forces of the Crusades. The Crusades were a series of religiously sanctioned military campaigns, called by the pope and waged by kings and nobles. They volunteered to take up the cross with the main goal of recapturing Jerusalem and the Holy Land from Muslim rule and restoring Christian control. It was dissolved in 1312. But in a separate interview with the Associated Press Mr Ray flatly denied having anything to do with the gunman and said: 'I just want the truth to come out and it proven that I'm nothing whatever to do with this.' Mr Ray's comments came after Norway's domestic intelligence chief said there was no evidence of links between Breivik, 32, and the English far-right. Janne Kristiansen, director of the Norwegian Police Security Service, said yesterday: 'I can tell you, at this moment in time, we don't have evidence or we don't have indications that he has been part of a broader movement or that he has been in connection with other cells or that there are other cells.' The intelligence chief told the BBC she did not believe the killer was insane, but calculating and evil, and someone who sought the limelight. European Union counter-terrorism officials attended an emergency meeting in Brussels yesterday and warned that radicals who share Breivik's ideology could be tempted to follow his lead. 'Clearly, one major risk is that somebody may actually try to mount a similar attack as a copycat attack or as a way of showing support,' said Tim Jones, a counter-terrorism adviser. EU interior ministers are to meet to discuss responses to the Norway massacre in September. Meanwhile, Norwegian police are due to question Breivik for the second time today in relation to information that has emerged over the past few days, according to reports. Breivik has admitted setting off a car bomb in the government district of Oslo, killing at least eight people, and carrying out a shooting spree at the ruling Labour Party's annual youth camp on nearby Utoya island, where 68 people died. However, he denies criminal responsibility and has pleaded not guilty to the charges he faces. Norwegian officials last night released the names of another 24 victims and more are expected over the coming days.","Former EDL member says his anti-Muslim blog could have helped shape Breivik's Islamaphobic rants .

The mother of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne is 'devastated' to learn that the News of the World may have hacked her mobile phone given to her by the editor Rebekah Brooks. Sara Payne, who worked closely with the newspaper on its 'Sarah's Law' child protection campaign, has been told by detectives there is evidence she was targeted. The phone was given to Mrs Payne by Mrs Brooks so that she could stay in touch with her supporters. Today the Phoenix Chief Advocates group, which speaks out for the victims of paedophiles, said Sara was 'absolutely devastated' to hear she may have been targeted. The campaigner was alerted by officers from Operation Weeting - as the Metropolitan Police's phone hacking inquiry is known. The group, which is jointly run by Ms Payne, said in a statement: 'Whilst it was previously confirmed by . Operation Weeting that Sara Payne's name was not on private investigator . Glenn Mulcaire's list, it has now been confirmed by the Operation . Weeting that Sara's details are on his list. 'Sara is absolutely devastated by this news, we're all deeply disappointed and are just working to get her through it.' Ms Payne became a tireless . campaigner on child abuse issues after her eight-year-old daughter was . murdered by paedophile Roy Whiting in 2000. The mobile's number had been passed to private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, who hacked into hundreds of phones on behalf of the paper. Mrs Payne’s eight-year-old daughter was abducted and killed by Whiting in July 2000. The NotW campaigned for 'Sarah’s Law’, the scheme which allows parents to check whether people with access to their children are child sex offenders. The revelation that the paper may have hacked into a phone which was a gift to Mrs Payne marks a new low in the scandal. In the past month it has emerged that the News of the World illegally accessed the voicemails of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, 7/7 victims’ relatives, and grieving military families. Close ties: Rebekah Brooks (left) with Sara Payne in 2002. The pair had worked closely together on the Sarah's Law Campaign championed by the News of the World . Mrs Brooks said the latest allegations were ‘abhorrent’ and ‘particularly upsetting’ because Mrs Payne was a ‘dear friend’. She said: ‘For the benefit of the campaign for Sarah’s Law, the News of the World have provided Sara with a mobile telephone for the last 11 years. It was not a personal gift. ‘The idea that anyone on the newspaper knew that Sara or the campaign team were targeted by Mr Mulcaire is unthinkable. The idea of her being targeted is beyond my comprehension.’ It is believed police have found evidence in files kept by Mulcaire which suggested he targeted Mrs Payne. Her mobile phone number and possibly a PIN were discovered in documents listing hundreds of potential hacking targets. Devastated: Friends of Sara Payne said they were working to get her through the latest ordeal and that they were 'deeply disappointed' by the news . However, last night it was unclear whether there is any clear proof her phone was actually hacked. As part of their inquiries, detectives will want to establish who might have commissioned any hacking. It was also reported that Mrs Payne’s phone may not have had voicemail until 18 months ago. Mrs Payne wrote a column for the final issue of the News of the World on July 10 when it was closed amid growing political and commercial pressure over the phone hacking scandal. Roy Whiting was jailed for the abduction and murder of Sarah Payne in July 2000 . She wrote: ‘We did not meet under the best of circumstances. In fact, it was the worst, most horrendous time in my life. But from that moment on the News of the World and more importantly the people there became my very good and trusted friends. And like all good friends they have stuck with me through the good and the bad.’ Mrs Brooks has denied knowledge of phone hacking while she was editor of the NotW between 2000 and 2003. On July 15 she resigned as chief executive of News International and two days later was arrested and interviewed by police. Earlier this month, after it emerged that Milly Dowler’s phone was hacked by the NotW, there was speculation that Mrs Payne might also have been a victim. According to reports, detectives checked the names of Mrs Payne and her closest associates against its database of information contained in the notebooks, computer records and audio tapes seized from Mulcaire in August 2006. Nothing was found but in the past few days officers discovered her mobile number in notes kept by Mulcaire. Last night Labour culture spokesman Ivan Lewis said: ‘This shocking news about the hacking of Sara Payne’s phone will ignite anger and revulsion across the country. ‘The newspaper which championed Sara’s campaign for Sarah’s Law invading her privacy in such a cruel way raises further serious questions about what was happening at the News of the World on Rebekah Brooks’s watch.’ BSkyB has given chairman James Murdoch it's full backing after his role at the satellite broadcaster came under pressure in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. The FTSE 100 Index company said Mr Murdoch, pictured, would remain as chairman as it revealed a 23 per cent hike in annual operating profits to £1.1billion - rubbing salt in the wounds of News Corporation, which earlier this month withdrew its bid for total control of the company. The company also announced a partnership with the BBC to broadcast live Formula 1 between 2012 and 2018, in a move which will see Sky Sports show all races while the BBC have just half the races live. Mr Murdoch junior, deputy chief operating officer at News Corp, had faced calls for his resignation as BSkyB chairman from MPs, shareholder groups and industry figures as the phone-hacking scandal unfolded. The revelations led to News Corp pulling its bid for the 61per cent of the broadcaster it does not already own. Today's annual results laid bare the appeal of BSkyB to News Corp as the company revealed a 16per cent surge in annual revenue to £6.6billion and net growth of 71,000 customers between April and June.","NotW gave Sara Payne phone so she could stay in touch with supporters .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:43 PM on 29th July 2011 . The hotel maid who accuses ex-IMF boss Dominique Strauss-Kahn of a sex attack has told how she cries every day. Nafissatou Diallo said her 15-year-old daughter had inspired her to publicly urge people to believe her story. Meanwhile, her lawyer has promised to file a civil lawsuit against her alleged attacker 'soon'. Can't sleep: Nafissatou Diallo speaks publicly about her emotional turmoil over the alleged attack and the media storm that followed . In a highly unusual news conference, Diallo told reporters that she wants no other woman to suffer like her — first at the hands of a powerful attacker and then through media muckraking. 'I am going through a lot. My daughter, we are going through a lot. We are crying everyday. 'We can't sleep,' an emotional and tearful Diallo said in broken English. 'A lot of things they say about me are not true.' The case pits an illiterate, immigrant, 32-year-old mother and hotel maid against a powerful politician. She has said he behaved like a 'crazy man' on May 14 in his suite at the luxury Sofitel hotel near Times Square. Showing the strain: A tearful Diallo has promised her teenage daughter that she will remain strong during her legal case . She alleges he brutally forced her to perform oral sex on him and attempted to rape her. The 62-year-old Strauss-Kahn - the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund who was viewed as a possible French president - denies the charges and contends any sex that afternoon with Diallo was consensual. Diallo, known as 'Nafi' to her friends, said her daughter told her: 'She goes, ""Mom, please promise me you stop crying. People call you bad names because they don't know you."" 'You have to remember this guy is a powerful man,' Diallo said, adding that she told her daughter: 'I am going to be strong for you and for every other woman in the world.' 'What happened to me, I don't want to happen to any other woman,' she said. 'I said God, why me?""' Support: Diallo, the daughter of an imam from Guinea, thanked the leaders in the African community who have supported her since the alleged attack by Strauss-Kahn . The case against Strauss-Kahn has teetered for weeks since prosecutors disclosed they had uncovered discrepancies in Diallo's account of her past, and of the immediate aftermath of the alleged assault. With her credibility in doubt, prosecutors continue to investigate the criminal case as they mull whether to press ahead with charges or to drop the case. Promises action: Diallo's lawyer, Kenneth Thompson says he will fight a civil case to hold Strauss-Kahn accountable . The media event was the latest twist in a case which has generated lurid headlines on both sides of the Atlantic. The New York Post called Diallo a prostitute and she has since sued the Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid for libel. Diallo's supporters on Thursday said District Attorney (DA) Cyrus Vance had mishandled the matter and should be replaced by a special prosecutor. They suggested race and poverty may be a factor in the prosecution's treatment of the case and said Vance's office leaked numerous false stories about Diallo to the media, making her case harder to win. Religious link: Diallo held her press conference at the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn, New York. A spokeswoman for Vance declined to respond, saying the DA's office does not comment on pending criminal cases. Her lawyer Kenneth Thompson denied she was trying to shake the rich Frenchman down for cash, saying: 'Nafi Diallo did not try to shake down Dominique Strauss-Kahn.' Thompson promised action, saying he and her legal team 'will take the civil case to trial because we are going to hold Dominique Strauss-Kahn accountable, whether it be in a criminal courtroom or in a civil lawsuit.' Asked when such a civil suit would be filed, he responded: 'I said soon. Soon is soon.' Political heavyweight: Strauss-Kahn is no longer under house arrest, but is barred from leaving America . Accusers in such cases normally hide from the media glare until after their criminal case is over. Many media outlets protect their identities by not revealing their names. But Diallo, the daughter of an imam from Guinea, broke her silence on Sunday, revealing her identity in interviews to Newsweek and ABC News. At the news conference at a Christian cultural center at the church Thompson attends, Diallo was flanked by members of women's rights groups and advocates for Latinos and blacks. Diallo said the event was to thank supporters. But some experts said her lawyers were pushing Vance not to drop the case because otherwise Diallo's supporters might not vote for him if, as expected, he seeks reelection in 2013. Top defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz has called Diallo's media interviews, 'a desperate gambit to try to put pressure on the prosecution to consider not dropping the case.' Notwithstanding Thursday's show of support, Diallo's case has not brought a groundswell of public support or led to widespread outcries about Vance's handling of the case. 'In my political travels around Manhattan, I don't hear any of the woman activists jumping up and down that much,' said Arthur Greig, a lawyer and former New York County Democratic Committee counsel. 'I haven't seen or heard any groundswell.' On Wednesday, Diallo and her lawyers held an eight-hour meeting with prosecutors focused largely on phone conversations she had with a fellow African immigrant in an Arizonan jail after the May 14 incident. News reports suggested Diallo told him a day after the incident that Strauss-Kahn was rich. But Thompson disputed those accounts after hearing the tapes, saying such interpretations of that conversation were not true and that prosecutors had botched their translations. Strauss-Kahn is no longer under house arrest, but is barred from leaving America and next appears in court on August 23.","Nafissatou Diallo, 32, promises daughter to remain strong through 'sex attack' case .

As the search for missing 11-year-old Celina Cass enters its fifth day, police are now turning their attentions towards her computer as it has been revealed that her stepfather has a troubled past filled with allegations of criminal behaviour and mental illness. Celina vanished without a trace from her bedroom on Monday, where she was last seen playing on her computer around 9pm. The next morning she was gone. Police are desperately searching for her and plan to question everyone in the small town of Stewartstown, New Hampshire, which is just a mile away from the Canadian border. Last night the stepfather of the shy fifth-grader, Wendell Noyes, said the family were 'grieving' - as a friend issued a statement on their behalf with a direct plea to Celina, saying 'we will not stop searching for you until you are back in our arms'. It has emerged that Noyes, 47, was involuntarily committed in 2003 after being diagnosed with schizophrenia and arrested for threatening an ex-girlfriend. According to court records obtained by ABC, the woman said Noyes broke into her home while she and . her two children slept, picked up her mattress and slammed it down. She . also told authorities that he threatened to throw her down the . stairs. At the time, Judge Richard Hampe ruled Noyes was . incompetent to stand trial, writing that the man's mental illness created 'a . potentially serious likelihood of danger to himself and others'. A forensic examiner said Noyes was a paranoid schizophrenic, who most likely developed the condition while he was in the Air Force. Celina's family have said that she would never run away from home or leave with a stranger. Speaking yesterday  from the motel in . Canaan, Vermont, where he and Celina's mother are staying, Noyes told the Boston . Herald: 'Right now, we’re in the process of grieving.' Devastated: New Hampshire State Police officers watch as a woman identified as Celina Cass's mother, under a blanket, is escorted from the family home in Stewartstown, New Hampshire . At a press conference last night, a friend broke down as she read out a statement on behalf of Celina's family. She said: 'Our beautiful Celina is a . happy child who brings much love and joy into the lives of those who . know her. Her safe and speedy return is our sole priority and focus. 'We remain hopeful and vigilant and . trust in the investigative abilities of the authorities involved. We . pray that our little girl is returned home soon. 'We plead for answers and ask if you . saw or know anything at all, however insignificant you may think your . information is, that you come forward now without hesitation and share . it with our investigators. Troubled past: Celina Cass's stepfather, Wendell Noyes, was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2003 . 'And Celina, if you can hear this . now, please know how much we love and we miss you. You are in our . thoughts and in our prayers. We will not stop searching for you until . you are back in our arms.' Her disappearance has shaken the small town, with some fearing that she may have been taken out of the country. State police from New Hampshire and . Vermont, along with FBI child abduction specialists and U.S. border . patrol, scoured the area Thursday, even sending agents as far as New . York and Virginia. Investigators say they have little to go on, with no signs of an abduction or a struggle but no sign she ran away either. Jane Young, New Hampshire's assistant attorney general, said they were going to talk to every person in town. 'Every house, every individual in the neighbourhood is being spoken to,' she said. She added: 'We just continue to look . for her with all available assets. We don’t have any evidence at this . juncture to indicate that this is a criminal investigation.” Investigators are painstakingly going through 225 tips, some of which have come from as far away as North Carolina and Illinois. More than 100 searchers are now . involved in the manhunt for the 11-year-old girl, including the FBI and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The town of just 800 people . is only a mile from Canada. So far, this extraordinary effort has turned up nothing. Call for help: Family friends hold up missing posters for Celina for passing cars to view outside the family home . Hunt: A New Hampshire Fish and Game officer uses as GPS device as he searches for Celina along a road near her home in Stewartstown. An FBI abduction team has now joined the investigation . Kiernan Ramsey of the FBI's New . Hampshire office told ABC: 'We're using advanced techniques from . aviation to canines and the like. We are hopeful some positive outcome . could result.' Frantic search: Celina Cass vanished from her home in the small town of Stewartstown, New Hampshire . He added: . 'Some have made a lot of debate as to whether this is a missing persons . case or an abduction. I will tell you, from the FBI's perspective, . labelling of this case does not matter, when it comes to the resources . that we are bringing to bear.' The front lawn of the home where . Celina lives with her mother, stepfather and 13-year-old sister has . been turned into a shrine, with candles, stuffed animals and notes . to the missing fifth grader. Community members outside the home are flagging down cars and handing out flyers with Celina's image. 'It's a big world and she's a small . girl and she's only 11. She doesn't know how to handle herself,' said . Stewartstown resident Shahannah Fuller. Celina's mother and stepfather have not spoken to the television media, and have requested 'absolute privacy'. On Wednesday an extensive land search was scaled back, and police trawled the Connecticut River using two boats. They lowered the waterway . so helicopters could scour it from the air, while officers desperately . searching an area within a half-mile radius of her home. Friends . and neighbours have been holding candlelit vigils for Celina every . night since she disappeared, as they desperately pray for her safe . return. They gather around a framed photograph of the schoolgirl on a . picnic table, surrounded by candles. Friends say Celina was the last person they'd expect to run away. Fighting back tears and holding a lit . candle at the gathering, family friend Rebecca Goodrum said: . 'She never went anywhere without her mom or sister.' Comforting: Family and friends of Celina wait on the porch of the family home . She said: 'She was beautiful. She was the light of everything.' Another, Kayla Baglio, said: 'She is . very shy. If she doesn't know you, she'd look at her sister to see if it . was OK to talk to you. One of Celina's schoolfriends, . 11-year-old Makayla Riendeau, said she was very athletic and a stickler . about getting her school work done on time. She said: 'She's a very good friend, and she never lets anybody down. Shannon Towles, who owns a mini-mart on Route 3, said her disappearance had shaken the town, which has just 800 residents. She said: 'It's creepy. Things like . this don't happen here. I know that's kind of a tired phrase. I'm an . overprotective mom as it is. Now it's going to be way worse.' Popular: Celia Cass pictured left in her basketball uniform and right, with friends in a photo she posted on Facebook. Her friends have described her as athletic and hardworking, and say she would never run away . Hunt: Residents post flyers on trees in Stewartstown to help find Celina Cass, who disappeared from her home on Monday evening . Mrs Towles said Celina wasn't the type . of girl to hitchhike or run away. She said: 'She's just a little girl . and she's a nice little girl.' Celina attends Stewartstown Community School, where she is one of just 85 pupils. The . district superintendent described her as popular and well-liked, and . said six counsellors were on hand to help students cope with her . disappearance. Mrs Towles said her daughter, Echo, . had asked her whether she thought Celina was still alive. She said: 'How . do I answer that question? And do I want to? I don't want to think . about it, but I pray every second that she is.' Friends . and neighbours have spent the last four days posting flyers showing her . smiling face on every available lamppost and tree trunk. Shaken: Celina is one of just 85 pupils at the town's school. Counsellors are on hand to help students cope with her disappearance . On Thursday police searched the woods . behind an apartment building about a mile north of the town. They . carried bags and boxes, but it was unclear if they collected anything. Later . officers went into Celina's home, then stretched yellow crime scene . tape around it before posting a uniformed officer outside. Then . plain clothes police officers wearing purple rubber gloves surrounded a . red pick-up truck parked across the street from the house, taking . photographs and looking inside. Lieutenant Douglas Gralenski, a state . Fish and Game Department official helping to search the river, said: . 'Honestly, we don't know where else we can look. There's so much that's . unknown.' He said: 'It's not a deep river. You'd be hard-pressed to find six to eight feet in . most of it in that area. When we had it drawn down, it was . exceptionally low.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:38 PM on 18th June 2011 . The autopsy done on little Caylee Anthony's body was 'shoddy,' a renowned forensic expert said in court today. Dr Werner Spitz, who spoke for the defence in Casey Anthony's murder trial, also said the duct tape Florida prosecutors say suffocated the child was not applied until after her body had decomposed. Dr Spitz, who has contributed expert opinion in several high-profile cases including O.J Simpson and record executive Phil Spector, spoke on the third day of the defence's case. Tearful: An emotional Casey Anthony stares into the distance as an expert forensic doctor calls her daughter's original autopsy 'shoddy' He also testified it was a failure that the two-year-old's skull was not opened during the official autopsy. Dr Spitz himself conducted a second autopsy later. 'The head is part of the body and when you do an examination you examine the whole body,' he said. 'That to me is a signal of a shoddy autopsy.' Defence: Forensic expert Dr Werner Spitz holds up a plastic skull as he tells the court how little Caylee's skull should have been opened in the first autopsy . Casey Anthony, 25, has pleaded not guilty to killing her daughter in the summer of 2008. If convicted she faces a possible death sentence. The defence maintains the little girl drowned in her grandparents' swimming pool. Dr Spitz said he had intended to attend Caylee's original autopsy after her remains were found in a wooded area in December 2008. He was denied. He eventually came to Orlando to conduct his own exam and visited the crime scene, reviewed photos and read the official autopsy reports. Revelations: Dr Spitz, seen here against a blurred out picture of Caylee's skull, told the court the duct tape Florida prosecutors say suffocated the child was not applied until after her body had decomposed . There were 'specks' of decomposition sediment inside the left side of Caylee's skull, which Spitz said indicated the girl's death was not necessarily a homicide. Orange and Osceola County medical examiner Jan Garavaglia determined that Caylee was killed 'by undetermined means.' If the tape had suffocated Caylee, evidence of skin would have been on the sticky side of the tape, he said. But there was no such evidence on the tape. 'I had problems with (the manner of death finding),' Dr Spitz said. 'When a body decomposes the tape comes loose on the skeletal structure. Can't look: Anthony turns her head away as Dr Spitz's showed photos of her daughter's skull to the court . Parents: Caylee's grandmother, Cindy Anthony, looks away from the  courtroom monitor as the two-year-old's skull is shown, left, while her husband George, right, stares straight ahead . In this case, the only thing that held the tape there was hair and roots. 'My strong opinion is duct tape was placed there to hold the (decomposed) lower jaw in place.' Prosecutor Jeff Ashton attacked Dr Spitz's assessments on cross examination, arguing that he didn't have nearly as much information as Dr Garavaglia did when she made her evaluation. Mr Ashton also challenged Dr Spitz to cite a particular written protocol that said the skull must be opened in every autopsy. 'I'm not aware of where you can find a protocol, but I can assure you it is part of a complete autopsy,' Dr Spitz said. An oversight? Anthony, right, consoles her attorney Jose Baez, left, after Judge Belvin Perry finds the defence's first witness testimony was not disclosed to the prosecution earlier . Later, he suggested the position of hair found with the child's skull might have been staged when it was photographed in the medical examiner's office. 'It wouldn't be the first time, sir,"" he said. 'It's my opinion that somebody did.' The testimony of the defence's first witness of the day, forensic anthropologist William Rodriguez, was interrupted after prosecutors said he testified about information not previously disclosed to the state. The objection came after Mr Rodriguez said it would be impossible to determine the exact position of duct tape on a corpse. You did what? Judge Perry dismissed the defence's first witness and has retained the right to hold Mr Baez in contempt of court after the trial ends . Because tape loses its stickiness, it may be shifted, and animals could have come in contact with the body, he said. With the jury sent out of the courtroom, Judge Belvin Perry questioned Mr Rodriguez about his planned testimony. Mr Rodriguez told him that he initially told lead defence attorney Jose Baez the information in February. Mr Baez told Perry the non-disclosure was not intentional. He said prosecutors had declined an opportunity to further question Mr Rodriguez before trial and only asked for the pre-testimony report all witnesses were to submit. Victim: Anthony, 25, has pleaded not guilty to killing two-year-old Caylee in the summer of 2008 . Judge Perry said Mr Baez's conduct seemed to have violated a pre-trial order he issued. 'What you are basically saying is you can pick which orders you will comply and not comply with,' the judge told Mr Baez. 'It appears to me this was quite intentional. It was not an inadvertent slip.' Judge Perry decided to have Mr Rodriguez step down from the witness stand today, allowing the state an opportunity to question him outside court. He said he would consider a special instruction to jurors about the non-disclosure and would reserve the right to hold Mr Baez in contempt of court after the trial ends. Judge Perry also warned Mr Baez about further infractions that could end in witness exclusion. 'Lightning does not strike twice in one place,' Judge Perry said. 'I'm not making any promises of warranties if this happens a second time with this witness.'","Forensic expert for defence makes explosive claims at Casey Anthony's murder trial .

The U.S. spy chief in Islamabad has unexpectedly quit his post amid rumours of a rift with his Pakistani colleagues. U.S. and Pakistani officials say the CIA station chief who ran operations in Pakistan during the raid that killed Osama bin Laden left his post due to illness. But another Pakistani source claims issues surrounding the working relationship between spies from the two countries led to the sudden departure. The station chief, who cannot be named because he works undercover, is said to have been an important liaison with Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency. He guided intelligence operations in the country through a troubled time in U.S.-Pakistani relations. The senior spook's sudden resignation was first reported by CBS news, citing a Pakistani government official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official told CBS 'there were issues both internal to America's working in Pakistan and issues with Pakistan' which prompted the departure. American officials, who also spoke anonymously, told the Associated Press the outgoing chief also clashed with U.S. ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter. Ambassador Munter had objected to CIA drone strikes during diplomatic negotiations. Tensions: Pakistani media personnel and local residents gather outside the hideout of Al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden following his assassination . The spy chief's sudden resignation marks yet another possible sign of strains in the relationship between the two countries, which has been under pressure since the assassination of terror chief Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, northern Pakistan. Military and civilian leaders in Pakistan reacted angrily to the U.S. decision to withhold information on the raid from Pakistani authorities. It was feared that any information shared could have been leaked to Islamist militant groups sympathetic to al Qaida and the Taliban. A European ambassador, who spoke to CBS News on condition of anonymity, said the senior spy's departure 'deeply suggests that the U.S.-Pakistan relationship continues to be surrounded with tension'. The ambassador added: 'Unless the U.S. and Pakistan quickly work out their differences, we will have to live with some pretty severe consequences.' The news came as Pakistan imposed travel curbs on U.S. and other diplomats in the latest sign of worsening ties between the troubled allies since the killing of bin Laden. A Western diplomatic source said the U.S. embassy received a 'diplomatic note' from the Pakistani foreign ministry last month, setting travel guidelines for diplomats outside the capital Islamabad. The restrictions came amid Pakistani media reports that U.S. diplomats travelling from Islamabad were turned away from the north-western city of Peshawar in recent weeks for not having a 'no objection certificate' from authorities. Terror: Angry supporters of Pakistanis burn U.S. flags during a rally to condemn the killing of Osama bin Laden. Feeling against the U.S. has been running high . Pakistan is an important ally for the United States in its fight against Islamist militancy, but relations have been on downward spiral after a CIA contractor killed two Pakistanis in January. More tensions emerged after U.S. forces killed bin Laden in May without informing Islamabad beforehand. The United States recently suspended about a third of its $2.7 billion annual defence aid to Islamabad in a show of displeasure over Pakistan's cutbacks on U.S. trainers and limits on visas for U.S. personnel. Meanwhile, U.S. drone-fired missiles slammed into a car near the Afghan border on Monday, killing four suspected Islamist militants, Pakistani intelligence officials said. The missile strike took place in the Nargusa area of South Waziristan, which like much of the rugged border region is home to al-Qaida and Taliban fighters. Officials identified the dead men as Pakistani militants, but said they were not from the border region. Two other fighters were wounded in the strike.

In the North, there will be congestion on the M6 through Staffordshire and Cheshire into Lancashire at peak times. Lured by special deals, millions of people headed to Britain's major airports to catch some overseas sunshine, leading to departure lounges becoming clogged up. Heathrow Airport is expecting 1.4million holidaymakers to take off between today and Sunday. More than . 124,000 passengers are predicted to fly from the airport on Sunday alone. Winging it: Crowds at Stansted Airport today as millions opted to jet away for the summer . Drivers are being warned to expect jams particularly on main routes to the coast in south west England, at cross-Channel ports like Dover . - The A303 from the M3 through Hampshire, Wiltshire and Somerset . - The M5 from Almondsbury near Bristol to Exeter . - The M3/M27/A31 from Winchester in Hampshire to the Dorset coast . - The M6 between Junction 11A through Staffordshire and Cheshire into Lancashire . - . The western part of the M25 between M1 interchange at junction 21 in . Hertfordshire and the M3 interchange at junction 12 west of Chertsey in . Surrey . Terry Morgan, . acting chief operating officer at Heathrow, said: 'We're looking forward . to a very busy summer at Heathrow and hope that the family-friendly initiatives . such as dedicated family lanes and children's play area will take the load off . parents and get holidays off to a flying start.' Travel . organisation Abta said around 2million people will be heading overseas this . weekend. It said a . quarter of a million are expected to fly from Gatwick, 135,000 from Stansted, . 210,000 from Manchester, 65,000 from Birmingham, 26,000 from Leeds Bradford and . 70,000 from Luton. Spain is . still the British holidaymakers' favourite destination, with the Balearic and . Canary Islands also seeing a lot of tourists. Meanwhile Turkey, Tunisia and . Egypt are offering great value holidays, Abta said. Mark . Tanzer, Abta chief executive, said: 'This weekend is one the busiest of . the year as families head off overseas for a well-earned summer break. 'This . year, traditional favourites in the Eurozone like Spain and Portugal have . bounced back after two tough years, with customers taking advantage of some of . the lowest day-to-day expenses overseas.' However despite downpours blighting . much of Britain for the past few days, the sunshine looks set to arrive . in the nick of time. A . bright and dry weekend is on the way for most of us, pushing away the . heavy showers which have turned this week into a washout for many. The . best of the weather will be on Sunday, with temperatures soaring to as . high as 23c (73f) in the West of England, Wales and Scotland. Splashing day out: Tourists in Westminster take shelter from torrential rain yesterday . Although the South West will be . basking in the sunniest spells, the rest of us will also be tempted out . to finally enjoy a touch of summer in what has been a disappointingly . cool July. Before that, . however, some will have to put up with a patchy outlook tomorrow. The North of England is forecast to be bright and dry but cooler winds . and isolated showers mean the South will have to wait just a bit longer . to banish the chill and rain. Forecasters said the more settled weather should then continue for most of next week. Advising motorists this morning AA . patrolman of the year Keith Miller said: 'Allow extra time for your . journey and, if you can, avoid travelling at peak times. Carry plenty of . drinking water, food and things to keep the children entertained.' The Highways Agency urged families to plan their journey and to check traffic and weather before setting off. Road . safety minister Mike Penning said: 'For many people, this will be the . longest car journey of the year, often on an unfamiliar route, and we . want to help them to avoid spoiling the start of their holiday. 'A . few moments checking traffic conditions before you set off could take a . lot of stress out of the journey. There are also plenty of ways to . check for updates whenever you stop for a break, which you should do . every two hours.' In Somerset this afternoon a lorry crashed leaving the driver sitting on top of his cab, not daring to move a muscle in case the truck plunged into a ravine . The lorry smashed through a wall and was left balancing precariously on the edge of a road above a sheer drop into the ravine in scene reminiscent of the hit film The Italian Job starring Michael Caine, where a coachload of gangsters and their gold bullion balanced on a clifftop. Emergency crews arrived at the scene and found the trucker perched on top of his cab, too scared to move in case the slightest tremor sent the vehicle crashing into the ravine. His lorry had jack-knifed on Bath New Road in Radstock and came to rest teetering over the edge of the hill. Amazingly the driver, who has not been named, walked away with just cuts and bruises after being plucked to safety by Avon Fire and Rescue Service. An eye witness in Coombend, a road that runs below the scene of the incident, who did not wish to be named, said 'We heard a huge bang, went outside and looked up and there was the lorry hanging over the edge of the hill. 'Parts of the wall came away and at first we thought it was outside our building.' The drama began at 9.15 this morning and blocked the A367 in both directions. The road is likely to remain closed until late this afternoon because a crane is being brought in to remove the lorry. Police have put diversions in place and are appealing to drivers to avoid the area.","1.4million expected to take off from Heathrow between now and Sunday .

It’s travelled the equivalent of more than eight round trips to the sun, it’s been constantly occupied for 11 years and it’s cost the U.S. taxpayer billions of dollars to build and maintain. But the International Space Station will reportedly be taken out of orbit and allowed to sink into the Pacific Ocean in 2020 - just like its Russian predecessor, Mir. Russia's space agency announced the decision on Wednesday because the space base that is maintained around 200 miles away from the earth is too ‘complicated’ and ‘heavy’ to leave in orbit. Going down: The International Space Station will be taken out of orbit and allowed to sink into the Pacific Ocean in 2020, according to Russia's space agency . ‘We will be forced to sink the ISS,' Roscosmos deputy head Vitaly Davydov told the agency's website. 'We cannot leave it in orbit as it is a very complicated and a heavy object. We have agreed with our partners that the ISS would function roughly until 2020.’ But NASA and government sources are shocked, following the input of billions of dollars into the space station - if the cost of the shuttle flights that carried its modules into orbit is included. ‘The partnership is currently working to certify on-orbit elements through 2028,’ a spokesman for NASA (the National Aeronautics and Space Administration) told Fox News. Reasoning: Russia's space agency announced the decision because the space base that is maintained around 200 miles away from the earth is too 'complicated' and 'heavy' to leave in orbit . This suggests the U.S. space agency clearly has a different vision for the ISS. It agreed to build the station in January 1998 with Canadians, Europeans and Japanese and Russian space scientists. The NASA spokesman said a global panel that included the U.S. and Russia met earlier this year to consider the ISS’s future - and looked at continuing the operation into the next decade, reported Fox News. ‘This isn't the first time I've seen Russia come out with a statement that seems to be coming out of their own stovepipes,’ a congressional representative told Fox News. ‘I’d give it no credence at all. 'We wouldn't allow astronauts to be on the station if there's a sense that it's limping along.’ Another congressional source said NASA . would have advised them if there was any agreement on the date when the . ISS would no longer be used and what will happen to it. Before: The station's Russian predecessor, Mir, pictured in 1996, operated between 1983 and 1998 before it was sunk into the Pacific Ocean near Christmas Island in 2000 . Former astronaut and U.S Senator Bill Nelson said Mr Davydov’s comments were mainly intended to address worries about space junk or debris falling into populated areas. Government sources told Fox News that de-orbiting the station in 2020 has not even been discussed - and The White House and Congress are both expecting the ISS to be in action until at least 2020. The ISS, which is the same size as a football field, has travelled more than 1.5 billion miles – the same as eight trips to the sun and back. Its Russian predecessor, Mir, operated between 1983 and 1998 before it was sunk into the Pacific Ocean near Christmas Island in 2000, reported RIA Novosti.","Russian agency says ISS is too 'complicated' and 'heavy' to leave in space .

"By . Ray Massey . Last updated at 10:32 PM on 29th July 2011 . Families are facing record fare rises as airlines begin to pass on increasing fuel costs and soaring taxes. The warning comes just days after Ryanair announced a 12 per cent hike on ticket prices. Experts believe it is 'inevitable' other airlines will follow suit. Price hikes: A double double whammy of fuel price hikes and soaring taxes has led to budget carrier Ryanair announcing a 12 per cent rise in ticket prices . The increase would see £300 added to a holiday in Florida for a family of four, or nearly £100 for the same family flying to Spain. EasyJet chief executive Carolyn McCall warned that families'  foreign holidays were being hammered by the Government and would soon become a luxury only the privileged could enjoy. She said: 'This is unfair on hard-working families. Britain is one of the only European countries to tax air passengers.' There was a limit to how far even low-cost airlines could keep cutting costs against a background of high oil prices and taxes, she added. 'I think fares will rise inevitably because you have to pass on the cost of  fuel some way. All airlines will have to do it. All prices will rise.' 'Unfair': EasyJet CEO Carolyn McCall warns foreign travel could soon be a luxury only the privileged could enjoy . British Airways boss Willie Walsh said fuel costs had shot up by 35 per cent and the company's fuel bill this year would be £4.47billion – a third of its total costs. Of a return ticket to Orlando in Florida costing £600, £340 is basic fare and £260 is made up of  fuel (£170), air passenger duty (£70) and local taxes. A 12 per cent fare hike could see the fare rise by £72 – or by £288 for a family of four. Passengers face a second round of price increases from 2012 when the controversial air passenger duty (APD) is set to increase by double the rate of inflation. An announcement is expected in the pre-Budget statement in November. A new 'green' emissions tax is also expected to be imposed from January. Details are yet to be finalised. APD was first imposed on flights in November 1994, ranging from £5 for economy across Europe and £20 across the rest of the world, up to a maximum of £40 in other classes. But since then it has soared – under the pretence of being a 'green' environmental tax –  so that now it ranges from £12 economy in Europe up to £85 for long-distance economy  journeys in the rest of the world, and £170 for the longest journeys in other classes. Travel expert Bob Atkinson of travelsupermarket.com said:  'British families are undoubtedly facing  pressure on the amounts they pay for their air fares. 'If Ryanair is putting up prices by 12 per cent, others will not be far behind. It means that more than ever, families will have to shop around for the best deals.'","Fuel costs up 35 per cent, says BA boss Willie Walsh .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:04 PM on 17th June 2011 . Welsh rugby star Mike Phillips has been suspended indefinitely from the national squad with immediate effect following an alleged early morning street brawl. The 28-year-old scrum-half has been banned 'with immediate effect' following allegations of an incident involving the player. A statement from the WRU read: 'The Wales management team will take time to consider circumstances surrounding recent allegations about the player's behaviour in public whilst on an agreed holiday period from pre-Rugby World Cup training.' No can do: Mike Phillips tries to get into McDonald's, left, before being grabbed by bouncers, right . 'The WRU operates to its own strict code of conduct covering behaviour both on and off the field, in circumstances of serious indiscipline the national squad management have the capacity to impose sanctions on players for matters arising from occasions when they are not on official squad duty,' the statement continued. 'Whilst the suspension is in operation further clarification regarding the incident will be sought. 'The suspension has been approved by Wales head coach Warren Gatland and agreed by the senior squad management team. The WRU has not been alerted of any criminal action and the suspension is based on its own behaviour protocols.' Phillips, who sealed a move to French . Top 14 club Bayonne from Ospreys earlier this week on a two-year deal, . is now expected to face questions over the allegations. WRU chief executive Roger Lewis explained Phillips's suspension was a result of a 'breach of standards'. 'Discipline and acceptable behaviour are issues which run to the core values of the Welsh Rugby Union and we cannot tolerate any compromise of those standards,' he said. 'Mike Phillips is an exceptional player, but there is irrefutable evidence of a prima facie nature that he was engaged in behaviour which falls below the standards we set. 'It is vitally important that we send out a clear and unambiguous message to one and all concerning our views on matters of this sort. No way out: Phillips is wrestled to the ground, left, before the police arrive, but no arrests were made . 'That message must be heard clearly by all players, coaches, administrators, volunteers, supporters and, of course, the parents and guardians of any child attracted to take part in the national sport of Wales. 'By taking decisive action now we are emphasising that this sort of incident is highly unusual in that the majority of people involved in Welsh rugby help us maintain the proud record we have for fair play and off the field courtesy. Former love: Phillips with his former girlfriend, the singer Duffy . 'Our senior national squad players are highly visible because of the profile which accompanies the success of our national sport and it is made clear to them that they are the ambassadors we rely on to foster and sustain our image. 'An incredible amount of hard work is currently taking place as our players prepare for the Rugby World Cup in New Zealand and that effort must be recognised and supported by all involved. 'I am making my views public at this time because, as the nation anticipates our involvement in Rugby World Cup there is no room for any ambiguity in our reasoning. 'Rugby is part of the culture of our nation and we must do all in our power to ensure that the game remains a sport that everyone in Wales can be rightly proud of.' Phillips has been replaced by Lloyd Williams in Wales' pre-World Cup training squad. Police said they were called to the incident but said no arrests took place. Inspector Tony Bishop, of South Wales Police, said: 'In the early . hours of Tuesday, June 14, South Wales Police attended Queen Street, . Cardiff, following information received that a man was being restrained . by security staff. 'Officers attended and the individual was placed into a police . vehicle while enquiries were made in the location to establish what had . taken place. 'No complaints were received, no persons wished to provide statements and no offences were disclosed. 'The man was taken away from the area and no further action was taken.' Damien Broad, who took photographs of the incident, described how events unfolded. He said: 'He was not allowed into McDonald’s and was having an argument with the bouncers.' Mr Broad said there was a scuffle with bouncers outside the . restaurant before one of them sat on 6ft 3in Phillips until police came. 'They put him in the back of the van . and drove off,' he said. 'There were quite a few people there watching. It was definitely Phillips.'","Ban takes place 'with immediate effect' says Welsh Rugby Union .

"Water hits nuclear plant in Nebraska but officials say there's 'no danger' 2,000-foot berm at the Fort . Calhoun Nuclear Station collapsed . 11,000 people forced to flee Minot after worst floods in 130 years . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:53 PM on 27th June 2011 . As the devastating floods peaked today it was revealed that most of the residents affected in Minot, North Dakota, don't have proper flood insurance. The town has been decimated by the floods from the Souris River which slowly began to retreat today, although officials estimate it will be weeks before the river returns to a normal level. At least 4,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed by the floods, the worst in the region for 130 years. And most residents affected do not have the right kind of insurance, as they believed the flood prevention projects put in place after the last major flood in 1969 would protect them. Scroll down for video . Disappeared: The Souris River floods, pictured today in North Dakota, have reached their peak - according to officials who say it could take weeks to subside . Under siege: Floodwater from the Souris River surrounds a church in Burlington, North Dakota . Submerged: The rooftops of these Burlington homes poke out above the flood water in North Dakota today . Today the town looked to recovery and . FEMA said they will provide some assistance. North Dakota Legislature is . expected to offer some relief. Meanwhile a protective barrier which . was holding back floodwater from the Missouri River surrounding a nuclear power plant in . Nebraska collapsed yesterday, sending water gushing around key . electrical equipment. The head of the U.S. Nuclear . Regulatory Commission has been dispatched to the plant in Fort Calhoun, . Nebraska, but officials said the public is in no danger. After the 2,000-foot berm was breached . flood waters poured into around containment buildings forcing the . shutdown of electrical power, and sparking fears that thousands could be . left without power - or face rising bills - if any damage is done. Officials said backup generators are cooling the nuclear material, and that the plant has not operated since April. They said there is no danger to the public. Jeff . Hanson, a spokesman for the Omaha Public Power District, said the . breached berm wasn't critical to protecting the plant, although a crew . will look at whether it can be patched. Mr Hanson said: 'That was an additional layer of protection we put in.' No land in sight: These aerial pictures, taken today, show the extent of the floods that have swept away homes and destroyed lives in North Dakota . Immersed: Homes in Minot are surrounded by water. Most of the residents whose homes are affected don't have flood insurance . The berm's collapse didn't affect the . reactor shutdown cooling or the spent fuel pool cooling, but the power . supply was cut after water surrounded the main electrical transformers, . the NRC said. Emergency generators are powering the plant while workers try to restore power. Flooding . remains a concern all along the Missouri because of massive amounts of . water the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has released from upstream . reservoirs. The river is expected to rise as much . as five to seven feet above flood stage in much of Nebraska and Iowa . and as much as 10 feet over flood stage in parts of Missouri. The . corps expects the river to remain high at least into August because of . heavy spring rains in the upper Plains and substantial Rocky Mountain . snowpack melting into the river basin. Homes destroyed: These pictures, taken today, show the extent of the flooding that forced 11,000 to flee their homes . Aid: The National Guard provides two large ""bladders,"" water tanks that hold thousands of gallons of water, for Minot's Trinity Hospital . The . berm collapse comes as the National Guard battled to remove a tiny . footbridge that holds the key to saving a small North Dakota town from . being engulfed in flood waters. Up . to 4,000 homes and business in Minot will be wiped off the map if the . bridge, which has become wedged against a levee, is not removed. The . small bridge is collecting debris, causing the water to swell violently . around the levee - further eroding the last line of defence against the . river Mouse. Resistance: National Guard Specialist Adrian Batsch, left, tests the water supply to Trinity Hospital in downtown Minot today . Hope: Minot residents have started looking to recovery today although many of those affected by the floods do not have flood insurance . Speaking to CBS, Minot's Mayor Curt Zimbelman said the man-made levees threatened to fail in the wake of the huge volumes of water. He said: 'If [the levee] goes, everything goes in this whole, this whole area, for several blocks up, several businesses. 'We either hold this whole dike, this whole temporary dike or we lose it all.' Although the river crested, it is still flowing at 50 times its normal rate and is expanded to 10 times its normal size. Thin line: Levee's protecting homes in North Dakota were reinforced on the weekend . The city has prepared for the worst . with workers bolstering levees that stand between thousands of dry homes . and the rising waters. Workers sweated over sandbags on the weekend as levees were built up to six feet above the level of the rising waters. There . is already widespread damage in the town, with Mayor Zimbelman . reporting more than 4,000 homes had been flooded in an evacuation zone . of neighbourhoods nearest the river. About 11,000 people were ordered out last week. Lead excavator Russ Gohl has drafted in every flood fighter in the area and has even drafted in the National Guard to help. Washed up: Floodwater is pumped out of the basement of a Minot State University building today, after the river hit its peak and began a slow retreat . Jutting out: A statue of a worker, part of the Monument to Labor statue by Matthew Placzek, pokes just out of the rising waters of the Missouri River at Omaha's Lewis & Clark Landing in Nebraska . He said: 'By removing the bridge its . collecting debris and its causing the water to swirl and erode our dikes . and what we are going to do is hook on and try and physically brute . force pull the bridge away.' Fed . by heavy rains upstream and dam releases that have accelerated in . recent days, the Souris surged past a 130-year-old record today and kept . going. This week emergency officials focused on protecting water and sewer systems to avoid the need for more evacuations. Problems at Minot's water treatment . plant prompted the state Department of Health to issue a 'boil order' on . Saturday for users of city water. It also applies to the Minot Air . Force Base, about 13 miles north of town, which gets its drinking water . from Minot's municipal system. Reached its peak: Street signs in Minot show the height of the flood waters at a levee today . Zimbelman said city officials were 'not completely sure at this point' that Minot's water supply had been contaminated. 'It has not been fully tested ... to . show that it is contaminated,' Zimbelman said. 'There is just a concern . at this point, so we're taking precautions.' Minot's Broadway Street bridge over . the Souris, which is its most important connection between the north and . south sections of the city, is likely to remain closed until the crest . recedes, the mayor said. Despite the gloomy . outlook, stories of people helping each other were a heartwarming . counterpoint to the destruction from unprecedented flooding along the . Souris valley in north-central North Dakota. Brought together by word of mouth, church and civic networks, social . media and random encounters, those with housing and supplies to spare . gave willingly to those without. So . many opened their doors that while some 11,000 people were evacuated . from neighbourhoods nearest the river, only a few hundred used shelters . at Minot State University and the City Auditorium. 'For . the rest of the country, that is kind of mind-boggling. But ... that's . how we are in North Dakota,' Senator John Hoeven said. Breached: An aerial view of the Fort Calhoun Nuclear Power Plant in eastern Nebraska, surrounded by Missouri River flood waters . A Facebook page called Minot ND Flood Help drew volunteer offers to haul furniture, care for pets, clean laundry and even give therapeutic massages - many from outside town. Patrica Eide of Tioga, about 85 miles west, posted an offer to loan her 30-foot camper to a displaced family. It quickly drew a taker: a man with a wife and three children who were living in their van since being evacuated. 'We could probably rent that thing for $500 a month, but I told my husband there's no way I'm going to be greedy,' Eide, 62, said by phone. 'God just had better plans for our camper than renting it.' She was preparing to haul it to Minot with a load of canned tomatoes and green beans, a grill, propane and other supplies. 'I think we've got 'em covered,' she said. A common sight was garages packed with televisions, books, clothing and other items as residents turned their homes into temporary storage units for flood victims.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:57 PM on 30th July 2011 . In an unforgiving display of partisanship, the Republican-controlled House approved emergency legislation Friday night to avoid an unprecedented government default and Senate Democrats scuttled it less than two hours later in hopes of a better deal.'We are almost out of time' for a compromise, warned President Barack Obama as U.S. financial markets trembled at the prospect of economic chaos next week. The Dow Jones average fell for a sixth straight session.Lawmakers in both parties said they were determined to avoid a default, yet there was little evidence of progress — or even significant negotiations — on a compromise during a long day of intense political maneuvering.The House vote was 218-210, almost entirely along party lines, on a Republican-drafted bill to provide a quick $900 billion increase in U.S. borrowing authority — essential to allow the government to continue paying all its bills — along with $917 billion in cuts from federal spending.

Update: President Barack Obama speaks on the U.S. debt ceiling talks at the White House today . That marked a concession to tea . party-backed conservatives and others in the rank and file who had . thwarted House Speaker John Boehner's attempt to pass the bill Thursday . night. 'Today we have a chance to end this debt limit crisis,' Boehner . declared, his endgame strategy upended by rebels within his own party. But the changes he made to the House GOP bill further alienated . Democrats. And they complicated prospects of a compromise that could . clear both houses and win Obama's signature by next Tuesday's deadline. At the other end of the Capitol, Senate Democrats rejected the measure . without so much as a debate. The vote was 59-41, with all Democrats, two . independents and six Republicans joining in opposition. Moments later, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., unveiled an . alternative that would cut spending by $2.4 trillion and raise the debt . limit by the same amount, enough to meet Obama's terms that it tide the . Treasury over until 2013. Reid invited Republicans to suggest changes, saying, ""This is likely our last chance to save this nation from default."" The Senate GOP leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, accused Democrats of . 'rounding up 'no' votes to keep this crisis alive, and noted the House . had passed two bills to raise the debt limit and the Senate none.

Worried faces: Traders work on the main trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange in Manhattan on Friday . The House, eager to return the Senate's favor rejecting the Boehner . bill, set a vote to reject Reid's proposal on Saturday. The Senate set a . test vote at about 1 a.m. on Sunday, a middle-of-the-night roll call . that underscored the limited time available to lawmakers. At the same time Reid appealed for bipartisanship, he and other party . leaders accused Boehner of caving in to extremists in the GOP ranks — . ""the last holdouts of the tea party,"" Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois . called them. Republicans conceded that the overnight delay had weakened Boehner's hand in the endgame with Obama and Senate Democrats. But the Ohio Republican drew applause from his rank and file when he . said the House, alone, had advanced legislation to cut deficits, and . that he had ""stuck his neck out"" in recent weeks in hopes of concluding a . sweeping deficit reduction deal with Obama. Fifteen Trillion Dollars: This graphic from WTFnoway.com shows the value of $15,000,000,000,000, which is around the value of the $14.3trillion debt limit . Boehner's measure would provide a quick $900 billion increase in . borrowing authority — essential for the U.S. to keep paying all its . bills after next Tuesday — and $917 billion in spending cuts. After the . bill's latest alteration, any future increases in the debt limit would . be contingent on Congress approving the constitutional amendment and . sending it to the states for ratification. ""With conservatives insisting on the addition of a balanced-budget . amendment requirement, Speaker Boehner's bill will now cut, cap and . balance"" federal spending, said Rep. Jeff Flake of Arizona as Friday's . scheduled vote approached. The White House called the bill a nonstarter. Press secretary Jay Carney . issued a statement that called it a ""political exercise"" and said . congressional leaders should turn their efforts to a compromise that . Obama can sign by Tuesday. The developments occurred one day after Boehner was forced to postpone a . vote in the House for fear the earlier version of his measure would . suffer a defeat. But by forcing a delay the conservative rebels upended . the leadership's strategy of making their bill the only one that could . clear Congress before a default and win Obama's reluctant signature. ""Everybody acknowledges that because of the dust-up yesterday we've lost . some leverage,"" said Rep. Steven LaTourette, R-Ohio, an ally of the . speaker. The rebels said they were more worried about stemming the nation's steady rise of red ink. Rep. Jeff Landry, R-La., a, a first-term lawmaker, issued a statement saying his pressure had paid off. ""The American people have strongly renewed their November calls of . bringing fiscal sanity to Washington. I am blessed to be a vehicle . driving their wishes to fruition,"" he said. ""This plan is not a . Washington deal but a real solution to fundamentally change the way . Washington operates."" Administration officials say that without legislation in place by . Tuesday, the Treasury will no longer be able to pay all its bills. The . result could inflict significant damage on the economy, they add, . causing interest rates to rise and financial markets to sink. Executives from the country's biggest banks met with U.S. Treasury . officials to discuss how debt auctions will be handled if Congress fails . to raise the borrowing limit before Tuesday's deadline.

But Carney said the administration did not plan to provide the public . with details Friday on how the government will prioritize payments. The day's economic news wasn't very upbeat to begin with — an economy . that grew at an annual rate of only 1.3 percent in the second quarter of . the year. The Dow Jones industrial average suffered through a sixth straight day . of losses, and bond yields fell as investors sought safer investments in . the event of a default. At the White House, Obama cited the potential toll on the economy as he urged lawmakers to find a way out of gridlock. He said that for all the partisanship, the two sides were not that far . apart. Both agree on initial spending cuts to take effect in exchange . for an increase in the debt limit, he said, as well as on a way to . consider additional reductions in government benefit programs in the . coming months. Hands out: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi speaks about the debt ceiling and budget negotiations in Washington D.C. on Thursday, stating that the delay in decision-making 'must end now' My way: Democratic Leader Harry Reid's plan, backed by President Obama, would cut $2.2 trillion from the deficit over 10 years without raising taxes and extend the debt ceiling through next year . ""And if we need to put in place some kind of enforcement mechanism to . hold us all accountable for making these reforms, I'll support that, . too, if it's done in a smart and balanced way,"" he said. That went to the crux of the conflict — his insistence that Congress . raise the government's borrowing authority by enough to avoid a repeat . of the current crisis during the heat of the 2012 election campaigns. Republicans have resisted, accusing him of injecting purely political considerations into the debt limit negotiations.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:12 AM on 2nd August 2011 . Kings of Leon today cancelled the remainder of their U.S. tour. A statement released by the rock band claims the lead singer Caleb Followill, who recently married Victoria's Secret model Lily Aldridge, is suffering from 'exhaustion'. It comes three days after he angered fans in Dallas, Texas, by abruptly walking out mid-concert because it was 'too hot.' A string of tweet by the band after Friday night's disastrous performance hinted at mounting disharmony between the group. Bizarre behaviour: The Kings of Leon have cancelled their entire U.S. tour four days after Caleb Followill (pictured) walked off stage complaining he was 'too hot' A spokesperson said today: 'We are so . sorry to say Kings of Leon are cancelling their entire US tour due to . Caleb Followill suffering from vocal issues and exhaustion.' 'The band is devastated, but in order . to give their fans the shows they deserve, they need to take this . break. 'Unfortunately, the US dates cannot be rescheduled due to the . band's international tour schedule.' 'Utterly depressed': Jared Followill today tweeted about the cancellation and joked about the band breaking up . After performing about four songs on Friday, the lead singer started complaining about losing his voice and asking the audience to help him sing. 'If you guys would please help me sing, I'd love it,' he begged. About 50 minutes into the show the rocker told the shocked audience at the Gexa Energy Pavilion he needed a break. 'I'm gonna go backstage for a second and I'm gonna vomit,' he said. 'I'm gonna drink a beer and I'm gonna play three more songs.' Rift: Caleb's brother Jared Followill apologised to fans after Friday's show and hinted at deeper problems within the group . Caleb, however, did not reappear, leaving his bandmates to apologise to the crowd. 'Caleb's . just a little unfit to play the rest of the show,' they said. 'We love . you guys so much. I know you guys f***ing hate us. I'm so sorry.' They added: 'It's really not out fault - it's Caleb. He can't play the rest of the show. We will be back as soon as possible.' Comments . made on Twitter by Caleb's brother and the band's bass guitarist Jared . Followill, however, suggested there was more to Caleb's problems that . met the eye. 'Dallas, I . cannot begin to tell you how sorry I am. There are internal sicknesses . & problems that have needed to be addressed,' he wrote on Saturday. Troubled history: This isn't the first time the group has bailed mid-concert . He . added: 'I love out fans so much. I know you guys aren't stupid. I can't . lie. There are problems in our band bigger than not drinking enough . Gatorade.' Drummer Nathan Followill echoed his brother's sentiment. 'Ashamed & embarrassed by last night's fiasco,' he tweeted. 'Can't apologise enough, utterly gutted.' Today Jared was back on Twitter to share his disappointment over the cancelled tour saying he was 'uttterly depressed'. Trouble: The band have rescheduled, but furious fans have taken to social networking sites to slate their behaviour . He . added: 'It's completely out of my hands. Family has to come 1st. If . base solos & backing vocals were more popular, I'd be there.' But told fans he said he'd spend the time song writing. He also made a joke about the band breaking up, only to insist he was 'kidding'. The Kings of Leon rep said people who had tickets for the band's remaining US shows would be refunded. They are expected to resume their tour in Canada on September 28th. The Nashville-based group, which is known for hits including the Grammy-winning anthem 'Use Somebody,' is also known for its history of squabbles and bizarre behaviour. Last . year the band pulled the plug half way through a concert in St Louis, . Missouri after their bass player was pooped on by pigeons. Jared had been hit several times already when a particularly large splat landed on his face near his mouth. That proved too much for the rockers, who fled the stage just three songs into their set. In 2009 the band members were also involved in a drunken backstage bust-up with each other at the Brit Awards, according to witnesses. A host of stars milling around the dressing room area including U2 and David Hasselhoff, watched as the band, who are all related, started brawling.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:31 AM on 1st August 2011 . Four people have been killed today as fighting broke out between rival Libyan rebels. One rebel group overran the base of another faction in the opposition stronghold of Benghazi after they . suspected that faction had freed some supporters of Muammar Gaddafi from . an opposition prison, Rebel Information Minister Mahmoud Shammam said. It comes just days after rebel military chief Abdel-Fattah Younis was killed, possibly by fighters from his own side. Relatives visit Wael Shaari, a wounded rebel fighter in the Al-Jala hospital following the rebel clashes . Mr Shammam said the clashes between rebel security forces and members of the . al-Nidaa Brigade broke out around 3am. Six were also injured in the fighting. The main rebel force . took control of al-Nidaa's base after five hours of fighting, he said. The violence comes two days after suspected al-Nidaa members attacked . two prisons in Benghazi, which led to the escape of some 200 to 300 . inmates, including mercenaries, pro-Gadafi fighters and regime . loyalists. The clashes point to divisions . within the rebel ranks that could sap the movement of much-needed unity . in its push to topple Gaddafi nearly six months after the revolt began. Libyan special emergency police officer guards the hangar in Benghazi where the fighting between rebel forces and suspected pro-Gaddafi fighters took place . Meanwhile, in the Nafusa mountains of western Libya near the Tunisian border, rebel . forces said they were making gains in their push against Gaddafi . forces. On Sunday, they said they were in the town of Hawamid and advanced . another 6-9 miles toward the small town of Tiji in . the last 24 hours. 'Hundreds of rebel fighter are surrounding Tiji,' said Jamal Motawa, a . 26-year-old rebel who was one of seven wounded in the fighting. Motawa . had shrapnel in his left leg. Pro-Gaddafi forces inside Tiji were under siege but continued to attack the advancing rebels with rockets he said.

Tiji is on the main road from the Tunisian border to Tripoli, the Libyan . capital. It is considered a strategically important town if rebels were . to continue their advance to Tripoli, some 150 miles . to the northeast. The rival rebel clashes point to divisions within the rebel ranks that could sap the much-needed unity to topple Gaddafi, pictured . Rebels in the Nafusa mountains have been making modest advances against . Gaddafi's troops, but fighting in the east has been stalled for months, . with neither side able to make any significant progress. Despite the slow pace of events on the ground, France, one of the rebels' main outside backers, is encouraging patience. In an interview published on Sunday, French Defence Minister Gerard . Longuet addressed the growing pressure for a quick resolution to the . Libya conflict, insisting that 'impatience is never a good adviser' and . that rebel fighters don't deserve the blame. 'Things have to move in Tripoli. To put it clearly, the population has . to rise up. The month ahead will naturally be intense. There will not . be, I think, a pause because of the month of Ramadan,' Longuet said. Today, a day after NATO airstrikes bombed three Libyan state . television satellite transmitters in Tripoli, a spokesman at NATO's . operational headquarters in Naples said the alliance had seen reports of . casualties among the TV network's employees. A NATO official said: 'We are aware of the allegations related to this subject. We cannot confirm them since we have nobody on the ground . there.'

At the time, NATO justified the attack by claiming the TV network was . fomenting violence and serving as the propaganda mouthpiece of Serbian . strongman Slobodan Milosevic.

"By . David Wilkes . Last updated at 1:33 AM on 29th July 2011 . Turning back the clock to your youth might seem appealing. But when 34-year-old Naomi Jacobs woke up convinced she was 15, it was the start of a terrifying ordeal. The mother of one had been struck by a rare form of amnesia brought on simply by stress. Naomi Jacobs developed a rare form of amnesia that caused her to lose 17 years of her life . The last thing she could remember was falling asleep in her bunk bed as a schoolgirl, dreaming about a boy she had a crush on. When she woke, she thought it was 1992, John Major was prime minister and she was about to sit her GCSEs. Mobile phones and the internet were a total mystery, and worst of all she had no idea who her 11-year-old son Leo was. 'I looked in the mirror and had the . fright of my life when I saw a woman with wrinkles staring back at me,' said Miss Jacobs yesterday. 'Then this little boy appeared and . started calling me mum. That's when I started to scream. I didn't know . who he was, I didn't think he was much younger than I was, and I . certainly didn't remember giving birth to him. Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a type of amnesia involving the sudden, temporary disturbance in an otherwise healthy person's memory. The leading hypotheses are . some form of epileptic event, a problem with blood circulation around, . to or from the brain, or some kind of migraine-like . phenomenon. TGA attacks are associated with some form of precipitating event in at . least one-third of cases. In females, this event is more often of a . strong emotional character; in males, it is more often related to some . physical exertion. The most commonly cited precipitating events . include sexual intercourse, swimming in . cold water or enduring other temperature changes, and emotionally . traumatic or stressful events. TGA is most common in people between age 56 and 75, with the average age of a person experiencing TGA being approximately 62. 'I began sobbing uncontrollably. To . say I was petrified was an understatement. I just wanted my mum. I . couldn't get my head around going to bed one night and waking up in a . different century.' Miss Jacobs had Transient Global . Amnesia, a form of memory loss brought on by stress. It affects five in . 100,000 people in  Britain, rising to 23 in 100,000 in the over 50s. Before her attack, Miss Jacobs, of Manchester, was worrying about a homeopathy business she ran. She was studying for a psychology . degree and had her final exams approaching, and had recently split up . with the father of her child. The condition caused the 'episodic' part of her memory to shut down, meaning she had lost all her emotional memories. But her semantic memory was still . intact, meaning she could remember things she had repeated over time . such as how to drive and phone numbers she had regularly dialled. This meant she was able to ring a friend and her sister to ask for help, and they took her to a doctor. There is no specific treatment other than support and reassurance from family and loved ones. Fortunately, Miss Jacobs had this, and after eight weeks her memory began to return to normal. Looking through old diaries further . helped her piece her life back together, and now she has finally . regained most of her memory. Jacobs' last memory was of falling asleep as a 15-year-old dreaming about a boy . Yesterday she told of her ordeal ahead of publication of a novel she has written based on her experience in 2008. 'It has taken three years of hard . work to piece most of my memory back together, and it just helps me to . appreciate all I have,' she said. 'At 15, I thought I would have . conquered half the planet by my thirties. It was a massive shock to . discover I was just an ordinary, single mum and driving a battered old . Fiat Brava. 'My best friend and sister had to . take over all communication for me. I had no idea how to work my mobile . phone, and had no concept of email. 'For the first few months, I was . desperately trying to make sense of my life. At night, I'd lie awake and . cry, longing to be back at school.' 1992: The year Whitney reigned and Windsor flamed . She added: 'At first, I struggled to leave my home, and venture out into the world. 'It wasn't fun, like Michael J Fox in . Back To The Future. I'd fallen asleep in a world of endless . possibilities and woken up in a nightmare. 'My best friend and my sister had to . sit me down and painstakingly explain 9/11, 7/7 and the war on terror. Facebook, Google and YouTube sounded like they were completely made up. The first time I saw Leo play on his X-box and interact with the TV, I . was so shocked I spat out my tea. 'Although it was traumatic, I'm . really grateful for being thrown forward through time now. It's made me . re-evaluate my life and decide to follow my childhood dream of becoming a . writer.'","Thought Google, Facebook and YouTube were made-up words .

"Dean Cochrane tried to hide the girl's injuries with ink and talcum powder . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:15 PM on 2nd August 2011 . Vicious: Dean Cochrane, 24, was jailed for beating and biting a young girl . A man has been jailed indefinitely after he severely beat a toddler leaving the child with two skull fractures, 68 bruises and swelling of the scalp. Dean Cochrane, 24, refused to accept he had attacked the girl throughout his trial  and instead blamed her family. Cochrane shouted 'nice one' to the judge as his sentence was handed down yesterday at Teesside Crown Court, Middlesbrough. The child's mother has already received a four-month prison sentence, . suspended for two years, after admitting child cruelty by neglect. The . toddler's injuries were so severe that police officers were left in . tears, describing it as one of the worst cases of abuse they had . ever had to deal with. The court heard how the little girl . suffered a complex skull fracture to the right side either . from being struck with a heavy object or having her head . banged against something. Another impact caused the left fracture and bleeding on the brain. The toddler had a bite mark on her shoulder. Cochrane admitted he had bitten her after experts proved that he was responsible by matching his . teeth prints. He claimed he bit her only to teach her 'not to bite others'. Cochrane of Grangetown, Middlesbrough, had tried to cover up the  injuries using talcum powder and ink. He was told he will be released from prison only when the parole board considers that he is no longer a risk to others. After . a seven-day trial, he was convicted of two charges of causing grievous . bodily harm with intent, one of causing actual bodily harm and child . cruelty. The judge, . Recorder Carl Gumsley, said Cochrane, who has previous convictions, had . shown no remorse for his horrific abuse of a child. Protecting the public: Dean Cochrane was sentenced at Teesside Crown Court to be held indefinitely . Judge Gumsley said: 'You have what must be regarded as a troubling record of previous offences. 'There is an emerging pattern of violence and bullying. You pose a significant risk - a very real risk - of substantial harm to members of the public, by committing serious personal injury to them. 'The only way the public's safety can be ensured as best as it can be is by the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for public protection.' The judge described the child's injuries . as 'truly appalling' and said no one would ever know how, when or why . they were inflicted. Police welcomed the verdict and said the child had recovered quickly and seemed to be coping well. Detective Constable Rebecca Lisle said: 'The injuries the child sustained were horrific and sickened even the most experienced child protection officers. 'Cochrane refused to admit his guilt. He has tried to blame others for the crimes he committed in an attempt to evade justice. His attempts failed.' During the case, the court heard that Cochrane's had a history of violence which included attacks on friends, neighbours and a former girlfriend. He was convicted of affray and battery in 2007 and was on bail for abusing the child when he committed a string of offences of violence and disorder. In March last year, he was given a suspended prison sentence for smashing the windows of a house belonging to a man with whom he had a dispute. Last July, Cochrane was armed with a baseball bat - police initially thought it was a sword - when he was involved in a fight close to his home. Three months later, he threatened to torch the property of a friend if he told the police about him stealing a TV from his home, the court heard. Cochrane, was also convicted of common assault against a former partner who he threw a bottle at during a row. Peter Sabiston, for Cochrane, said his client must have suffered a loss of self-control, and accepted the court would be disturbed by what he called 'a hideous offence'.",Dean Cochrane tried to hide the girl's injuries with ink and talcum powder .

Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne has shocked Twitter followers by offering £50,000 to anyone who could identify - and break the arms of - a sinister tweeter who threatened to harm his daughter. The self-made millionaire became embroiled in a row yesterday afternoon after receiving a string of anonymous threats via the micro-blogging service. The messages threatened to 'bring hurt and pain' to his family unless he handed over £35,000. Reward: Duncan Bennatyne sent out this message to his 372,000 followers . And although Mr Bannatyne later withdrew his threat, the entrepreneur said 'I'd gladly do my time' to get revenge on the anonymous tweeter. The TV star received a series of tweets from someone calling himself Yuri Vasilyev, linking to a message threatening to harm Hollie Bannatyne, 25. He responded by posting: 'I offer £25,000 reward for the capture of the coward who calls himself @YuriVasilyev_ Double if his arms are broken first'. Although this tweet was soon deleted, Mr Bannatyne posted another message saying: 'OK £30,000 reward for info leading to his arrest'. The drama began yesterday, when he . received a message from the Twitter account @YuriVasilyev_ which linked . to a message about Holly. It read: 'Dear Dragon. My name is . Yuri Vasilyev and I'm looking for a £35,000 investment to stop us . hurting your Hollie Bannatyne. We will bring hurt and pain into your . life. 'We are watching her. She is very attractive. Want photos? Tweet using the hashtag £4money to confirm payment will be made.' Threatened: Duncan Bannatyne received sinister messages threatening his daughter Hollie, right . A . later message said: 'Duncan Bannatyne - Hollie is going to get hurt. We . will bring pain and fear. You should have expected us. We are the men . of Belarus. 'We do not give up. We will stand . tall. You should have paid. £35,000 to stop it. Contact us to pay. We . are watching. Expect us. We are the men of Belarus.' Despite Vasilyev's claim to be from Belarus, Mr Bannatyne has said that he believes him to be in Moscow. His latest message to Vasilyev reads: 'Go home to your mum and cry we are closing in on you little boy'. That message was also later deleted. Mr Bannatyne's threats have met a mixed reaction from Twitter users. Many have helped to try to locate Vasilyev, although this is unlikely to be successful without tracking him down electronically, as 'Yuri Vasilyev' is a common name in Russian-speaking countries. But one user, speculating that Vasilyev was using a fake name, told Mr Bannatyne: 'Whoever the real Yuri Vasileyev is I hope hijacking his identity & ur call to vigilantes doesnt end in his injury or death.' [sic] . Mr Bannatyne said in a statement: 'My family is well protected, but I take any threat to them very seriously and will do all I can to ensure the person or people involved are caught.' Last night, police issued a statement saying: 'Durham Constabulary can confirm Duncan Bannatyne has reported a number of threatening messages he had received via email and Twitter in which threats were made against a member of his family. 'These appeared to originate from an email address based in Russia. 'We have been liaising since then with Mr Bannatyne and conducting enquiries into the credibility of these threats.'

Unfortunate end: Joseph Lacher, left, of Allstate, was fired after reportedly telling agents in a bar that his boss Thomas J.

He was having drinks at a Ritz-Carlton hotel bar in Orlando, Florida, with some of Allstate’s top-selling agents at a company event.

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Last updated at 12:24 AM on 31st July 2011 . The father of a brother and sister killed in a deliberate fire at their flat has died in hospital, police said last night. Eight-year-old Bridget Sharkey and her brother Thomas, 21, died after the blaze at their home in the early hours of last Sunday. Their parents, Thomas Sharkey, 55, and Angela, 46, suffered serious burns and were taken to hospital. Thomas Sharkey, 55, has passed away after he and his wife Angela, 46, suffered serious burns following a blaze at their family home last weekend . Police, who have launched a murder investigation involving 50 officers, confirmed that Mr Sharkey died in hospital yesterday morning. The fire broke out in the living room of the family’s home in Helensburgh, Argyll and Bute, and quickly spread, trapping them. Mr Sharkey had been seen hanging out of the window shouting for help. His son was found dead at the scene and the rest of the family were taken to hospital where Bridget died a short time later. The rest of the family were taken by ambulance to Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, Renfrewshire where Bridget died a short time later. Thomas Sharkey, 55, and Angela, 46, suffered serious burns and smoke inhalation. Mr Sharkey was told of his children's deaths on Tuesday although Angela remains sedated. Fifty officers are involved in the investigation and yesterday, police set up an email address for information in a bid to catch the killers. Tragedy: Thomas Sharkey, 21, and his eight-year-old sister Bridget, who were killed in a house fire in Helensburgh, near Glasgow. Police have now launched a murder investigation . Earlier this week Valerie McFadyen, Mr Sharkey's sister, read a statement on behalf of the family. Speaking . at the town's police station, she said: 'The entire family have been . left shattered, devastated and now angry by the deaths of our darling . Bridget and Thomas. 'Golf . was Thomas's life and all his family and friends aspired to be as good . as he was. His smile lit up every room and he always found the best in . everyone he met. 'We always thought he would be famous for his golf and not for the tragic way he died.' Prior to Mr Sharkey's death Chief Inspector Fergus Byrne said: 'They will have to wake up and learn this dreadful news. My thoughts are very much with the family at this very difficult time. 'It's an absolutely dreadful and tragic event. Right now there is no clear motivation. We are looking at all aspects of the background of the people concerned to see if there is a motive there that perhaps could shed some light and point us to the people responsible. 'We have spoken to the wider family. They are aware of these dreadful circumstances and obviously that will be part of our ongoing inquiry.' Eight-year-old Bridget is . believed to have died after coming home from a planned sleepover because . she missed her parents. The heat of the blaze caused a . downstairs window to explode and left an area of severe scorching around . the front door of the property in Scott Court. Thomas was in the . country after returning from the U.S. where he has a Golfing . Scholarship at Georgia Southern University. Tragic: Police and fire crews at the scene of the fire in Helensburgh, near Glasgow where Thomas Sharkey died . Parish . priest Father Peter Lennon, of St Joseph's Church in Helensburgh, said: . 'It is dreadful. The wee girl was an absolute gem, the boy I didn't . know as well because he was in America on this scholarship. 'She made her first Communion in May. She was like the other girls, when they were out playing she always had good fun. 'I didn't know the parents very well, but they came to church and were a good family. 'I have spoken to their relatives. They are just shocked.' Father Lennon said he told his congregation yesterday morning. He said: 'There was a deadly silence when I announced it. Most of them knew there had been a fire and most of them knew who had been involved, but to hear of the deaths was devastating. There was just silence.' Thomas Sharkey won a golf scholarship . to Georgia Southern University in the U.S. after leaving Our . Lady and Saint Patrick's High in Dumbarton in 2008. In his biography on the Georgia . Southern Eagles website, he described himself as 'ambitious and . competitive', adding that his grandfather and father were the biggest . influence on his athletics career for teaching him golf. Thomas Sharkey was 'hard-working and conscientious' while his sister was 'beautiful, talented and enthusiastic', their headteacher said today. Closed off: the police seal off the area near the fatal flat fire which killed a 21-year-old man and his sister, eight and their father . Ann Chalmers, headteacher St Joseph's . primary school in Helensburgh, where both siblings were pupils, said: . 'We are absolutely devastated and saddened to hear Bridget and Thomas . have died. Bridget was ready to start primary five in August. Bridget . was a beautiful child, very talented, an excellent all-rounder and . enthusiastic pupil who was a lovely singer, dancer and artist. 'Bridget was a very happy and popular girl. She will be sorely missed by all at St Joseph's primary. 'Thomas also attended St Joseph's for primary schooling. He was a great pupil, was very hardworking and conscientious. 'It . is so tragic to lose two fine young people who had everything to live . for. Our thoughts and prayers are very much with them and their families . and friends.' Strathclyde Police Area Commander, Chief Inspector Fergus Byrne, said a murder investigation had been launched. 'Extensive inquiries have been . ongoing all day at the scene, including a full crime scene forensic . investigation by forensic scientists, fire service and Strathclyde . Police,' he said. 'This investigation is continuing, . however, we believe that this fire was started intentionally and the . deaths are now being treated as murder.' Forensic investigation: A police officer stands guard near the property where the family died . Police said that post-mortem . examinations will be carried out in due course to establish the exact . cause of death but that the deaths are being treated as murder. The officer in charge of the . investigation, Detective Chief Inspector Anne McKerchar said: 'This is a . tragic event made worse by the fact that it was a deliberate act.'

"Producer says the pair would only use them when the car park's owner gave permission . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:34 PM on 2nd August 2011 . The executive producer of Top Gear has apologised after the show's presenters got into hot water again with viewers - and this time for parking in disabled bays. On Sunday night's episode Jeremy Clarkson and James May tried out electric cars by driving them . to Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, where they pulled into a car park to . discuss the merits of the motors. But instead of using standard parking spaces, the road hogs parked in spaces for disabled bays. Scandal: Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson and James May have driven into trouble yet again for parking in disabled bays during filming of the hit show . During the slot about electric cars, . Jeremy Clarkson - driving a £31,000 Nissan Leaf - and James May - . driving a £33,000 Peugeot iOn - discussed the merits of non-petrol cars, . asking 'should you buy an electric car?' After . parking up in the disabled bays the pair laughed and joked about the . costs of the cars and the electric motors - which are capable of a top . speed of up to 90mph. They also . joked about the luggage space and how electric cars had to be fitted . with special windscreen wipers which make barely any noise. But it was only when they started to walk away did shocked viewers realised where the pair were parked. Andy Wilman responded to complaints by penning an explanation on the show's blog. He said the programme makers had permission to use the bays for 'a quiet spot to film in' and there were three other unused bays available all the time. He pleaded with disgruntled viewers to vent their fury at producers, rather than the presenters who are renowned for making controversial remarks and pulling stunts. Typical: Rather than parking in normal parking bays, Jeremy Clarkson and James May parked in spaces reserved for disabled people, sparking outrage among disability groups . 'For those who are cross with us, please direct your anger towards myself and the production team, rather than at Jeremy and James,' he wrote. 'Both presenters expressed deep concern to the film crew and me about using the disabled bays prior to filming, because of the disrespectful impression it would convey. 'They only capitulated when we assured them the parking had been approved by the owner, and that the disabled bay markings would not appear on television. 'This was our fault, not theirs, and we unreservedly apologise to all the viewers we have upset as a consequence.' It was the latest in a string of apologies the BBC have had to issue over the programme. Controversial: It is just eight months since the team sparked a diplomatic incident by poking fun at Mexicans . Earlier this year, the BBC apologised to the Mexican ambassador over remarks made by Clarkson, May and co-host Richard Hammond. In the episode, broadcast on January 30, Hammond joked that Mexican cars reflected national characteristics, saying they were 'just going to be lazy, feckless, flatulent oaf with a moustache, leaning against a fence asleep, looking at a cactus with a blanket with a hole in the middle on as a coat'. May described Mexican food as 'like sick with cheese on it' and Clarkson predicted they would not get any complaints about the show because 'at the Mexican embassy, the ambassador is going to be sitting there with a remote control like this (snores). They won't complain, it's fine'.","Producer says the pair would only use them when the car park's owner gave permission .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 2:54 AM on 3rd August 2011 . A damning dossier has shown how bungling officials failed to capture Jaycee Lee Dugard’s abductors while she was in captivity for almost 20 years. Phillip Garrido, who raped the girl and fathered two children with her, was jailed for 431 years while his wife Nancy Garrido was sentenced to 36 years in prison for the abduction of Jaycee in 1991. But it took authorities almost 20 years to rescue her after she was abducted in South Lake Tahoe, California, and a report from El Dorado County prosecutors shows the incredible mistakes made. Blundering officials: Phillip Garrido, left, was jailed for 431 years while his wife Nancy Garrido, right, was sentenced to 36 years in prison for the abduction of Jaycee Lee Dugard in California in 1991 . Innocence removed: Jaycee Lee Dugard was captured aged 11 in California and held for 18 years . It labels one federal parole agent ‘utterly incompetent’ and looks at how various signs showed Phillip Garrido should have been locked up again in jail while on parole after an earlier rape and kidnap: . One of the most disturbing revelations comes in the videos released, showing one of the 20 times when young girls were lured into the back of his van while his wife got them to stretch and bend over. El Dorado District Attorney Vern . Pierson released the videos with a 162-page report on Tuesday. ‘Law . enforcement failed to see Phillip Garrido for what and who he truly is - . evil,’ he said. One video . from 1993 shows Nancy Garrido luring a young girl into the van and . asking her to do the splits. It begins with the criminal asking the . girl: ‘That's it. Can you go all the way down?’ Tears: Jaycee Lee Dugard spoke on ABC about the horrific time she endured at the Garrido couple's house . The girl says she can go down further - and Nancy Garrido encourages her, saying: ‘Let me see, I bet you can go down really easy’. But the girl notices a light on a camera that is filming her. Nancy Garrido replies that she does not . know anything about the camera. In one interrogation video, she told a . detective she made 10 to 20 of these videos for her husband. Phillip Garrido was sentenced to 431 . years to life in prison earlier this year and Nancy Garrido was . sentenced to 36 years to life. Jaycee was abducted aged 11 and held . until she was 29. Jaycee . was reunited with her family in August 2009 after her whereabouts were . discovered during a meeting with a parole agent who had summoned Phillip . Garrido to his office. Horrific: One video from 1993 shows Nancy Garrido luring a young girl into the van and asking her to do the splits. It begins with the criminal asking the girl: 'That's it. Can you go all the way down?' Shocking revelations: In one interrogation video, Nancy Garrido told a detective she made 10 to 20 of videos of young girls performing actions such as the splits for her husband . The . meeting came after two University of California, Berkeley, police . employees grew suspicious when Phillip Garrido showed up at the campus . with the two girls he fathered with Jaycee. ‘Law enforcement . failed to see Phillip Garrido for what and who he truly is - evil'El Dorado District Attorney Vern Pierson . The report also looks at when Phillip . Garrido visited victim Katie Callaway-Hall, following his early release . from a 50-year sentence for her rape and kidnap in 1976, reported the . Sacramento Bee. He . approached her at a casino where she worked in 1988 and it was a . ‘colossal blunder’ for agents not to take the woman’s complaint about . the incident seriously, the report said. ‘The . criminal justice system failed Jaycee Lee Dugard, it failed Katie . Callaway-Hall, and assuredly failed many of the other countless unknown . victims of Phillip Garrido,’ the report said. Mr Pierson wrote: ‘The failure and . inadequacies of the psychiatric profession were highlighted by Phillip . Garrido and his manipulation of them to his advantage.' Crime scene: The home of Phillip Garrido, where he held Dugard for 18 years, is seen in Antioch, California . After David Garrido captured Dugard in 1991, Mr Pierson said federal and state parole agents failed to investigate his history of sexual crimes and instead relied on reports from psychiatrists. This led to agents missing numerous warning signs over dozens of visits, allowing David Garrido to continue holding Dugard and seeking other victims. ‘Had the federal parole agents searched the Garrido residence they would have found her,’ the report states. The report says Garrido's federal parole agent only visited his home once between May 1991 and May 1995 - in addition to the dozens of incidents in which David Garrido should have had his parole revoked. Mr Pierson said he hoped his report would begin a process of exploring potential legislative solutions that will help law enforcement do a better job of supervising and detecting sexual predators.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:40 PM on 2nd August 2011 . The eurozone faced fresh financial fears today as Spain and Italy edged closer to the spiralling abyss of debt engulfing  the region. The two countries have both been crippled by painfully slow economic growth but so far managed to avoid the kind of handouts given to Ireland and Greece. But the stock indexes in the two countries plummeted today while the yields on  their bonds  soared to record highs, sparking a risk of them defaulting. Concerns: Spain's Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has cancelled his holiday to monitor the economic problems . The yield for the Spanish 10-year bond rose as far as 6.45 percent, the highest since the euro was created. The rate is near the levels seen in Greece, Ireland and Portugal before they were forced to ask for rescue loans, and prompted Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero to delay his vacation to monitor the situation. Italy's equivalent bond yield jumped to 6.18 per cent, above where it was before July 21, when the EU announced its latest debt crisis plan, including a second Greek bailout, to calm and contain market jitters. Spain's main stock index was down 1.3 percent in late afternoon trading after plunging 3.2 per cent a day earlier, while Italy's fell another 1.4 per cent. On the defensive: Italian Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti . The heightened market pressure bodes ill for Italy and Spain, the eurozone's third- and fourth-largest economies, which are both too expensive to rescue for Europe's bailout fund. The turmoil is due to a toxic mix of market concerns about growth, not only in Europe but also the U.S., and the possibility that the debt crisis will continue spreading. Over the past two weeks, markets have been roiled by worries that the U.S. economy may be sliding back toward recession and have its credit rating cut. In times of trouble, investors' knee-jerk reaction is to sell what they perceive as high-risk assets and buy into safer ones. That was evident by the fall in the yield for German bonds, which investors bought up as they sold so-called peripheral ones, those of countries with poor government finances. 'There is increasing uncertainty in the market and all the peripheral markets, the ones which have weaker political contexts, will continue to suffer,' said Luca Peviania, managing director of P&G, a Rome-based asset managment company. The rising borrowing rates sent shockwaves rippling through the two nations' political leadership. Italian Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti called an emergency meeting in Rome to analyze the situation and arranged to meet Jean-Claude Juncker, the chairman of the Eurogroup meetings of eurozone nations, on Wednesday. Tumble: The Madrid Stock Exchange starts the day at around 990 points but by 5pm it has fallen to below 930 . Zapatero, meanwhile, delayed his vacation so he could 'follow more closely the evolution of economic indicators,' his administration said in a statement. The move came just four days after he called early general elections for November - largely due to pressure on his administration from the financial crisis and because he wants a new government to manage the troubled Spanish economy for all of next year instead of part of it. EU officials sought to downplay the . danger of Spain and Italy edging closer toward needing a bailout, but . the European Commission said it was monitoring the situation closely. 'We . are very confident in both the Spanish and Italian authorities' determination to get their economies back on track,' said Chantal . Hughes, a spokeswoman for the EU's executive. Deal: U.S. President Barack Obama reached an agreement on the country's debt but still faces economic problems . She said that in the Commission's view, 'there is no factual evidence (about the two countries' economies) that has changed in the last few days.' 'The question of a rescue plan (for Spain) is not on the table, it hasn't been discussed,' Hughes said. Eurozone leaders agreed on July 21 to a second, 109 billion euros bailout for Greece and overhauled their rescue fund in hopes of keeping market turmoil from spreading to Spain and Italy. But the deal gave only a temporary lift to Spanish and Italian bonds. Just days later, global markets were rocked by the possibility that the U.S. may default on its debt by not raising its borrowing ceiling. It managed to clinch a deal just in time, but investor sentiment was shaken profoundly. At the same time, U.S. indicators showed its economy was slowing sharply. The combination caused traders to move their cash into the safest investments - such as German bonds, Swiss accounts, and gold. Euro collapse: Greece was forced to accept a second EU bailout last month after facing mounting debt . In that context, confidence in the EU crisis plan's ability to protect Spain and Italy from the market turmoil dropped rapidly. That is partly because the deal included asking bondholders to take losses on the value of their holdings by swapping them for longer-dated bonds with lower interest. Losses for private investors - a first in the 21-month debt crisis - has underlined the risks to banks, insurance companies and others who hold eurozone debt. Elevated yields show the additional interest investors demand to hold the country's debt, and underline how their financing costs could rise when they need to tap bond markets again. As fears of default increase, interest rates rise and make paying debt even harder in a vicious circle. Spain is struggling to recover from nearly two years of recession triggered in large part by the collapse of an overheated real estate sector. Burdened by a swollen deficit, the country's jobless rate stands at a eurozone high of nearly 21 per cent. Italy has debt of 120 per cent of economic output, but had been viewed for months with calm by bond markets. The country has low levels of private debt and has not had the real estate boom and bust that caused trouble for the United States, Spain, and Ireland. But it suffers from chronically low growth and investors doubt the government's willingness and ability to push through painful economic reforms.","Government borrowing costs in Italy and Spain soar to record highs .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:36 PM on 3rd August 2011 . Jack Tweed arriving at Redbridge Magistrates' Court today, where he admitted assault . The widower of reality TV star Jade Goody today admitted assaulting a man outside a nightclub. Jack Tweed, 24, pleaded guilty to common assault as his trial was due to begin at Redbridge Magistrates' Court this morning. Tweed, who married Big Brother star Goody shortly before she lost a battle against cervical cancer in March 2009, was involved in a brawl outside Deuces Bar and Lounge in Chigwell, Essex, in which a 21-year-old builder was knocked unconscious. The court heard that Tweed, of Buckhurst Hill, Essex, punched Tom Grantham in the head on January 3 this year. Tweed appeared alongside his brother, Lewis Tweed, 21, of, Buckhurst Hill, who also admitted common assault. Prosecutor Alex Matic said police were called by CCTV operators who saw the fight take place. He said officers found Lewis Tweed at the scene but his brother had left. He attended a police station two days later. 'It appears to be drink-fuelled,' Mr Matic said. Describing the CCTV footage, Mr Matic said Mr Grantham is seen walking backwards and exchanging words with the Tweeds. He added: 'Jack Tweed runs round the back of the claimant and swings a punch which connects with his head. 'The claimant staggers backwards for a short while then he falls to the ground.' Jack Tweed and his brother Lewis (right) at court today. Magistrates were told the brawl at a club in Chigwell appeared to be 'drink-fuelled' Mr Matic said that Jack Tweed attempted to kick Mr Grantham, adding: 'Lewis Tweed is seen to kick the victim in the groin whilst he is on the ground, also he punches the victim in the face.' Mr Matic said Mr Grantham appeared to be unconscious for a short time. The CCTV showed Jack Tweed arriving at the bar at 2.37am - only a minute before the fight broke out. When police arrived, they arrested Lewis Tweed, who said: 'What can I say, I was in a fight,' Mr Matic told the court. He added: 'Lewis Tweed was conveyed into custody and he was interviewed. 'He said that he was provoked by the claimant and said that the claimant was calling his brother names. 'He did punch him in the face but could not remember how hard. He did not believe it to be hard. 'He was drunk and he was sorry and he wished he had walked away.' Mr Matic said Jack Tweed gave a 'no comment interview' when he attended a police station. Mark . Wright, who appears in The Only Way Is Essex, arrives at court. He is . accused of threatening behaviour towards the builder Jack Tweed has . admitted assaulting . The pair appeared in court alongside The Only Way Is Essex personality Mark Wright, who is accused of using threatening behaviour towards Mr Grantham. Mitigating on behalf of Jack Tweed, Ronald Jaffa said he and Wright had invested a 'substantial amount of money' in a refurbishment project at Deuces Bar. Shortly before the bar was to reopen in October last year, it suffered a 'fire bomb' attack and was 'completely destroyed' inside, Mr Jaffa said. It later reopened and on December 31 last year, four days before the incident, the bar suffered another arson attack. Mr Jaffa said that on the night in question, Jack Tweed arrived at the bar, where revellers can enter free of charge but have to pay up to £1,000 for a table, after it had closed to see a friend who lived nearby. He saw an argument taking place outside. Mr Jaffa said: 'He heard Tom, or someone with him, say they are going to petrol-bomb the bar. 'He took it seriously because of what had happened. 'This person was making threats, saying he was going to beat Jack up. 'As you well know, Jack is known in the Press, and people do, from time to time, say things (to him) that are not complimentary and often it is water off a duck's back. Jack Tweed married reality TV star Jade Goody shortly before she lost her battle with cervical cancer in March 2009 . 'But this time, Tom raised his arms to Mark Wright so what Jack did was to hit him and then he tried to kick him.' He added: 'Considering it in the cold light of day, he does not think he should have done it.' Tweed vowed after the death of Goody . that he was going to grow up, stay out of trouble and 'be the man that . Jade wanted me to be'. But within weeks, tales of drunken nights with a series of young women emerged in the national press. In September 2009 he was accused of raping a 19-year-old student but was cleared in April 2010. He has been jailed twice in the past, . once for drunkenly attacking a taxi driver after a night out in Epping, . Essex, in May 2008, and once for an attack on a 16-year-old boy who he . hit with a golf club in Ongar, Essex, in December 2006. He was on curfew after his release . from prison when he married Goody in February 2009. The terms of the . curfew were relaxed to enable the couple to spend their wedding night . together. Tweed was born on June 9, 1987 in . Waltham Forest and first came to national public attention when he and . Goody appeared on 2007's Celebrity Big Brother. Mitigating on behalf of Lewis Tweed, Daniel Chadwick said his client acted after 'serious provocation'. He said: 'This was a sorry end to what would have been a very pleasant evening.' Mr Chadwick said Lewis Tweed, who has ambitions to become a professional golfer, had been out with friends at another bar, Mojo's, before going to Deuces. He said Lewis and his friends got a cab between the venues and Mr Grantham tried to get into the vehicle. 'Several people did not want him, but Lewis Tweed invited him in,' said Mr Chadwick. 'The claimant Tom Graham threatened several times to beat up Jack. These threats were made in the presence of, and directly to, Lewis Tweed. 'Lewis Tweed genuinely though his brother was going to be the subject of an attack. 'It was for this reason that the argument outside Deuces bar occurred.' Mr Chadwick said Lewis Tweed had told Wright what Mr Grantham had said, adding: 'The argument was about whether or not he should come in the bar or go home.' He said Wright had tried to walk away but Mr Grantham had threatened to smash the windows of the bar. Lewis Tweed was 'itching' for the row to be over and only got involved after threats were made about the bar, given its recent history, he said. Lewis Tweed admitted kicking Mr Grantham once in the leg and once in the jaw. Mr Chadwick added: 'It is a rather feeble kick, it is a rather girly kick and it is a feeble punch.' Magistrates told the brothers they would be sentenced on August 16 after pre-sentence reports were conducted. They were both released on unconditional bail. Wright's trial will begin this afternoon.",Tweed was involved in a brawl which saw a builder knocked unconscious .
"By . Hugo Duncan . Last updated at 12:57 AM on 4th August 2011 . A massive £35billion was wiped off the value of Britain’s biggest companies yesterday as the global economy sunk deeper into crisis. Stock markets around the world fell as the debt storm in America blew back across the Atlantic to Europe and threatened to engulf Italy and Spain. Panicked investors were also rattled by signs of a severe slowdown in the United States, the world’s biggest economy, as it edged closer to a double-dip recession. 'Bumpy ride': The FTSE sank to it's lowest point this year with a 132 point drop . In New York, the Dow Jones index of American stocks recovered only slightly after falling for eight straight days. The loss of confidence on financial . markets threatens to destroy momentum in the world economy and send . unemployment soaring. A renewed global slump would be devastating for . Britain and could tip the economy back into recession. The . number of Britons who will never find work has risen by as much as half . a million as a result of damage done during the recession, leading . economists say. Even when the economy has recovered around two million will still be jobless. Research . by the Institute of Economic and Social Research and the International . Monetary Fund said unemployment has fallen in recently but is still at . 7.7 per cent, or 2.45million. The NIESR expects it to peak at 8.3 per . cent next year. It . estimated that so-called structural unemployment, which remains after . the economy recovers, has risen from 5.2 per cent before the crisis to . 6.2 per cent today. That . means the number of  permanently unemployed has increased from . 1.66million to 1.98million. The IMF puts the figure at 2.18 million. In . its last forecast in May it predicted growth of 1.4% but it said today . that weaker spending will 'hinder any meaningful recovery' this year. NIESR today repeated its call for 'a modest loosening in fiscal policy' to improve prospects for output and employment. The FTSE 100 index tumbled 133.88 . points to 5584.51– slashing the value of Britain’s blue chip companies . by £35billion. It is the worst fall for nine months. London’s index of leading shares has . lost £75billion of value in the past four days and is down more than 500 . points, or £135billion, since its 2011 high in February. Louise Cooper, an analyst at broker . BGC Partners in London, said: ‘Everybody is phenomenally nervous. There . is a lot of fear out there.’ The carnage in London was mirrored in . Europe where the debt crisis sweeping the single currency bloc pushed . Italy and Spain closer to the brink. More than £1.2trillion has been . erased from the value of global shares in the past week amid concern the . economic recovery is faltering. Falls of this magnitude affect . millions of families as well as investors because workers’ pension funds . are tied up in the stock market. David Jones, chief market strategist . at IG Index, said: ‘It has been an ugly day for shares. It is the now . familiar double-whammy of sovereign debt and a stumbling recovery that . has smashed sentiment once again. ‘It really is bounce or bust time for . markets at the moment, but it is difficult to see what the positive . news could be that pulls stock markets back from the brink.’ A succession of crises has battered . the global economy in recent months, from violent uprisings in the . Middle East, to the earthquake, tsunami and subsequent threat of nuclear . meltdown in Japan. The Eurozone debt crisis that flattened Greece, Portugal and Ireland hurtled across the Atlantic to America. The U.S. was only saved from an . unprecedented default by 11th-hour deal to raise the $14.3trillion debt . ceiling on Tuesday night. With political leaders heading away . for their summer holidays, analysts warned the global economy faces its . biggest crisis since the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers in . 2008. Spooked investors: Obama's deal on the U.S. debt ceiling has done nothing to instil confidence in the markets . Simon Derrick, chief currency . strategist at BNY Mellon Global Markets in London, said: ‘It feels as if . the past few days have seen global markets reach a tipping point.’ It came as the White House insisted . the U.S. is not in danger of a double-dip recession even though the . services sector – which employs nearly 90 per cent of U.S. workers – had . its worst month for 17 months. Barack Obama held an emergency . cabinet meeting last night to discuss the economy. The President also . admitted that wrangling over the country’s debts has caused unnecessary . damage. Italian Prime Minister Silvio . Berlusconi, 74, last night tried to calm jitters that Italy was heading . into the financial abyss, insisting the economy was ‘solid’. European leaders  defended the single . currency bloc amid fears that Italy and Spain will follow Greece, . Ireland and Portugal towards collapse. European Commission president Jose . Manuel Barros said the treatment of Spain and Italy was ‘a cause of deep . concern’ and blamed the financial markets for the crisis – rather than . towering debts across the Eurozone. Fading fortunes: The FTSE 100 looked like it was set for a summer of gains but is now heading for its lowest point in five months . With . more eurozone economies apparently set to follow Greece, Portugal and . Ireland on the road to debt crisis, we ask how the euro is managing hold . its own against the pound? Still strong: Despite the financial turmoil in the Eurozone the currency itself is holding up well . What is happening with the pound versus the euro?The . pound is currently worth 1.147euros, down from this year’s high of . 1.202euros, but above this year's low of 1.107euros. The pound was last . worth 1.30euros in early 2008. Why is the euro so strong?The . euro isn’t so much strong – it is just not as weak as the pound. The . severity of the UK recession – compared to France and Germany - combined . with the shock remedies of record low interest rates and quantitative . easing, all served to weaken the pound against both the dollar and the . euro from 2008 onwards. The dollar has recently been kept weak by the US . debt crisis and the threat from the Federal Reserve of more . quantitative easing. Why do low rates and QE weaken a currency?Higher . UK interest rates mean higher returns on assets that international . investors hold in the UK, so more money will flow into the country and . more sterling will be bought on the global currency markets. Quantitative easing, by flooding the economy with more money and . increasing the supply of sterling, devalues the price of that currency . in terms of rival currencies. But why has the euro-zone crisis not swung things back in sterling’s favour?With . Chancellor George Osborne unswerving in his commitment to cutting the . UK budget deficit, you might think that the worsening problems in . several euro-zone economies would mean the pound should be in favour . over the euro. But two . things have worked against that. One, the commitment of the stronger . euro zone economies like France and Germany to propping up the single . currency and the ailing second-tier economies has shored up confidence . in the euro. More . importantly, the European Central Bank has raised interest rates twice . this year to 1.5 per cent, while the Bank of England has kept rates at a . rock-bottom 0.5 per cent: this has opened up an interest rate gap . between the UK and the continent, which means investors’ money is more . likely to drift into euros. And the prospects for the rest of the year?More . of the same: the ECB has warned it is likely to raise rates again, . while the outlook for UK rates is that they will not go up until next . year. If the euro, dollar and pound are all weak – who is strong?The . Swiss franc has been the big beneficiary as a safe haven from the . turmoil in the US and Europe recently. And over the last year or so the . Canadian and Australian dollars have done well.","Index drops by 132 points to 5,585.74 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:28 AM on 3rd August 2011 . An autopsy conducted on 11-year-old Celina Cass was unable to determine how she died, authorities said yesterday. Divers found Celina Cass's body Monday . morning near a hydroelectric dam that spans the Connecticut River . between her home town of Stewartstown, New Hampshire, and Canaan, . Vermont. Celina's death has been deemed suspicious, based on what divers found, and investigators were treating the case as a criminal investigation. Celina, who lived with her older sister, mother and stepfather a mile from Canada, was last seen at her home computer around 9 pm on July 25 and was gone the next morning. Police said there was no sign of a struggle and there was no indication she ran away or someone took her. Community residents were saddened that the autopsy wasn't able to provide them with any closure. 'I don't even know what to say. 'I thought the community needed some answers, and I thought we were going to get them tonight,' said Debbie Whelan, whose daughter, a friend of Celina's, was sobbing after watching a news report on a TV monitor. The lack of answers was 'scary,' said Shannon Towle, who owns a convenience store across the street from the house where Celina lived with her mother, sister, stepfather and a man named Kevin Mullaney, said by neighbors to be the son of a former boyfriend of her mother, Louisa Noyes. 'We still don't know what happened, and that's terrifying,' Towle said. Search: Investigators search near the dam where the body of Celina Cass was found on Tuesday . Grim: Divers recovered Cass' body from the Connecticut River on Monday a quarter-mile from her home . After the news conference, teenagers gathered in a town park, where candles were lit in Celina's memory. 'Someone has to light the way for Celina,' said Kayla Baglio, 18. 'It's to let her know no matter what, people are going to be here for her.' Earlier Tuesday, investigators combed the area along the river, which divides Vermont and New Hampshire, above where Celina's body was found. A crime scene technician said they were doing computer-aided diagramming to give them a precise electronic image of the area. At the peak of the search for Celina, more than 100 federal, state . and local law enforcement officers descended upon the town of 800 . residents, searching a mile-wide area around her home, including woods . and ponds. Because . of the town's remote location, law enforcement officers went so far as . to have a cellphone tower erected to assist in communications.

Troubled past: Celina Cass's stepfather, Wendell Noyes, was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2003 and was hospitalised earlier today . On Monday, the intense search came to an abrupt end when New Hampshire Fish and Game Department divers found her body near a hydroelectric dam that spans the Connecticut River between Stewartstown and Canaan. Investigators on Tuesday combed the area along the river, which divides Vermont and New Hampshire, above where Celina's body was found. A crime scene technician said they were doing computer-aided diagramming to give them a precise electronic image of the area. Celina's stepfather, Wendell Noyes, who reportedly was hospitalized hours before her body was recovered from the river, returned to the community Tuesday. Witnesses said Noyes was taken away by ambulance Monday after lying down with his face in his arms outside a home where he had been staying in Stewartstown. Hospital officials declined to say whether he was a patient. Shannon Towle, owner of Towle's Mini-Mart, said she sold him cigarettes Tuesday morning. In the first days after Celina disappeared, Noyes had described her as a quiet girl who would not have left home on her own, but he had declined to comment further. Devastated: New Hampshire State Police officers watch as a woman identified as Celina Cass's mother, under a blanket, is escorted from the family home on Wednesday . Residents considered cancelling their . annual children's fair in light of the fifth-grader's death but instead . decided to go forward with the weekend event and to dedicate it to her . memory. 'It's still a scary place for our . children,' Patricia Grover, who's on the organising committee for . Stewartstown Days said. He added: 'They need something . that's on a little happier note for them.' Location: Celina Cass' body has been found at a dam less than a mile from her home in Stewartstown, New Hampshire . 'Whatever it takes': A New Hampshire State Police Trooper puts crime scene tape around the family home of Celina Cass in the town of Stewartstown on Wednesday after her disappearance . After her body was discovered, . several of the 11-year-old's relatives could be seen at her home crying . and roads were blocked off with reporters also asked to leave. Meanwhile, Celina's stepfather was . hospitalised after he was said to have taken a 'funny turn' on the . driveway of the family home earlier today after talking to reporters. Wendell .

Ryan O'Neal's troubled son Redmond has been arrested and denied bail after police allegedly found a stash of heroin in his car. Police say 26-year-old Redmond, the son of the late Farrah Fawcett, was pulled over in Santa Monica yesterday morning after he ran a red light. He is currently being held in custody on no bail, but is yet to be charged, website RadarOnline.com reports. Arrested: Ryan O'Neal's son Redmond looks stern in his mug shot taken after being arrested for drug offences . Officers are said to have found a quantity of heroin in his car when they inspected his vehicle. A police spokesman told the website: 'At approximately 8.45am a motor officer observed an argument at a store on Lincoln corner of Michigan. 'O'Neal was one of those involved in the argument. No bail: The 26-year-old has not been granted bail after police found heroin in his car . 'The officer then watched as he got into his vehicle. He proceeded to go north bound on Lincoln before turning west bound on Olympic, it was at this time the officer observed him going through the red turn arrow.' The spokesman added that the officer stopped Redmond for the traffic violation before discovering the narcotics. His arrest came just hours before his half-brother Griffin O'Neal was hospitalised after a car accident. The 46-year-old was driving in Escondido, San Diego County when he collided with another vehicle. He was taken to a nearby hospitalised, but later discharged.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:15 PM on 3rd August 2011 . Resigned: Luke March has quit as the Compliance Officer at Ipsa after his controversial comments over keeping expenses investigations secret . The chief of the Commons expenses watchdog has quit just over a week after he was roundly criticised for refusing to name MPs being investigated for dubious claims. Luke March has resigned as the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority's (Ipsa) compliance officer with immediate effect. The move followed an interview last week in which Mr March argued that details of his probes should remain secret. He said it would be 'unfair' to identify MPs before allegations were proved, and suggested there should be no publicity at all if they were cleared. Mr March appeared to be contradicting transparency guidelines set by Ipsa, which indicate that politicians should be identified when a formal probe is launched, and cases should be heard in public where possible. A statement on the body's website revealed that Mr March, who had only been in the post two months, tendered his resignation last Wednesday. In a letter to chairman Sir Ian Kennedy, he wrote: 'As I explained during our conversation, after much thought and with a good deal of regret, I have come to the conclusion that the role of Compliance Officer for Ipsa is not the right role for me. 'On that basis, I have decided that the sensible thing for me to do is to resign the post.' Sir Ian replied: 'Thank you for your letter of July 27 and for notice of your resignation from the post of Compliance Officer. The new politics: Ipsa was set up in the wake of the expenses scandal that rocked Parliament . 'I accept, with regret, and understand your conclusion that the role is not the right one for you. I know you did not reach this conclusion lightly or hastily.' Martyn Taylor, previously Ipsa's head of governance, has now become its third compliance officer in little more than a year. He will fill in for six months until a permanent successor can be found. Ex-RAF officer Alan Lockwood was given the post on an interim basis when Ipsa took charge of Commons expenses after the General Election. Mr March was part-way through probes into a number of MPs' claims.Liberal Democrat Bob Russell is the only named subject so far. He disclosed the fact himself in May, and the case was later dropped. Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'After the MPs' expenses scandal one of the crucial principles behind the new system was transparency. 'Taxpayers have a right to know if an MP is being investigated, equally it should be made public if the probe amounts to nothing, or if the error was Ipsa's. 'Public trust in Parliament and the expenses system is still fragile and it would be unacceptable for allegations of dubious claims to be swept under the carpet, or for investigations to be conducted in secret.'",Luke March resigns as Compliance Officer at Ipsa .
"By . Brendan Carlin . Last updated at 10:52 PM on 30th July 2011 . HM Revenue chiefs were yesterday ordered by MPs to stop sending threatening letters to people who owed them money, warning that cars and televisions would be seized and sold off for a pittance. In a scathing rebuke, tax bosses were told by the Commons' Treasury committee that the 'widely used' practice of mailing out threats to auction off people's property was 'completely inappropriate'. Labour MP George Mudie, deputy chairman of the committee, even suggested that HM Revenue and Customs had been breaking the law by sending out the 'horrifying' letters. 'Horrifying threats': HM Revenue has been sending out letters to people threatening to auction off their property . And he accused Chancellor George Osborne of turning a blind eye to the abuse after one of his Treasury Ministers appeared to condone it. Earlier this year, The Mail on Sunday exposed how the tax office was targeting thousands of people among Britain's ten million self-assessment taxpayers who had failed to respond to tax demands. In a damning report this weekend on HMRC's performance, the Treasury committee said: 'These letters appear to have been widely used without sufficient thought to whom they were sent to, even being sent to people who did not actually owe money. 'Such language is appropriate only where there is strong evidence of persistent and deliberate non-payment.' Mr Mudie, who led the inquiry,  praised The Mail on Sunday for exposing the HMRC tactics. He said: 'This was one of the most disturbing things uncovered in our inquiry. They were sending these out to taxpayers, seemingly on a random basis, and telling them to pay up within weeks. 'There was no question of saying  we would like to discuss this with you, or you can phone this number, and you have a right of appeal. 'It was just: pay up this money – and it was often a four-figure number – within weeks or we will seize your goods. 'Imagine the effect on someone elderly and vulnerable living on their own if they got a letter like that.' 'Disappointing': Treasury Minister David Gauke was on the receiving end of stern criticism from the committee . The Leeds MP also warned that unless the letters were being sent to people who had repeatedly and deliberately refused to pay up, they were illegal. He also voiced his anger that Treasury Minister David Gauke, who oversees HMRC, appeared to condone the practice. Mr Mudie said: 'The Minister came before us and I was disappointed because he took the line that they owed money and they had to get it. 'He seemed to think it was acceptable but the committee didn't.' Earlier this year, The Mail on Sunday exposed how HMRC was targeting thousands of people among Britain's ten million self-assessment taxpayers who had failed to respond to tax demands. In a provocative twin-track tactic, tax chiefs set out to humiliate people into paying up by threatening to seize their possessions and auction them off publicly for a fraction of their real value, and warning them that if they refused the Government would run out of money to treat the sick and educate the nation's children. One letter sent from the HMRC office in Croydon described in graphic terms how 'embarrassing' and costly it would be for the taxpayer if a debt of more than £2,000 was not settled. 'We must collect this tax from you to pay for the hospitals and schools we all rely on. We will do that by taking your possessions and auctioning them publicly. 'We don't like doing this because people have told us it is embarrassing for them and it will cost you so much more to pay this way. 'For instance, if your car is worth several thousand pounds, it might sell for only a few hundred pounds at auction, a flat-screen TV costing £2,000 would typically sell for about £200-£300, and an £800 laptop would sell for about £100.' Praised: The Mail on Sunday story from earlier this year that exposed how HMRC was sending menacing letters to late payers . In their report, MPs painted a dismal picture of HMRC as an organisation in deep crisis, with 'endemic delays'. Staff were so over-stretched that more than half of calls from the public went unanswered and letters were ignored for months. The report comes after HMRC  admitted last year that six million people had paid the wrong amount of tax in previous years. Last night HMRC remained defiant about the letters, saying most of the them were sent to people who either repeatedly failed to respond or refused to pay up. The Treasury declined to make a statement last night.","HMRC warned letters could be breaking the law .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:32 PM on 4th August 2011 . The possibility that man walked much earlier than previously thought has been raised after a study of ancient habitats. Scientists now believe that grassy open spaces - where human predecessors would have been forced to walk - have dominated the East African landscape throughout the whole of human evolution. Until now it was supposed that the region known as the 'Cradle of Humanity' was heavily forested until around two million years ago. Walking not swinging: Areas such as Maasai Mara in the 'Cradle of Humanity' in East Africa are now thought to have had open grassland throughout history . Many experts believe the predecessors of humans only came down from the trees and developed into fully bipedal creatures after the forests receded. But the new evidence, based on chemical signatures in ancient soil samples, shows that savannah-like open habitats have prevailed there for more than six million years. The finding has implications for theories about the pivotal moment when human ancestors started walking on two legs. Humans and chimpanzees parted company on the path of evolution between five and eight million years ago. The findings published in the journal Nature tie into certain aspects of the fossil record. Primitive man: Homo erectus, who walked upright, could have done so much earlier than expected . One . species, Ardipithecus, which is thought to have lived in woody habitats . 4.3million years ago, had a diet which included small amounts of . tropical grasses. 'The fact it had some means it was going into the savannah, unless it was eating take-out food,' said Professor Thure Cerling, from the University of Utah, who led the new research. The study showed that for more than six million years, tree cover has been less than 40 per cent at most of the East African sites where humans evolved. By definition, woodland has more than 40 per cent tree cover and a forest more than 80 per cent. Prof Cerling added: 'We've been able to quantify how much shade was available in the geological past, and it shows there have been open habitats for all of the last six million years in the environments in eastern Africa where some of the most significant early human fossils were found. 'Wherever we find human ancestors, we find evidence for open habitats similar to savannahs - much more open and savannah-like than forested. 'In some periods, it was more bushy, and other times it was less bushy. Hardly anything could have been called a dense forest, but we can show some periods where certain environments were consistently more wooded than others. 'We find hominins (early humans, pre-humans and chimp and gorilla relatives) in both places. 'How early hominins partitioned their time between 'more open' and 'more closed' habitats is still an open question.'","East African region previously thought to have been heavily forested until 2million years ago .

"By . Chris Greenwood . Last updated at 2:30 AM on 4th August 2011 . It's the sort of luxurious yacht that would attract admiring glances wherever it went. In the case of £1million pleasure cruiser Louise, however, the attention it received was from customs officials, who found the UK’s largest ever haul of cocaine stashed ‘ingeniously’ inside. Smugglers had hidden 1.2 tonnes of the class-A drug in the bodywork of the vessel – then audaciously tried to ship the whole boat to Britain in a commercial cargo vessel. High and dry: The Louise in Southampton Docks where she was searched by officers . The cocaine was exceptionally pure and officials said it could have been cut into eight tons of saleable drugs – worth £300million and a third of the entire UK annual supply. On Tuesday, six suspected members of a crime gang, including a 60-year-old Dutch man and his three sons, were arrested in Holland. Police also seized 100,000 euros (£87,300), two Harley-Davidson motorcycles, two guns, a silencer and ecstasy. Authorities were first alerted to the 65ft Caribbean pleasure cruiser while it was in the British Virgin Islands in May. Seized: The £1m Louise, a 65ft pleasure cruiser, was held at Southampton Docks where UKBA and Soca officers found cocaine worth an estimated £300m . Undercover officials looked on as it was loaded on to a container ship alongside 30 others for its journey across the Atlantic to Holland via Southampton. Investigators believe the gang intended to unload the cocaine there before distributing the majority back to Britain, which is the biggest market for the drug in Europe. But customs officers intercepted the boat at Southampton and specialist search teams spent six days secretly taking it apart. Meanwhile, the boat’s owners threatened to sue for £750,000 unless it was released. Border officials stalled for time claiming the yacht had been damaged in transit and was no longer seaworthy. Record haul: The drugs, worth £300m, are pictured with the head of the Border Force for the UK Border Agency Brodie Clark . Hidden depths: The £1million yacht, Louise, is held by customs officials, who found the 1.2 ton cocaine haul stashed in a specially built section in the back . It transpired that the excuse was based on fact, as they discovered that by removing the huge haul of drugs the vessel had become dangerously unstable. The cocaine had been concealed in a specially designed four cubic-metre compartment under the diving platform. It was 90 per cent pure, while the average purity of cocaine seized at the British border is just 63 per cent. Officials at the Serious Organised Crime Agency said the high purity meant it could have been cut into about seven million street deals. Brodie Clark, of the UK Border Agency, said the way the drugs were hidden was ‘ingenious’, adding: ‘This has been an enormous seizure of cocaine. This is the largest we have on record. It is hugely significant.’ The operation is the latest blow to international drug cartels which has forced cocaine prices in the UK to record levels. Officials said the value of a kilo of cocaine has risen from £30,000 in 2008 to more than £55,000 today. News of the seizure came as Scotland Yard scored a separate blow against the British arm of another drug network. Anthony Briggs and Rayner Jane Rothery, the final two members of a gang responsible for trafficking a ton of cocaine and laundering £10million, were jailed at Kingston Crown Court. Since . the drugs were found in June, the UKBA has helped Dutch police track . members of the gang and six men were arrested during early-morning raids on Tuesday  - two 44-year-olds in Amsterdam, a 60-year-old in Meppel, . two, aged 32 and 34, in Heusden, and a 27-year-old in Waalwijk. Immigration . Minister Damian Green said: 'This was a significant drugs seizure which . was made possible by the co-operation of our international partners. 'UK Border Agency staff have shown vigilance, dedication and determination to uncover this shipment. 'Our . efforts have helped bring an international crime gang to book and the . message is clear: we will investigate and prosecute anyone who tries to . smuggle banned substances through UK borders. 'By . keeping the border secure we play a key role in stopping drugs entering . the UK and in reducing the harm they do to our communities. Find: Some of the 1.2 tonnes of 93 per cent pure cocaine found hidden inside the boat which was 'destroyed' during the search . UK Border Agency officials called the hiding of a record drugs haul in a 44-tonne, £1 million luxury yacht 'ingenious'. 'The cocaine took up a space of about four cubic metres and was fitted neatly under the diving platform aft with access from the engine room. 'It required some really good blanking panels to hide them and it was ingenious,' a spokesman said. The hiding place was so good it took specially trained officers six days to find the haul. 'The concealment was a professional job. It's a case of being methodical to find it,' said Doug McLellan, the head of maritime operations at the UKBA. 'Six days might sound like a long time but there is a lot of areas on a yacht of this size, so it's a painstaking process using trained officers, firstly looking through the obvious places and when those have been exhausted looking at the fabric of the boat.' The yacht had been transported from the British Virgin Islands on board a specially designed Dutch-registered ship, Snoekgracht, owned by Seven Stars Yacht Transport along with 30 others. It was coming to Europe to be refitted. The transport company was completely unaware of the drugs, the spokesman said. Now the yacht, which was owned by those arrested, is at berth in Southampton docks and is Crown property. 'We aim to protect society from the violence and corruption that always accompanied the trade in illegal goods.' The Dutch police were acting on . intelligence provided by Soca's international network and the French . Customs Investigation Service. Brodie Clark said the international co-operation was a 'strong and powerful example of more to come', he said. Asked . about how the drugs were hidden, he added: 'It was ingenious, it was . difficult to find. Skilful people spent a number of days looking for . it.' David Armond, deputy director of international operations for Soca, said the Louise had been 'of interest for some time'. Operation Parsons showed the trust . between international partners as the £1 million vessel was 'destroyed . to find the load', he said. He said the high purity of the cocaine meant it would make about eight tonnes of saleable drugs once cut. 'It's unusual for a load like that to get to the shores of the UK. 'It . is undoubtedly the case that, had this vessel been allowed to get to . its destination, a significant amount of this load would have been . transported back to the UK.' Jim Jarvie, deputy director for the . UKBA's crime directorate, said the drugs were destined for Holland, from . where they would have been distributed across Europe. Commissioner Gert Ras, of the Dutch National Crime Squad, said all six arrested men were Dutch nationals. They included the 60-year-old owner of the boat and his three sons, aged 27, 32 and 34. A further arrest of a seventh Dutch national is also expected, he said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:41 AM on 28th June 2011 . Chocolate retailer Thorntons dealt a further blow to the High Street today by announcing plans to close up to 180 stores. The struggling store will close 120 outlets over three years in another high-profile retail slump following the recent failures of Habitat, Jane Norman, TJ Hughes and Oddbins. Thorntons, which celebrated its 100th anniversary this year, will close the stores as their leases expire, and is considering the future of 60 other outlets. Strugging: Thorntons bosses said the chocolate maker announced the store closures to cope with 'challenging trading conditions' Jane Norman closed its doors on Saturday before it was put into administration yesterday . There was some relief from the latest . High Street gloom as sofa giant DFS defied the slump by . announcing plans for eight new stores. The group, which operates 80 stores, announced a 3.1 per cent rise in underlying profits after increasing its share of the furniture market. The closures by Thorntons, however, will leave the chocolate maker with around . 180 to 200 company-owned stores, although in the majority of locations . it hopes franchisees will open outlets. The closure of the stores could put between 750 and 1,125 jobs at risk, but the company said it would try to find staff alternative roles wherever possible. It is the latest blow to the high street after the failure of chains such as Habitat and Oddbins in recent weeks and Jane Norman yesterday. Discount department store TJ Hughes is set to join the list of failed retailers today after it reportedly filed a notice of intention to appoint an administrator. Chains such as HMV, Game and JJB Sports, which have long been the mainstay of UK high streets, are also slimming down their store estates. And Mothercare said recently that it would axe 110 shops in order to focus its trading on out-of-town locations. The Thorntons strategy review, led by new chief executive Jonathan Hart, will see the company increasingly focus on its commercial division, which sells Thorntons-branded chocolate through other retailers, and grow online sales. The review also aims to make the business less dependent on seasonal events such as Christmas and Easter by increasing the number of gifts it sells . Mr Hart said the strategy was the . right one because he sees the current weakness in high street footfall . and consumer sentiment continuing. Carpetright . today reported a 70% slide in full-year profits and warned it will . close more stores in an effort to weather the consumer downturn. The . floor coverings specialist said profits reduced to £6.6 million in the . year to April 30 after householders were put off making major purchases . and also found it harder to obtain mortgages in order to move home. Sales in the UK and Ireland fell nearly 5% to £404.5 million in the year. The . group finished the period with 559 stores in the UK and Ireland, after . closing a net figure of 27, and said that, with leases on 94 stores due . to expire in the next five years, it expected to further reduce the size . of its estate. Lord Harris, Carpetright's chairman and chief executive described trading conditions as 'very challenging'. The . review said its stores needed an overhaul after a recent lack of . investment and changes in shopper behaviour, as they visit the high . street less regularly in favour of supermarkets and internet shopping. Although . it still thinks its own stores will remain an important part of its . future, it said selling through other retailers will become its main . sales channel over the next three years. It . will revamp its products with gifts for under £5 for special occasions . such as birthdays and anniversaries to help broaden its appeal . throughout the year and will develop a new flagship boxed chocolate . brand next year. It will start offering free tastings in-stores in the . next couple of months. The group also aims to make efficiency savings at its factories and supply chain in a bid to save £2 million a year. However, closing the company-owned stores will cost it between £4.2 million and £4.8 million. Elsewhere, department store chain TJ Hughes joined the increasing ranks of struggling high street brands when it today announced it would be appointing an administrator in the next 10 days. The move by the Liverpool-based chain, which runs 57 stores, could put 4,000 jobs at risk. TJ Hughes was bought out by its management team in March following reports that it had been hit by the withdrawal of credit insurance for its suppliers following a difficult period of trading. The homewares sector has suffered heavy sales declines in recent weeks as nervous consumers put off purchases of big-ticket items such as fridges and TVs. Women's . fashion firm Jane Norman became another big high street name to fall . into administration yesterday in a move which could put up to 1,600 jobs . at risk. Accountancy firm Zolfo Cooper hopes to find a buyer for the stricken retailer, which closed its 90 stores on Saturday. Habitat:Thirty . stores outside London put into administration. Around 900 jobs . threatened. Homebase and Argos owner, Home Retail Group, bought the . rights to the Habitat brand in the UK, the webstie and three stores in . central London for £24.5million.

The administrator . earlier managed to find buyers for 55 stores, including to Wickes owner . Travis Perkins, but the collapse of the chain left more than 3,000 . workers facing redundancy. Oddbins:The . wine merchant was the latest victim of a declining independent wine . trade in the UK, which also saw Threshers' owner, First Quench . Retailing, collapse in 2009. Oddbins had hoped to push through a rescue . deal but HM Revenues & Customs, which was owed £8 million by the . chain, refused to vote for the scheme. Whittals Wine Merchants bought 37 . Oddbins stores, securing more than 200 store jobs, but this left a . further 52 stores in the hands of administrators Deloitte. JJB Sports:The . sportswear chain was saved from administration after landlords and . creditors backed its second rescue deal in as many years. JJB's latest . company voluntary arrangement involved closing 43 unprofitable stores, . placing a further 46 under review and a move to monthly rental payments. The deal enabled it to raise £65 million from investors and secure a . new banking facility. HMV:The . sale of its Waterstone's book chain for £53 million has been key to . HMV's survival as the deal with Russian investor Alexander Mamut enabled . the high street retailer to negotiate a two-year extension to lending . facilities with its banks. HMV, which has around 260 stores in the UK . and Ireland, is now working on a plan to reduce its estate and focus . more on gadgets such as iPads. Mothercare:Mothercare . unveiled plans in May to close 110 outlets and focus on out-of-town . superstores. Rents will be cut on a further 40 stores, squeezing incomes . for high street landlords even further. The new focus will be on . out-of-town Parenting Centres, which contain its Early Learning Centre . brand. Media . reports have suggested that Jane Norman could be sold imminently in a . so-called pre-pack administration deal, with department store chain . Debenhams and knitwear firm Edinburgh Woollen Mill reported to be among . the potential bidders. Jane Norman closed its doors on Saturday before it was put into administration yesterday. Pre-pack administrations are controversial because creditors, such as suppliers, can lose out as some of the debts are scrapped. Jane . Norman, which specialises in selling to women between the ages of 16 . and 25, is the latest retail victim of the squeeze in consumer spending . brought about the financial crisis. Around 1,600 jobs are at risk as a result of the collapse of Jane Norman . The . company, founded in London in 1952, has failed to find a buyer in . recent weeks but putting the company into administration may speed up . the sale process because some of its £140 million debts could be . scrapped. Jane Norman has . been squeezed in recent months as cash-strapped consumers put off . non-essential purchases and consumer confidence plunged amid fears over . the strength of the economic recovery. Clothes . have also become more expensive as raw materials such as cotton have . soared in price, and VAT rose to 20% from 17.5% in January.

Flight attack: Jeff Ellis, of West Linn, Oregon, was stung by a scorpion while on a commercial flight from Seattle, Washington, to Anchorage, Alaska . You would expect the worst thing stopping you getting a bit of sleep on a red-eye flight might be a screaming child or an air hostess. But Jeff Ellis, of West Linn, Oregon, was stung by a scorpion while on a commercial flight from Seattle, Washington, to Anchorage, Alaska. He was trying to sleep on the 1,400-mile overnight Alaska Airlines flight when he felt something in his sleeve and tried to brush it away. He then felt the crawling again, looked . down and saw the culprit. ‘I picked my hand up and said: “Oh, my God. That's a scorpion”,’ he told KPTV. Mr Ellis said he grabbed the scorpion with a napkin and showed it to his girlfriend, but not before it stung him on the elbow. ‘At first I didn't believe him,’ said his girlfriend Suzanne Foster. ‘But then I saw it. He held the napkin up for me to see, and I saw the tail wiggling. I pretty much jumped out of my seat.’ She called for the flight attendant because Mr Ellis noticed his elbow burning and said it felt like a bee sting. Culprit: Mr Ellis said he grabbed the scorpion with a napkin and showed it to his girlfriend, but not before it stung him on the elbow .

The flight originated from Austin, Texas, where Alaska Airlines officials believe the scorpion got on board.

Based on photos he took of the arachnid, Mr Ellis believes he was stung by a striped bark scorpion common in Texas. Whopper: Mr Ellis holds a photograph of the scorpion up to reporters .

He said most people will experience minor pain from a bark scorpion sting unless they are allergic, in which case it might cause anaphylactic shock. ‘He got stung because he threatened it,’ Mr Brooks said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:33 PM on 3rd August 2011 . Smartphones that turn into a mobile wallet are among several new BlackBerry devices unveiled by manufacturer Research In Motion today. As well as all the usual smartphone functions like internet browsing, Blackberry users will be able to make 'contactless' payments in shops across Britain, including Pret A Manger, McDonalds and Boots. The new technology allows card details to be loaded onto a Blackberry Bold 9900 or 9930 and then make payments of up to £15 by waving it against a reader in-store. BlackBerry Torch 9810, which does not contain the technology, was also unveiled. Pay as you go: The new technology allows credit card details to be loaded onto a Blackberry Bold 9900 (pictured) or 9930 and then make payments of up to £15 by waving it against a reader in-store . The BlackBerry Torch 9850 is the only new smartphone unveiled that features a new design for RIM. The Torch 9850 - launched in the U.S. as the 9860 - is a touchscreen device with a 3.7inch, 480x800 pixel screen. The 253dpi display is the largest on a BlackBerry device to date. It also has 720p video camera and is powered by a 1.2GHz processor and 768MB of RAM. Primed with 4GB of internal memory, the Torch 9850’s memory will be expandable by up to 32GB via a microSD card. The handset has wifi and BlackBerry OS 7. The move by Blackberry, one of the biggest smartphone brands in the world, marks another step along the way to a 'cash-less' society. One in eight of us now doesn't carry cash at all, preferring cards for purchases - a potential goldmine for banks because they charge shops a fee for transactions. It is thought that Apple's iPhone 5, which may be ready for launch as soon as December, will also include the tap-and-pay technology. In May, Orange and Barclaycard teamed up to offer 'Quick Tap' mobile technology. Quick Tap is currently available only on one model of phone - the Samsung Tocco, costing an extra £59 on a pay-as-you-go contract. In addition, internet giant Google has announced that it plans to launch 'Google Wallet', which may take the form of an all-encompassing smartphone app for banking. Experts warned in the Huffington Post, though, that this may allow Google to collect information about users' locations, shopping habits, and spending patterns with the intention of using this to sell ads, coupons, and loyal reward programs. RIM executives hope that today's launch of five devices will buy time until the firm can introduce a radically new software packinging in its smartphones. Three will go onsale in Britain. These three new touchscreen phones run on the new BlackBerry OS 7, and each boast an improved screen display and pack a 1.2 GHz processor from Qualcomm, the most powerful ever for a BlackBerry phone. All three devices will launch with carriers globally by the end of August, RIM said. The browser for the new phones is 40 per cent faster than the original Torch, RIM's last major phone launch which hit shelves almost a year ago. But since co-chief executive Mike Lazaridis has already promised 'superphones' next year using the QNX-based operating system running RIM's PlayBook tablet computer, analysts are looking beyond the launch. 'This is a necessary product refresh in . advance of the big bang that we hope and expect will happen with . QNX-based phones,' said CCS Insight spokesman John Jackson. The three new BlackBerry touchscreen phones being released in Britain. Each runs on the new BlackBerry OS 7 and boasts an improved screen display . RIM shipped 13.2million phones in the three months to late May, its first fall in shipments versus the prior quarter since at least mid-2007, as it pushed this launch back to August. RIM's newly-promoted global head of sales Patrick Spence said BlackBerry heritage was as a leading communications tool and 'what we're talking about now with BlackBerry 7 is really enhancing that experience'. One of the Torch versions is to the eye identical to the original touchscreen device with a slideout Qwerty keyboard, the other is RIM's first touch-only device since the disappointment of its Storm model. The Bold upgrade will feature a near-field communications chip that can turn the phone into a mobile wallet. It was first shown at RIM's BlackBerry World conference in May. RIM's North American market share has dipped sharply in the past year as high-end Android devices proliferate and Apple's iPhone was added to Verizon's lineup. Globally the fall has been less severe but from a smaller starting point, according to data compiled by research firms CCS Insight and Gartner.","New technology allows credit card details .

"By . David Williams . Last updated at 1:45 AM on 4th August 2011 . Ailing: Hosni Mubarak lies on a bed in a steel cage inside the court room in Cairo as he faces charges of corruption and ordering the deaths of protesters . Six months ago he ruled Egypt with absolute power. Yesterday Hosni Mubarak was in a cage, wheeled into court on a hospital trolley, broken and humiliated, to face an extraordinary show trial. The 83-year-old, who is said to have stomach cancer, denied charges of corruption and complicity in the killing of protesters. Beside him at a Cairo police academy converted into a court for the trial stood his two sons, their hair cropped and wearing white prison uniforms which matched their father’s. It was the first time Egyptians have seen Mubarak, who has been under hospital arrest in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, since he gave a defiant TV address refusing to resign before he was forced from office in February. They watched him live on state TV yesterday, many savouring the downfall of the man who ruled them, often brutally, with unquestioned power for 29 years. There had been widespread scepticism that Egypt’s new military rulers would ever allow Mubarak to stand trial – one of the key demands which has united protesters since he fell following an 18-day uprising. ‘This is the dream of Egyptians, to see him like this, humiliated like he humiliated them for the last 30 years,’ said Ghada Ali, the mother of a 17-year-old girl in the city of Alexandria who was shot dead during the crackdown. ‘I want to see their hearts explode like my daughter’s heart exploded from their single bullet,’ she sobbed. In the courtroom protected by 3,000 soldiers and police, a prosecutor read the charges against Mubarak – that he was an accomplice along with his then-interior minister in the ‘intentional and premeditated murder of peaceful protesters’ – and that he and his sons received gifts from a prominent businessman in return for guaranteeing him a lowered price in a land deal with the state. Repercussions: The former leader, who held power for nearly 30 years, has not been seen since he was deposed in February . Unprecedented: Security is extremely tight at the trial in Cairo, with steps taken to prevent missiles being thrown into the cage . Caged: Mubarak can be seen in his bed on the left of the image, flanked by his two sons Gamal and Alaa . Court appearance: Mubarak was flown by helicopter from Sharm el-Sheikh yesterday morning . ‘Yes, I am here,’ Mubarak said softly from his bed, raising his hand slightly when the judge asked him to identify himself and enter a plea. ‘I deny all these accusations completely,’ he said into a microphone, wagging his finger. The charge of ordering the killing of protesters – 850 died during the uprising –  carries the death penalty. Although pale, his eyes ringed with red, the man who survived several assassination attempts to become the region’s power broker appeared alert and aware of what was going on.  He showed little discernible emotion, occasionally pulling a white sheet up to his chin. Flanking him in the cage were his nine co-defendants. As well as his sons – one-time heir apparent Gamal and wealthy businessman Alaa – his former interior minister Habib el-Adly and six top former police officials are accused. Highly anticipated: Mubarak abiout to be led from a van outside the court. He faces charges of corruption and ordering the killing of protesters during the uprising in February . Clashes: Pro and anti-Mubarak supporters were involved in scuffles outside the courtroom . Unrest: Pro-Mubarak supporters have threatened to burn down any prison the former leader is put in . Jubilant: A protester against Egypt's former President Hosni Mubarak holds a flag and flicks a V for victory hand gesture outside the police academy where the trial is taking place . From time to time, Mubarak craned his neck to see the proceedings and at other times, he crooked his elbow over his face as if in exhaustion. While the other defendants sat on wooden benches in the cage, Gamal and Alaa stood next to their father’s bed, at one point with their arms crossed on their chest seemingly trying to block the court camera’s view of their father. The two sons each carried a copy of the Koran and leaned over to talk to their father. Emotions were high outside the court where a crowd of Mubarak supporters and hundreds of relatives of dead protesters and other Mubarak opponents massed at the gates, scuffling sporadically as they watched the proceedings on a giant screen. Divisions: An Egyptian man loyal to the former president throws a stone at a foe outside the police academy where the trial is taking place . Fighting: Supporters Mubarak clash with an anti-Mubarak protester, centre, outside the court room during the first day of the former president's trial . Emotions running high: The clash continues between pro- and anti-Mubarak demonstrators with the men wielding makeshift weapons . The pain is not yet over: An injured man is carried away during clashes between supporters of Egypt's ousted President Hosni Mubarak and anti-Mubarak protesters . Scores to settle: Unidentified protesters throw rocks as they clash with others, as one holds a photograph, right, of a man killed during the uprising in February . They threw stones and bottles at each other while riot police with shields and helmets tried to keep them apart. Fifty supporters pounded on the steel gate trying to get into the compound, chanting ‘We love you, Mubarak!’ until police charged at them with electrified batons and dispersed them. The courtroom itself was divided. Relatives of the defendants sat near the cage. A fence running through the middle of the chamber divided them from the rest of the audience of around 300 people, including a few relatives of protesters killed in the uprising, kept far enough that they cannot shout or throw anything at the former leader. The trial was adjourned until August 15. Mubarak will be held  at a military hospital on the outskirts of Cairo. Flashback: Mubarak was ousted from power after 18 days of violent protests centred around Tahrir Square, in Cairo, as well as other cities . Public anger: A man walks past a defaced statue of the former leader. Mubarak has been in Sharm el-Sheikh since he was deposed in February . Backlash: Hundreds of protesters were killed during violent clashes in February, but eventually Mubarak was forced to stand down as thousands descended on his palace .","Mubarak flanked by sons during trial in police academy named in his honour .

Virgin Media's network would be freely available to anyone at 0.5Mbps, and to subscribers to its home broadband at speeds up to a blistering 10Mbps.

Neil Berkett, the company's chief executive, has announced they are are in advanced negotiations with London councils to gain permission for the necessary works. 'The proposition would be that we would provide free WiFi access for all,' he told investors. The free-to-use approach contrasts with BT's Openzone network which, though free to BT broadband customers, costs as much as £5.99 for 90 minutes browsing to non-customers. Mr Berkett called the plans 'a punt' that will cost his company 'a few million pounds' and will 'keep them [BT] honest', the Daily Telegraph reported.

An American PhD student has relived the terrifying moment he was caught up in gunfire between the Taliban and Nato-assisted forces  - prompting him to write his own will. Saiz Ahmed had just eaten dinner and returned to his fourth-floor room at the InterContinental Hotel in Kabul when he heard loud noises and - thinking he was about to die - he cowered on the flood an penned his will. The Afghan legal history student survived the attack, performed by the Taliban, according to reports - but 18 others did not. Bloodied: Soldiers - believed to be international special forces - leave the scene of the siege . Devastation: Smoke was still billowing from the roof as the sun came up over Kabul this morning . Afghan policemen keep watch: The attack has raised fresh questions over the country's ability to handle security . Mr Ahmed thought that there might have been a power cut when the lights went out but moments later realised it was gunfire. He stayed put inside the hotel and grabbed a piece of paper to . hastily scribble down his will in case he was killed in the explosions. 'It . was clear that people were shooting from inside the building - a number . of people I didn't know where - and from outside,' he told CNN. 'I didn't know who was who. They might have been people blowing themselves up.' Mr Ahmed said that over the next few hours he endured the sound of constant gunfire and explosions roughly every 45 minutes. The building rocked with the force of the blasts but he remained inside after speaking by phone with relatives in Kabul. He . said that he was sure that nobody would get out alive and he scrawled . the names of a handful of charities on a piece of paper in case he was . killed. He continued: 'I've never experienced explosions that near. I felt the ground move up. 'I was just praying that the next one wouldn't be right under me or above me or anywhere else where there were people.' Engaged: A Nato helicopter fires a missile on the roof of the Intercontinental hotel in Kabul this morning . An explosion on the roof of the hotel lights up the night sky . Meanwhile these images show how a helicopter hovers over the hotel - the next moment a trace of fire is seen hitting the roof and killing Taliban troops who were trying to siege the Western-style hotel. The siege, however, was still not over. Some hours later the last insurgent blew himself up in a hotel room. Officials said today that eleven civilians were killed in the assault that has sent shock waves through the Afghan capital. The attack on the five-storey hotel in the capital raised doubt about the ability of Afghan security forces to take charge of securing the nation from foreign combat forces. The assault began at around 10pm last night and eight suicide attackers killed the guards and entered the building. During the next four hours, a number of workers were killed as the men stormed through the hotel, which sits on a hill overlooking the city. The 11 civilians killed included a judge from an unnamed province, five hotel workers and three Afghan policemen, Latifullah Mashal, the spokesman of the Afghan National Directorate for Security. said. Assault: Afghan soldiers gather outside the hotel after the siege finally came to an end . Perimeter: The siege only came to an end after the lone surviving suicide bomber blew himself up in a hotel room . The InterContinental - known widely as . the 'Inter-Con' opened in the late 1960s - was the nation's first . international luxury hotel. It . has at least 200 rooms and was once part of an international chain. But . when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979, the hotel was left to . fend for itself. It was used by Western journalists during the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. On November 23 2003, a rocket exploded nearby, shattering windows but causing no casualties. Twenty-two . rockets hit the Inter-Con between 1992 and 1996, when factional . fighting convulsed Kabul under the government of Burhanuddin Rabbani. All the windows were broken, water mains were damaged and the outside structure pockmarked. Some, but not all, of the damage was repaired during Taliban rule. Attacks . in the Afghan capital have been relatively rare, although violence has . increased since the May 2 killing of Osama bin Laden in a U.S. raid in . Pakistan and the start of the Taliban's annual spring offensive. Storm force: Afghan soldiers on a road near the hotel. The siege was ended by NATO helicopters and forces . Staff at the same hotel clean up after a bomb went off in its garden in November 2003 (file picture) He said no foreigners were killed, but two were among 14 people wounded in the attack. He did not disclose their nationalities. One guest, named as Jawid, said he jumped out a one-story window to flee the shooting. 'I was running with my family,' he said. 'There was shooting. The restaurant was full with guests.' A police source said a wedding party was underway when the attack happened and that the death toll could have been much higher. The attackers were heavily armed with machine guns, anti-aircraft weapons, rocket-propelled grenades, hand grenades and grenade launchers, the Afghan officials said. Afghan police rushed to the scene and firefights broke out. ‘We were locked in a room. Everybody was shooting and firing,’ said Abdul Zahir Faizada, head of the local council in Herat province in western Afghanistan. I heard a lot of shooting.’ The attack occurred the day before a conference was scheduled in Kabul to discuss plans for Afghan security forces to take the lead for securing an increasing number of areas of the country between now and 2014 when international forces are expected to move out of combat roles. Afghans across the country were in the city to attend, although it's not known who was staying at the Inter-Continental. Nazar Ali Wahedi, chief of intelligence for Helmand province in the south who was attending the conference, called the assailants ‘the enemy of stability and peace’ in Afghanistan. ‘Our room was hit by several bullets,’ said Wahedi. ‘We spent the whole night in our room.’ U.S. Army Maj. Jason Waggoner, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting in Afghanistan, said the helicopters killed three gunmen and Afghan security forces clearing the hotel worked their way up to the roof and engaged the remaining insurgents. As the helicopters attacked and Afghan security forces moved in, there were four massive explosions. Officials at the scene said the blasts occurred when security forces either fired on suicide bombers or they blew themselves up. After the gunmen were killed, the hotel lights that had been blacked out during the attack came back on. Afghan security vehicles and ambulances were removing the dead and wounded from the area. Hours later, however, the last of the suicide bombers, who had been holed up in a room, blew himself up, the final act of violence of the night. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the rare night-time attack in the capital - an apparent attempt to show that they remain potent despite heavy pressure from coalition and Afghan security forces. It came less than a week after President Barack Obama announced he was withdrawing 33,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan and would end the American combat role by the end of 2014. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid later issued a statement claiming that Taliban attackers killed guards at a gate and entered the hotel. ‘One of our fighters called on a mobile phone and said: “We have gotten onto all the hotel floors and the attack is going according to the plan. We have killed and wounded 50 foreign and local enemies. We are in the corridors of the hotel now taking guests out of their rooms - mostly foreigners. We broke down the doors and took them out one by one”.’ But Kabul Police Chief Gen. Mohammad Ayub Salangi said the death toll was only ten, who were all employed at the hotel. He provided no further details, but said none of the conference attendees staying at the hotel were harmed. ‘There were no casualties among the guests - either foreign or Afghan,’ he said. ‘No high-ranking government officials were killed.’ Earlier on Tuesday, officials from the U.S., Pakistan and Afghanistan met in the capital to discuss prospects for making peace with Taliban insurgents to end the nearly decade-long war. 'The fact that we are discussing reconciliation in great detail is success and progress, but challenges remain and we are reminded of that on an almost daily basis by violence,' Jawed Ludin, Afghanistan's deputy foreign minister, said at a news conference. 'The important thing is that we act and that we act urgently and try to do what we can to put an end to violence.' Attack: Eleven Afghan civilians were killed when suicide bombers and heavily armed Taliban insurgents attacked the hotel . Target: The Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul is popular with foreigners and Afghan officials . On June 18, insurgents wearing Afghan . army uniforms stormed a police station near the presidential palace and . opened fire on officers, killing nine.

In January 2008, militants stormed Kabul's most popular luxury hotel, the Serena, hunting down Westerners who cowered in a gym during a coordinated assault that killed eight people. An American, a Norwegian journalist and a Philippine woman were among the dead. A suicide car bomber in December 2009, struck near the home of a former Afghan vice president and a hotel frequented by Westerners, killing eight people and wounding nearly 40 in a neighborhood considered one of Kabul's safest. And in February 2010, insurgents struck two residential hotels in the heart of Kabul, killing 20 people including seven Indians, a French filmmaker and an Italian diplomat.","Spanish pilot, 48, among the dead .

A mother is suing a fraternity for $25million after its members allegedly killed her 19-year-old son by making him drink until he passed out and then leaving him tied up for hours. Marie Anfre has launched the wrongful death lawsuit against the Sigma Alpha Epsilon frat after her only son George Desdunes died in the alleged hazing at Cornell University in February. He died in hospital after he was found unconcious on a sofa in a fraternity flat following a night of drinking - during which he was allegedly kidnapped and taken back to a fraternity house where he was bound with duct tape and zip ties. Mrs Anfre, from Brooklyn, said members of the fraternity asked her only child a series of questions about the frat, and then forced him to drink if he got them wrong. Mr Desdunes had already been drinking when he was bundled into a car at 1am on 25 February and taken back to a frat house where the hazing riutal is said to have gone on until 5am. Members of the fraternity allegedly 'left him to die' - instead of taking him to hospital - after he passed out several times during the hazing. The biology student was found unconscious on a sofa the next morning by university staff and taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead - his blood alcohol level was still five times the legal drink-drive limit. Frat members are also accused of removing the zip ties binding Mr Desdunes after he was found unconcious but before police arrived to hide the fact that a hazing ritual was involved in his death. Disbanded: The former base of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon frat at the Cornell University campus in Ithaca, New York . Rest in peace: A memorial service for George Desdunes at Cornell University, which de-recognised the Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter after the death . After the death some former pledges of the fraternity were charged with first-degree hazing and unlawfully dealing with a child. They deny the charges. The fraternity was de-recognised by Cornell University and the chapter suspended by the national Sigma Alpha Epsilon organisation. Mrs Anfre filed the lawsuit at Brooklyn Supreme Court yesterday. She said: 'With the death of my son, I find some comfort in knowing that this lawsuit may bring about changes in fraternities that will prevent other families from suffering as I have.' Her lawyer Douglas Fieberg said: 'No person deserves the indignity of being bound and tied at the wrists, then plied with alcohol, rendered unconscious, and left to die as part of some fraternity ritual. 'George’s death has incited Marie to join the fight against fraternities, their dangerous rituals, and their refusal to stop activities that have killed at least one student every year for the past 40 years.' Cornell said it 'neither condones nor tolerates hazing or the type of activities that we understand contributed to George’s death. 'The matter is now in litigation,' he added, 'and we will be following it closely as it progresses through the courts.'","Cornell student George Desundes died after initiation .

Smashed up: Ms Passarella bought the table from Kmart around three years ago and says she has followed the care instructions closely since then . Proof: Ms Passarella took photos showing the injuries suffered by her family - and she is not the first to have trouble with the table . ‘Because we do not oversee the mechanical design, engineering or manufacturing of the products, we require all of our vendor partners to adopt and comply with product safety programmes and reviews.’ The spokesman then directed customers to Kmart. A Kmart spokesman told 7 News: ‘We believe that these tables are safe’. Kmart and Martha Stewart Living ended a patio furniture contract two years ago and the product is no longer being made.","Martha Stewart Living table exploded on Father's Day .

"By . Allan Hall . Last updated at 6:20 PM on 28th June 2011 . Lawyers in Germany are preparing a groundbreaking court case aimed at stripping diplomats of immunity from prosecution. Human rights lawyers hope the case against a Saudi Arabian diplomat accused of beating an employee will be the catalyst to be able to bring prosecutions against foreign embassy staff worldwide. The German Institute for Human Rights this week published a 60-page study on the reported widespread humiliation, exploitation and abuse of private domestic servants employed by diplomats in Britain, Austria, Belgium, France, Switzerland and Germany. Widespread: The British Embassy in Berlin. A German study has revealed widespread humiliation, exploitation and abuse of private staff by diplomats in six European countries . The UK had 51 cases of abuse reported between April 2009 and March 2010. Many of those involved people who had come to the UK through people traffickers. Some 70 per cent of those employed by diplomats said in a survey, conducted by the Kalayaan Justice for Migrant Workers Group in Britain, that their passports were confiscated and they were paid and treated like 'slaves'. Belgium had 50 cases in 2009 - although only four were referred to authorities - while Switzerland was worst in the list with 62. The report mirrors another published in the U.S. yesterday, which put Britain on the 'top tier' of abuse of diplomatic employees. The landmark court case in Germany concerns a 30-year-old woman who claims she endured daily beatings with a stick for 18 months at the hands of a diplomat from the Saudi Arabian embassy in Berlin. She said she was kicked and 'humiliated like a serf'. 'Top tier of abuse': The Iranian and Ethiopian embassies in London. Britain had 51 reported incidents of abuse between April 2009 and March 2010. There is no indication the incidents took place at these embassies . Unable to speak German and with no money, the Indonesian native was a prisoner of her employer. Eventually, a Berlin group that aids trafficked women from all over the world took her to safety. Diplomatic immunity is laid down in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 and makes embassy employees unanswerable to the laws governing the rest of society. The worst thing that can happen is expulsion back to their homeland. Hamburg lawyer Klaus Bertlsmann and the German Institute for Human Rights are now financing the court case which could give the right to legal redress against diplomats who exploit their staff. He said: 'Human rights are, also from the perspective of international law, a higher good than diplomatic immunity.' The woman was sent by an agency in Jakarta to work at a home in the UAE before transferring her to Saudi Arabia. In April 2009, she accompanied her Saudi employer to Germany were he was to serve as an attache at the embassy, according to the German news magazine Der Spiegel. Her duties included caring for the wheelchair-bound wife of the diplomat and his four daughters - including putting on their shoes each day, even though the eldest was 17 and the youngest 12. She worked from 7am until gone midnight every day, slept on the floor and never had a single day off in the entire time she worked for the family. She told of being punched, of the stick beatings and of how her employer encouraged his five-year-old son to hit her. An earlier court hearing rejected claims of slavery because of the diplomatic status of the alleged abuser. The next step is a hearing at the state court, followed by the constitutional court. Der Spiegel said: 'The fact that a case of modern slavery was brought before a court is already extraordinary in its own right. 'No one checks to see if members of the diplomatic corps obey the regulations regarding working hours and wages that have been in force for the past eight years. It would, after all, violate the principle of immunity.' The legal firm representing the Saudi Arabian embassy dismissed the allegations made by the woman, who has since returned to Indonesia, as 'baseless'.","Indonesian forced to work 18 hours a day serves as test case .

A fugitive sex offender who police want to question over the disappearance of a young nursing student Holly Bobo has been arrested. Victor George Wall, 43, who was convicted of molesting a child in Washington state more than 20 years ago, was found at his girlfriend's home in Duluth, Minnesota. Miss Bobo, 20, from Parsons, Tennessee, went missing four months ago after she was abducted from her home by a man wearing camouflage clothing. Abducted: Holly Bobo went missing from her home in April . Wall was asleep at the time, arrested without incident and booked into the St. Louis County Jail. He will be extradited to Tennessee. He used to live near Bobo's Tennessee home. Victor Wall, seen here in a 2007 mugshot, was arrested at his girlfriend's home . Bobo, a cousin of country music star Whitney . Duncan was last seen being dragged across the carport from her family . home towards a wooded area. Her heartbroken parents Dana and Karen Bobo have continued the search for their daughter but the case has remained unsolved. Her brother Clint Bobo, 25, told . police that he saw his sister outside the house with a man before she . was kidnapped at around 7.30am on April 13. Mr Bobo only saw the man from the back and . told police he believed at the time it was the University of Tennessee . student’s boyfriend. But shocked Mr Bobo later called 911 after he witnessed an attack and saw blood outside the home. Miss Bobo’s lunchbox was later found several miles away. Police had said they believe the man . who kidnapped Miss Bobo could live in or near the college student’s home-town . of Parsons. Officials have not yet reported any previous connection between Wall and Miss Bobo, reported Fox News. Miss Bobo was abducted as she was leaving . for university.She is 5ft 3in tall with shoulder-length blonde hair and . weighs around 110lbs.

Devastated: Her parents Dan and Karen Bobo made an appeal for anyone with details to come forward . She was wearing a pink shirt and light blue jeans at the time of her suspected abduction. Devastated family and friends have been working with police to try and find her. 'Please pray for her': Country singer Whitney Duncan, Holly's cousin, appealed on Facebook . Police conducted a grid . search of the area on horseback and used sniffer dogs and a helicopter . in a bid to find her. The missing student's parents Dan and Karen have made repeated pleas for help in finding their daughter. Barely able to contain his tears, Dan Bobo said earlier this year: 'We've got thousands of people, we've got friends and neighbours and people we don't even know helping us. When asked what he would say to his missing daughter he replied: 'I would tell her I love her, and tell her to call us. 'We are hopeful she is going to be brought back soon.' Speculating on who may have abducted his daughter, Mr Bobo added: 'The way it looks to me myself, it might have been somebody close. 'Somebody that kinda knew our routine, knew when she (Karen) left, when I left, when my daughter left to go to school, is what I kinda got in my mind, but I don't know that for sure.' Barely able to talk, Karen Bobo said: 'Holly I love you so much, please try and get back to us.' Miss Bobo's cousin, the country singer Whitney Duncan, also made an appeal at the time for help to her fans to pray for Holly's safe return. My cousin Holly was kidnapped this . morning,' she wrote on Facebook. 'Please pray for her & our family. This is really sad & shocking.' She tweeted: 'Lord have mercy. I feel . like I'm walking in a nightmare. Thanks for all the prayers and please . keep spreading the amber alert.' Happy: Holly Bobo seen here with her sister and the family dog before the disappearance . Wilderness: Search parties have been scouring the rural areas around Holly's home in the hunt for clues . Abduction: The family home in Darden, Tennessee, where Holly Bobo disappeared earlier this year . Bud Grimes, a spokesman for the University of Tennessee at Martin, said Miss Bobo was studying to be a licensed practical nurse through the Tennessee Technology Center. She was taking classes at the university's extension campus in Parsons, but was not a UT-Martin student. Family friend David Ivey, whose son went to high school with Miss Bobo, said the young woman has an 'angelic voice' and loved to show it off in talent contests at school. She also would sing solos at Corinth Baptist Church where she was a member, he said. Her pastor, Don Franks, from the Corinth Baptist Church, said he has known the young woman all her life and called her 'a fine young Christian girl' with the voice of an angel.","Holly Bobo went missing in April from her home in Parsons, Tennessee .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:10 PM on 1st July 2011 . Police chiefs are set to scrap a plan to replace vultures with sniffer dogs after it turned out to be a miserable failure. The German authorities imported the feathered recruits from Carinthia, Austria, after hearing of their incredible eyesight and fantastic sense of smell. It was hoped these attributes, coupled with the birds' ability to find dead prey would help them to find dead bodies. Vultures are famed for their eyesight and sense of smell - but plans to replace police sniffer dogs with the birds have fallen flat (file picture) But the three birds - named Sherlock, Miss Marple and Columbo - have not only failed to ever find a single cadaver laid out in the wild for them  - but one of the vultures has consistently refused to fly at all. Instead Sherlock walks around at the speed similar to a waddling duck making him far less efficient than the average sniffer dog. In addition to this, the other two birds - Miss Marple and Columbo - spend all of their time fighting. An insider working with the project at Walsrode in Lower Saxony, Germany, confirmed: 'The project has been a disaster.' Early trials with the birds - which have a five foot wingspan - had already ruffled feathers with fans of more traditional methods. 'Everyone knows what vultures do when they find a body and they're not going to be as easy to call off as a Labrador. You could find half the evidence disappearing down their beaks,' said one. When contacted this week for a comment, project creator Hermann Meyer said that the vultures were 'not currently available for journalists.' Trainer German Alonso admitted: 'They don't seem to be able to do anything other than attack each other.' And he revealed further research had been done on the birds which indicated they might not have been the best choice. He said: 'It seems they are rather cowardly birds - they would rather hide in the woods than be out and about in the open.'","Vultures Miss Marple and Columbo fight constantly, while Sherlock refuses to fly, preferring to walk in circles .

"By . Kirsty Walker . Last updated at 12:16 PM on 5th August 2011 . Brainchild: PM's aide Steve Hilton . The death penalty, pulling out of Europe and withdrawing from the European Human Rights Act topped the agenda as the public yesterday got the chance to decide what Parliament debates. The Government launched its  ‘e-petition’ website with the promise to consider discussing any subject which attracts 100,000 signatures. Passions ran so high that the site  continually crashed as thousands sought to raise issues that politicians usually shy away from. Other popular subjects included calls for the legalisation of cannabis and Formula One to be kept on BBC. But last night the subject attracting the most interest, with 6,000 names, was the death penalty – with calls for and against. Forty of the 200 most subscribed petitions called for the return of capital punishment. Seven of the top 200, including the top one with 3,000 signatures, called for it not to be reinstated. The issue now looks certain to attract enough signatures for it to be debated in Parliament for the first time since 1998, and a vote could follow. Among the most prominent  pro-death penalty e-petitions is one calling for child killers and those who murder on-duty police officers to be executed. More than 1,000 people a minute visited the website yesterday. Writing in the Daily Mail yesterday, the Leader of the House of Commons, Sir George Young, warned that MPs cannot ignore the popular groundswell. But critics warned that the e-petitions would allow the Commons to be hijacked by special interest campaigns and mean MPs spending precious Parliamentary time on proposals that have little or no chance of becoming law. Popular petitions included calls for Britain to withdraw from the EU and the European Human Rights Act, an absolute right to self defence in your own home and the decriminalisation of drugs. Others called for prisoners’ diets be restricted to bread and water as in the ‘good old days’. Fail: The highly-anticipated e-petition website crashed within hours of going live . And there were several bizarre petitions including demands that bodybuilding be encouraged to improve the nation’s health, and calls to make it a criminal offence to cruise along in the middle lane of motorways. No 10’s previous e-petition site was suspended ahead of the general election then shelved by the Coalition. But it has been resurrected by David Cameron’s director of strategy, Steve Hilton, with the promise that those that attract more than 100,000 signatures will be considered for debate in Parliament. Several Tory MPs have said they will back calls to reintroduce the death sentence. The last hangings in Britain were in 1964. Tory MP Philip Davies said the public was sick of seeing criminals freed from prison committing  further crimes. Sir George Young wrote in the Daily Mail yesterday that the death penalty is likely to be discussed by Parliament . He said: ‘We should recognise that with advances in technology and DNA the chances of getting somebody wrong for a crime like murder is much more remote than it was in the past. ‘If at the very least this debate ends up with us going back to what we were promised at the time the death penalty was repealed – which was that murderers will spend the rest of their days in prison – then the debate will have served the country well.’ Another Tory MP, Andrew Turner, said: ‘It is about time we had a national debate in Parliament. The number of murders was about half in the 1950s. ‘The state makes the decision about drugs, it makes the decision about young men and women being sent to war and it talks about  abortion. Why are those so different that this particular issue can’t be talked about?’ But fellow Tory MP Dr Kwasi Kwarteng said he would fight attempts to restore the death penalty. He said: ‘The real clincher for me is that you can always get the wrong people and that is a terrible, terrible tragedy.’ Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘Too many politicians come from safe seats which means they only answer to other politicians. They have refused to discuss a lot of issues that matter to a lot of people.’ Any petition signed by more than 100,000 UK citizens goes to the cross-party Commons backbench business committee, which will decide whether it is worthy of debate. This does not mean any parliamentary bills will be tabled as a result, simply that the matter will be discussed. A spokesman for DirectGov, which runs the e-petitions website, acknowledged that many users had experienced difficulties. ‘We apologise for any inconvenience. This is a result of greater-than-expected demand,’ he said.","Website crashed repeatedly as thousands log on .

Mr Hunter spoke just days after the players and owners met but a new collective bargaining agreement failed to get any closer. The controversy is over the NBA’s concern that its economic model must change because 22 of its 30 clubs are unprofitable. The NBA also wants the players’ share of revenue to fall from 57 per cent - and Mr Hunter said the players have agreed to drop to 54 per cent. But NBA commissioner David Stern has his hands tied in his negotiations by hard-line owners, reported the Baltimore Sun.

As the devastated family of a missing New Hampshire girl found dead struggles to come to grips with their loss, the girl's grandfather is speaking out. Dead: Divers found Celina Cass's body on Monday . morning near a hydroelectric dam . The body of Celina Cass, of New Hampshire, was found on Monday in the Connecticut River almost a week after she disappeared, but detectives don’t know how she died. Celina’s grandfather, Wally Laro, told the Boston Herald: 'I just hope justice is brought and whoever’s responsible gets the max because that little girl didn't deserve that.' He added: 'I don’t want no Casey Anthony.' Mr Laro was referring to the murder case out of Orlando, Florida, where Casey Anthony was on trial for the killing of her young daughter Caylee. Last month, Casey Anthony was acquitted of the murder, and released from jail. On Monday, a pick-up truck thought to belong to the troubled stepfather of the 11-year-old girl was been hauled away by investigators. Neighbours said the vehicle taken away is typically driven by her stepfather and while it was on a flatbed outside the house, technicians could be seen examining its undercarriage. Celina's stepfather, Wendell Noyes, was reportedly hospitalised hours before her body was recovered from the river and returned to the community on Tuesday. Witnesses said Mr Noyes was taken away by ambulance on Monday after lying down with his face in his arms outside a home where he had been staying in Stewartstown. Scroll down for video . Justice for Celina: Wally Laro, the grief-stricken grandfather of Celina Cass, demands answers in the case of the 11-year-old, who was found dead on Monday . Mr Noyes was reportedly involuntarily committed to a mental institution and diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2003, and was said to be receiving treatment for his mental illness. Officials are not expected to make any announcements on the progress of their investigation just yet - and the New Hampshire Senior Assistant Attorney General Jane Young would not comment on Wednesday. Ms Young said on Tuesday that an autopsy failed to determine how the girl died - and further toxicology tests and more investigations were needed, but the death was considered suspicious. Investigations: This mobile phone photo shows law enforcement officials standing near the silver pick-up truck being removed from where it was parked near the home of Celina Cass, in Stewartstown, New Hampshire .

Divers found Celina's body on Monday . near a hydroelectric dam that spans the Connecticut River between . Celina's hometown of Stewartstown and Canaan, Vermont. It ended an intense search that at its peak involved more than 100 federal, state and local law enforcement officers. Celina, who lived with her older . sister, mother and stepfather a mile from Canada, was last seen at her . home computer around 9pm on July 25 and was gone the next morning, . authorities said. Police said there was no sign of a struggle and there was no indication she ran away or someone took her. The autopsy was unable to determine . how she died – and community residents were saddened that the autopsy . wasn't able to provide them with any closure. 'I don't even know what to say,’ said . Debbie Whelan whose daughter was Celina’s friend. ‘I thought the . community needed some answers, and I thought we were going to get them . tonight.’ The lack of answers was 'scary,' said . Shannon Towle, who owns a convenience store across the street from the . house where Celina lived with her mother, sister, stepfather and another . man. 'We still don't know what happened, . and that's terrifying,' Ms Towle said. After a news conference, . teenagers gathered in a town park, where candles were lit in Celina's . memory.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:19 PM on 27th June 2011 . A convicted bank robber today became Britain's first prisoner to be given a paid apprenticeship - while still behind bars. Reuben Reynolds, 30, was a member of a four-man gang which netted £250,000 using stolen pick-up trucks to rip ATM machines from the walls of shops and banks in a five-month spree. He was jailed for four years at Lincoln Magistrates' Court in November 2009 after admitting one count of conspiracy to steal. Hammering away: Convicted robber Reuben Reynolds was a member of a four-man gang which netted £250,000 using stolen pick-up trucks to rip ATM machines from the walls of shops and banks in a five-month spree . The Apprentice: Reuben signs along the dotted line watched by, from left, Karen Woodward, of the National Apprenticeship Service, Steve Gelder MBE, and MP Karl McCartney . Reynolds will now work for housing firm The Gelder Group after being freed from his cell at HMP Lincoln to work five days a week as a £3.60-an-hour trainee builder. But Reynolds, who is now studying an NVQ in maintenance, will continue o be monitored by the Prison Service and must sleep in his prison cell every night. Furthermore he cannot spend a penny of his earnings until he is released. A spokesman for The Gelder Group said the apprenticeship will be cancelled if Reynolds steps out of line. She said: 'He's a very lucky boy. He's determined to turn his life around and get back on the straight and narrow. 'He will be closely monitored by us and the Prison Service. He's got too much to lose if it goes wrong. 'He will be working on our new build house and insurance and renovations so homeowners will be told and have the choice to say no if they wish. 'But Reuben has already been working for free on work experience and no one has had any problems.' The apprenticeship course includes painting and decorating, plastering and carpentry through the Sturton-by-Stow firm's new training academy. Work release: Mr Reynolds had been jailed for four years in 2009, but has been freed on licence to work five days a week . He worked several weeks for free on work experience before being interviewed for the position and agreed terms on Friday. During his crime spree Reynolds was part of a four-man gang that stole £250,000 from cash machines from shops and banks during a five-month spree in Lincolnshire. They also took cigarettes and tobacco and caused £13,000 damage. The gang is now serving a total of 16 years. Reynolds is eligible for release later this year on licence after serving half of his sentence. Mike Johnson, group training manager at The Gelder Group, said Reynolds is the first serving prisoner to get a paid apprenticeship in Britain. He said: 'It is the first time ever it has been done and we're proud Gelder Group has been selected to pilot and manage it. 'Reuben is number one and hopefully there will be a lot more. 'We provide them with all the things they will need and help them prepare for when they are released. 'We want to give them the best chance to find employment. We want to help them get back into the community and get back on track. 'There is a stigma attached when you are a prisoner. Sometimes it's difficult to prove it's a one-off and they regret it for the rest of their lives. 'What we're trying to do with this scheme is show that there is value in taking on inmates and past prisoners. 'We are motivated by a passion for training people and getting them back into the community.' Reynold's wages will be kept by the Prison Service until he is released. The company is taking over a training facility at the prison and plans to extend the apprenticeship to 150 inmates by the end of the year. Karl McCartney, MP for Lincoln, described the scheme as 'commendable'. He said: 'This clearly is a milestone in the Gelder Group and the prison services' development programme. 'It is all the more commendable insofar as the Gelder Group, I gather, is the first company to take on a serving prisoner as an apprentice. So well done to all involved.'","Reuben Reynolds was member of four-man gang that stole £250,000 .

Ron Thomas says he will instead sue the city of Fullerton in California after Kelly Thomas, 37, died after he was allegedly beaten up by police. He slammed the city’s offer of $900,000 as ‘a huge insult’ after his son was allegedly shocked with a stun gun, beaten with flashlights and kicked. Dead: Mentally ill homeless man Kelly Thomas, 37, was beaten and tasered to death by police for allegedly 'resisting arrest' Mr Thomas told CNN he had originally . avoided hiring a lawyer because he wanted to be a ‘voice for my son’ but . has since changed his mind. ‘I do need an attorney for this, and . I've been talking to some,’ he said, following the death of his son . almost a month ago on July 10. Witnesses described a shocking attack . on his son five days before, in which a person in distress can be heard . calling out for their father. Police attended a scene where a man . was allegedly trying to break into cars near a bus station and found . suspect Kelly Thomas there.

"Quarter of Royal Mail's business comes from junk mail . Scam mail costs victims £2.4bn a year . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:49 PM on 5th July 2011 . Cost: Disposing junk mail is costing English councils more than £50m per year . Taxpayers' are forking out more than £50 million a year - just to get rid of junk mail that is dumped on their doorsteps. Last year the county of Cornwall alone paid £700,000 to send 4,000 tonnes of unwanted leaflets, pamphlets, menus and glossy adverts to landfill - enough to fill 500 dustcarts. If it was recycled it would still cost a staggering £500,000 to process. The claim comes as, tonight, the BBC's Panorama reveals that Royal Mail 'financially relies' on the distribution of junk mail - which is now said to be vital to the service's future. Richard Kemp, Local Government Association vice chairman, said: 'If you extrapolate [the Cornwall figure] across England it's more than £50 million a year. 'We've got to cut down the stuff going into the waste streams, there's a lot of unwanted packaging. 'If people stop producing this stuff then we could make significant savings to their council tax, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.' Tonight's Panorama will look at the role Royal Mail plays in getting junk and scam mail, of which it delivered 1.7 billion pieces last year, to residents' front doors. It focuses on its links to Spring Global Mail, which handles vast amount of mail for legitimate international business, but is also alleged to be used by scam mail fraudsters. Royal Mail owns 33 per cent of the firm, in partnership with the Dutch postal service Post NL, that sends large amount of scam mail into Britain. And once that mail, which bears the official Royal Mail postmark and is not evidently from abroad, has entered the UK postal system the service has a legal obligation to deliver it. Profitable: Royal Mail is said to earn a quarter of its money through distributing junk mail . Fraud investigators said the Royal Mail logo was seen by some victims as a stamp of legitimacy, giving credence to the scammers' claims. Mike Haley, director of the National Fraud Authority, said: 'We're trying to make Spring Global and Royal Mail more aware of the human tragedy that this type of fraudulent mail impacts on victims. 'I think they need to understand the terrible consequences of delivery of this mail to some people.' Marilyn Baldwin, whose late mother Jessica Looke was scammed out of £50,000, said the official stamp of approval 'proved the scams were real' to her, and that it was now up to the Royal Mail to protect the vulnerable. She said: 'My mother used to say, it isn't a scam, it's genuine. This is the Queen's mail. 'Royal Mail are delivering, in effect, coach loads of criminals to the houses of elderly and vulnerable people. They are the link between the victim and the scammer.' A spokesman for Royal Mail said it was working closely with police to stop scam mail from entering the system. He said: 'We very much understand the upset and disquiet that scam mail can cause households across the country, including vulnerable people. 'We do not want our postmen or women handling or delivering mail that causes harm. We have made significant progress in our efforts to root out scam mail as we intensify our drive against it.' Spring Global said it too was working closely with police and other agencies to prevent scam mail slipping through, and that since January it had removed six million items out of the system. Of the 'local look' postmarks, it said in a statement: 'Local look is a recognised international marketing activity to prepare mail with a foreign postal indicia. Not wanted here: Junk mail has become so undesirable that many homes are putting up signs asking for it not to be delivered . 'This happens across the world and not just in the UK. The vast majority of companies using such a service are legitimate businesses that are looking to reduce costs and improve response rates.' But Richard Hooper, who authored a report for the government on Royal Mail's future, said legitimate junk mail was central to the financial viability of Royal Mail. He found that income from legitimate advertising mail accounted for nearly a quarter of Royal Mail's letters business - £1.3bn out of a total of £5.4bn. Making a mint: Royal Mail has to, by law, deliver any items which enter into the postal system . He added: 'The supreme irony is that without advertising mail, you would not have a universal postal service.' The Direct Marketing Association said sales due to junk mail totted up to £16bn a year and that half of the UK population had bought goods as a result of a piece of direct mail last year. And Alex Walsh, its head of postal and environmental affairs, said: 'I do think we do need to make a differentiation between advertising mail and junk mail. 'For us it's very simple, junk mail is irrelevant and poorly targeted. That is waste and unnecessary. However, legitimate advertising mail is a different matter. It's whether it's relevant to those people. 'We have a very strict code of practice in terms of targeting and supression. 'And in fact the industry has made huge steps in the use of that. Inevitably there is some instances where that is not going to be accurate. 'But we are on the verge of signing a voluntary agreement with Government that will give us some very hard measurable targets to achieve our targets.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:40 AM on 28th June 2011 . The son of a sheriff's deputy has today pleaded not guilty to the brutal killing of a 16-year-old girl, despite earlier admitting to police he carried out the crime. Robert Schwander, 17, of Traverse City, Michigan told police he did kill Carly Lewis but claimed her death had been an accident. Miss Lewis was stabbed 10 times, the fatal blow being a near five-inch deep slash to her neck, according to a forensic pathologist. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Carly Lewis, 16, was stabbed 10 times, the fatal blow being a near five-inch deep slash to her neck, according to a forensic pathologist . On June 14 Schwander led police to the shallow grave site where Miss Lewis' bloodied body had been buried in sand at a public works yard. That was after he confessed to killing the school girl following a lie detector test, police said. Miss Lewis disappeared on June 2. She had been due to meet up with Schwander at around 6pm that day. Police believe she was killed in a shack off the city's Beitner Street that same evening. Schwander then moved her body to the public works yard two days later, they added. Charged: Robert Schwander, 17, pleaded not guilty to the killing but earlier admitted the crime to police saying it had been an accident . June 15 would have been the popular blonde teen's 17th birthday. Instead, an autopsy was being carried out on her body. Miss Lewis' devastated mother Susie told the Record-Eagle that her family had known Schwander well and that he had been in the same class as her son, Mitchell. Earlier this year she even welcomed Schwander into the family home to stay for a couple of months after he left his own. 'I brought him into my home, and that’s why it hurts so much,' Miss Lewis told the paper. 'It’s hard to fathom that somebody you know could do that. This isn’t easy.' Scene: Police tape stretches around a vacant building off Beitner Street where police believe Miss Lewis was killed . A 'Justice for Carly Lewis' Facebook group, that has so far attracted 2,835 people, turned from one of calls to find the teen to one of tributes today. A friend of the girl put together a picture slideshow on YouTube while others took time to write heartfelt messages on the group's wall. Lissa Velveeta Hromada wrote: 'Carly you were amazing so bright and full of life your smile would and could just brighten up a room.' While Jaered Elwell wrote: 'Jail is meant specifically for these types of disgusting people, and honestly, he shouldn't be given the privilege to live.' As a sheriff's deputy Schwander's father Scott, is reportedly a pillar of the community and is currently on paid leave following his son's arrest. Schwander made his plea today via a video link from the Grand Traverse County Jail. His attorney Clarence Gomery said despite the teen calling Ms Lewis' death an accident, he recognises the 'seriousness and potential consequences' of it. 'You’re not talking about a hardened criminal here,' he said before Schwander's arraignment last week. 'You’re talking about confused kid who might have made a horrible mistake and is about to realise his whole life is going to be changed because of that horrible mistake.' Schwander was denied bail and is due back in court on June 27. Watch friend's moving tribute to Ms Lewis . Now watch news report on today's hearing .","Carly Lewis had been missing since June 2 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:32 PM on 5th August 2011 . Sickening: Corporal Stephen Curley was killed by a bomb detonated by a 14-year-old Afghani boy . A Royal Marine was blown up in Afghanistan by a 14-year-old boy who was promised just $80 to set off a roadside bomb. Father-of-one Stephen Curley, 26, was killed instantly when the bomb was detonated in the town Sangin in Helmand province in May last year. Just days after his death the boy's father handed him in to the local police and he confessed to setting off the device. The boy named Aga Wali confessed to the killing after the Taliban reneged on their promise to pay him, saying he should be acting out of insurgent zeal. An inquest at Exeter heard today how the boy had been sentenced to imprisonment by Afghan authorities but that it is not known how long he will serve or if he is still in custody. The boy was handed into the Afghan police at the same base in Sangin where Corporal Curley had been stationed until his death. However, he was never handed over to British security or intelligence officers but was instead questioned by the local Afghan chief of police. Stephen's widow Kirianne, aged 28, who is caring for their 17-month-old son William on her own, only learned of the hired killer hours before the start of the inquest when she was shown statements from two Royal Marines officers. Loss: Corporal Curley with wife Kirianne and their then five-week-old son William Arthur. The family did not learn about the circumstances of his death until today's inquest . Lieutenant Colonel Paul James, who was in charge of operations with 40 Commando at the time said he had been informed of the boy's confession. He said: 'I received a report from the Afghan national police that a 14-year-old boy had been handed in by his father for being the trigger man in an IED attack. 'The boy was named as Aga Wali and he admitted firing the device which killed a Royal Marine in Southern Sangin on a date which corresponded to the explosion which fatally wounded Corporal Curley. 'The father was concerned that his son was embarking upon a life as a fighter with the Taliban and feared for his life. 'He said Aga Wali had been told he would be paid $80 by the Taliban but when he went for payment they said aggressively he should be fighting for ideological reasons and not financial gain. 'Aga Wadi left angrily and felt betrayed. The boy was detained briefly within the national directorate of security before being processed through the courts and a sentence of imprisonment was imposed of an uncertain period of time.' Good relations: Royal Marines from 40 Commando, greet a local boy in Sangin in September last year . Captain Dom Rogers said: 'It was brought to my attention the Afghan national police had detained an adolescent named Aga Wali and there was speculation he had been handed in by his father. 'He was questioned by the local chief of police and I was present during the latter stages with an interpreter to ensure it was conducted in the correct manner. 'In my presence he admitted activating an IED and acting as the trigger man. 'He was unable to read a map but was able to describe the ground and it fitted with that where Corporal Curley was wounded fatally. 'From this information and the time and date when he said the event took place it was reasonable to assume he was responsible for initiating the IED that killed Corporal Curley. British forces on patrol in the town of Sangin in Helmand Province, Afghanistan . 'I was told the chief of police had taken the initial confession and there had been a written statement which he had signed, . 'He was flown to Lashkar Gar by an US military helicopter and tried through the Afghan justice system. 'He was arrested and detained by the Afghan police and remained in their custody throughout under Afghan law. 'I was later told by the chief of police he was given a prison sentence but we have no further details about the sentence.' Greater Devon coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland said: 'All I will say is that any report to this court from the Afghan National police has yet to be received and I am told the matter is being pursued by agencies in theatre.'",Youngster was handed into police by his father after Taliban bosses refused to pay him for roadside attack .

A mother regained consciousness in hospital today to be told the tragic news that her husband and two children had been killed in an arson attack at their home. Angela Sharkey's husband Thomas, 55, eight-year-old daughter Bridget and 21-year-old son, also called Thomas, died after the attack on their flat in Helensburgh, near Glasgow on July 24. Mrs Sharkey, 46, who had been sedated after suffering serious burns, was given the grim news by her sister Margaret McKenchie after she came round in a ward at Glasgow's Royal Infirmary. Sole survivor: Angela Sharkey awoke in hospital to be told her husband and two children had been killed in an Arson attack . Ms McKenchie said: 'There was such sadness in her eyes and I can't begin to explain how shattered she is by this terrible, terrible news. 'We're absolutely heartbroken at the deaths of young Thomas, Bridget and of course their dad Tommy as well. 'She was totally and utterly devastated to hear from me that her two lovely young children had been taken from her. 'Her family was her life and she has been robbed of any future with them. It's so, so sad that she will never see young Thomas and Bridget grow up.' Close family: A holiday photo of Angela Sharkey with her eight-year old daughter Bridget and 21-year-old son Thomas . Police have launched a triple murder investigation with a 55-strong team of officers working on the case. The fire broke out in the living room of the flat at around 5.10am on July 24 and quickly spread. Strathclyde Police said the building had just one door and the family became trapped by the flames. The heat of the blaze caused a downstairs window to explode and left an area of severe scorching around the front door of the property in Scott Court. Mr Sharkey Senior was seen hanging out of the window and shouting for help. His son was found dead at the scene. The rest of the family were taken by ambulance to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley where Bridget died a short time later. Mr Sharkey and his wife both suffered serious burns and were moved to Glasgow Royal Infirmary, where he died on July 30. Ms McKechnie added: 'On behalf of my sister Angela I would like to ask anyone please, please if you have any information, don't be afraid to come forward to the police to help us solve this horrible crime.' Thomas junior, an extremely talented golfer, was in the country after returning home from the U.S. where he had a Golfing Scholarship at Georgia Southern University. In his biography on the Georgia Southern Eagles website, he described himself as 'ambitious and competitive', adding that his grandfather and father were the biggest influence on his athletics career for teaching him golf. His sister Bridget is believed to have died after coming home from a planned sleepover because she missed her parents. Police said they are keen to speak to people who were at two parties which took place near Scott Court on the night of the blaze. The parties went on into the early hours of the morning. They are also keen to speak to two men seen in the vicinity at around 5am. A man in a grey hooded top was seen crossing West Princes Street near James Street at about 5am and another man was seen going on to John Street between 4am and 5am. Police are examining CCTV collected from around the Argyll and Bute town and are visiting more than 500 houses and business premises. Detective Superintendent Peter McPike . said: ""There are no suspects at the moment. Clearly we are really . desperate to find out why this has taken place. 'Perhaps once we can establish that we will be closer to finding a suspect.' Family members (left to right) Margaret McKechnie, Gemma McFadyen and Val McFayden appeal to to the public for information during a police press conference . He added: 'I don't think people in Helensburgh are holding back. I do think that perhaps there might be a small number of people who might well be in receipt of information that could be crucial to the investigation and I would appeal to the consciences of those people to come forward and to contact us.' He said that police will wait until medical staff give approval before they speak to Mrs Sharkey, whose condition is still critical. Valerie McFadyen, 51, Thomas Sharkey Senior's sister, said: 'These murders have torn our family apart and it is something that no family should ever have to go through. It is very hard to come to terms with this. 'Someone knows who carried out this appalling act, and we do not understand how anyone could protect this killer who has murdered three members of our family. We would urge people to please look at your conscience and make that vital call to police to help us. 'We would like to thank people for their messages of condolence and help. But please keep doing all that you can to help police and help find those responsible.'

Heavy downpours arrived shortly before the 1pm scheduled start of play, as tournament officials said there would be a delay of at least one hour. Covers went on the courts and the Centre Court roof was moved into place so that play could continue. But the rain was so relentless at Wimbledon that as it pounded down on the £80m Centre Court roof, the umpire had to shout to make himself heard during play.

Elsewhere, lightning struck electrical signalling on train lines in Southall which affected commuters leaving Paddington. Lightning strikes meant delays of up to 90 minutes on services in the Welwyn Garden City and Hertford North areas of Hertfordshire. Passengers affected were on trains run by the East Coast, First Capital Connect, First Hull Trains and Grand Central companies. Passengers travelling on Heathrow Express trains to the airport were among those whose journeys were disrupted. Another lightning strike was at signalling at Petersfield in Hampshire.

There were also disruptions to one of the UK's busiest airports after lightning hit an air traffic control tower. The incident, at Gatwick airport in West Sussex at around 2pm, led to the temporary failure of some ground-based systems. Planes continued to land but there were no departures for around half an hour. No one was hurt and there was no structural damage.

Golf Wag: Tom Lewis's girlfriend Lara Cornell is all smiles on day two of the British Open . Lara yesterday proved to be somewhat of a good luck charm as Lewis stunned the sporting world with a record-breaking 65 to share the lead. It is the first time an amateur has led after opening day since 1968, and the lowest score by an amateur at the Open. Although his father Bryan, a teaching pro, was too nervous to watch his son play, Lara was all smiles as she joined the rest of Tom's family at Royal St George's. Making history: Amateur Tom stunned the golfing world yesterday by sharing the lead . Lewis, from Welwyn Garden City, has been playing golf since he was four-years old. He was named after his father's idol, 61-year-old golfing legend Tom Watson, who, ironically, he is playing with in the opening two rounds this week. His second round couldn't quite match the brilliance of Thursday's effort, but at -1 he is still well on course to make the cut for the weekend.

Robert Faulcon, Seargeant. Robert Gisevius and Officer Anthony Villavaso deny any wrongdoing in the shootings that killed 17-year-old James Brissette and . 40-year-old Ronald Madison, who was severely mentally disabled. Brissette is said to have died in a hail of gunfire when officers opened up without reason while Maddison was allegedly shot in the back with a shotgun minutes later. Mr Lohman told the jury that when he arrived at the scene of the shooting, none of the junior officers could explain why they opened fire. He said he arrived at the bridge to find 'people lying on the pedestrian walkway with multiple gunshot wounds' but no evidence of any of them being armed. But after finding the body of Mr Madison, he became increasingly concerend that he could see lot of wounded people but 'no guns'. 'They seemed to be unsure of what . actually happened,' Lohman recalled. 'There was too much uncertainty, . and things didn't add up.' He said he told the officers to go 'collect themselves, calm down and then come back and tell me what happened.' He indicated that he expected them to make up an untrue story according to WDSU New Orleans. He . said Officer Kenneth Bowen then came back and said, 'What about this? I . kicked the guns off the bridge because the scene was still hot. I did . not want anyone else to pick up the guns.' Lohman said he put Sgt. Arthur Kaufman in charge of the investigation. Accused: Sergeant Kenneth Bowen and former New Orleans police officer Robert Faulcon pictured as they handed themselves in over the Danziger Bridge shootings in 2007 . Handing themselves in: Sgt. Robert Gisevius, left, and Anthony Villavoso were also greetedby supporters when they handed themselves in . Prosecutors say the confusion started when police officers on a nearby interstate reported that someone was shooting and gave the impression they had a 'man down'. Shortly afterwards nine officers arrived on the nearby Danziger Bridge and opened fire. The Bartholomew family came under fire and four of them were injured. Susan Bartholemew had her arm shot off and 17-year-old James Briseete was shot dead. Officers say they were shot at but no weapons were found at the scene. Further up the bridge, another officer is said to have opened fire with an assault rifle at mentally-disabled  Ronald Maddison ansd his brother Lance. Officer Faulcon is said to have driven up the bridge, got out and shot Ronald Maddison in the back before stomping on his body and arresting his brother unharmed. No weapons were found at the scene . Lohman expressed concern that there . were no guns on the scene. He said Kaufman told him he had a gun he . could put on the scene. He then asked Kaufman whether the weapon was 'clean,' meaning it could not be traced, and Kaufman said it was. Lohman then said he told Kaufman that 'if he was going to do it, to do it and not talk about it with anyone else. Just do it.' 'The guys who were involved in this were co-workers, and some of them were friends of mine. I didn't want anybody to get into trouble,"" Lohman said. 'I feel pretty horrible about all of it, but most particularly about the people who were killed and wounded.They were people who didn't deserve what they got.' His evidence came a day after the court heard a woman describe how her arm was blown off as officers opened fire. Susan Bartholemew  told jurors she felt bullets piercing . her body as she huddled with her husband and teenage daughter behind a . concrete barrier. She recalled that her daughter, lying on the ground . next to her, tried to shield her body from the hail of gunfire. She recalled that her daughter, lying on the ground next to her, tried to shield her body from the hail of gunfire. I prayed. I just called to the Lord because I didn't know what else to do,' Bartholomew said. Bartholomew said it wasn't until after the shooting stopped that she realized police officers had shot her, leaving her right arm hanging by just a strip of skin. She said the officers approached them as they lay on the bridge, threatened to kill them and yelled at them to hold up their hands. 'Of course I couldn't because my arm was shot off,' she said. 'I raised the only hand I had.' Opening arguments started Monday with prosecutors painting a picture of out of control police opening fire on unarmed civilians without following proper procedure. Defense attorneys countered with a portrait of stressed, tired, overworked officers reacting to what they thought was an attack on fellow officers. 'They cut loose with assault rifles . and shotguns and they did so without ever identifying themselves,' Justice Department attorney Bobbi Bernstein said of the officers. 'The . mistake they made was thinking anyone walking on the Danziger Bridge . that day was a criminal.' The . officers are accused of plotting to plant a gun, fabricate witnesses . and falsify reports to make the shootings appear justified. Five other . former officers already have pleaded guilty to participating in a . cover-up. Crime scene: A caution tape floats in the wind over a walkway running alongside the Danziger Bridge . A .223 caliber shell casing lies alongside the road on Danziger Bridge in eastern New Orleans, Louisiana November 10, 2005. They are cooperating with the government and are expected to testify during the trial, which could last up to eight weeks. Defense attorneys said their clients had honored their oaths to protect and serve, quickly beginning rescue missions even though they too suffered from the hurricane's destruction. They saw death and suffering, worked in horrifying conditions and heard gunshots so frequently at night they had to stop rescue missions when the sun went down. Holmes survived, but Brissette died on the east side of the bridge. On the west side, Faulcon allegedly shot Madison in the back with a shotgun as he and his brother, Lance Madison, were fleeing from the gunfire. Ronald Madison was lying on the ground when Bowen walked over and asked a fellow officer, 'Is that one of them?"" before he repeatedly stomped on the dying man, Bernstein said. 'This was a tragedy for everyone involved, police officers and victims,"" said attorney Lindsay Larson, who represents Faulcon.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:59 AM on 6th August 2011 . Just two weeks after the end of its historic shuttle programme, Nasa will today launch a solar-powered spacecraft on a mission to Jupiter. The robotic explorer Juno is set to become . the most distant probe ever powered by the sun. The windmill-shaped craft is equipped with three tractor-trailer-size solar panels for its two . billion-mile journey into the outer solar system. It will blast-off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 11.34am local time (4.34pm BST) aboard an unmanned Atlas V rocket. Scroll down for video . Eve of lift-off: An Atlas V rocket with Nasa's Juno spacecraft payload sits on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral in Florida last night. The robotic explorer is set to become the most distant probe ever powered by the sun . After the landing of shuttle Atlantis prompted waves of nostalgia around the world, the demise of that Nasa programme is giving extra oomph to the $1.1billion voyage to the . largest and probably oldest planet in the solar system. It will take Juno five years to reach its target, five times farther from the sun than Earth. No spacecraft has ever ventured so far, powered by solar wings. Europe's solar-powered, comet-chasing Rosetta probe made it as far as the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Each of Juno's three wings is 29ft long and 9ft wide, necessary given that Jupiter receives 25 times less sunlight than Earth. The panels - folded for launch - emanate from the spacecraft much like the blades of a windmill. At Jupiter, nearly 500million miles from the sun, Juno's panels will provide 400 watts of power. In orbit around Earth, these panels would generate 35 times as much power. It is the first . of three high-profile astronomy missions coming up for Nasa in the next . four months. Jupiter - a planet several Nasa . spacecraft have studied before - is so vast it could hold everything . else in the solar system, minus the sun. Scientists hope to learn more . about planetary origins through Juno's exploration of the giant . gas-filled planet, a body far different from rocky Earth and Mars. Jim Gree, Nasa's director of planetary science, said: 'Look . at it this way - it is a new era. 'Humans plan to go beyond low-Earth orbit. When we do . that, it's not like Star Trek. It's not ""go where no man has gone . before"".' Plunging deeper into space will require robotic scouts first, he said. Scott Bolton, a Southwest . Research Institute astrophysicist and Juno's principal . investigator, said it's also important for people to realise that 'Nasa's not . going out of business.' 'If we're going to . learn who we are and where we came from, and how Earth works, we've . got to keep doing these science missions, not just Juno,' he said. Environmentally-friendly: The windmill-shaped craft is equipped with three tractor-trailer-size solar panels for its two billion-mile journey into the outer solar system . How it will look: Each of Juno's three wings is 29ft long and 9ft wide. The panels - folded for launch - are here seen emanating from the spacecraft much like the blades of a windmill . Nasa's . long-range blueprint would have astronauts reach an asteroid by 2025 . and Earth's next-door neighbour Mars a decade later, although there's . still uncertainty surrounding the rockets needed for the job. A Juno . success would be a good sign for future solar-powered missions of all . types. Jupiter may be just two planets over, but it's far enough away to be considered the outer solar system. It . will take Juno five years to reach its target, five times farther from . the sun than Earth. No spacecraft has ever ventured so far, powered by . solar wings. Europe's solar-powered, comet-chasing Rosetta probe made it . as far as the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The . choice of solar was a practical one, Mr Bolton said. No plutonium-powered . generators were available to him and his San Antonio-based team nearly a . decade ago, so they opted for solar panels rather than develop a new . nuclear source. They wanted to avoid ballooning costs and possible . delays connected with developing new technologies. He said: 'It's nice to be green, but it wasn't because we were afraid of the plutonium.' Long journey ahead: It will take Juno five years to reach its target, five times farther from the sun than Earth . Passengers: Three Lego figurines representing the Roman god Jupiter, his wife Juno and Galileo Galilei will travel aboard the Juno spacecraft on its journey to Jupiter . Indeed, . Nasa's six-wheeled, Jeep-size Mars rover named Curiosity, due to launch . in late November, will be powered by more than 10lbs of plutonium. Despite safety efforts, there's always the question of public safety if . an explosion occurred. Nasa's Grail mission - twin spacecraft to be launched next month to Earth's moon - employs solar panels. Eight . robotic craft have already flown to or near Jupiter and its many moons, . as far back as the 1970s - Nasa's Voyagers and Pioneers, Galileo, . Ulysses, Cassini and, most recently in 2007, the Pluto-bound New . Horizons. Juno - named after the . cloud-piercing wife of Jupiter, the Roman god - will go into an . oval-shaped orbit around Jupiter's poles in July 2016, after travelling . 1.74billion miles. The craft will fly within . 3,100miles of the dense cloud tops, closer than any previous . spacecraft. Any closer, and Juno would feel the tug of the planet's . atmosphere, which in turn would alter the spacecraft's orbiting path and . hamper its gravity experiment. The spinning . spacecraft will circle the planet for at least a year, beaming back data . that should help explain the composition of its mysterious insides. Each orbit will last 11 days, for a total of 33 orbits covering 348million miles. Nine instruments are on board, including JunoCam, a wide-angle colour camera, which will beam back images. Destination: Jupiter as seen by the New Horizons spacecraft in 2007 . Juno's . most sensitive electronics are inside a titanium vault to protect . against the incredibly harsh radiation surrounding the planet. The . radiation exposure will worsen toward the end of the mission. 'We're . basically an armoured tank going to Jupiter, Mr Bolton said. Scientists . believe Jupiter was formed from most of the leftovers of the sun's . creation. That's why it is so intriguing - by identifying the planet's . contents, besides hydrogen and helium, astronomers can better explain . how the solar system came to be. Mr Bolton said: 'We want to . know that ingredient list [for Jupiter]. What we're really . after is discovering the recipe for making planets.' For . these answers, Juno will study Jupiter's gravity and magnetic fields, . and turbulent, cloud-socked atmosphere, which can spawn 300mph wind and . hurricanes double the size of Earth. The experiments will investigate . the abundance of water, and oxygen, in Jupiter's atmosphere and help . determine whether the planet's core is solid or gaseous. Once . its work is done in 2017, Juno will make a kamikaze dive into Jupiter. Nasa doesn't want the spacecraft hanging around and crashing into Europa . or other moons, possibly contaminating them for future generations of . explorers.","Juno to blast-off from Cape Canaveral at 11.34am local time (4.34pm BST)

A 95-year-old woman asked to remove her adult diaper by TSA agents has spoken for the first time about her embarrassing ordeal. Lena Reppert, who is in the final stages of a battle with leukaemia was detained and . humiliatingly searched at a Florida airport while in a wheelchair - but, remarkably, says she is 'too old to care'. Her daughter Jean Weber, claims Mrs Reppert was asked to remove an adult diaper in order to complete a pat-down search after TSA agents felt something soggy around her thigh area. Scroll down for video . Ordeal: Lena Reppert said she was 'too old to care' despite the humiliating pat down experience . Stunned: Mrs Reppert's daughter was angry at TSA for what she called an unnecessary search . Speaking to 24 Hour News 8, Mrs Reppert said TSA agents took her into an examination room. She said: 'That's when they took my pants. 'They do a really good job of patting you down. They really give you a physical exam, almost.' 'I guess it bothered my daughter more than it did me. I guess I’m too old to care. 'I didn’t let it bother me for some reason. 'It was an episode of embarrassment, so to speak, but then I got on the plane OK, and after that everything was OK. 'When I get on the plane, I don’t want anyone on there that has got something in their pockets, like a knife or a gun or whatever.' Jean Weber claims her leukaemia-stricken mother, 95, was made to take off her adult diaper by airport security in Florida, who are standing by their actions . Ms Reppert was trying to board a plane to fly to Michigan in an attempt to be with relatives as she battles the disease, Ms Weber said. Her mother entered security in a wheelchair because she could not walk through by herself and was detained for 45 minutes. But Ms Reppert was pulled aside into a separate area and patted down before being moved to another room to protect her privacy. Security . staff then said they needed her diaper removed because it was soiled . and was preventing them from completing their search. Ms . Weber, who removed her mother's diaper in a bathroom for her, said she . did not understand why her mother had such an extensive search. Speaking to the station she said: 'They took excessive measures.' When asked what sort of threat her mother may have posed, she added: 'Can't . think of anything really. 'I really can't.' Ms Weber has filed a complaint with the Department of Homeland Security after the incident last weekend at Northwest Florida Regional Airport. ‘It’s something I couldn’t imagine happening on American soil,’ she told the Northwest Florida Daily News. ‘Here is my mother, 95-years-old, 105lbs, barely able to stand, and then this.’ The humiliating search took place at Northwest Florida Regional Airport, pictured . Despite outrage over the incident, the TSA released a statement defending its agents' actions in the search. 'While every person and item must be screened before entering the secure boarding area, TSA works with passengers to resolve security alarms in a respectful and sensitive manner,' the TSA said. 'We have reviewed the circumstances involving this screening and determined that our officers acted professionally and according to proper procedure.' A TSA spokesman told the Northwest Florida Daily News it would be dangerous for them to exempt any group from screening. ‘We know from intelligence that there are terrorists out there that would then exploit that vulnerability,’ a TSA spokesman said.

Cecilia Mortensen, 14, passed away on Saturday, after doctors removed life support Friday at Sutter Coast Hospital in Crescent City, California. Cecilia had been pronounced brain dead earlier in the week, but doctors had reportedly kept her alive so they could harvest her organs for donation to those in need. That process was completed on Friday, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. New life: Cecilia Mortensen, 14, died at Sutter Coast Hospital in Crescent City, California Saturday. Her organs were donated to those in need . Shooter: Accused child molester Jerry Wayne Steele allegedly shot Cecilia Mortensen and her mother on July 14, before killing himself . Police say Cecilia was shot in the face on June 14 by Jerry Wayne Steele, 60, who was out on bail after being charged with molesting the 14-year-old at least four times over four years, starting in 2007. Police say Steele also shot Cecilia's mother, Ashley Volore, 49, in the head. She is recovering in an Oregon hospital and is expected to survive. Beth Liles, a spokesperson for Sutter Coast Hospital, confirmed to MailOnline.com that Cecilia had been a patient, and that she died on Saturday. Ms Liles would neither confirm nor deny any details of Cecilia's treatment or whether she had organs donated, citing patient confidentiality. She said she was unaware of the details of any organ donation agreement, but said in the case of minors it is up to the parents to make the decisions. Ms Volore and her daughter had moved to the Shangri-La trailer park in Crescent City, in northern California, seven weeks ago from Santa Clara County, which is in the Bay Area. They reportedly moved to escape Steele and start a new life. They had a restraining order out against him. Recovering: Ashley Volore, 49, is expected to recover, though her 14-year-old daughter Cecilia Mortenson has passed away, after her organs were donated . Police say after he shot his victims on June 14, he was found nearby, sitting in his rental car. When police approached, he shot himself in the head, then died. Police say Steele was upset after he had learned he would spend the rest of his life in prison over a plea deal for his seven felony child molestation charges. Steele, who was free on $250,000 bail, allegedly drove over 400 miles to seek out his victim and her mother and had been attempting to kidnap them. Police said when the mother and daughter put up a struggle he shot them both in the head. Authorities said Steele had begun molesting the girl when she was 10 years old. She told police he took indecent photographs of her with his cell phone and the abuse would be carried out when he visited their home. Police found the photo images on his phone when he was arrested. The abuse was revealed in January after Cecelia became terrified when Steele held a razor to her throat. She told her father who informed police. Police say Steele tracked his victims to a trailer park in Crescent City, California, where they had hoped to start a new life . Steele, who lived with his mother and sister, was arrested on multiple sex abuse charges, which he denied. Del Norte County Sheriff's Cmdr. Bill . Steven said investigators found a 'kidnap kit' in a duffel bag in the . backseat of Steele's car that included night-vision goggles, a stun gun, . duct tape, rope and zip ties.

"By . Nick Mcdermott . Last updated at 11:24 AM on 4th July 2011 . A Nigerian woman who has cost the NHS up to £200,000 after flying into Britain while expecting quintuplets is to fight for the right to stay. Bimbo Ayelabola, 33, who had been taking double doses of a fertility drug while in Africa, applied for a six-month visitor’s visa within days of discovering she was pregnant. Busy: An operating theatre at Homerton Hospital - one of London's busiest - where Mrs Ayelabola gave birth . As soon as it was granted, she travelled to the UK without her husband late last year on the pretence of visiting her three sisters. An emergency NHS scan showed she was expecting four babies. Owing to the size and complexity of the birth, she underwent a caesarean section 32 weeks into her pregnancy on April 28. During the procedure at Homerton Hospital in East London, doctors discovered there was a fifth child. She gave birth to two boys, Tayseel and Samir, and three girls: Aqeelah, Binish and Zara. Although she was due to leave last week, she believes the children are too frail to travel and has instructed lawyers to seek an extension to her visitor’s visa. The total bill to the taxpayer for Mrs Ayelabola’s care alone is expected to reach £200,000, which she is unable to pay. The five babies were all treated in a special care unit because they were born prematurely, at a cost of £1,000 a day for each of them. Consequently, the cost of a week’s hospital care for the family would be a staggering £35,000 for the taxpayer. The issue has raised yet again the issue of so-called ‘health tourism’ – in which foreigners can use Britain’s state-funded health system. It is estimated to cost the NHS £200million a year. Foreign nationals should be charged for the full cost of any treatment they receive, with most hospitals employing overseas visitor managers whose job is to identify those who must pay. But urgent treatment such as maternity care will always be provided regardless of residence status or ability to pay. Hospitals must then take reasonable measures to recover any debts from overseas patients. Many bills are never settled, however. And border officials repeatedly report seeing passengers arriving in an advanced state of pregnancy after securing a visitor’s visa. Around 150 cases a year are identified at Gatwick Airport. Expensive: The cost of a week's hospital care for the five babies is a staggering £35,000 for the taxpayer (File photo) Mrs Ayelabola, whose 37-year-old husband, Ohi, remains in Nigeria, has signed a five-figure deal with a red-top newspaper. She said in an interview: ‘I had already had miscarriages and couldn’t bear the stress another pregnancy would cause. So I decided to visit my family in London. I thought I would stand a much better chance of avoiding another miscarriage in a calmer place with friends and family. ‘Now if I go back I’ll be on my own without even a roof over my head. My entire family support network – three sisters, four aunts and virtually all my school friends – live here.’ Mrs Ayelabola says she was unaware she was expecting as many as five children. The multiple birth is the likely result of the fertility drug Clomid, which she purchased over the counter in her home city of Lagos. She began taking two pills a day – double the normal dose – and continued the regime for eight times longer than recommended. Her children are being cared for with the help of her 26-year-old sister Stella, with whom she is living at a two-bedroom flat in Poplar, East London. ‘The NHS is a national health service, not an international one.' Mrs Ayelabola, who is not entitled to any state benefits and does not have the right to work, says she is struggling to pay for her family, with nappies and milk powder alone costing her £70 a week. Despite being born in the UK, the children do not have an automatic right to British citizenship. To qualify, they would need at least one parent who is British, or who has indefinite leave to remain in the country. A spokesman for the Home Office said: ‘The NHS is a national health service, not an international one. We expect those with no right to be in the UK to leave voluntarily otherwise we will seek to remove them.’ The UK Border Agency can deny someone entry into the country if they believe they are seeking free healthcare. But the rules are hard to enforce. In March, the Government announced plans to tackle health tourism. Measures include preventing anyone who owes the NHS more than £1,000 from entering the country until the debt is paid off. Last night, from behind a closed door, Mrs Ayelabola said: ‘I am not happy about what has been written about me, that is not what I told them. You need to speak to my lawyer, I do not want to comment.'","Row escalates over foreign use of British state-funded health system .

New deal: Tiger Woods can now be seen on Japanese TV promoting a pain reliever, his first endorsement since he was caught in a sex scandal in late 2009 . Cheer up, Tiger. You've staged a comeback in the lucrative world of TV commercials... at least in Japan. Tiger Woods can now be seen pitching 'Vantelin Kowa' Japanese heat rub in 15-second spots for the Kowa Corporation on Japanese TV. It's arguably some good news for the golf superstar, who has had a rough few years, since allegations surfaced in November 2009 that he was having numerous extramarital affairs. The golf great hasn't won a major tournament since before his infidelities surfaced, and he has recently been plagued with injuries. As a result of the bad press, several top-flight advertisers ended their relationships with Mr Woods, 35, including Accenture, AT&T, Gillette and PepsiCo. It's unclear how much money Mr Woods will be earning from the Japanese TV spots, which first aired Friday, in a deal that was announced on Wednesday. A spokesperson for Kowa told AFP: 'We don't think there is any', when asked if there was any . risk in using the disgraced athlete. It's certainly true that Kowa has now appeared on the radar of millions of consumers in the West, many of whom likely hadn't heard of the company or its products. Tiger rub: Vantelin Kowa packages are seen at a drug store in Tokyo on June 30. Tiger Woods' TV commercial for the product started airing on July 1st . More Kowa products for sale in Tokyo . Time will tell if other companies will follow suit and seek endorsements from Mr Woods, now that Kowa has stepped up as the first one to do so after the scandal. The New York Post noted that this marks Mr Woods' second endorsement contract with a Japanese firm, since he had signed . a three-year deal with Asahi Soft Drinks in 1997 to promote canned coffee for an estimated $11 million. Mr Woods lost an estimated $35 million a year in cancelled endorsement deals as a result of his scandal, according to Forbes. Even so, the dirty secret is that the golfer has retained the top spot as the world's highest paid athlete, making $75 million over the past 12 months ending in May. That's a whopping $22 million more than the next . ranked sports star, basketball player Kobe Bryant. Mr Woods had to miss the U.S. Open due to injury, and he may not make the British Open July 14 through 17. Mr Woods has won 14 major titles in his brilliant career, though he has yet to fully bounce back from his 2009 scandal. It's no secret that he faces an ugly and supremely expensive divorce, but at least he is making some new money. Former glory: Tiger Woods used to appear in Gillette commercials, before the contract was cancelled after his sex scandal.

"By . Daniel Bates . Last updated at 1:07 AM on 4th August 2011 . A British defence contractor was amongst the targets of the world’s largest ever cyber attack, thought to have been carried out by China. Hackers tried to infiltrate the unidentified company to find out sensitive military secrets during an unprecedented five year worldwide campaign, according to a report. A total of 72 national governments and well known companies along with bodies such as the International Olympic Committee all fell victim to the operation. Hacked: The United Nations building in New York. The UN was one of 72 organisations infiltrated by the biggest cyber attack in history . Experts said the most probable . culprit was the Chinese government which has recently been blamed for . cyber campaigns against the International Monetary Fund and Sony. The scale of the operation - which . covered 14 countries - has stunned American computer security company . McAfee, which discovered it. ‘This is the biggest transfer of . wealth in terms of intellectual property in history. The scale at which . this is occurring is really, really frightening,’ Dmitri Alperovitch, . the security company’s vice president of threat research said. ‘Even we were surprised by the . enormous diversity of the victim organizations and were taken aback by . the audacity of the perpetrators’. McAfee dubbed the hacking ‘Operation . Shady RAT’, or remote access tool, referring to a kind of computer . software used to infiltrate networks. In addition to the British defence . contractor, a computer security company from the UK was also hit but . neither have been identified. Amongst the other victims which have . publicly been named are the World Anti-doping Agency, the United . Nations, the Associated Press news agency and ASEAN, the Association of . Southeast Asian Nation which counts Singapore amongst its members. The U.S. was hacked the most - 49 . times - followed by Canada four times and South Korea three times. Britain was affected twice. The data stolen included e-mail archives, . design schematics, legal contracts and government secrets. Long infiltration: In the case of the UN, the hackers broke into the computer system of its secretariat in Geneva in 2008, hid there for nearly two years, and quietly combed through reams of secret data . McAfee said the hacking dates back to the middle of 2006 although there may still be intrusions which it has not yet detected. The attacks lasted from a matter of . weeks to a sustained 28-month attack against an Olympic committee of an . unidentified Asian nation. The operation worked by sending an . e-mail which when opened downloaded a malicious programme onto an . individual’s computer which allowed an intruder to gain access to their . network and remove data. McAfee learned of the operation last . March when it gained access to one of the hackers’ servers and began . notifying companies which had been affected and working with them to . improve their security systems. James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert . at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said there was . only one country that could be responsible for the attack. ‘The most likely candidate is China,’ he said. ‘Who else spies on Taiwan?’ China has long been suspected as being the world’s leader in cyber espionage. Mr Lewis added: ‘Everything points to . China. It could be the Russians, but there is more that points to China . than Russia’. There was no comment from China on the report. Britain’s Ministry of Defence, one of the prime targets, was alone the victim of more than 1,000 cyber attacks last year. Last year, cyber crime cost the . British economy £21billion according to one industry report, but it is . widely accepted that the figure could be much higher. In 2009, a foreign intelligence . agency infiltrated the Pentagon’s £200billion Joint Strike Fighter . project, the U.S. defence department’s costliest weapons programme in . history. Cyber spies stole data relating to . the aircraft’s design and electronic system. Officials said the attacks . appeared to originate from China. Google, the Pentagon, Chinese dissidents, and the oil industry has also been hit.

One of Michelle Bachmann's former chiefs of staff launched a scathing attack on his old boss today, claiming she was 'decidedly' not ready to be president. Ron Carey, who worked for Mrs Bachmann last year, described her offices as 'wildly out of control' and criticised her for a lack of leadership experience. It came as the 55-year-old attempted to mend her increasingly gaffe-prone reputation in a television interview this morning - only to make another historical mistake by claiming John Quincy Adams was a Founding Father. Under fire: Michele Bachmann at a meeting in Raymond, New Hampshire, today, as her former chief of staff attacked for a lack of leadership experience . In fact, he was just nine-years-old at the time of the Declaration of Independence. And yesterday, the Republican made another embarrassing gaffe,when she inadvertently compared herself to serial killer John Wayne instead of the actor. In an article for the Des Moines . Register, Mr Carey, who worked for Mrs Bachmann for several months last . year, says his former boss doesn't have the leadership experience needed . to be president. Attack: Ron Carey said his former boss Michele Bachmann was 'decidedly' not ready to be president . He conceded she had 'great oratory skills', but added: 'She is not prepared to assume the White House in 2013.' Mr Carey, who served as chairman of the Minnesota Republican Party from 2005 to 2009, says he knows Mrs Bachmann 'very well'. But he believes she offers no challenge to fellow candidate Tim Pawlenty, for whom Mr Carey also worked. He was particularly scathing about Mrs . Bachmann's managerial skills. He wrote: 'The Bachmann campaign and . congressional offices I inherited were wildly out of control. 'Stacks upon stacks of . unopened contributions filled the campaign office while thousands of . communications from citizens waited for an answer . 'If she is unable, or unwilling, to handle the basic duties of a campaign or congressional office, how could she possibly manage the magnitude of the presidency?' Today she was out on the campaign trail again at a meeting in Raymond, New Hampshire. She formally launched her presidential bid yesterday, from her hometown of Waterloo, in Iowa. Gaffe-prone: Michele Bachmann launched her presidential campaign in Iowa yesterday, but is already attracting criticisms for her inaccuracies . She . tore into President Obama as she sought to capitalise on a sudden surge . in poll ratings, which have put her ahead with fellow candidate Mitt . Romney. Rising star: Michelle Bachmann waves to crowds with her husband, Marcus, after she officially launched her presidential campaign in Waterloo, Iowa . Strong support: Mrs Bachmann's address, at a mansion in Waterloo, won her rapturous applause - but today she was criticised by a former aide . The Minnesota congresswoman has won support from many in the Tea Party for her hardline opinions on abortion and gay marriage, but she has also attracted criticism for her inaccuracies. According to Politifact.com,a political fact-checking service, Mrs Bachmann's record for inaccuracy is worse than all the other Republican candidates. Yesterday she told Fox News: 'Well what I . want them to know is just like, John Wayne was from Waterloo, Iowa. That's the kind of spirit that I have too,’ she told Fox News. On the road: Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann greets a young fan at a campaign meeting in Raymond, New Hampshire . Unfortunately for Mrs Bachmann, that John Wayne is in fact John Wayne Gacy, also known as the 'Killer Clown', who was executed in 1894 for raping and murdering more than 30 boys and young men. He was born in Chicago, but later moved to Waterloo where he began his crime spree. Although the actor of the same name is originally from Iowa, he was in fact born in Winterset - more than 150 miles away. Politifact.com, a political fact-checking service, examined 24 of Michele Bachmann's recent statements for their accuracy. It found just one to be fully true and 17 to be false - more than any other Republican candidate whose statements have been vigorously vetted. They include: . The claim: 'The farm is my father-in-law's farm. It's not my husband and my farm. It's my father-in-law's farm. And my husband and I have never gotten a penny of money from the farm.' (Fox News Sunday) The facts: In personal financial disclosure reports produced by members of Congress each year, Mrs Bachmann said she holds an interest in a family farm in Independence, Wisconsin, with her share worth between $100,000 and $250,000. The farm, which was owned by her father-in-law, produced income for Mrs Bachmann of at least $32,500 and as much as $105,000 from 2006 to 2009, according to the reports she filed for that period. The farm also received federal crop and disaster subsidies, according to a database maintained by the Environmental Working Group. From 1995 to 2010, the farm was given $259,332 in federal payments. When asked about the subsidies and her income from the farm late last year, a spokesman for Bachmann said only that she wasn't involved in decisions about the running of the farm. Yesterday she said her husband became a trustee of the farm because his father had dementia before he died two years ago, and he now 'oversees the legal entity'. She insisted she and her husband receive no farm income, despite the forms reporting it. The claim: 'If you look at one of our Founding Fathers, John Quincy Adams, that's absolutely true. He was a very young boy when he was with his father serving essentially as his father's secretary. 'He tirelessly worked throughout his life to make sure that we did in fact one day eradicate slavery.' (Good Morning America) The facts: John Quincy Adams was not a Founding Father. He was nine-years-old when the Declaration of Independence was made and 20 when the Constitution was adopted . His father, John Adams, was a Revolutionary War figure and an architect of the declaration - and therefore a Founding Father. Both father and son became president. Mrs Bachmann was defending her earlier, inaccurate remark that the Founding Fathers had devoted themselves to ending slavery. John Quincy Adams, president from 1825 to 1829, privately called slavery a 'great and foul stain', but largely sidestepped the issue in office, according to The Reader's Companion to the American Presidency. He tried to avoid antagonising the South, while reasoning that his push for a stronger central government would hasten slavery's end over time. The claim: 'Well what I want them to know is, just like John Wayne was from Waterloo, Iowa, that's the kind of spirit that I have, too.' (Fox News) The facts: Wayne the actor was born in Winterset, Iowa, nearly three hours away, and moved to California in his childhood. John Wayne Gacy, convicted of killing 33 men and boys, was born in Chicago, moved to Waterloo to work in his father-in-law's chicken restaurants and first ran afoul of the law there, sentenced to 10 years for sodomy. He began his killing spree after his release, and his return to Illinois. Bachmann told CNN on Tuesday her comments 'were just misspeaking' and that her main intent was to show she identified with Wayne's patriotism. The claim: 'Overnight we are hearing that potentially 10 to 30,000 people could have been killed in the strike.' (She was criticising Mr Obama in May for the 'foolish' U.S. intervention in Libya, and citing what she said were reports of a civilian death toll from a NATO strike as high as 30,000)The facts: The U.S. ambassador to Libya, Gene Cretz, said in late April that U.S. officials have seen reports that 10,000 to 30,000 people may have died in Gaddafi's crackdown on protesters and the fighting between rebels and pro-government forces, but it is hard to know if that is true. He was speaking about all casualties of the conflict; no one has attributed such a death toll to NATO bombing alone, much less to a single strike. The claim: 'It's ironic and sad that the president released all of the oil from the strategic oil reserve... There's only a limited amount of oil that we have in the strategic oil reserve. It's there for emergencies.' (CBS's Face the Nation) The facts: Mr Obama did not empty all the oil from the strategic reserve, as Bachmann said. He approved the release of 30 million barrels, about 4 per cent of the 727 million barrels stored in salt caverns along the Texas and Louisiana coasts. It's true that the U.S. normally taps the reserve for more dire emergencies than exist today, and that exposes Obama to criticism that he acted for political gain. But the reserve has never been fuller; it held 707 million barrels when last tapped, after hurricanes in 2008. The claim: 'That's the number of new drilling permits under the Obama administration since they came into office' (comment  to a conservative conference in Iowa in March) The facts: The Obama administration issued more than 200 new drilling permits before the Gulf oil spill alone. Over the past year, since new safety standards were imposed, the administration has issued more than 60 shallow-water drilling permits. Since the deep water moratorium was lifted in October, nine new wells have been approved.","Former chief of staff says Michele Bachmann lacks leadership experience .

A baseball fan dressed in a green Morph suit ran onto the pitch during a game in Madison, Wisconsin, and managed to wrestle, sprint and slide his way to escape from SIX security men in pursuit. He made his exit via a large door at the back of the field - which was being held open by a yellow Morph man, who promptly shut it in the faces of the onrushing staff. Scroll down for video... Arms flailing: Dressed head to toe in green, the Morph man comes onto the pitch from the Duck Blind stand of the stadium . A video of the comical incident has attracted nearly 100,000 hits since it was put on YouTube a week ago, with one user commenting: 'hahah this was awesome, what an escape assisted by the yellow man.' It came at the top of the fifth innings of a match between Madison Mallards and Battle Creek Bombers, two collegiate summer baseball teams. First, the fan takes everyone by surprise by leaping from the stands and running across the field arms flailing. First obstacle: The Morph man comes up against two security men and decides to dart to the left . Floored: An older member of staff hauls the Morph man to the ground - but he rolls over and gets out of his grasp . Then, he charges towards staff when they come to stop him and it looks like his fun is over as he is wrestled to the ground. But despite four officials surrounding the masked man, he manages to push one away and makes a dash for the far fence. One shove and away: The lycra-clad individual pushes a staff member and makes a dart for the back of the field . Out-paced: The ground's security staff fail to keep up with the anonymous prankster . Slippery: One security man goes for a slide tackle in the wet conditions but fails to grab Morph man's heels . As he sprints away, attempts at slide tackles are poorly timed and even a sixth security man can't keep pace with the prankster. But with seemingly nowhere to go, his chances of escape don't look good. That is until a large door at the back of the field, used for bringing in batting cages, is opened by his accomplice dressed in a yellow Morph man costume. To the rescue: The green Morph man has help in the shape of a yellow Morph man, who holds open the door used to bring batting cages onto the field . Slammed shut: The yellow Morph man completes the stunt by locking in the staffers . They exchange a high five as the green Morph man runs out and the stunt is complete when the door, which locks from the outside, is slammed shut in the staff members' faces. Another YouTube user posted: 'I watched this from the duck blind (the stadium's main stand) and couldn't stop laughing!' Mallards president Vern Stenman told MailOnline he had never seen anything like it before and said he thought is could be an former employee with knowledge of how the door works. Mr Stenman said: 'Our staff are kind of perplexed. We're used to having people on the field but usually they are drunk so easy to handle.' There was a similar stunt days later when the green man escaped by climbing up a rope ladder dropped down over the far wall by his yellow accomplice.",Got help from a yellow Morph man .

When it comes to expressing romantic regret in epic love songs, Bryan Adams is considered something of a master. Now the Canadian rocker may need all his songwriting skills after apparently failing to inform his lover he was expecting a child with his personal assistant. Adams has denied even being in a long-term relationship with glamorous advertising executive Antonia Harrison, 36. But she says they had been dating each other for two years and that Adams has still not told her the truth about Cambridge-educated Alicia Grimaldi’s pregnancy. Antonia refused to see the singer, who is best known for his hit ballad (Everything I Do) I Do It For You, on learning about the baby. But friends say he has tried to get back in touch with Antonia and they believe he wanted to see her again. A friend of Antonia’s revealed: ‘Bryan has never confirmed to Antonia that the child is even his but we can only assume so. He has still never answered a direct question on it. Lots of people believe he would have preferred never to tell the public about the baby. ‘Maybe Bryan would have liked to continue seeing Antonia and looking after Alicia and the baby. ‘But he didn’t have any choice when it came to Antonia – she refused to see him again after hearing the news. ‘They did tentatively speak as friends on many occasions. I believe Antonia had a thought in her mind that it could all go back to normal.’ Last week, 51-year-old Adams was pictured outside his £2.4 million London home with his first child, three-month-old Mirabella Bunny, who was born on Good Friday. The baby has come as a shock to Antonia, who began seeing Adams at the start of 2009.The friend said: ‘Antonia had kept their relationship to herself for a few months. She smiled a lot around that time – a lot.’ Alicia Grimaldi (left) carrying her and the singer's baby Mirabella Bunny and Adams' current girlfriend Antonia Harrison . Adams would call Antonia whenever he was in London and arrange to meet. ‘He is a very, very busy man and obsessive about not stopping for one minute. For a clean-living man, that is his addiction. He travels perhaps two weeks out of every four. Antonia saw him when he was in Britain. ‘He made her glow. Even though she didn’t like to talk about him, you could tell that she was very happy. She is a passionate character so the relationship was obviously very passionate. ‘They would talk about photography, fashion, music and film. They’re both into anything cultural. Antonia studied history at university and reads everything and anything. ‘She likes to learn from people and found his knowledge of world topics a very attractive aspect of his personality. ‘They also found each other very physically attractive.’ Antonia also has a high-powered job as deputy general manager of the luxury atelier division of creative ad agency Leo Burnett and was happy to accept the erratic nature of their relationship. The friend said: ‘I believe that there was a “we live for today” attitude between them. But he never gave off any signs of wanting to settle down and Antonia’s not a jealous person anyway.’ The couple were seen at upmarket restaurants where teetotal and strict vegan Bryan would nurse a hot water with lemon. Sometimes he would sing to her. Crooner: Adams is best known for his ballad (Everything I Do ) I Do It For You, which spent an astonishing 16 weeks at number one in the charts . ‘I think when they were together it was their time – hiding away from the world in his place. It was all very romantic, I suppose.’ Bryan was forever welcoming guests into his many homes, and troubled actress Lindsay Lohan once stayed for three weeks with girlfriend Sam Ronson. Late singer Amy Winehouse also stayed at his house on the Caribbean island of Mustique, which she ‘hated – he only had beetroot and carrot juice in the fridge’. Despite this generosity, Antonia’s friend said: ‘When he is busy then love life comes second. I know an ex-girlfriend of his from way back and she said he was very selfish and everything was only on his terms.’ In October, Antonia was invited . to spend time with Adams after his concert in Manchester, and the couple spent the night together in the city’s Lowry Hotel. But by this time Alicia was already pregnant. Alicia, 31, who is the daughter of the Isle of Wight’s deputy lieutenant Peter Grimaldi, met Adams in 2004 while helping to set up his Bryan Adams Foundation, which provides grants to support vulnerable people. Mr Adams’ spokesman Gary Farrow last night dismissed the friend’s comments and added: ‘It’s all been done before.’",Friends tell how Canadian rocker went on dating glamorous British woman despite making his secretary pregnant .
"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 4:38 PM on 21st July 2011 . It’s certainly not your average city view when looking out of a downtown Manhattan flat. A World War One fighter plane sits on top of the roof of a 26-storey tower built by the William Kaufman Organization more than 40 years ago in New York City near Wall Street. Locals have often wondered how it got there - and whether the 1916 British Sopwith Camel landed on the roof of 77 Water Street. Now they have a definitive answer. Spot the Sopwith: A World War One fighter plane sits on top of the roof of a 26-storey tower built by the William Kaufman Organization more than 40 years ago in Manhattan, New York . The William Kaufman Organization decided it wanted something a little different to air-conditioning and water tanks to adorn the roof of its new building in the 1960s, reported the Wall Street Journal. ‘You can’t just impose these buildings . and ignore the people that have to look at them. It’s very satisfying when you do something people . so appreciate’ Robert Kaufman . Company president Robert Kaufman said they thought looking down on buildings from higher up usually made for an ugly view. ‘So we said: “What can we do?”,’ he explained. ‘And we got the idea of putting an airplane on the roof.’ ‘You can’t just impose these buildings and ignore the people that have to look at them,’ he told the Wall Street Journal. ‘It’s very satisfying when you do something that people so appreciate.’ Previous mystery: Locals have often wondered whether the 1916 British Sopwith Camel landed on the roof of 77 Water Street and how it got there . But the plane never landed on the roof. It is actually an artistic re-imagining of the 1916 aircraft that was designed by Rudolph de Harak and constructed by sculptor William Tarr. The Sopwith Camel was hoisted into place by a crane in 1969 and has been there ever since. Developer Shawn Hakimian has housing on . Wall Street overlooking the building on Water Street, where the biplane . is parked on a landing strip with runway lights. Starting point: This Sopwith F-1 Camel shows what the artistic re-imagining of the 1916 aircraft was based on . ‘It’s not every day you see an airplane taking off from a New York City building,’ he told the Wall Street Journal. ‘It’s one of our buyers’ most commonly asked questions.’ But 77 Water Street is not the only Kaufman-owned building with a twist in New York City. A three-storey chess board can be found on a cement wall at 767 Third Avenue, where historic matches have been recreated. And a cat cashing a canary on tiles can be seen at 127 John Street.","1916 British Sopwith Camel fighter plane on Manhattan rooftop .

The father of 11-year-old Celina Cass, whose body was found this week, is bedridden with exhaustion and severe heart problems. The unsolved death of Adam Laro's daughter is said to be 'killing him' while detectives continue to investigate her 'suspicious' death after autopsy results were inconclusive. Meanwhile a neighbour of the family, who live in the small town of Stewartstown, said Celina's home was more like a 'party stable' with people coming in and out all the time. Robbie . Kimball, the owner of nearby Wayne’s Lanes and Jo’s Grill, said: 'They had people that were in and out of there all the time. It was the get-together hangout.' Celina went missing from the bedroom of her home almost two weeks ago and a large-scale search was underway until her body was recovered in the Connecticut River on Monday. According to relatives she will be placed in a pink casket and cremated soon. Her grandmother, Marcia Laro, told the Boston Herald that Celina's father's health is deteriorating because of her unsolved death. She said: 'Today was not good. His heart . is critical. He was supposed to have open-heart surgery, but he’s too . weak for it...His health is very bad.' Adam Laro suffered congestive heart . failure and spent more than a week in a coma prior to Celina’s . disappearance the night of July 25. He left the hospital last week and . made a public plea for her return - against doctors’ advice. Police have seized two pick-up trucks in their investigation - one belonging to her stepfather Wendell Noyes, who has a history of mental illness, and the other driven by another man who lives at her home. Natasha Newell, who works with Celina’s mother Louisa Noyes, said other relatives, including Louisa’s . ex-boyfriend’s son, her sister and her aunt, also lived in the house. Community residents were saddened that the autopsy wasn't able to provide them with any closure. Father: The unsolved death of Celina is said to be 'killing' Adam Laro, who is seriously ill with exhaustion and heart problems .

'I don't even know what to say. I thought the community needed some answers, and I thought we were going to get them tonight,' said Debbie Whelan, whose daughter, a friend of Celina's, was sobbing after watching a news report on a TV monitor. The lack of answers was 'scary,' said Shannon Towle, who owns a convenience store across the street from the house where Celina lived with her mother, sister, stepfather and a man named Kevin Mullaney, said by neighbors to be the son of a former boyfriend of her mother, Louisa Noyes. 'We still don't know what happened, and that's terrifying,' Towle said. Celina's death has been deemed . suspicious, based on what divers found, and investigators were treating . the case as a criminal investigation. Search: Investigators search near the dam where the body of Celina Cass was found on Tuesday . Grim: Divers recovered Cass' body from the Connecticut River on Monday a quarter-mile from her home . After the news conference, teenagers gathered in a town park, where candles were lit in Celina's memory. 'Someone has to light the way for Celina,' said Kayla Baglio, 18. 'It's to let her know no matter what, people are going to be here for her.' On Tuesday, investigators combed the area along the river, which divides Vermont and New Hampshire, above where Celina's body was found. A crime scene technician said they were doing computer-aided diagramming to give them a precise electronic image of the area.

A crime scene technician said they were doing computer-aided diagramming to give them a precise electronic image of the area. Celina's stepfather, Wendell Noyes, who reportedly was hospitalized hours before her body was recovered from the river, returned to the community Tuesday. Witnesses said Noyes was taken away by ambulance Monday after lying down with his face in his arms outside a home where he had been staying in Stewartstown. Hospital officials declined to say whether he was a patient. Shannon Towle, owner of Towle's Mini-Mart, said she sold him cigarettes Tuesday morning.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:52 PM on 7th August 2011 . Convicted child sex offender Warren Jeffs walked out of his sentencing hearing in protest today, telling the court there would be a 'whirlwind of judgement' on the world if God's 'humble servant' wasn't set free. Polygamist cult leader Jeffs, 55, made the bizarre outburst after representing himself during the eight-day trial that ended with his conviction of sexual assault against two under age church members. The news comes as shocking . pictures emerged showing Jeffs holding and passionately kissing an . underage female church member. And as the Texas court began today to consider punishment for Jeffs today, prosecutors told the jury to expect more sickening revelations, including the fact he had 24 underage 'wives'. Sickening: Jeffs is seen embracing one of his child brides as he smiles at the camera . Shocking: The pictures of Jeffs and one of his child brides compounded damning evidence brought by prosecutors . Other pictures revealed to the court today showed beds where ritual sex sessions were carried out in front of a church audience. State witness Rebecca Musser - a former FLDS member - told the court she had received training about how beds in the temple were to be used in sexual rituals before it was built. Miss Musser told the court beds inside the temple were arranged so that witnesses could see the abuse and that a special seat was placed for someone to record the sexual acts. Also called to testify was Utah psychologist Larry Beall who described Jeffs' grooming of the underage girls as being 'like a peadophile'. Mr Beall, who has worked with FLDS victims, said some of the abused girls may not even recognise they have been sexually assaulted - such was their 'mental conditioning' He said: 'The adolescent girl in the FLDS community has no frame of reference to understand she is a victim. 'He [Jeffs] was an expert at taking average sounding words and making them sexual.' Mr Beall then gave examples where Jeffs used phrases such as 'being ready' and 'heavenly sessions' to refer to sex. At the start of today's punishment phase, and before jurors had even been brought back into court, Jeffs absented himself from events saying: 'I request the full removal of myself as an objection to all that has been presented.' He asked to keep serving as his own attorney, but state District Judge Barbara Walther said he couldn't leave and continue to represent himself at the same time. Instead, she ordered two lawyers who had been Jeffs' standby counsel, Deric Walpole and Emily Munoz Detoto, to represent him. Abuser: These are just some of the shocking images that show convicted child sex cult leader Warren Jeffs with one of his child 'wives' Shocking: A law enforcement officer, right, escorts Rebecca Musser, left, a former member of the church and a witness for the prosecution . 'Mr Jeffs, I know this is difficult for you to understand, but you do not have control over these proceedings,' Walther said. Jeffs often stands in court and waits up to a full minute before speaking. He began in slow and deliberate manner to respond, saying 'I am . . .,' but Walther ordered a recess. Jeffs is the ecclesiastical head of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which believes polygamy brings exaltation in heaven. The more than 10,000 FLDS members nationwide see Jeffs as a prophet who is God's spokesman on Earth. Worship: Temple of the Fundamentalist Church . of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in El Dorado, Texas, where the . 'heavenly sessions' with the young girls took place . Jeffs asked to be taken back to jail, but Walther said that would make it too difficult for his lawyers to communicate with him. Irons: Jeffs, center, arrives in wrist and leg shackles to the Tom Green County Courthouse for the sentencing phase of his sexual assault trial today . Instead, he was placed in a room near the court and will be allowed to return to the hearing whenever he chooses. The judge said Jeffs won't be able to dismiss his attorneys again and go back to defending himself, however. He burned through a slate of seven high-powered attorneys, including Walpole and Detoto, in the six months before he decided to represent himself, and Walther said he did so in an effort to manipulate the court and stall the case against him. Prosecutors plan to call witnesses . during the sentencing hearing and introduce evidence showing Jeffs . committed a slew of crimes not mentioned during his trial. For . starters, Jeffs had 78 wives along with his legal spouse, and 24 of . them were under age 17, said Eric Nichols, lead prosecutor for the Texas . Attorney General's office, which is handling the case.

"By . John Stevens . Last updated at 7:23 PM on 8th August 2011 . A former New York City police . officer, acquitted of raping a drunken . woman after helping her get home, was today sentenced to a year in jail for official misconduct. Kenneth Moreno, 43, the lead officer in the 'rape cop' case was labelled a corrupt liar who thought he was 'above the law' by prosecutors as he was sentenced. 'When law enforcement officers commit . a crime, they rip at that fabric that holds us together and you, sir, . ripped a gaping hole in that fabric by committing your crimes,' said . State Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro. Led away: Kenneth Moreno was today sentenced to a year in jail after he was convicted of misconduct . He blasted Moreno's insistence that he only had chivalrous intentions in 'counselling' and 'spooning' in bed with the semi-naked, vomiting woman. 'You're a trained police officer,' the . judge told him. 'It's not too far a stretch to believe that you couldn't . avoid being in that bed with a naked female.' The 29-year-old alleged victim who was sat in the front row as Moreno was sentenced appeared to sob as Moreno was led away. She had requested to make a victim . statement during the proceedings, but the judge had refused as she is . now not legally a victim after Moreno and fellow officer Franklin Mata, . 29, were acquitted of rape. A grim-looking Kenneth Moreno was led . away after the sentence was pronounced in state Supreme Court. Convicted: Kenneth Moreno, pictured, and his colleague Franklin Mata had been summoned to help the drunken woman get out of a taxi in December 2008 . Moreno and Mata were fired from the police . department within hours of their convictions for official misconduct in May. Although acquitted of raping the . female fashion executive, each was convicted of three counts of . misconduct for being in the woman's apartment when they were supposed to . be on patrol. 'You were in bed with an intoxicated naked young woman - that is official misconduct,' said Mr Carro. The judge criticised defence lawyer Joseph Tacopina's argument that Moreno was more of a 'simpleton' than a sexual predator. 'Simpleton like a fox,' Mr Carro said. 'During your testimony, you told a . story that was incredible,' the judge added. 'Your testimony was classic . for admitting what you couldn’t deny, denying what you couldn’t admit . and classic tailoring of your testimony to the witnesses who testified . before you.' Last steps of freedom: Kenneth Moreno, arrives at State Supreme court with attorney Joseph Tacopina . Moreno said he had gone back to the . woman's apartment three times after the first call - even placing a . phony 911 call about a sleeping vagrant to provide a pretext for one of . the visits - only to try to comfort her and give advice about drinking. People in this city must be able to rely on this, that when they call . 911 for help, the police who arrive will, in fact, help,' Assistant . District Attorney Coleen Balbert told the judge. 'He demonstrated that . he had no regard for the law.' Moreno's lawyer Joseph Tacopina had pressed for probation, noting that the . ex-officer's first-time conviction was for a misdemeanour and already . has already cost him his 17-year job and his pension. Probation . officials had said there was no need to jail Moreno, he added. 'I'm going to ask the court to have the same courage that that jury had in rendering that verdict,' Mr Tacopina said. Some jurors said later that they had too much doubt to convict in a rape . case with an accuser who acknowledged her memories were spotty - and . without DNA evidence implicating the officers. But the verdict spurred . outrage from women's advocates, a few of whom demonstrated outside the . courthouse on Monday. Caught on camera: CCTV footage shows the two police men outside the woman's apartment . Mata's sentencing was postponed until Wednesday. Mata . and Moreno met the drunken woman in December 2008 after a taxi driver . called for help getting her out of his cab. She told authorities she . passed out and awoke to being raped in her bed, saying she acutely . remembered being violated despite being unclear on significant parts of . the night. And she secretly recorded a conversation days later in which Moreno alternately denied they had sex but said 'yes' twice when she asked whether he'd used a condom. Moreno told jurors he was trying to mollify her. The former officers acknowledged returning to her apartment three times without telling dispatchers or supervisors what they were doing - the genesis of their misconduct convictions. In fact, Moreno admitted he even placed a phony 911 call about a sleeping vagrant to provide a pretext for one of the visits. The officers said she'd asked them to . come back and check on her, and Moreno said he felt impelled to give . her advice about drinking and to comfort her. He said that she made . advances and he ultimately ended up cuddling with the barely dressed . woman in her bed, but that they didn't have sex. Mata said he was . sleeping on her sofa while the others were in the bedroom. Still free: Franklin Mata leaves court after his sentencing is postponed until Wednesday . The . woman said in a statement after the verdict that her 'world was turned . upside-down by the actions of two police officers who were sent there to . protect but instead took advantage of their authority and broke the . law.' The case ignited . protests from women's advocates, who saw it as a discouraging example of . the difficulty women face in coming forward with a sexual assault . complaint. KC Washington, a . member of the National Organization for Women's New York board of . directors, stood outside the courthouse, holding a sign that said, . 'NYPD: Protect Women.' She said she had been 'horrified' by the rape . acquittals. 'We can't keep silent,' she said. 'We're just sending a message to the people who make the policies, and the judges, that it's not OK.' The case ultimately pitted the woman's word, with some support from the recorded conversation, against the officers' denials. At the trial, their lawyers underscored the lack of forensic evidence and the fact that the woman had sued. I thought she made the whole thing up,' Moreno said after the verdict. In trying to help her, he said, he 'made a judgement call... and I paid for it.'","Judge tells Kenneth Moreno that he 'ripped a gaping hole' in the 'fabric that holds us together'

"By . Oliver Pickup . Last updated at 4:18 PM on 8th August 2011 . America's Federal Bureau of Investigation have launched an application which can track lost children - but they insist that they are not taking the vital information provided to spy on users. The controversial Child ID - which is free - went on sale at the end of last week in America and is designed to help parents speed up the process of contacting the relevant authorities should their young on go missing. When the app, which needs a mobile device with a camera, is activated, the FBI, the police and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children can be contacted at the click of a button. Helping hand: Child ID has been launched to help parents in America to quickly contact the authorities should their child go missing . Compatible with Apple's iPhone, iPad 2 and iPod Touch, the new application allows those with young ones to fill in vital statistics about their children, so that they can save time when raising the flag if one goes missing. Parents will be invited to input information about their child's height, weight, name, nicknames, ethnicity, date of birth, home address and a variety of other important information that would assist police in finding the lost child. Along with the statistics, parents should, in addition, take a photograph of their little one with the mobile device and send that along with the other information. The FBI have said that they are developing plans to add support for using pictures stored on the device - a move that will allow parents to use photos taken with another camera and sent to the mobile device via e-mail or a direct transfer. The new application, which is free, was released on Friday . Further, the application has tips about the best steps that a parent can take after a child goes missing. However, the FBI underlined that data about children will not be held by the organisation or by Apple. Indeed, they insist that the only way information about the child can be viewed by the FBI is if the user of the application sends it and activates the application. Aside from the iPhones and iPad, the FBI intends to develop the application so that it can be used on other mobile devices including Android and BlackBerry phones. One other likely step with the application would be sending GPS data when parents transfer data to help local police forces locate the user, and hopefully cut even more time. Also the FBI noted that 'you can show the pictures and . provide physical identifiers such as height and weight to security or . police officers on the spot'. Since the release of Child ID the main criticism has been the lack of password protection on the application - without it, the phone could find its way in to the wrong hands. Either false reports could be filed - a waste of time and money for police - or the child's vital statistics could be accessed and stolen. 'The FBI (and iTunes . for that matter) is not collecting or storing any photos or information . that you enter in the app,' a statement from the FBI read. 'All data resides solely on your mobile device . unless you need to send it to authorities.'","Parents invited to document vital statistics of child .

A Mexican military helicopter packed with soldiers has landed on United States soil, uninvited. But Barack Obama can rest easy - because the unit from Mexico touched down at Laredo International Airport, Texas, by mistake, according to a spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Invasion by accident: A Mexican helicopter like this one landed by mistake at an airport in Texas . The helicopter landed at about 3pm on Saturday - 16 miles from its intended target south of the border, a landing strip in Nuevo Laredo. The spokeswoman said she could not share details of the incident, such as the number of occupants or whether they were armed. Following protocol, CBP officers checked out the helicopter’s occupants, then allowed them to return to Mexico in the aircraft. 'The only thing that I can tell you is that they did land here,' the spokeswoman said. 'It was by mistake. They were processed and they were returned to Mexico.' According to a statement from CBP, the pilot mistook the Texas airport for Nuevo Laredo airport. This is the latest such incursion . against international protocol that officials have called inadvertent, . as the Mexican military increases troop deployments in north-eastern . Mexico. In July, a convoy of soldiers rolled . across the international bridge at Donna, Texas, and were processed by . customs and sent back across. Laredo residents expressed their doubts about whether the helicopter landing really was a mistake. Attention all Mexican military pilots: This is Laredo International Airport, not a landing strip in Nuevo Laredo (one for the SatNav?) 'I am a little upset that it happened,' Janice Davis said. 'I think they knew what they were doing. I don't think it was a mistake. 'I think they were here to find out maybe what's going on. It worries me that they're so close and something could happen.' David Sanchez added: 'I think it worries us all. I think maybe people are trying to see how far they can take things and what they can possibly get away with.' Mayor Raul Salinas, a former FBI agent, says everything is under control. 'I want to make sure that people understand that we have a safe community,' he said. 'We have the right resources, personnel, boots on the ground. We ask Washington how important our border is.' The Mexican military announced last week that it had wrapped up an operation called 'Lince Norte,' or Northern Lynx. The 20-day assault on the Zetas drug trafficking organisation used 4,000 Mexican troops, deployed mostly in states bordering Texas. The operation resulted in the death of the Zeta who controlled Nuevo Laredo and the arrest of a man the military says is a 'national level' financier for the gang.",Pilot missed target in Mexico by SIXTEEN miles .

A fierce thunderstorm swept through a rural Wisconsin county that was packed with holiday campers, toppling trees that killed an 11-year-old girl, blowing ashore boats and injuring more than three dozen people, officials said Saturday. The storm moved across Minnesota and Wisconsin on Friday, packing winds up to 110 miles per hour and hail as large as softballs. In northern Wisconsin's Burnett County, at least 37 people went to hospitals after the storm toppled hundreds of trees and left several thousand utility customers without power.

The Log Cabin Hollow campground on Yellow Lake near Webster, Wisconsin sustained heavy damage in Friday evening's storm . Three of those injuries were reported as critical. Dawn Sargent, a Burnett County public information officer, told MailOnline.com that all missing persons had been accounted for by Saturday evening. A search was undertaken earlier in the day along the St. Croix River for missing canoeists, the Wisconsin Emergency Management Office reported. Boats were upended and blown ashore in the area, while an airport hangar in neighbouring Douglas County collapsed. Law enforcement reported the girl who died was killed when a tree fell . on her at a campground in the country. Ms Sargent would provide additional details of the girl's death, claiming that not all of her family has been notified yet. But the local Inter-County Leader quoted the Burnett County Sheriff's Department as claiming that the 11-year-old was from . Hinckley, Minnesota.

Kittleson said: 'The population here is about 15,000. But this weekend . there's probably about 80,000', she said of the county, which is about . 90 miles northeast of Minneapolis. The . storm moved into southwest Minnesota on Friday afternoon and took . nearly six hours to pass through before slipping into northwest . Wisconsin, said Matt Friedlein, a National Weather Service . meteorologist. The bad weather had moved out by Saturday morning, when skies were clear and sunny with temperatures in the 80s. Most of the damage occurred from the west side of Yellow Lake northeast to Birch Island Lake. The village of Grantsburg is shut down as authorities worry about gas leaks from uprooted trees.

Ms Frase said: 'About 9 o'clock the winds picked up and within five minutes it was upon us. Those were probably the darkest skies I've ever seen up here'. She added that the storm knocked down several trees, with some landing on vehicles. 'A lot of people were very nervous. Some of the kids were crying', she said. Workers were also rattled at a Grantsburg store near the St. Croix River that rents canoes, kayaks and gear.

Mr Mathews added that two tractor-trailers were blown off local highways. Two Minnesota state parks sustained tree damage so heavy that a conservation officer who was making sure no campers were in the area had to abandon his vehicle and hike through on foot, said Chris Niskanen of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Mr Niskanen urged people to stay out of Camden State Park and St. Croix State Park, which are technically closed because of the state's government shutdown but could still attract campers because they're public land. He cautioned that some trees may have fallen over but gotten hung up on other trees. Mr Niskanen said: 'It's an issue of health and safety.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:28 PM on 8th August 2011 . A World War II heroine spy who topped the Gestapo’s wanted list after her daring exploits behind enemy lines helped pave the way for the D-Day landings has died aged 98. Nancy Wake, who inspired the film Charlotte Gray after becoming one the Allies' most decorated servicewomen for her role in the French resistance, passed away in a nursing home in London yesterday. The Australian, who the Nazis codenamed 'The White Mouse' due to the ease with which she escaped capture, left strict instructions to be cremated in a private ceremony. Scroll down for video . 'Exceptional courage': Nancy Wake in 2004, left, and in 1945 after she had helped French resistance prepare the ground for the D-Day landings. She is credited with saving the lives of hundreds of Allied soldiers . She wants her ashes to be scattered at Montlucon in central France, where she fought in a heroic 1944 attack on the local Gestapo headquarters. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard today said: ‘Nancy Wake was a woman of exceptional courage and resourcefulness whose daring exploits saved the lives of hundreds of Allied personnel and helped bring the Nazi occupation of France to an end.’ Miss Wake, who had no children and was the widow of British fighter pilot John Forward, once famously said she was ‘sorry I didn’t kill more Nazis’. Subterfuge: A fake French ID card in which Miss Wake was known as Lucienne Carlier . Gratitude: Miss Wake is presented with flowers in 1945 after being hailed a hero following the war . Second World War heroine Nancy joined the French resistance in 1940. And within three years, her reputation was so great that the Germans put a huge price on her head – 5million francs. Despite having her mail and phone calls intercepted, she remained ice cool and undetected – even when the network was betrayed in 1943. Somehow she managed to escape to Britain, where she signed up to the Special Operations Executive. She was quickly parachuted back into enemy territory, where she bravely led attacks on German and Gestapo facilities. The pinnacle of her remarkable career, however, may well have been a battle she fought in 1944 with 7,000 French liberation fighters against 22,000 SS troops. The Germans suffered 1,400 losses – the French, despite being heavily outnumbered, just 100. At one stage of the operation an SS sentry came close to raising the alarm – but Ms Wake killed him with her bare hands. In an interview she conducted later about the incident, she illustrated how she neutralised the guard by simply drawing her finger across her throat. On one occasion in 1944, supply drops were threatened after the Nazis destroyed crucial radio codes. Nancy cycled 300 miles in 72 hours, crossing several German checkpoints, so she could find an operator to radio Britain and get new codes. One of her comrades in the Resistance, Henri Tardivat, later described her as 'the most feminine woman I know, until the fighting starts. Then, she . is like five men.' It’s no wonder that she received no fewer than 12 medals of honour from Britain, Australia, France, New Zealand and the U.S. Trained by British intelligence in . espionage and sabotage, Wake helped to arm and lead 7,000 resistance . fighters in weakening German defences before the D-Day invasion in the . last months of the war. While . distributing weapons, money and code books in Nazi-occupied France, she . evaded capture many times and reached the top of the Gestapo's wanted . list, according to her biographer, Peter FitzSimons. ‘They . called her the 'la Souris Blanche,' 'the White Mouse,' because every . time they had her cornered ... she was gone again,’ FitzSimons told . Australian Broadcast Corp. radio on Monday. ‘Part of it was she was a gorgeous looking woman,’ he said. ‘The Germans were looking for someone who looked like them: aggressive, a man with guns - and she was not like that.’ France decorated her with its highest military honour, the Legion d'Honneur, as well as three Croix de Guerre and the Medaille de la Resistance. The United States awarded her its Medal of Freedom and Britain, the George Medal. Her only Australian honour did not come until 2004, when she was made a Companion of the Order of Australia. Born on August 30, 1912, in the New Zealand capital of Wellington, Nancy Grace Augusta Wake was the youngest of six siblings. When she was two the family moved to Sydney, but her father left the family soon after and returned to New Zealand. Miss Wake became a nurse before an inheritance from a New Zealand aunt enabled her to run away from home in 1931 and fulfil her dream of travelling to New York, London and Paris, she said in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corp. in 1985. After studying journalism in London, . she became a correspondent for The Chicago Tribune in Paris and reported . on the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany. A 1933 trip to interview Hitler . in Vienna led her to become committed to bringing down the Nazis. ‘I . saw the disagreeable things that he was doing to people, first of all . the Jews,’ she told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio in 1985. ‘I . thought it was quite revolting.’ When . World War II broke out in 1939, she was living in the French city of . Marseille with her first husband, French industrialist Henri Fiocca. She . helped British servicemen and Jews escape the German occupying force.

Honoured: Miss Wake, just right of the Queen, with other holders of the George Medal in 2005 . Her husband was eventually seized, tortured and killed by the Gestapo. But Wake managed to escape in 1943 through Spain to London, where she received the espionage training before helping to lead the French resistance in its final days. Wake continued working for British intelligence in Europe after the war until 1957, when she moved back to Australia and married Mr Forward. She moved back to Britain in 2001, four years after his death.","Nicknamed 'The White Mouse' by Germans as she kept avoiding capture .

The News of the World was last night facing a growing backlash from Twitter users who were urging advertisers and readers to abandon the newspaper. Thousands of Tweets targeted a string of companies who advertise in the shamed paper while others called for a mass boycott. A number of companies with links to the publication, owned by News International, was published online with furious messages demanding they cut their contacts. The powerful public backlash came on a day when it emerged that private investigators could have hacked the voicemails of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. Murdered: Milly Dowler may have had her phone hacked along with the families of the Soham schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman while Rebekah Brooks was editor of the News of the World . The paper is said to have intercepted some messages and deleted others. It is said that this activity may have disrupted the police investigation and created false hope that Milly was still alive and had been using her phone. It is also claimed that they targeted the family of Soham schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman who were killed in 2002. A senior police detective who had been investigating an unsolved murder with links to the News of the World told Channel 4 that police believe he was also bugged. After more details of illegal activity emerged, car-maker Ford scrapped its contract with the paper and a number of other companies said they were 'considering' doing the same.

Advertisers: Car-maker Ford pulled its News of the World adverts while Halifax said it was 'considering' its contract with the paper . Twitter users published a flood of messages urging other household name to abandon the Ruper Murdoch-owned paper. One . worte: 'Dear @TheCooperative, will you be reconsidering your . advertising spend with #notw given that we now know they hacked Milly . Dowler’s phone?' Advertisers including @TheCooperative, @easyjet and @VirginMedia are among others who were being contacted by Twitter users. The power of Twitter was demonstrated last month when Ryan Giggs' super-injunction was virtually overpowered by the strength of thousands of online demands. A Facebook page has also been launched asking advertisers to boycott the News of the World this Sunday. It has 160 members and it includes links to News of the World advertisers including Tesco and Sainsbury’s. Halifax, T-Mobile, Npower and Dixons Retail have said they are 'reviewing' their contracts while Virgin Media, Tesco and Brand Alley say they will wait until an investigation is completed. The Co-operative has refused to rule out pulling adverts. Following the outcry, website Mumsnet have announced that they have cancelled a contract with Sky, and will be removing all News International adverts from their website. Details of the alleged hacking first emerged on Twitter last night when Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger tweeted: 'News of the World hacked Milly Dowler’s voicemail & deleted messages. Family says ''heinous''.' The schoolgirl went missing from her home in March 2002 and her body was found six months later. The Soham murders took place in August that year. Ms Brooks was editor of the News of the World at the time although she denies having any knowledge of illegal phone hacking. The News International boss' position looked increasingly untenable as both David Cameron and Ed Miliband condemned the alleged hacking of Milly's phone. The Prime Minister described the allegations as a 'truly dreadful act', while Labour leader Mr Miliband urged Brooks to 'consider her position' and 'examine her conscience'. Controversy: At the time Milly Dowler's phone . was hacked Rebekah Brooks (left) was editor of the News of the World and . Andy Coulson . (right) her deputy. Coulson resigned earlier this year as David . Cameron's Director of Communications as a result of the phone-hacking . scandal . Grief-stricken: Bob and Sally Dowler with daughter Gemma, centre, speaking outside court after Bellfield's conviction last week . Their words were backed by the Dowler family's lawyer Mark Lewis, who said of Ms Brooks's position: 'It is a matter for her own personal conscience to decide. Meanwhile, John Prescott has called for News Corp's attempts to take full control of BSkyB to be blocked in the wake of the allegations. The condemnation from Mr Cameron is a major blow to Ms Brooks, who considers him a personal friend. Both have homes in his Oxfordshire constituency and Mr Cameron visited her as a guest during the Christmas period last year. Their friendship is one of a number the Prime Minister holds with senior media industry figures who live nearby, including Elizabeth Murdoch and Jeremy Clarkson. In a letter to staff today, Ms Brooks said she was 'appalled and shocked' by the allegations that a private investigator working for the News of the World hacked into schoolgirl Milly Dowler's phone after she went missing. She said she has written to Milly's parents, adding that if the accusations are true then it is 'unforgivable'. In the letter she expressed her determination 'to lead the company to ensure we do the right thing and resolve these serious issues'. It has been claimed that her parents Bob and Sally Dowler also had their phones hacked by a private detective in the weeks after the 13-year-old disappeared. In a statement released to the Guardian, Glenn Mulcaire said he had worked under 'relentless pressure' at the Sunday newspaper and there was a 'constant demand for results'. He said: 'I want to apologise to anybody who was hurt or upset by what I have done.'","Thousands bombard companies calling for boycott of newspaper .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:29 PM on 29th June 2011 . Barack Obama's re-election bid has come under fire after a campaigner hinted he may include dinner cooked by White House chef Sam Kass as a way of raising money. The idea was suggested as a possible fund-raising measure by Noah Shaw - a junior campaign manager -  who hoped to arrange a food tasting that would feature a number of local chefs. The controversy comes after a video for an upcoming fund raiser was allegedly shot at the White House, leading commentators to criticise the President for his 'poor taste' in choosing the venue to serve as a campaign backdrop. Scroll down for video . Daddy duty: Barack Obama holds a sleeping baby boy as he visits Ross' restaurant in Bettendorf, Iowa . Pressing the flesh: Mr Obama danced with one of the diners at the restaurant as the 2012 campaign trail heats up . The video was shot for the upcoming . 'Dinner with Barack and Joe' contest - with the President encouraging . people to donate $5 to his re-election campaign in a bid to win a seat . with him and Vice President Joe Biden. In March, Obama met with financial leaders and executives in the Blue Room of the White House - with most of those present being past campaign contributors to the President. Speaking to ABC news about the video and earlier meeting, Mary Boyle, vice president of communications for Common Cause, said: 'It looks bad. 'It’s disappointing that a president who has gone further than most others in terms of putting up firewalls between the White House and special interests, would host in the White House a meeting with past or current donors.' Responding to the criticism, Press Secretary Jay Carney said there was nothing wrong holding a Democratic National Convention event at the White House. Popular: The president is hugged by another diner (left) and also spent time with a younger supporter . On the campaign trail: Mr Obama spoke about the economic recovery on his visit . He said: 'It is wholly understandable why the president would want to consult with business executives about their ideas about, you know, what to do in terms of economic policy and business policy going forward, including financial sector policy. 'The fact that they're supporters, obviously, he would want to talk to his supporters about that, as well. Also speaking to ABC, Fred Wertheimer of . Democracy 21 said: 'It is simply common sense that nothing should be . done that would leave the impression that the White House is being used . for fund-raising. 'Meetings in the White House should not have any political fund-raising overtones and these kinds of activities ought to be avoided in the future.' The controversy comes as the President spoke at Alcoa . Davenport Works, an aluminum factory whose products are exported around . the world in such high-tech applications as the wings for presidential . jet Air Force One. The plant has re-hired the workers it laid off during the recent recession and is eyeing an expansion, said Obama. Obama says the uptick is a sign his economic policies are working. But his visit to politically-strategic Iowa . comes amid a run of weak economic indicators that have thrown the . strength of U.S. economic recovery into question. U.S. manufacturing, which had added 134,000 new jobs in the first . four months of the year, lost 5,000 jobs in May.

The White House believes recovery in the . manufacturing industry is one way the U.S. can create jobs and stay . competitive in the global marketplace. Last week, Obama announced a $500 . million joint effort by industry, universities and the federal . government to help reposition the United States as a leader in . cutting-edge manufacturing. While the President's re-election hopes in Iowa, and across the country, are likely to rest on the economy, the chairman of the Iowa Republican .

"By . Colin Fernandez . Last updated at 5:13 PM on 8th August 2011 . Hero: Mike Reid's attempts to save Horatio Chapple's life were hindered by a faulty rifle, which did not fire the first four bullets properly . The rifle used to kill a polar bear which mauled an Eton schoolboy to death failed to fire four times, investigators revealed last night. The news paints a dramatic picture of expedition leader Mike Reid’s heroic attempts to save Horatio Chapple, 17, who was attacked while sleeping in his tent on the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. Mr Reid, who himself suffered serious injuries, tried to kill the bear but the first four bullets simply fell out of the magazine when he pulled the trigger. As the animal rampaged among the five tents occupied by 11 pupils and two leaders for several  minutes, frantic teenagers  threw rocks at it in an effort to  save themselves. Then, despite his own terrible injuries, Mr Reid managed to reload the rifle, march up to the snarling creature and – not even knowing whether the gun would work this time – shoot it in the head at short range. The animal was eight stone underweight and had an almost empty stomach, it was revealed last night. Police have sent the ‘old Mauser’ rifle to Oslo for tests to discover whether the British School Expedition Service had taken adequate precautions in case of an attack. The chilling details emerged  as the victim’s parents sought answers to why a string of safety measures failed or were not in place for the expedition. Horatio Chapple, left, has been described as 'strong, fearless and kind' by his family. Right, his father David Chapple. His family said he had . been excited about becoming a doctor and praised his sense of humour . The party were camping in an area where polar bears had been seen in recent weeks at a time when the animals are short of food. Autopsy: A pair of scientists examine the body of the polar bear that was shot dead after attacking Horatio Chapple . Experts . recommend using look-outs, trained guard dogs and preferably installing . two trip wires attached to explosive flares to scare off bears. But the Norwegian police investigation revealed yesterday that no-one was keeping watch at the camp when the bear approached at 7.30am on Friday. A spokesman for the governor of Svalbard said: ‘It is now clear that the bear had entered the tent camp unnoticed. It seems that the trip wire has not been detonated.’ Asked whether anyone was keeping watch, she said: ‘As far as I know, everybody was in the tents.’ The bear poked his head into the tent where Horatio and his friend Patrick Flinders were sleeping and began to bite and claw at them as they desperately tried to defend themselves. Alerted by their screams, Mr Reid and Andy Ruck, who were running the expedition on behalf of the BSES, rushed to the scene and were themselves slashed and bitten. Arald Lyssand, a Norwegian  government investigator, said Mr Reid picked up a gun with four cartridges in it, but ‘he loaded it, and pulled the trigger, each time  nothing’. Mr Ruck tried to light a flare to frighten the bear off, but this too failed to spark. Captured: The male polar bear is examined by an official after it was shot by members of the expedition . Online tributes to the killer polar bear have been condemned as ‘offensive’ to the victim’s family. One Facebook page – called ‘RIP Svalbard Polar Bear Who Got Shot Dead For Killing Horatio Chapple’ – was taken down following criticism. But a series of other insensitive pages remained. Several Facebook users also attacked Horatio, left, for being a public schoolboy. One wrote: ‘R.I.P snowy’, while another said: ‘If you go camping with polar bears then you shouldn’t be shocked when they try to eat you.’ But one person said of the tributes to the bear: ‘This is offensive and honestly disgusting. You need to consider how this is going to make friends and family of Horatio feel.’ And Simone Engelbrecht wrote: ‘Whoever made this page  is a sick, attention-seeking individual.’ So the bear continued its rampage, injuring another member of the party, Scott Bennell-Smith. One of the other students picked up the rifle and tried to fire it, but realised it was empty. It was then that Mr Reid summoned all his remaining strength to pick up a cartridge from the ground and shoot the animal. Horatio’s father David, 49, an orthopaedic surgeon, and mother Olivia, 46, a GP, from Bishopstone, near Salisbury in Wiltshire, are in Tromso to formally identify their son’s body which has been transported back to mainland Norway. The couple, who were travelling with Horatio’s younger brothers Titus and Magnus, were too upset to comment yesterday. But a source close to the family said yesterday: ‘They are still not fully in the picture as to what happened and have many questions as to whether enough was done to protect their son’s life.’ Mr Lyssand said: ‘The routines of the British company have to be looked into.’ Experienced: Guides Michael Reid and Andy Ruck . will remain in Norway before they are flown home with the other two . injured survivors . Happy family: Michael Reid with, from left his sisters Rosalind and Juliet, father Peter and mother Rosemary . Mr Ruck, 27, from Edinburgh, and Mr Reid, 29, from London – were still in intensive care yesterday. Scott and Patrick, were sent by air ambulances to their homes in Britain yesterday. Scott’s father Peter Bennell-Smith said: ‘Friday was without doubt the worst day of my life and it will never leave me to think how close Scott came to being killed that day.’ He said Scott suffered a fractured jaw, head injuries and lost some teeth in the attack. A spokesman for BSES said yesterday: ‘The BSES followed best practice in everything they did.’ Battle with the bear: An aerial view of the camp shows the four tents with the dead polar bear in the middle of the site having been killed by the group during the struggle .

The son of a German officer whose men killed a French captain in hand-to-hand fighting in the First World War has traced the relatives of the dead man nearly 100 years later. A yellowing troop newspaper led the son of Johannes Richter to the family of Captain André Vacquier who died in 1918 in the Vosges region of France. Helmut Richter, 78, is proud to have discovered and befriended the family of the man his father met in combat, he told Germany's Der Spiegel magazine this week. A yellowing troop newspaper led the son of Johannes Richter to the family of Captain André Vacquier who died in 1918 in the Vosges region of France during the bloody World War One conflict (file picture) The newspaper article was among the possessions of his father. A military correspondent described how Lieutenant Richter's platoon came across a French outpost in a wood in southern Alsace in the summer of 1918. 'The patrol decided to take up the fight,' said the article. 'It had been lying in wait when it heard laughter and loud voices. The enemy came forward. 'Every nerve was strained. Nearer, nearer - and then the Germans leaped out. The lieutenant shot one and seized another by the throat with the intention of taking him alive.' But the Frenchman was strong. Lt. Richter grappled with him but was losing the struggle until one of his men put a bullet in his head, the report went on. For years this fading relic of the 'war to end all wars' lay in a suitcase. When Lt. Richter died in 1977 his widow passed it on to her daughter and ten years ago it came into the possession of his son Helmut at his home in Frankfurt. Also inside the suitcase were two religious medals, a metal plaque and a leather cigarette holder. Upon examining the metal plaque more closely Helmut saw it bore the inscription: 'Capt. Vacquier, Montignac Dordogne.' These were the souvenirs of war that Johannes Richter brought back to Germany with him. His victim on June 5 1918 was listed as missing and, two years later, declared dead 'fighting the enemy'. Andre Vacquier was a lawyer when he was called up, a father of two daughters, a holder of the French Legion of Honour. He was twice wounded in combat before he fell. His grave was found after the war and his widow transferred his body back to the Dordogne for burial. Johannes Richter's victim on June 5 1918 was listed as missing and, two years later, declared dead 'fighting the enemy' Helmut Richter said his father, like many fathers, never spoke about the war which cost nine million soldiers their lives. 'We had a drive around Alsace in 1971,' he said, 'and he pointed out many things, about the way the vegetation had changed.' But he did not describe the horrors of the trenches or the comradeship, the fear, the disease and constant knife-edge existence of front-line troops. This gnawed at Helmut Richter and, the day he found the possessions of Vacquier, he vowed to do something about it. Using the Internet, he looked up the name of the town of Montignac and, using his best schoolboy French, penned a letter to the mayor. 'Permit me to submit a little everyday affair to you,' he wrote, describing the events that led him to write to her. 'If you can communicate to me the whereabouts of the family of Captain Vacquier so I can make contact I would be most grateful.' The family was well known in Montignac, the house of the dead captain still in the possession of his heirs. The letter was forwarded to Paris businessman François Leroux, a grandchild of André Vacquier and, together with his cousin, the only survivors of the family. Leroux, 68, said he was 'electrified' by the letter but then began to have second thoughts; the French-German relationship, scarred by three wars  - beginning with the 1870 Franco-Prussian conflict and ending with WW2 - has never been easy. 'How should I have taken it?' he said. 'Was this project generous, sympathetic, courageous? I didn't know.' But then something happened which made him opt to see the son of the man who killed his grandfather. He learned he was to become the grandfather of a French-German child; his son Matthieu is married to a German woman. 'I saw it as a moving indication,' he said. 'I felt the coincidence of history as deeply symbolic moment.' In a meeting at his apartment in Frankfurt, Helmut Richter handed over the possessions of Captain Vacquier to his family over coffee and cake. Herr Richter said he felt like all the animosity between two tribes who lived on opposite sides of the Rhine 'vanished'. 'We made our peace with history,' said Ms. Leroux. 'I am glad I came.'",Captain Vacquier was ambushed and shot in the head at French outpost in southern Alsace .

Endurance swimmer Diana Nyad, who attempted to become the first person to swim . between Cuba and Florida without a shark cage, was forced to abandon her effort . early this morning - roughly halfway through her journey. Nyad was vomiting when she was brought aboard a boat at 12.45am, 29 hours after she jumped into the water on Sunday. 'I am not sad. It was absolutely the right call,' she said. Nyad, who is 61, struggled through ocean swells, shoulder pain and asthma . Monday before she was forced to give up the 103-mile swim. U.S. swimmer Diana Nyad poses for reporters before her attempt to swim to Florida from Havana, at dusk on Sunday morning . The swimmer flashed a victory sign at her well-wishers before performing a rendition of Reveille on her bugle, ahead of her challenge . She was hoping to become the first person to swim from Havana to Key . West without a shark cage. The challenge – which she also failed to . beat at the age of 28 – would have taken 60 hours. Tanned . and freckled from long hours training in the open seas of the . Caribbean, she seemed confident before starting off just before sunset . Sunday. She said the still air and shimmering water flat as a plate were perfect conditions for her attempt to make the epic swim. 'The adrenaline's flowing now,' Nyad said at a jetty in western Havana as she looked at the water. '... This is what I dreamed of: a silver platter.' She gave a heartfelt cheek-kiss to the commodore of the Hemingway Marina in Havana, who helped arrange logistics of the trip, changed into a black swimsuit and blue swim cap and showed off the goggles she planned to wear: light blue during the night for better dark vision and smoky charcoal tinted to protect her eyes from the blinding daytime sun. After an assistant greased her shoulders and armpits to prevent chafing in the salty water, Nyad played 'Reveille' on a bugle, thanked several dozen well-wishers who came to see her, then jumped feet first into the sea. Nyad said it has been a lifelong dream and she hoped would inspire people to live vigorously during their golden years. There she goes: The 166 kilometer stretch between Cuba and the South of Florida is expected to take three days . Instead of using a cage, Nyad will rely on divers and the deployment of an electronic boom to surround her with a current that is imperceptible to humans but is strong enough to keep most sharks at bay . 'Thirty-three years ago I stood on a beach close by here and looked out at a giant sea. ... Now I'm almost 62 years old and I'm standing here at the prime of my life,' she said. 'I think this is my day.' Nyad first had a go at this crossing back in 1978, when she swam inside a steel shark cage for about 42 hours before sea currents hammering her off course put an end to that attempt. The following year she set a world record for open-water swimming without a shark cage, charting 102.5 miles (165 kilometers) from the Bahamas to Florida, then retired from competitive endurance swimming. Still, she said the aborted Cuba attempt stuck with her all these years, and upon turning 60, she started thinking about a comeback. 'What if I went back and tried to chase that elusive dream of Cuba?' she said. 'And I started training and I found it was in my heart and it was in my body. ... It seems almost like a dream to me, but now it's real.' The sun sets as an assistance boat follows Nyad on her grueling route . The waters Nyad will spend the next 60 hours in are shark infested . In preparation she made 8- to 15-hour swims over the last two years off the Caribbean island of St. Martin. Australian swimmer Susie Maroney successfully swam the shark-filled waters from Cuba through the Straits and to the Keys in 1997, though she used a cage. Nyad's team is deploying an electronic boom to surround her with a current that is imperceptible to humans but is strong enough to keep most sharks at bay. Whitetip sharks are not deterred by the field, so divers will be standing by to gently discourage any of those who get curious - without harming them. For the record to have been considered . valid, Nyad had to make the swim without a wetsuit. Her crew were navigating, monitoring her health and providing nourishment. But she was not . allowed to touch the boat, nor can her helpers hold her, until she . emerges fully onto dry land. Five . support vessels carried 45 navigators, nutritionists, doctors, shark . wranglers and a film crew that has been documenting her story. She planned to stop every 45 minutes for 20-second hydration breaks - water, juice, sports drinks. Every 90 minutes she'd rest for two minutes and nibble on bread or a spoonful of peanut butter. By . day two she was drinking heated water and hot chocolate to ward . off hypothermia, a threat after so many hours at sea. Nyad . embarked on a northwest course aiming to arrive at a point in the Keys a . little east of due north, compensating for sea currents. She . called the attempt a 'symbolic moment' for increasing understanding . between the United States and Cuba, two nations torn by five decades of . animosity and mistrust. 'I'm under no delusion that my swim is going to make any new political ramifications,' Nyad added. 'But it is a human moment between the two countries.'","Absolutely the right call, Diana Nyad said ."

As the U.S. loses its top-notch credit rating, consumers face rising interest rates and borrowing costs that may cost taxpayers billions of dollars. Analysts warn the Standard & Poor's downgrade would increase the costs on everything from student loans to car payments. The downgrade could also spread to a state and local level, pushing up the costs of borrowing funds for schools, roads and parks. S&P cut the long-term U.S. credit rating from AAA to AA+ Friday night on concerns about the government's budget deficits and rising debt burden. Investor concern: S&P cut the long-term U.S. credit rating by one notch to AA+ on concerns about the government's budget deficits and debt burden . ‘The downgrade reflects our opinion that the fiscal consolidation plan (falls) short of what, in our view, would be necessary to stabilise the government's medium-term debt dynamics,’ an S&P spokesman said. Borrowing costs will rise for U.S. government, companies and consumers in long-term . Foreign creditors such as China who hold U.S. debt will be concerned by the move . Funding costs for public debt could increase by $100billion, as Treasury yields go up . It follows a fierce battle in Congress over spending cuts and raising taxes to reduce the debt burden and allow the statutory borrowing limit to rise. President Barack Obama signed legislation on Tuesday designed to reduce the fiscal deficit by $2.1trillion over 10 years. But that was well short of the $4trillion in savings S&P had called for as a good ‘down payment’ on fixing America's finances. The political gridlock and the failure to seriously address U.S. long-term fiscal problems came against the backdrop of slowing economic growth. It also led to the worst week in the U.S. stock market for two years. The S&P 500 stock index fell 10.8 per cent in the past 10 trading days on concerns that the U.S. economy may head into another recession. There are also fears the European debt crisis has been growing worse as it spreads to Italy. Going down: Political gridlock came against the backdrop of slowing U.S. economic growth and the worst week in the U.S. stock market for two years . U.S. Treasury bonds, once seen as the world's safest, are now rated lower than bonds issued by countries such as Britain, Germany and France. S&P said the outlook on the new U.S. credit rating is ‘negative' - a sign that another downgrade is possible in the next 12 to 18 months. The impact of S&P's move was . tempered by a decision from Moody's Investors Service this week that . confirmed, for now, the U.S. AAA rating. 'It's not entirely unexpected. I believe it has already been partly priced into the dollar. We expect some further pressure on the U.S. dollar, but a sharp sell-off is in our view unlikely' Vassili SerebriakovWells Fargo in New York . Fitch Ratings said it is still reviewing the rating and will issue its opinion by the end of the month. ‘It's not entirely unexpected. I believe it has already been partly priced into the dollar,' said Vassili Serebriakov, of Wells Fargo in New York. 'We expect some further pressure on the U.S. dollar, but a sharp sell-off is in our view unlikely.' ‘One of the reasons we don't really think foreign investors will start selling U.S. Treasuries aggressively is because there are still few alternatives to the U.S. Treasury market in terms of depth and liquidity.' S&P's move is also likely to concern foreign creditors - especially China, which holds more than $1trillion of U.S. debt. Beijing has repeatedly urged Washington to protect its U.S. dollar investments by addressing its budget problem. Debt deal: President Barack Obama signed legislation designed to reduce the fiscal deficit by $2.1trillion over 10 years on Tuesday . The downgrade could add up to 0.7 of a percentage point to U.S. Treasuries' yields over time, increasing funding costs for public debt by some $100billion, U.S. securities industry trade group SIFMA said. S&P had placed the U.S. credit rating on review for a possible downgrade on July 14. ‘The downgrade reflects our opinion that the fiscal consolidation plan that Congress and the Administration recently agreed to falls short of what, in our view, would be necessary to stabilize the government's medium-term debt dynamics' S&P statement . It was on concerns that Congress was not adequately addressing the government fiscal deficit of about $1.4trillion this year, or about 9.0 per cent of gross domestic product - one of the highest since World War II. The unprecedented downgrade of the nation's AAA credit rating by a major ratings agency comes only 15 months before the next presidential election, where the downgrade and the debt will be top issues for debate. Bitter political battles remain over the ideologically fraught issues of spending cuts and tax reform. The compromise reached by Republicans and Democrats this week calls for the creation of a bipartisan congressional committee to find $1.5trillion of deficit cuts by late November, beyond the $917billion already identified.","Downgrade may send shockwaves locally AND globally .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:33 PM on 4th August 2011 . The English teacher of a gay student . who was shot by a classmate at a junior high school testified . that she told him to stop wearing eyeliner and mascara and when he . refused the classroom disruption escalated. Jill Ekman told jurors that 15-year-old . Larry King wore even more makeup after she told him to stop drawing . attention to himself, the Ventura County Star reported. She said Larry told her the school's . assistant vice-principal, Joy Epstein, said he could and was told by her that the 15-year-old had constitutional rights to do so. Larry King (left) was 15 when he was shot dead by then 14-year-old classmate Brandon McInerney (right), who faces first-degree murder and hate-crime charges . Later, an email message was issued telling teachers that Larry's . attire was allowed and that they should try to teach students tolerance. Ms Ekman said she incorporated the message . of tolerance into her lessons, but that the problem continued. She said . boys complained to her that Larry was chasing them into the bathroom. 'I explained to him that what he was . doing was inappropriate and he laughed and said that he could go into . the boys' bathroom and he liked to see them squirm,' she said. Ms Ekman said she went to Ms Epstein to . complain about the teen's behaviour again, but the administrator told her . there was nothing that could be done. Four days later, he was shot in . the head in the computer classroom at E.O Green School in Oxnard. Her testimony came after the . half-brother of Brandon McInerney, who's on trial for the 2008 shooting . death, told the jury that the defendant was sexually abused. James Bing . testified that the abuse at the hands of a cousin, coupled with physical abuse . by their father, scarred McInerney, now 17. McInerney, who was 14 at the time of the shooting, is being tried as an adult on first-degree murder and hate crime charges. The trial was moved to Los Angeles County because of extensive media coverage in Ventura County. Assistant vice-principal Joy Epstein previously told jurors . that the 15-year-old had made sexually inappropriate comments to . other students in the weeks before the shooting. She said she warned Larry that dressing . differently could make things hard on him. But she added that she and other teachers didn't discourage him because it didn't violate the school's dress code. Ms Epstein's sexuality was also brought up during the trial this week and it was the first time jurors heard that she was openly lesbian. Susan Crowley, King's seventh-grade special education teacher, said she did not think Joy Epstein was being truthful when she testified that King's behaviour . was being adequately addressed by school administrators and that very . few people had complained about King's clothing. 'It is impossible for any sentient being not to know,' she said. 'Every conversation I had with an adult leading up to his death was . about Larry's behaviour.' She said that Larry was a sweet, caring kid who endeared himself to certain teachers at E.O. Green School but had trouble making that same connection with students his own age, according to court testimony on Monday. She said: 'He desperately wanted to be liked but didn't have the social skills to get along with his peers. He often said things that were one note off the mark.' 'I was concerned they were designed to draw negative attention to himself and would make him unhappy and victimized. 'He couldn't distinguish between positive and negative attention. He just wanted people to pay attention to him.' Liberal: The shooting took place on February 12, 2008 at E.O. Green Junior High School in Oxnard, California . Larry King, who was murdered at the E.O. Green School shooting . According to VC Star, she told the . court that Larry was extremely immature for his age and didn't have a . firm grasp of his sexuality. A year before, he was wearing women's . high-heeled boots and telling friends he was gay, and complained that . another boy was sexually harassing him at school. She said: 'I think Larry was probably gay, but I don't think he knew that. He had a lot of years before he could figure it out.' Senior Deputy District Attorney Maeve Fox asked Ms Crowley if she thought Ms Epstein empowered Larry. She said yes. Another teacher, Shirley Brown, also . testified that she didn't think Ms Epstein was adequately addressing the . issue of King's behaviour and its impact on students. She said when Larry came to school with thick pancake and eye makeup, she told him to take it off. 'He looked like a clown, and if a . girl came into my class like that, I would tell her to go to the . bathroom and wash it off,' Ms Brown testified. 'I would talk to any . student who was doing anything that was making themselves a target.' McInerny's lawyers are arguing that he was pushed over the edge by Larry's unwelcome advances. Prosecutors say McInerney was motivated by white supremacy to commit a hate crime. Exactly how teachers should deal with Larry King's appearance was a concern among school administrators back in 2008. They decided it was within his constitutional rights to wear such garb and it wasn't outside the school's dress code. 'I did tell him that junior high is the most difficult time for most students, and by dressing the way he did, it could be difficult for him, but it was his choice,' Mrs Epstein said. 'I told him, ""More power to you if you can get through it"".' Larry's death has roiled gay-rights advocates and parents in Oxnard, a city about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles, and has resonated with the nation . Prosecutors are trying to prove McInerney disliked gays and committed premeditated murder. The . defence says McInerney came from a violent and troubled home, was . pushed to the edge after King made too many unwelcome advances and is . only guilty of manslaughter. The . opposing lawyers argued over whether incidents involving King were . serious disruptions at school that went unpunished, or just typical . actions of an awkward eighth-grader, vcstar.com reports . Mrs . Epstein said she never had anyone complain to her about King's clothing . — other than his own younger brother, who said he was being teased . because of it. King did say . sexually inappropriate things to other students and pushed another . student against a wall in the weeks before his death, Mrs Epstein . testified. She added that after a second incident, a disciplinary form was put into his permanent record. McInerney's . lawyer, Scott Wippert, asked Mrs Epstein why, when the school's student . handbook explicitly said violence or sexual harassment would be met . with suspension, King never received more serious discipline. Ms Epstein said he was given appropriate discipline and it was dealt with in the correct manner. When Senior Deputy District Attorney Maeve Fox asked if the name calling and shoving by King were anything beyond typical eighth-grade behavior, Epstein replied no. Earlier Monday, Dawn Boldrin, the teacher who was in the classroom when King was shot, continued her testimony from Friday. Miss Boldrin described McInerney as a nice kid who hadn't caused any problems. She was, however, more forthright in her opinion about the school in the aftermath of the shooting. 'I was having a difficult time with depression and fear,"" she said of the months after the killing. 'I know for a fact that the school has done nothing to make the classroom safer for anyone. 'They have not done anything to prevent this from happening again.' Boldrin, who had befriended King and gave him a green homecoming dress in the month before he was killed, said she no longer works at the school, and that she was forced to quit. 'I wouldn't want to go back to the school where they treat students and me like that,' said . She said she never asked anyone's permission to give King her daughter's used homecoming dress, because he had started wearing makeup and his guardians seemed OK with the change. 'It seemed like the foster care he was in was not condoning it per se but at least allowing him to finally do what he wanted to do instead of fighting him on it,' she said. According to court documents,  as the boys sat in . a computer lab, McInerney drew a .22-caliber gun from his sweatshirt . and shot Larry in the back of the head. Prosecutor . Maeve Fox wrote in court documents McInerney 'then stood up as Larry . collapsed to the floor, looked around at his astonished classmates and . delivered a second coup-de-grace shot into the back of Larry's head.'","English teacher told by assistant vice-principal nothing could be done .

This 14-year-old girl was fatally stabbed 15 times on her way home from school and left to die in a pool of her own blood next to a main road. Now, almost 30 years after Tina Faelz was brutally killed in Pleasanton, California, police have arrested a suspect thanks to a new DNA match. Her Foothill High School classmate Steven John Carlson, 43, has reportedly been arrested over the death that ‘devastated’ a community. Death mystery: 27 years after Tina Faelz, 14, was brutally killed in Pleasanton, California, police have arrested a suspect thanks to a new DNA match . Police would not name the suspect because he was a minor at the time of the incident - but the San Francisco Chronicle identified him as Carlson. Carlson, who was 16 at the time, allegedly murdered Tina while she walked home from school in April 1984 and took a shortcut by a drainage ditch. But less than an hour after she went through the dark culvert her bloody body was found and she had been stabbed more than 15 times. She would usually take the bus home but did not want to be teased by other pupils anymore and chose to walk, her mother Shirley Orosco said. The crime baffled police and they in fact interviewed Carlson shortly after Tina was found on a shortcut route that no longer exists. 'Suspect': Tina's Foothill High School classmate Steven John Carlson, 43, has reportedly been arrested over the death that devastated a community . It took until 2007 for a DNA . breakthrough when police sent evidence to the FBI for re-examination, . reported the San Francisco Chronicle. The FBI’s lab matched the biological evidence to Carlson last year and it helped them rebuild the whole case, authorities said. ‘The brutal murder of this 14-year-old freshman made the people of Pleasanton look at the world entirely different that day' David SpillerPleasanton Police Chief . Carlson lived near the shortcut and became a registered sex offender after Tina’s death, but police don't believe he sexually assaulted her. Pleasanton Police Chief David Spiller told the San Francisco Chronicle that the local area was ‘rocked’ with a reaction of ‘purely shock’. ‘The brutal murder of this 14-year-old freshman made the people of Pleasanton look at the world entirely different that day,’ he said. Carlson is expected to be arraigned on Wednesday at the Alameda County Juvenile Justice Center before he is moved to an adult court. School: Carlson, who was 16 at the time, allegedly murdered Tina while she walked home from Foothill High in April 1984 and took a shortcut . He was released from Santa Cruz County Jail where he was being held on unrelated drug charges and a probation breach. Carlson was convicted for sexual assault on a child in Yolo County in 1989 that made him a sex offender and landed him in jail for three years. He was also convicted of assault with a deadly weapon three years ago and sent to prison for 120 days, reported the San Francisco Chronicle. Ron Orosco, husband of Tina’s mother Mrs Orosco, 63, said she ‘lost a child’ and wants to know who was responsible before she dies. Leslie Davisson, 43, told the San Francisco Chronicle she used to go through the same shortcut and the killing ‘rocked our teenage worlds’.","Tina Faelz, 14, fatally stabbed 15 times in 1984 killing .

"By . Oliver Pickup . Last updated at 12:38 PM on 9th August 2011 . Theodore John Kaczynski killed three people and injured 23 others in a bombing spree that spanned almost two decades . A Sacramento judge has approved the payment of $232,000 (£142,000) to the victims and survivors of the so-called Unabomber, having raised the money through auctioning off his possessions. Theodore 'Ted' Kaczynski killed three people and injured 23 others in a bombing spree around Illinois and California that spanned almost two decades. The Chicago-born 69-year-old Harvard graduate, who was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole in May 1998 and is currently housed in Colorado, pleaded guilty to the bombings, which began in 1978. In August 2010 District Judge Garland Burrell Jr. ordered that personal . items seized when Kaczynski, a Berkeley mathematics professor, was arrested in 1996 should be sold at a 'reasonably advertised Internet auction' and the money recouped be distributed to the victims and their families. Most of the items were taken from the Montana cabin - located in the wilderness of the Rocky Mountains - the Unabomber (university and airline . bomber) had built and been living in for the best part of 25 years. Auction items included the typewriter Kaczynski . used to compose the manifesto he sent to the New York Times and the . Washington Post. That manuscript fetched $22,003, while there were various items of clothing that had been worn by Kaczynski during his time in the countryside and while he organised and detonated the bombings. Also on sale was the infamous hooded . sweatshirt and sunglasses depicted in an FBI sketch of the Unabomber . suspect, which sold together for $20,025. Kaczynski's . personal journals sold . for the highest amount: $40,676. However, bomb-making materials, such as writings that contain diagrams and 'recipes' for bombs, were excluded from the sale. The auctioneer . paid the cost and will reportedly keep up to 10 per cent of the sale price. In total, neo-Luddite Kaczynski, who said that technology was the reason he went on his killing spree, was ordered to pay $15 million in damages and interest to his victims, of which - even after this auction - only a very small amount has been paid. Scroll down to see a video about the auction . The Unabomber is shown being taken to Sacramento County Jail in 1998 after he was sentenced to life imprisonment . And last week Judge Burrell last week . ordered the funds dispersed among two widows of men killed by . Kaczynski, the wife of a man severely injured and an injured computer . store worker. The sums handed to the victims of the Unabomber, who mailed his homemade . explosives to targets including airlines and universities, were as follows: . The U.S. Marshals Service and the . General Services Administration conducted the online auction of . Kaczynski's typewriter, sweat shirt and other belongings, which began on May 18. 'The U.S. Marshals Service has been given a unique opportunity to help the victims of Theodore Kaczynski's horrific crimes,' said U.S. Marshal Albert Najera of the Eastern District of California. 'We will use the technology that Kaczynski railed against in his various manifestos to sell artefacts of his life. 'The proceeds will go to his victims and, in a very small way, offset some of the hardships they have suffered.'","Bomber's personal journals sell for $40,676 - the most recouped .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:04 PM on 7th July 2011 . Getting fatter: A new report has revealed there is only one U.S. state with an obesity rate below 20 per cent . A fifth of the population in all but one state is obese, according to a shocking new report released today. America has become dramatically fatter in the last five years alone - in 2005 just one state had an obesity rate of more than 30 per cent, but today a dozen do. The fattest state is Mississippi, where 34.4 per cent of adults are obese, and Colorado is the only state where fewer than one fifth of the population falls into that category. But the obesity rate there, in the 'thinnest' state, is still 19.8 per cent, which in 1995 would have made in the fattest state. The . figures, for 2010, were released today in 'F as in Fat', an annual report from the . Trust for America's Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. No state decreased its level of obesity, . which is defined as a body mass index of 30 or more. The body mass . index is a measurement based on weight and height. Even Colorado does not . win high marks -- its score means one in five state residents is at . higher risk for conditions like heart disease and diabetes. States with highest obesity rates . 1. Mississippi - 34.4 per cent . 2. Alabama - 32.3 per cent . 3. West Virginia - 32.2 per cent . 4. Tennessee - 31.9 per cent . 5. Louisiana - 31.6 per cent . 6. Kentucky - 31.5 per cent . 7. Oklahoma - 31.4 per cent . 8. South Carolina - 30.9 per cent . 9. Arkansas - 30.6 per cent . 10. Michigan -  30.5 per cent . The worst offenders are in the south. Mississippi tops the list for the seventh year in a row, with Alabama, West Virginia, Tennessee and Louisiana close behind. At the other end of the scale, Colorado, District of Columbia, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Hawaii are the 'thinnest' states. Since 1995, the first time data was available for every state, obesity rates have doubled in seven states and increased by at least 90 per cent in ten others. Rates have grown fastest in Oklahoma, Alabama, and Tennessee, and slowest in Washington D.C., Colorado, and Connecticut. Jeffrey Levi, the executive director of the Trust for America's Health, said: 'When you look at it year by year, the changes are incremental. When you look at it by a generation you see how we got into this problem.' Campaigner: Michelle Obama, shown here doing push-ups with Archbishop Desmond Tutu in South Africa, is trying to curb childhood obesity . There was some good news for high-profile anti-obesity activists including Michelle Obama, whose Let's Move campaign aims to reduce childhood weight problems. This year 16 states reported increases in their obesity rates, down from 28 last year. States with lowest obesity rates . 1. Colorado - 19.8 per cent . 2. Washington D.C. - 21.7 per cent . 3. Connecticut - 21.8 per cent . 4. Massachusetts - 22.3 per cent . 5. Hawaii - 23.1 per cent . 6. Utah - 23.4 per cent . 7. Vermont - 23.5 per cent . 8. Montana - 23.8 per cent . 9. New Jersey - 24.1 per cent . 10. Rhode Island - 24.3 per cent . Mr Levi said: 'We're levelling off to some degree at an unacceptably high level.' He said increases have been gradually slowing as a result of greater public awareness on health issues, along with government initiatives to give schools better access to healthier foods. As in previous years, the study showed that racial and ethnic minorities have the highest obesity rates. In 15 states, more than 40 per cent of African-American adults are obese, while the obesity rate for white people was higher than 30 per cent in just four states. Education also has a dramatic effect on obesity rates. About a third of adults who did not graduate from high school are obese, compared to a fifth of college graduates. Dr Mary Currier, Mississippi's health officer, says the state has struggled to drop its status as the country's status because so many areas are poor and rural. She said: 'We live in an area of the country where eating is one of the things we do, and we eat a lot of fried foods. Trying to change that culture is pretty difficult.'","Fattest states are Mississippi, Alabama and West Virginia .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:42 PM on 20th June 2011 . The death penalty carries a heavy price in California, and not just to those executed. The legal practice also costs taxpayers billions, at a time when the state languishes under crushing debt. Golden State taxpayers have spent more than $4 billion on capital punishment in . since it was reinstated there in 1978, or about $308 million for . each of the 13 executions carried out there since then, according to a . new report. Walking dead: A prisoner on Death Row is led back to his cell in California's San Quentin prison in 2003. Due to legal challenges and long delays, the state hasn't executed anyone since 2006, despite a crowded death row . The analysis by a senior federal judge and a law . professor estimated that the additional costs of capital trials, security on death row and legal representation through long appeals for the . condemned adds $184 million to the budget each year, reports the Los Angeles Times. The study's authors, U.S. 9th Circuit Judge Arthur L. Alarcon and Loyola Law School professor Paula M. Mitchell, predicted that the death penalty will cost California $9 billion by 2030, when death row will house more than 1,000 condemned inmates. For their report 'Executing the Will of the Voters: A Roadmap to Mend or End the California Legislature's Multi-Billion-Dollar Death Penalty Debacle', the authors examined previously unavailable records from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Mr Alarcon and Ms Mitchell suggested three options to reduce the ballooning costs of capital punishment: fully preserve the practice with $85 million more in funding each year; reduce the number of death penalty-eligible crimes for an annual savings of $55 million; or abolish capital punishment and save taxpayers about $1 billion every five or six years, reports the Los Angeles Times. Former death chamber: The gas chamber at San Quentin, seen in 2006, hasn't been used since 1996. Today lethal injection is used in a newer room, although the procedure is stalled in courts . Waiting room: File photo of the execution holding cells at San Quentin Prison in Marin County, California . A guard tower rises above San Quentin State Prison. California has 714 inmates on death row, costing $184 million more per year than those sentenced to life in prison without parole . Mr Alarcon prosecuted capital cases while serving as a Los Angeles County deputy district attorney in the 1950s and served as clemency secretary to Governor Pat Brown. He said he does not oppose the controversial death penalty and believes California voters do want to keep it as an option. Ms Michell is his long-time law clerk, though she says she favours eliminating capital punishment in her state. Even so, both authors claim they approached their report as impartial academics, focused on the economics of the issue. Four years ago, Mr Alarcon pointed out that it took an average of 17 years from conviction to execution in California, two times the national average. Now, it takes longer than 25 years, and no executions have taken place in the state since 2006, despite a crowding death row that now numbers 714 inmates. No executions are likely in the near future, according to the Los Angeles Times, due to legal challenges to the state's lethal injection procedures. The report stated: This 'reflects a wholesale failure to fund the efficient, effective capital punishment system that California voters were told they were choosing' in the battery of voter initiatives over the last three decades that have expanded the penalty to 39 special circumstances in murder. Executed: Clarence Ray Allen (left) was executed at San Quentin in January 2006 (at age 76)  for the murder of three people. Donald Beardslee was executed in January 2005 for the murder of two people during a drug deal . Stanley 'Tookie' Williams was executed at San Quentin in 2005 for four murders. The co-founder of the Crips gang, he had spent years in prison writing against gang violence, making his execution controversial . Protest: Anti-death penalty protesters raise their arms in support of Stanley Tookie Williams outside San Quentin December 13, 2005. The death penalty remains controversial . Unless major reforms are made, the authors claim 'capital punishment will continue to exist mostly in theory while exacting an untenable cost', writes the Los Angeles Times. Among their findings to be published next week in the Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review: . The state's 714 death row prisoners cost $184 million more per year than those sentenced to life in prison without parole. A death penalty prosecution costs up to 20 times as much as a life-without-parole case. The least expensive death penalty trial costs $1.1 million more than the most expensive life-without-parole case. Jury selection in a capital case runs three to four weeks longer and costs $200,000 more than in life-without-parole cases. The state pays up to $300,000 for attorneys to represent each capital inmate on appeal. San Quentin: Federal judges have found fault with about 70% of the state's death row convictions, sending them back to trial courts. California also has a lack of lawyers who are experienced in death row appeals cases . Death Row inmates play basketball and stand around in the crowded exercise yard of East Block Condemned Row 2 during a rare tour of San Quentin in 2003 . The heightened security practices mandated for death row inmates added $100,663 to the cost of incarcerating each capital prisoner last year, for a total of $72 million. The study echoes findings by the bipartisan California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice in 2008 and a 2009 report by the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California. There is a lack of death penalty-qualified attorneys in California, perhaps only 100, which leads to long delays. Federal judges have found fault with about 70% of the state's death row convictions, sending them back to trial courts. The report claims voters have not been apprised of the real costs of capital punishment over the years. The authors concluded: 'We hope that California voters, informed of what the death penalty actually costs them, will cast their informed votes in favour of a system that makes sense'.","California has spent more than $4 billion on capital punishment since 1978 .

Prowling in the vicinity of a number of tents, this hungry polar bear is photographed just a week before it went on a ferocious rampage which left one Eton College-educated teen dead and four other Brits seriously wounded. The images, taken by a Polish sea captain, were snapped only a few miles away from where Horatio Chapple was killed by the ravenous 39st animal, on Spitsbergen island in Norway. The captain took the photographs as he was worried that the 14ft beast would attack the camp - similar to the one set up by the British . Schools Exploring Society only days later. This polar bear - thought to be the same one which killed a Brit and seriously wounded four others - is seen prowling near to a camp in Norway . A flare is shown ignited, which - on this occasion - scares the adult male polar bear away, leaving the campers safe. Sunny Secamp, a German tour guide at the . camp, said: 'The bear came out but didn’t try to get into any tent. He . just looked around and smelled the air.' She said that it was possibly the same . bear as it appeared to weigh around 200-250kg (31-39stone) - the same . size as the bear that took Horatio’s life. It is believed that the . flare-triggering defence systems in place at the BSES camp were faulty, . which allowed the animal to enter the campsite early on Friday . morning and being its attack. Horatio, . 17, was 'ripped to pieces' by the polar bear according to Patrick . Flinders, who was in the tent next to the aspiring doctor when bear attacked. The 14ft animal is shown bolting - and not attacking any humans - after a flare is triggered near to the German camp . A photograph of Horatio Chapple, taken on his own camera only two days before he was mauled to death by a polar bear . The . Jersey-based 16-year-old suffered a fractured skull after being bitten on his head - he punched the . animal in the face during the attack and his father hailed him a hero . for 'fighting for his life'. Scott Bennell-Smith, 16, also survived, having been in the same tent as Horatio and Patrick. In addition trip leaders Michael . 'Spike' Reid, 29, from Plymouth and Andrew Ruck, 27, who is from . Brighton but lives in Edinburgh, were severely injured in the bear . attack, but are now stable. Dawyd Guzowski, who was sailing in . northern Norway, took these astonishing pictures of the bear approaching . the camp. Michael Reid (left) shot the polar bear and fellow team leader Andy Ruck (right) was also injured in the attack . Patrick Flinders, 16, saw Horatio 'ripped to pieces' in his tent and managed to survive the polar bear attack . In contrast to the flares at the German campsite, . when the bear approached the camp where Horatio was staying with nine . other youngsters and two adult leaders, the safety tripwire failed to trigger. It has emerged that the wire system was not fixed firmly in the ground - so it fell over . when the bear trod on it, according to a Norwegian police investigation. In a further mishap, the ‘old’ Mauser . hunting rifle failed to fire four times. The bear was eventually killed by Mr Reid on the fifth attempt, despite the fact that he had been severely mauled by the animal. Safety precautions at the site have been criticised in the Norwegian media. John Inge Karlsen, who organises . expeditions at the University of Svalbard said that in 15 years of . expeditions on Svalbard, members of the university had only had to shoot . one polar bear. ‘You could say that if you come into a . situation where you have to shoot a bear, then you have done something . wrong,’ he told the Aftenposten newspaper. Clive Garner, head of international . litigation at law firm Irwin Mitchell, who has experience of lawsuits . involving wild animals attacking tourists said Horatio's family, . and injured participants on the trip, would be able to sue the BSES if . it could be shown ‘reasonable steps’ to ensure the safety of the . expedition. Mr Garner said: ‘Reasonable steps need . to be taken to ensure people are safe, and while it’s too early to tell . in this case, there are serious questions that need to be answered by . the organisers of this trip.’ The aftermath of the attack is shown - the bear appears to be dead, shot in the middle of the cluster of tents . The 14ft bear is hauled to the awaiting helicopter after his bloody rampage . Meanwhile yesterday Horatio's parents released an image of their killed son, after his digital camera had been returned to them by the Norwegian police. The picture shows Horatio standing by a glacier on the Arctic island. Wearing sunglasses and smiling, he appears to be enjoying the adventure of camping in the Norwegian islands. Two days later he was mauled to death by the polar bear.","Safety precautions criticised in Norwegian press .

"By . Amy Oliver . Last updated at 10:54 AM on 2nd July 2011 . Texas bound? After saying farewell to Fox Glenn Beck is thought to be moving to a rented mansion in Dallas, Texas . After saying farewell to Fox, Glenn Beck is going it alone. So what better place to head than the Lone Star state of Texas? The right-wing mouth piece, who is thought to have sold his Connecticut home for $3.6million, is moving his family to Dallas, according to his listing agent. 'They are going to the Dallas area,' Lynne Leonard told the New York Daily News. 'They will be renting. It's secure and gated.' Beck is expected to move into the seven-bedroom pile owned by baseball player Jorge Piedra and Swarovski heiress Vanessa Piedra. The home is currently on the market for $3.9million, but Beck will be renting the 7,900-square foot mansion for $20,000-a-month for the time being, Dallas-based real estate blogger Candy Evans said. As well as multiple bedrooms Beck can also look forward to seven-and-a-half bathrooms, two-acres of land and of course, Swarovski crystals throughout the house. He is thought to still own an apartment in Manhattan however and his production company, Mercury Radio Arts will still operate out of New York meaning he could be back in the city repeatedly. But on a prior show he's also joked with Texas Governor Rick Perry that he would run for the post. Beck drew his final breath, on television at least, last night. Grand: Beck is thought to be moving his family into the seven-bedroom mansion which is owned by baseball player Jorge Piedra and Swarovski heiress Vanessa Piedra . The now ex Fox News host filed his last ever show with a series of bizarre rants that repeatedly returned to the reason why he had decided to call time on the programme after two-and-a-half years. He promised a so-called cynical media . that he would be back adding 'you will pray for the time when I was only . on the air for one hour a day.' Beck went on to reveal his plans in a live Q and A after the show online. Deluxe: The home is currently on the market for $3.9million, but Beck will be renting the 7,900-square foot mansion for $20,000-a-month for the time being, according to sources . Boudoir: As well as seven bedrooms Beck can also look forward to seven-and-a-half bathrooms, two-acres of land and of course, Swarovski crystals throughout the house . Eat in, work out: The house also comes with a home gym and lavish kitchen. Should Beck fancy a stroll to mull on his various philosophies he can do so within the sprawling grounds . From September Beck will broadcast a two-hour daily show on his GBTV internet network. He is also launching a charity programme called Mercury One, the name of which he revealed during his live TV show. Mercury One will be a 'humanitarian' project that will gather people to help others in disasters and tragedies, Beck explained. Beck bows out: Fox News host Glenn Beck filled his last ever TV show with bizarre ramblings about what he was planning to do next . Legacy: Beck said he and his audience must have 'faith, hope and charity' going forward . 'It will be part of a rapid response team everywhere in America, in every town...everywhere,' he added. He is even planning a clothing line called 1791, the same date the U.S. Bill of Rights was ratified. 'It's not about GBTV, it's about . saving the world,' Beck said before setting out a challenge for people . to sign up as 'peace ambassadors.' 'It's 828, . it's' Restoring Courage.' During his hour-long last show, Beck said he was heading to Israel in search of 'courage.' 'What makes . people live in Israel? he asked. 'It 's a ticking time bomb. How do I get some of . that courage? I begin my search after this programme.' The infamous chalk boards: CNN may have graphics, but Fox has chalkboards, Beck told his audience . The show, broadcast live, kicked off with Beck reliving the last two-and-a-half years with a montage of best bits. Before that he had taken the cameras back stage to see where the props for the show were kept or 'magnet alley' as he called it. Floor to ceiling shelves groaned . under the weight of aids the Fox host had used over the years to express . certain metaphors. Quiet what a chainsaw was doing there was anyone's . guess. There was also cases and cases of chalk for writing on the infamous chalkboards of the show. Beck later joked that 'CNN use graphics, we use chalkboards,' adding that he always felt as though he had chalk on his trousers. There was some speculation Beck may cry. He didn't but there were many emotional moments - genuine and hammed. 'I've met amazing friends' on this show, he said. 'Namely you.' Beck then went on to talk about all the 'amazing' things the Glen Beck Show has taught the people of America. Looking back: Beck admitted he'd done many things in order to 'hack the left off' as he went over his best bits . Should the topics have slipped anyone's memory, they were all handily written up on a chalkboard titled: 'Things we've learned.' 'How many people knew about the great depression of 1920' before the show? Asked Beck. 'We showed you.' 'We are the same, me and you,' he continued before adding: 'I may be able to figure out some things little faster than you.' He's . well known for going on a bit but in tonight's show Beck actually . celebrated his 'staggeringly long monologues' saying that a 21 minute . stint was normal for the show now. He even took on Jon Stewart, berating him for having 'so many writers' for 'just six minutes' worth of material. End of an era: The blinds go up and the set is dismantled as Beck says a final farewell to his audience . He then brought in his show's writers, all two of them. They shuffled about and looked at the floor for a bit before the show went to a commercial break. Beck, teasing the audience, kept suggesting he would reveal the real reason why he was leaving 'next,' but never quite made it. 'There were people who said I was fired,' Beck said in a booming voice before going on to suggest if he had been sacked he wouldn't be in the midst of a live broadcast. Many asked if he was negotiating his contract Beck added, even his agent. But in the end Beck said he was standing in his New York City apartment looking at the skyline after 'hanging out with Bono' backstage after watching Spiderman: Turn off the Dark musical, currently on Broadway, and thought: 'If you don't leave now, you will not leave with your soul. 'Never want anything too much,' he said. 'It will destroy you.' Beck ended the show saying he was 'determined to fix this country one family, one entrepreneur at a time,' with his new project 'Mercury one.' He failed to say what that was exactly, but left the audience in no doubt that he'd be back soon.","Beck has sold his Connecticut mansion for $3.6million, according to his listing agent .

"By . Jack Doyle and Chris Greenwood . Last updated at 11:26 AM on 1st July 2011 . Emergency law change: Policing Minister Nick Herbert said that legislation will have to be clarified . Thousands of criminal suspects could lodge compensation claims as a result of the chaos over police bail rules. Senior police officers fear alleged . murderers, rapists and paedophiles could demand payouts of hundreds of . pounds under human rights laws. The revelation came as ministers . pledged to rush through laws to reverse the ‘bizarre’ ruling, revealed . in yesterday’s Mail, which tears up 25 years of legal precedent and puts . a straitjacket on officers’ ability to question suspects. As a result of the ruling, made by a . district judge earlier this year, time spent on bail now counts towards . the maximum of 96 hours suspects can be held in custody. Previously, the clock stopped when . alleged offenders were let out, allowing police to investigate then . recall them for further questioning weeks or even months later. The ruling also undermines key public . protections such as requiring alleged offenders to hand over their . passports, or demanding they stay away from schools or victims. Yesterday Home Secretary Theresa May . branded the ruling  ‘flat wrong’. Pledging to introduce laws to reverse . it, she said: ‘This judgment could have a serious impact on the vital . work the police do to keep us all safe.’ The Daily Mail story exposing the scandal . Scotland Yard boss Sir Paul Stephenson said he feared the crisis could saddle taxpayers with a massive compensation bill. Senior officers estimate more than . 85,000 people are on bail at any one time and many will have been bailed . beyond the 96-hour limit. There are 14,029 on bail in London alone, including 175 suspected of murder or attempted murder. Sir Paul said: ‘The ruling overturns . 25 years of police interpretation and application of the Police and . Criminal Evidence Act. We are very, very concerned. ‘We have been advised by two QCs that this is a serious situation that needs primary legislation to get us out of it. 'We are putting into place . categorisation plans, profiling the most serious offences when people . are on bail. We are in new territory here.’ Fury: Sir Norman Bettison, Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police, left, said they were 'on the verge of disaster' following the Magistrates' Court decision upheld by Mr Justice McCombe, right, in the High Court . Asked about potential compensation . claims, Sir Paul said: ‘You would expect me to assess the implications . but it is not my intention to alert people to this latest ruling to . behave improperly. The implications are serious for ongoing cases and . historic cases.’ Experts said defendants could use . Article 5 of the Human Rights Act – which protects against infringement . of liberty – to make a compensation claim. It is already used by . prisoners to claim more than £100 a day if they are kept in prison . beyond their parole date. Tory MP Priti Patel said: ‘This is an . urgent situation that clearly the Government understands has to be . addressed. First to make sure that the criminal justice system doesn’t . go into meltdown, but also that ensures the floodgates aren’t opened to a . string of compensation claims. Concerned: Home Secretary Theresa May said Government was looking to appeal the decision which could have huge ramifications for the criminal justice system . In a statement to the House of . Commons, Policing Minister Nick Herbert said emergency legislation will . be introduced within days to ensure police were not forced to operate . with ‘one hand tied behind their back’. He insisted ministers were not . alerted to the ruling until this week. Yesterday the Supreme Court agreed to . emergency sessions to examine the case next month, but it is likely the . law will be changed before MPs go on holiday on July 19. The decision does not apply to terror . suspects, who cannot be bailed. Under separate counter-terror . legislation, alleged terrorists can be held for a maximum of 14 days . before they must be charged. Until this year the maximum detention . period was 28 days. On April 5 at Salford Magistrates Court, District Judge Jonathan Finestein rewrote the rule book. Refusing to extend custody time for a murder suspect, he ruled that the detention clock continues to run while the suspect is on bail from the police station. Paul Hookway, 47, had been arrested over a ferocious attack on Malcolm Short, 52, who lived alone. He was first held last November for 28 hours and then released on bail. Police applied to the court to extend the period of detention from 36 hours to the maximum allowed of 96 hours. The ruling was made despite Hookway’s solicitor not opposing the extension. Court papers suggest the judge initially decided the police’s case was ‘justified’ before changing his mind on the advice of his court clerk. Hookway has not been charged and will remain free unless new evidence emerges in the case. Greater Manchester Police applied to the High Court for a judicial review but last month Mr Justice McCombe upheld the decision and refused leave to appeal.","Emergency law to reverse shock bail ruling, minister tells MPs .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:31 AM on 11th August 2011 . The 'Butcher of Brooklyn', charged with killing and dismembering Leiby Kletzky, 8, is confused and apathetic, a 'practically blank' personality whose younger sister died while institutionalized with schizophrenia, according to an evaluation. The court-ordered psychiatric evaluation of Levi Aron found him fit to stand trial on murder charges in the death of the Brooklyn school boy. Details in the report from a psychiatrist and psychologist at Kings County Hospital show the 35-year-old suspect is deeply troubled, and has given authorities conflicting accounts of his life and his mental and physical history. Levi Aron, 35, was charged with killing and dismembering Leiby Kletzky, 8. A leaked court-ordered psychiatric evaluation claims Aron suffers from a host of personality issues . A psychologist diagnosed him with an adjustment disorder and a personality disorder with schizoid features. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder . characterized by disintegration of thought processes and diminished . emotional responsiveness. A person is more likely to have it if a close family member, such as his sister who died, has it. Aron is reportedly being kept on suicide watch and the psychiatric evaluation recommends he remain hospitalized . 'His mood is neutral, practically blank,' the psychologist wrote in the report,  obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press. 'The only time he seems to show any emotional response is when he is asked difficult questions about the reason for his incarceration.' The evaluation offers little details on a possible motive and does not delve much into the crime. Aron admitted knowing the charges against him are serious, and acknowledged that people are angry with him. 'He states he did not wish the boy harm but that he ""panicked"",' the psychologist wrote. Aron, 35, has pleaded not guilty to murder and kidnapping in the death of Leiby, who got lost walking home from a Brooklyn religious day camp on July 11. The boy's severed feet were found in Aron's refrigerator, the rest of the body was discovered in pieces in a suitcase elsewhere in Brooklyn. During the evaluation, Aron, dressed in regulation pajamas and 'well-groomed,' gave conflicting accounts of most details of his life, including how many siblings he has and whether he sought mental health care previously. He said he suffered a head injury as a child, though it wasn't clear exactly when. 'Mr. Aron is unable (unwilling?) to state categorically whether or not he was in prior psychiatric treatment,' the psychologist wrote. Aron also was unclear about the voices he says he heard during and after the boy's death. He said he doesn't remember anything stressful happening when he began to hear the voice. 'He admitted to us that he began to hear a voice talking to him approximately one year ago, but cannot make out what it says,' according to the psychiatrist, who had recommended Aron remain at Bellevue Hospital. A judge disagreed and Aron is now being held without bail at a medical wing at Riker's Island in solitary confinement. 'He says he was too embarrassed to mention it to anyone,' the report said. Aron told the psychologist the voice does not command him to do anything, but he told doctors after his arrest that the voice commanded him to hurt himself and others, according to the records. The psychiatric evaluation was . ordered specifically to determine whether Aron would be fit for trial. The Brooklyn District Attorney's office had no comment. Aron's lawyer, Pierre Bazile, said the records obtained by the AP were accurate. 'The evaluators agreed with us that Mr. Aron suffers from some psychiatric disorders and right now we are . investigating whether or not his disorders are sufficient to meet the . not guilty by reason of mental disease or mental defect threshold,' he . said. The records filled in a few blanks about Aron's life, which was lived mostly alone except for a few impulsive decisions, such as moving to Memphis to get married to a woman he met online and had met in person only twice. Ordeal: Police have been removing item's from Aron's home as they look for evidence. Leiby's mother Esther joined family members for a walk to 'escort his soul to its final resting place' They divorced after a few years. Aron was employed as a hardware clerk, and earlier as a supermarket worker and a caterer. Aron spent much of his time online, and made a lot of audio and video recordings of himself doing karaoke. He lived alone in a home owned by his father and step mother, his brother lived in a separate apartment. His mother died about seven years ago. Both the psychiatrist and psychologist described Aron as reserved, apathetic, sad and cooperative. 'He did report having nightmares since . the incident which led to his arrest and having difficulty ""realizing . what happened"",' the psychologist wrote. Leiby, lost walking home from camp, met . Aron on the street and asked for help, prosecutors said. It was the . first time the little boy was allowed to walk alone, and he was supposed . to travel about seven blocks to meet his mother but missed a turn. No longer on Aron's side: Gerard Marrone, left, said his conscience prevented him from continuing to defend Aron, while the suspect's former wife, Debbie Kivel, right, filed for a protective order . The boy first asked for a ride to a bookstore. But 'on the way, he changed his mind and wasn't sure he wanted to go,' Aron wrote in his confession, according court papers. Aron decided to take the boy to a wedding upstate and, when they returned, they watched television before the boy fell asleep, police said. He remained there the next day while Aron went to work, authorities said. By that time, the disappearance had sparked a major search effort in his insular community in Borough Park. The boy's picture was plastered on light posts around the area. Aron panicked, according to court documents, and smothered the boy. The detectives' notes also outline alleged statement by Aron about how he carved up the body with knives and disposed of body parts, including the severed feet found wrapped in plastic his freezer. A cutting board and three bloody carving knives were found in the refrigerator. The medical examiner's office said the boy was given a cocktail of prescription drugs. But Aron's confession didn't mention that, and he denied ever tying up the boy, though marks were found on his body. A pretrial hearing is set for October 14.","Court-ordered psychiatric evaluation fills in blanks about Levi Aron's life .

Persona non grata: Plastic surgeon Toby Mayer has been told he won't be needed at the charity polo match in which Prince William is playing . It's the hottest ticket in town. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are in Los Angeles this weekend and the great and good of the movie world and high society are hoping to schmooze them. One of the highlights of their stay is set to be a charity polo match on Saturday. But in the leafy surrounds of the Santa Barbara club where Prince William will be playing, there is already a storm brewing in one of their china teacups. Beverley Hills plastic surgeon Toby Mayer has had his nose put out of joint after being told that, despite years of service tending to wounds on the touchline, his services will not be required. Dr Mayer, 69, had been expecting to be the man with the spongebag ready to attend to a royal knee in the event of a coming-together in the middle of a chukka. After sending out a press release and giving a series of interviews about his 'official' role, he received a call from the club's general manager, Ariana Nobel, saying he'd been 'deselected'. Dr Mayer said: 'I'm extremely disappointed with the polo club and this foundation that after 30 years of service to the membership that I was treated this way. 'Ariana said, ""They want to control the media"". There's not supposed to be any interviews granted unless they tell you it's OK.' Dr Mayer had boasted in the press release that he had been personally selected for the role by Buckingham Palace and that it was his responsibility to keep Prince William looking good. Kate and William will attend the charity polo match at the Santa Barbara club on July 9 . The release read: 'As the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are embarking on a new life, keeping Prince William healthy and looking Hollywood, camera-ready, is of utmost importance. 'I'm honoured to be selected by Buckingham Palace to be the Beverly Hills surgeon given that it's such an esteemed privilege to keep his royal highness looking good.' Ms Nobel and the event organisers said Dr Mayer had helped out at past matches, but would not be helping during Saturday's royal visit. Royal visit: A worker cleans up around the grand stand of the Santa Barbara Polo & Racquet Club ahead of the arrival of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . Ms Nobel said: 'Mayer was never confirmed as the plastic surgeon on site for the event. 'It seems as if he chose to assume he would be the doctor on site on the 9th since he has served as the doctor at many prior polo events at the Santa Barbara Polo Club.' The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are due to attend the event in support of the American Friends of The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry charity. Geannie Sheller, president of the Polo Training Centre, said she had already contracted an emergency medical technician and ambulance for the event. Prince of polo: William playing in a match last year. Dr Mayer boasted in a press release that it was his responsibility to keep the Prince 'looking Hollywood' She said: 'We did not request a medical doctor or plastic surgeon to be present during the polo match.'

A British tourist has been found drowned in a swimming pool at popular summer holiday destination Ibiza, and is the fifth young UK holidaymaker to die on the island this summer. Christopher Barrington died in the swimming pool at the three-star, £130-a-night Hotel Puchet in the party resort of San Antonio, where some of the world's biggest DJs spin. The 31-year-old was pulled unconscious from the pool at 4.30pm yesterday and despite the best efforts of the paramedics, who tried to revive him, he died poolside. The 31-year-old Brit was found drowned in the swimming pool at three-star Hotel Punchet in San Antonio . Revellers flock to the chill-out zone in San Antonio Bay, Ibiza - five Brits have died on the island so far this summer . It is understood that Mr Barrington was not a guest at the 212-room hotel - he was, in fact, residing at the two-star Hotel S'Anfora close by. Police are investigating why he was in the pool at the Puchet. 'A 31-year-old British tourist died in a hotel swimming pool on Tuesday afternoon,' a spokesman for the Civil Guard, investigating the death, said. 'We believe he drowned. We are waiting for the results of a post-mortem examination. At this stage we do not know what caused him to drown.' Earlier this month, on August 1, Barry Hesford, from Craigend in Glasgow, drowned in the pool of the Aparthotel THB Bahia in the same resort in similar circumstances. Barry Hesford, 21 (left), died earlier in August after being found dead in a swimming pool in Ibiza and 23-year-old Sam McCaughey (right) died after falling from the balcony in the San Antonio coastal resort .

When a thief repeatedly stole money from the till in their old-fashioned sweet shop, the owners came up with an ingenious plan to catch him. Placing concealed cameras among the jars, Jane and Neil Hutton waited in silence at Beehive Treats in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, to catch the thief in the act. Dubbing  their sting 'Operation Rhubarb and Custard', the couple also set 'booby traps' including rubbish-filled bin bags, bottles of cleaning products and cans . of cream soda to make a noise. Detectives: Neil and Jane Hutton caught an employee stealing from the till at their sweet shop after placing cameras among the jars . And the couple eventually got their man, catching employee Oliver Longstaff in the act, a court heard. Longstaff, 20, was given 'the shock of a lifetime' after battling through the series of obstacles to raid the till - only to find them lying in wait. Wycombe Magistrates' Court heard that . Longstaff, an aspiring actor and former grammar school pupil, was . stealing to pay off gambling debts which had spiralled out of control. He had amassed debts of £545 and been visited by debt collectors. His solicitor Stephen Toghill said: 'It was the panic caused by this debt collector turning up at his home. Caught out: Oliver Longstaff was taking the money from the till to help pay off a gambling debt following a visit from a debt collector . 'Basically he wanted to try and get some money quickly and he saw an easy option.' Longstaff, . who is due to go to drama school next month, had intended to re-gamble . the cash to pay off the debt - but lost it again betting. The court heard that Longstaff had crept out of the store room at the shop before the couple rushed him and locked the door until police arrived. It was a successful end to almost a week of detective work, triggered . after they became suspicious about cash seemingly disappearing from the . float left in the till overnight. They chose to place the cameras to catch the thief in the act and after identifying Longstaff, they vowed to catch him red handed. Mr Hutton, 47, said: 'At every stage there were little traps, things that would tell us exactly where he was and what he was doing. 'First the Victorian shop bell rang as someone came in and then there was the sound of the Windowlene bottle being knocked over by the first till. 'Next came the rustling of someone fighting through full bin bags in the dark and then, and this was not in the plan, the sounds of the loo being used and flushed. 'We had to desperately stop ourselves from laughing. 'Next he tripped over the cans of cream soda placed to distract him as he approached our hiding place.' However Mr Hutton also defended Longstaff. He said: 'He was charming and seemingly well-liked by everybody. 'Operation Rhubarb and Custard': The couple also set 'booby traps' including rubbish-filled bin bags, bottles of cleaning products and cans of cream soda at the shop in Marlow, Bucks . 'We were disappointed because we have always invested in the young people of Marlow, who have been fantastic, and for one to go the other way is a shock.' Longstaff, who pleaded guilty to burglary, was handed a 12-month supervision order which involves him seeking treatment for his 'gambling problem'. He was also ordered to do 40 hours' unpaid work, pay £85 court costs and pay £158 to Beehive Treats - the amount of money he stole that night. Sentencing Longstaff, magistrate Sandra Connor said: 'You are young and we believe it is your youth and lack of experience leading you along. 'Nonetheless, you betrayed your family and your employer's trust.' Outside court, Longstaff said it had been a 'really tough time' for him but wanted a fresh start. He said he hoped he could put it behind him and 'appear on screen one day'.","Couple catch employee in sting dubbed 'Operation Rhubarb and Custard'

Looking into a quasar - one of the brightest and most violent objects in the cosmos - researchers have found a mass of water vapour that's at least 140trillion times that of all the water in the world's oceans combined, and 100,000 times bigger than the sun. Because the quasar is so far away, its light has taken 12billion years to reach Earth. The observations therefore reveal a time when the universe was just 1.6billion years old.

Matt Bradford, a scientist at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said: 'The environment around this quasar is unique in that it's producing this huge mass of water. 'It's another demonstration that water is pervasive throughout the universe, even at the very earliest times.' A quasar is powered by an enormous black hole that is steadily consuming a surrounding disk of gas and dust; as it eats, the quasar spews out huge amounts of energy. Two teams of astronomers, each led by scientists at the California Institute of Technology, studied a particular quasar called APM 08279+5255, which harbours a black hole 20billion times more massive than the sun and produces as much energy as a thousand trillion suns. Since astronomers expected water vapour to be present even in the early universe, the discovery of water is not itself a surprise, according to Mr Bradford. There's water vapour in the Milky Way, although the total amount is 4,000 times less than in the quasar, as most of our galaxy's water is frozen. Nevertheless, water vapour is an important trace gas that reveals the nature of the quasar. In this particular quasar, the water vapour is distributed around the black hole in a gaseous region spanning hundreds of light-years - a light-year is about six trillion miles - and its presence indicates that the gas is unusually warm and dense by astronomical standards. Although the gas is a chilly -53C (-63F) and is 300trillion times less dense than Earth's atmosphere, it's still five times hotter and ten to 100 times denser than what is typical in galaxies like the Milky Way. The water vapour is just one of many . kinds of gas that surround the quasar, and its presence indicates that . the quasar is bathing the gas in both X-rays and infra-red radiation. The interaction between the radiation and water vapour reveals properties of the gas and how the quasar influences it. For example, analysing the water vapour shows how the radiation heats the rest of the gas. Furthermore, measurements of the water vapour and of other molecules, such as carbon monoxide, suggest that there is enough gas to feed the black hole until it grows to about six times its size. Whether this will happen is not clear as some of the gas may end up condensing into stars or may be ejected from the quasar. Mr Bradford's team started making their observations in 2008, using an instrument called Z-Spec at the Caltech Submillimetre Observatory (CSO), a ten-metre telescope near the summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Z-Spec is an extremely sensitive spectrograph, requiring temperatures cooled to within 0.06C above absolute zero. The instrument measures light in a region of the electromagnetic spectrum called the millimetre band, which lies between infra-red and microwave wavelengths. The researchers' discovery of water was possible only because Z-Spec's spectral coverage is ten times larger than that of previous spectrometers operating at these wavelengths. The astronomers made follow-up observations with the Combined Array for Research in Millimetre-Wave Astronomy, an array of radio dishes in the Inyo Mountains in southern California. The research will be published in Astrophysical Journal Letters.","Mass of water vapour is 140trillion times the size of all the water in the world's oceans combined .

Peace talks between American and the Taliban, which were being held in secret, have been 'blown out of the water' after details - including the identification of the Taliban's negotiator - were leaked. In a bitter blow to both parties, Tayyab Agha, Taliban leader Mullah Omar's former private secretary, was outed as the man leading his side's negotiations, which have been halted in their infancy. The breakdown of the talks, which began before the death of Osama bin Laden, has sparked claims that the details of the clandestine meetings were deliberately leaked by 'paranoid' Afghan government figures. Tayyab Agha, the former private secretary to Taliban leader Mullah Omar, has been outed as the man leading the negotiations . It has come to light that the meetings, designed to broker a peace deal between the terrorist group and its opponents who have fought a decade-long bloody war in Afghanistan and on the Pakistani border, took place in Germany and Qatar this year. It is alleged that Agha met with senior officials from the US State Department and Central Intelligence Agency, and the discussions were mediated by Michael Steiner, Germany's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Western diplomats indicated that the negotiations had only been at the preliminary stage, and were designed to show the Taliban, who admitted to the 9/11 attacks 10 years ago which killed 3,000 people, that the U.S. and its allies are deadly serious about forging peace. The diplomats told the Daily Telegraph that the terrorist group's leaders were wary of opening talks with the Americans, as they thought that the U.S. only wanted to find out their movements. Germany's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan Michael Steiner was reported to be mediating the discussions . Further, the leaders believed that if news of the discussions were publically aired, they would lose face and credibility in the wake of their former leader, bin Laden's killing in May. However, following just three meetings - one in Qatar and the other two in Germany held in March and April - details have been leaked to the Washington Post and German newspaper Der Spiegel - both named Agha as the principal Taliban negotiator. Sources suggest that Agha has not been seen since the revelations, despite the efforts of American officials, who attempted to contact him through intermediaries in Quetta and Peshawar in Pakistan. According to the leaks, talks between the U.S. and the Taliban had taken place before he was killed in May . 'The talks were a big deal, the real thing,' a source 'close to the talks' told the Telegraph. 'I hope people will learn the lesson on the importance of confidentiality in the early stages. People in the US are horrified about what has happened.' Meanwhile other sources in Kabul - the second largest city in Afghanistan - also agreed that the discussions had been 'blown out of the water'. For years the Taliban had rejected Afghan president, Hamid Karzai's attempts to get around the negotiation table. However, details of contact with a senior aide to Mullah Omar sparked quiet confidence in Kabul - U.S. officials wanted to keep the Afghan government in the loop, so told them of the meetings. The former deputy European Union representative in Kabul and an expert on the Taliban, Michael Semple believes that the leaking of the meeting's details will be hugely damaging to both sides. 'The Taliban have long claimed that they will drive the foreigners out by force before contemplating talks,' he told the Telegraph. 'They need a period of confidential contact to satisfy themselves that there is something serious on offer to warrant them taking the big step of acknowledging that negotiations have to start now and not after things have been settled on the battlefield. 'When the fact that talks had taken place and the identity of the Taliban envoy were leaked the Taliban shifted into their version of damage control. 'The leadership put it about that the contacts were nothing out of the ordinary. 'They were just routine discussions about prisoner releases, which a movement at war has to undertake periodically. 'It is hardly surprising that the Taliban chose to downplay the significance of Tayyab Agha's mission. 'In terms of progress towards negotiations which might end the war, it has proved a case of one step forward and two steps back.'","Only three meetings took place - one in Qatar and the other two in Germany .

The prime suspect in the brutal double knife murder of a young couple was under arrest in hospital today after apparently trying to take his own life. Police say a 31-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of the hotel workers, both aged 20, who were both found stabbed to death in the blood-spattered staff quarters next to the Radisson Edwardian Hotel in Harlington, near Heathrow Airport. The suspect, who was held at an address in nearby Hillingdon, is now under arrest at a west London hospital where he was being treated for 'wrist and neck injuries'. A knife was also recovered. Investigation: A police cordon today remained in place on New Road, Harlington, next to the Radisson Edwardian Heathrow hotel, west London . The grisly discovery of the couple - . one is understood to be English, the other East European - was made by a . concerned colleague at the Radisson Edwardian Hotel and conference . centre on Wednesday. A source close to the case claimed yesterday the man died from over 20 knife wounds, while the woman had her throat cut. It was also claimed that the woman thought to have been murdered had only worked at the hotel on reception for around two weeks. Their bodies were later removed from the staff quarters which is in a semi-detached building behind the hotel. A source who did not wish to be . named, told MailOnline yesterday: 'The three people were supposed to be . going into work for duty at 7am yesterday morning, but when they didn't . show up one of the reception managers went looking for them. 'I have heard it was a complete . bloodbath - the girl had her throat cut and the man was stabbed over 20 . times, it sounded horrific. 'I believe the three of them all knew each other, but something happened which caused a massive row and it all boiled over. 'I'm amazed it has happened - the hotel is one of the best around.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:09 PM on 11th August 2011 . The FBI has joined the frantic hunt for a female American tourist missing in Aruba, as authorities on the Caribbean island continued to hold her supposed travel partner who insists she drowned in a snorkelling accident. Gary Giordano, from Maryland, is being held in prison on the island as authorities stepped up the effort to fins out what . happened to his friend, 35-year-old Robyn Gardner. He has said she . disappeared in a tragic accident while they were snorkeling off the western tip of the . island. Scroll down for video . Mystery: Gary Giordano (L) 'emphatically denies' any involvement in the disappearance of Robyn Gardner (R) Giordano was detained on Friday as he tried to leave Aruba. 'The suspect is standing by his story that they went snorkelling and that Robyn did not resurface,' Aruban Solicitor General Taco Stein said. Earlier, . the prosecutor's office said it decided to detain Giordano because of questions about information he . gave police about the disappearance. Prosecutors have not said what . prompted their suspicions. Mystery: Robyn Gardner, 35, shows off her tattoos while relaxing in the sun . Gardner's younger brother, Andrew Colson, said Giordano seemed too calm when his mother came to Aruba to help find her daughter. 'He didn't seem very sorrowful. He wasn't mournful or anything,' Colson said in a phone interview from Odenton, Maryland. Colson, . who last saw his sister in May, said Aruban authorities asked them not . to discuss the case in detail, but that they do not believe Giordano's . account of what happened. He said she was unlikely to have been . snorkelling in the first place. 'I think there's more to it,' he said. 'She just wouldn't want to ruin her make-up or get her hair wet.' Giordano's Aruban lawyer, Michael Lopez, said his client was being unjustly held. 'Our client emphatically denies being . involved in any malicious act concerning his friend and consequently . does not consider himself a suspect,' Lopez said in a written statement. The two Americans had been in Aruba a . couple of days when they decided to go snorkelling on August 2 near an . area known as Baby Beach, Lopez said. He added that the pair eventually . realised they were being pulled out to sea by the current and Giordano . tapped on Gardner's leg to signal that they should swim back. When he . got to shore, he noticed she wasn't with him and ran to get help after . looking for her unsuccessfully in the water, the lawyer said. Mystery: Ms Gardner was visiting the island with Gary Giordano, who was detained for questioning on Friday while trying to leave the . island . Fight: Gardner's boyfriend Richard Forester said the couple had a row before she left for Aruba . Lopez said that in the following . days, Giordano assisted with the search and answered questions from . police. He said his client waited until the woman's mother arrived . before he decided he should return to the U.S. Giordano says he was . given permission to leave by an official at the U.S. consulate on the . nearby island of Curacao, the lawyer said. The U.S. vice consul, Winnie Hofstetter, declined to comment on the case. Lopez said that after being detained, . Giordano initially declined to cooperate further with prosecutors and . police because he felt he was being wrongly detained. 'As judicial representative of our . client we can say that after reading and analysing everything there is . until now in his case file, there is no concrete or direct indication . that our client might be involved in any illicit act concerning his . friend,' Lopez said. New video of the search shows Giordano accompanying police as they searched the water around where he said Gardner disappeared. The scene: The Renaissance Aruba Resort & Casino in Oranjestad, where Ms Gardner and Mr Giordano were reportedly staying during the holiday . Worried: Ms Gardner's boyfriend of two-and-a-half years, Richard Forester, has made a public appeal for help as the search continues . Giordano is from Gaithersburg, Maryland. His lawyer said he runs an employment agency. Earlier today, news emerged Giordana was . divorced from his ex-wife in 2008 'amid allegations of domestic . violence' during which she obtained a restraining order, according to . court reports. At least one other woman sought a similar order against him, Gawker reported. Giordano, who also has several arrests on his record for thefts under $500. Gardner, a 5ft 5in blonde with . prominent tattoos on her arm, rib cage and right bicep, had worked in . the past as a patient care coordinator at a dental office in Bethesda, . Maryland, said said Richard A Forester, who said he was her boyfriend. Unsolved: Natalee Holloway was 18 when she vanished on Aruba on holiday in 2005 . Forester said Gardner lived much of . the time with him in Rockville, Maryland, and had said that she and . Giordano were platonic friends. The pair were scheduled to spend about . five days in Aruba, Forester said. 'I'm starting to believe that's not . true,' Forester said in a phone interview. 'I'm starting to believe . there was some romantic thing.' Forester said he and Gardner had been . in contact through Facebook until just before she disappeared. After . she vanished, her Google Chat indicators showed she was active on Gmail, . then on but not active, and finally off, he said. It seemed to indicate . that she or someone else had been on her Gmail account, he said. 'I'm terrified as to what may have . happened to her,' he said. 'I'm sad and scared that I might not see her . again. I love her very much and all I am concerned about is that she . gets home safely.' Forester earlier, told WJLA 7 News he had a fight . with Gardner shortly before she left for the vacation on July 31. 'The last message I got from her was, ""I love you, we'll talk and sort things out when I get back,""' Mr Forester said.He described Mr Giordano as a rival . for Ms Gardner's affections and said he does not believe Mr Giordano's . account. 'I just don't think that she was snorkelling. I just feel in my heart that something happened at this person's hand,' he said. 'We went on vacations and I couldn't even get her to put her head under water in the pool. 'She . was into makeup and hair and knowing her she would have had a few . cocktails already and would only be getting ready to go out that nigh,' he continued. Robyn Gardner's wild and rowdy tattoos belie the kind, quiet nature of a trusting woman who sought solace in a tropical getaway with a man who is now suspected in her disappearance, a close friend added. 'She's a very trusting person,' former room mate Christina Jones said at her hair salon in downtown Frederick. 'She's a hardworking, loyal, standup female who has never said anything bad about anyone.' Aruba has experience dealing with . missing person cases following the still unsolved disappearance of . Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway during a high school class trip to the . island in 2005. Her remains were never found and the main suspect, . Joran van der Sloot, is in jail in Peru on charges of killing a . 21-year-old woman last May. A long wait: Natalee Holloway's mother, Beth Twitty, launched a non-profit resource centre to assist families of missing persons last year . The FBI is still looking for leads in the disappearance of the 18-year-old Natalee Holloway, who vanished on the island of Aruba while on a high school graduation holiday in 2005. Twenty-three-year-old Dutchman Joran Van der Sloot has long been suspected in the case. He was the last person seen with her and was subsequently arrested. Van der Sloot is now suspected of murdering a young woman in Peru, where he is in prison and awaiting trial. He has several times confessed then recanted a role in the disappearance of Holloway, and has also been indicted by U.S. authorities for his alleged involvement in a plot to extort $250,000 from Holloway's family for information on her death and the location of her body. No charges have ever been filed in the Holloway case. And the Alabama teenager's body has never been found. In April, the National Enquirer reported a Peruvian prison informant said van der Sloot had confessed to the crime  while they were imprisoned in the country's notorious Miguel Castro Castro jail, and allegedly said he murdered Holloway because she refused to have sex with him . Snitch: A prisoner at a Peruvian jail has reportedly been told by Joran van der Sloot (pictured here) that he buried the body of Miss Holloway in an Aruban crypt . Van der Sloot, who is awaiting trial for the brutal murder of 21-year-old business student Stephany Flores, also allegedly used a laptop to email a friend the gruesome details of Holloway's  murder. He is being held in Lima's Castro prison, where his lawyer said he gives English lessons to other inmates. The break in the case gives fresh hope to Natalee's mother, Beth Twitty, who has been desperate for information on the whereabouts of her daughter for six years. Ms Twitty launched the Natalee Holloway Resource Centre last year, a non-profit resource centre to assist families of missing persons. Watch video here .

This morning a Pueblo County judge set bond for the infamous Dougherty siblings and rejected objections from their lawyer about photos of his clients being taken at the jail. According to an arrest affidavit, Dougherty told police 'I deserved to get shot', after she was wounded and captured at the end of a high speed chase. Appearing by video link, the trio face charges of attempted first-degree murder of a police officer and are expected to be charged with first-degree assault on a peace officer with a firearm after they led the FBI on a nationwide manhunt.

The injured trio were then taken to Spanish Peak's Medical Center to be treated before being transferred in the hospital outfits to prison. During the earlier chase, Lee-Grace, 29, got out of the gang's high-powered Subaru Impreza and . started shooting at police with a handgun. Officers returned fire, hitting her in the . leg. Her brothers Ryan, 21, and Dylan, 26, fled in a different directions and were . arrested a short time later.

County Sheriff Chris Nocco said about the gang's capture: 'I'm proud to say we won. We continuously said that if these . three fugitives wanted a battle with law enforcement, we would win that . battle. And that's what happened today.' Kevin Widner, who was one of the police officers at the scene, today said: 'At first it was like, ""Wow, you know, they're shooting at me."" And then it turned to I just want to catch them before they hurt anybody.' Three highway workers reportedly helped track and capture that sibling. Dave Dallaguardia told ABC's Good Morning America that he followed Ryan Dougherty in his truck even after the fugitive had motioned at him as if he had a gun. Mr Dallaguardia said he had no idea he was chasing one of the Dougherty siblings and his wife later scolded him for pursuing him. He said he and his co-workers came from small, blue-collar towns.

Lawrence Taylor, one of the most venerated American footballers in history, should have been slung in jail, according to an underage he paid to have sex with. The 52-year-old former New York Giants linebacker - a double Super Bowl winner - changed his plea and admitted to soliciting sex with teenager Christina Fierro last year, but 'LT' was handed only a six-year sentence on probation. The young women, now 18, spoke out - via her lawyer, Gloria Allred - at a news conference in New York, and expressed outrage at what she views as a derisory punishment. She was found to have been the victim of sex trafficking, and thinks that Taylor's sentence 'sends out the wrong signal'. Though Taylor was also made to have his name inked on the sex offenders' register, she believes that the former NFL player 'should have been sentenced to jail time - not probation - for the crimes he committed'. A statement read out by Mrs Allred outside Federal Court in New York said: 'Christina and I were appalled that he [Taylor] was permitted to enter the plea that he did. 'Even the district attorny himself told the press that Christina was a sex trafficiking victim, not a prostitute. 'Yet Taylor was permitted to enter the plea and as a result Christina has been wrongly characterised by the press. 'Also Christina felt that Taylor should have been sentenced to jail time - not probation - for the crimes that he committed against her. 'Sentencing him to probation sends out the wrong message to the buyers who provide the profit to commecial sex traffickers who sell the bodies of children for sex.' The teen, who said that pimp Rasheed Davis beat her and forced her to have sex with clients, said herself: 'I am a human being and I am hurting for what they did.'

Taylor, who has a history of drink and drugs problems, pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct and soliciting a prostitute. He has a checked past and two years ago was arrested in Miami-Dade County, Florida, after leaving the scene of an accident having hit another vehicle with his Cadillac Escalade. He had already committed a similar offense in 1996 when he wrote off his Lexus in an accident which involved one other car before leaving the scene of the crime. Rasheed Davi was sentenced to seven years in jail . The New York Giants' stadium, Dodger Stadium, where two men beat up a man - and hospitalised him . On that occasion he argued that he did not think the law required the reporting of a single driver incident. He was released on a $500 bond, and the other driver later sued him, seeking $15,000. He was arrested six months later for having sex at Rockland County Holiday Inn with a 16-year-old girl - Miss Fierro. He was charged with felony third-degree statutory rape, for allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse with someone under 17 and charged with third-degree patronisation for allegedly paying the underage girl $300 to have sex with him. He had faced up to five years in prison and lifetime sex offender registration if convicted of both crimes. On June 23, 2010, Taylor was indicted on these charges, and pleaded not guilty on July 13. On January 13 this year Taylor pleaded guilty to some of the charges thereby resolving the case. In March he was sentenced to six years probation as part of a plea agreement, which saw him plead guilty to the misdemeanours of sexual misconduct and patronising a prostitute. Rasheed Davis, 37, who pleaded guilty to a charge of sex trafficking, was sentenced to seven years in jail after setting up 16-year-old Miss Fierro with Lawrence Taylor. He had allegedly tried to bribe the teen and wrote: 'Let me know what LT gave you; I will give you more to help reduce my time.' Miss Fierro said in court: 'It has been a nightmare that should have never happened to me and it should never happen to any other teenage girl. 'We are not pieces of property to be bought or sold. I am a human being, and I am hurting because of what they did.' In court Davis told the teen: 'I'm sorry I put you all through this again; its going to be another long ride. I'm sorry for the pain I caused you, mentally and physically. I should have never put you in this position.' Two men accused of brutally beating a San Francisco Giants fan outside Dodger Stadium pleaded not guilty yesterday. The pleas were made in spite of the fact that prosecutors said they had made admissions in the well-publicised case. Louie Sanchez, 28, and Marvin Norwood, 30, entered their pleas during a brief arraignment to charges of mayhem and assault and battery in the March 31 attack of Bryan Stow, a Santa Cruz paramedic who suffered severe brain injuries and remains hospitalised. Prosecutor Frank Santoro said in court he did not object to a motion to allow television cameras in the courtroom because the case is built on admissions, not witness identifications. 'The case is based on admissions from both of them,' said Santoro, who provided no further details.","Pimp sentenced to seven years in jail .

"Last year Shannon Flynn, 27, claimed she has slept with 70 men in 10 years . She demanded sex at least four times a day . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:26 PM on 11th August 2011 . Sex addict: The beautician was prone to violence if her boyfriend did not satisfy her in the bedroom . A self-confessed female sex addict admitted drunkenly attacking a doorman while on a night out, a court heard yesterday. Shannon Flynn, 27, last year publicly confessed to being a sex addict who was prone to violence if her boyfriend did not satisfy her in the bedroom. Now she has admitted attacking bouncer  Bulen Aksoy outside Edinburgh nightspot, Garibaldis on October 28. The former beautician spat on her victim and kicked him on his body just after midnight Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard. Mr Aksoy was injured as a result of the attack but declined medical attention. The sex addict who claims to have slept with 70 men said owning up to her battle with sex and alcohol has helped her turn her life around. Defence agent James Stewart said Flynn . was currently living with her mother. He said: 'Alcohol was involved in . provoking the attack.' Sheriff Isabella McColl called for background reports and deferred sentence until next month. Speaking outside court Flynn said the attack on the bouncer was not related to her sex addiction, but her problems with alcohol. She added: 'I had a sex addiction. It's related to alcohol. The sex addiction only came out when I was . drunk. But I've calmed down now.' Flynn said she was now takes tablets three times a week, which make her sick when she has a drink. She said that speaking out about her addiction has helped her battle her demons. She said: 'I go to counseling once a week now. And I've not got a boyfriend. Attack: Sharon Flynn admitted attacking a bouncer outside Edinburgh nightspot, Garibaldis . 'When we were together I think he was more the girl and I was more the guy. I'm staying away from men. This year's my year.' Flynn spoke out about her sex addiction after revelations about Tiger Woods' sex life emerged last year. She confessed that even after she had sex with ex-partner, banker Jamie Thexton, in the morning, she was still hungry for love when he came home at night. If she was not satisfied, she became moody, and even violent,  and said she demanded sex at least four times a day. She claimed to have slept with 70 men over the last 10 years, including several one-night stands and casual affairs. During an interview last year she admitted throwing a mobile phone at one lover after he denied her sex . 'I'm not usually violent, but my desire for sex takes over all my senses,' She said if she was unable to satisfy her sexual desires the withdrawal symptoms were horrendous. She said: 'Hardly anyone can understand what I am going through on a daily basis. Every hour of every day, all I can think about is sex.'","Last year Shannon Flynn, 27, claimed she has slept with 70 men in 10 years .

"By . Richard Shears . Last updated at 2:16 PM on 12th August 2011 . The family of teenager Madeleine Pulver, who was at the centre of the 'fake bomb' drama last week, has been told that an arrest is imminent. Detectives have identified a suspect after 18-year-old Miss Pulver told them that the man who attached the collar bomb to her at her home in Sydney, Australia, had 'old wrinkly eyes'. The suspect has already been spoken to by detectives from Strike Force Haddon, but has yet to be formally interviewed, Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported today. Clue: Madeleine Pulver, seen here walking a dog with a friend near her Sydney home, has been told an arrest in the 'collar bomb' hoax case is imminent . Back to normal: Madeleine Pulver puts on a brave face to play hockey for her school last week, days after her terrifying ordeal . Madeleine is said to have described her attacker as having wrinkly eyes that she could see peering through the balaclava he wore when he broke into her home in the harbourside Sydney suburb of Mosman. 'Our most important goal is to solve this case as quickly as possible and protect the interests of the victim,' a police spokesman said. The paper said the development in the police investigation is the reason no description has been issued publicly following the drama, which made international headlines. Madeleine Pulver's family say they will not feel safe until the suspected extortionist is found . A police source said it had not been necessary to seek public help in identifying the offender because investigators had identified the person they believed responsible soon after the incident. Miss Pulver's father, Mr Bill Pulver, . a wealthy IT businessman, and his family have been told that police . were making headway with the investigation and an arrest was expected . imminently. The family has also been told that there is no need for 'ongoing fear or concern'. Despite . reports earlier this week that the family had been told to employ a . security guard in case of a further attack, a source close to the family . said that was untrue. Police have refused to comment when asked whether the suspect was an older man with wrinkly eyes. It took officers ten hours to remove the device from Miss Pulver's neck and discover it was a fake. Multiple . fingerprints have been found on the sophisticated bomb-like device that . was strapped to Miss Pulver's neck and on a USB stick inside the . square-shaped box.

An 83-year-old woman allegedly scratched and beat a policeman’s arm until it bled after she was pulled over for an illegal U-turn in her vehicle. Rosella Robinson was spotted by the officer in an area of Elgin, Illinois, known for drug and gang activity, police said. 'Attack': Rosella Robinson, 83, of Elgin, Illinois, allegedly scratched and beat a policeman's arm until it bled after she was pulled over for an illegal U-turn . The incident started on Monday afternoon when she realised she was being watched and made the U-turn before driving away, police said. Robinson allegedly tried to get away before the officer stopped her,  reached into her car and switched off the ignition. She allegedly then grabbed the officer’s arm, scratching and beating on it until it bled as he tried to take away her keys. The woman claimed she wanted to leave so the officer was trying to stop her driving off, reported the Chicago Sun-Times.

The man beaten and robbed by thugs during the London riots died in hospital late last night as it emerged he had suffered at the hands of yobs for years. After three days spent on a life support machine Richard Mannington Bowes, 68, died as a result of the serious head injuries he sustained at the height of the riots on Monday night. He was set upon by thugs and knocked over as he tried to stamp out a fire. Today, stunned residents left floral tributes at the spot where Mr Bowes was attacked. Others paid tribute to the 'local hero' who 'upheld the British way of life'. Tragic: In this haunting picture which has just emerged, Richard Mannington Bowes lies dying on the ground as neighbour Peter Firstbrook, 60, and a police officer battle to save his life . Attacked: Richard Mannington Bowes, 68, was critically injured after the riots in Ealing and had lived as a virtual recluse, deliberately cut off from his family since shortly after his sister's wedding, at which he is pictured right . And as detectives today questioned a 22-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder, it has emerged Mr Mannington Bowes was a . civic-minded man of old fashioned values who had been forced to confront . yobs on his own doorstep for years. The reclusive former accountant had . long been tormented by thugs who urinated on his front door and threw . litter outside his home, according to friends and neighbours. However, his courage and habit of never walking away from something he considered wrong eventually cost him his life. Police said next of kin have been informed and a post-mortem examination will be held in due course. Detective Chief Inspector John McFarlane of the Homicide and Serious Crime Command said: ‘This was a brutal incident that resulted in the senseless killing of an innocent man. ‘I still need the assistance of the community who may have witnessed the attack on Richard, to come forward and provide information or images they may have recorded on mobile devices. This information could be crucial in catching his killer.’ A young woman lays flowers at the scene where Mr Bowes was attacked in the riots in Ealing, and right, message of condolences are written on the floral tribute . 'Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Your bravery hasn't gone unnoticed,' reads one message. 'May your killer be brought to justice,' adds another . Poignant: A woman attaches flower to the gate above the spot where Mr Bowes was attacked . Prior to his death, his sister last . night spoke of her distress at his plight and Mayor of London Boris . Johnson described him as a ‘hero’. In fact, it was the first time in 30 . years that Mr Bowes and his sister, mother of three Anne Wilderspin, 73, . have been in contact. Mrs Wilderspin, who lives in Derbyshire, has travelled down to London to see her gravely ill brother. ‘I . was shocked,’ she told ITV news. ‘It was sort of unreal because you . don’t think anything like that happens to a relative of yours. ‘We’ve been horrified by the reports . of the riots. I’m very sad that we have to see him like this, but in one . way I’m very pleased that we could make contact again.’ Boris . Johnson, on a visit to see the riot damage in the West London suburb, . said: ‘There are many villains in this story but also many heroes and I . want to pay particular tribute to Mr Bowes. ‘But he has paid a terrible price. I am desperately sorry for him.’ Aid: A bystander and riot officer tend to Mr Bowes injuries before he was taken to hospital . Help: Richard Mannington Bowes, left, is assisted by Peter Firstbrook and a police officer during the riots in Ealing . Concern: A police officer and another man come to the victim's aid in one of the most horrifying pictures to emerge from the rioting . Neighbours . described Mr Bowes, who lived alone in a flat overlooking Haven Green, . as a man who would always stand up to trouble makers. One local businessman, who was himself being attacked, said: ‘Mr Bowes had a real civic pride. ‘He was a very quiet man who cared . greatly about his neighbourhood. We do have some drunks at the weekend . occasionally causing trouble and Mr Bowes would always challenge them . and tell them off. ‘He was a true gentleman who had old fashioned values.’ Detective Chief Inspector John McFarlane said the investigation could turn into a murder inquiry and appealed for Mr Bowes’s assailant to give himself up. A handful of police had arrived at 10.45pm on Monday to reports of looting in Ealing. Massively outnumbered, they called for back-up as they were showered with missiles and saw Mr Bowes being attacked. Bystander father-of-four Peter Firstbrook dragged the pensioner away from the fire. The 60-year-old documentary filmmaker, who broke through the lines of rioters to help, said: ‘There were about 120 youths. One of them, a big black lad in his early twenties, approached me and said something like: ""There’s one of your lot over there and he’s injured"".' Aftermath: Forensic officers examine the scene in Ealing close to where Mr Bowes was killed, and right, a burnt out car sits on the streer . Damage: Council workers begin the cleanup operation on Ealing High Street after the night of unrest earlier this week . ‘Three young lads from the crowd also seemed quite concerned and helped me drag him to an alleyway. He was unconscious and had blood coming from his ear. There were no external injuries.’ Patrick Kennedy, 68, the landlord of the block of flats near where he was fatally injured, described his death as a tragedy. Speaking at the scene today, Mr Kennedy said: 'He was a very kind man with old English values. He was a decent man who always upheld the British way of life which, sadly, is a diminished figure. 'I know he lived alone, but I would always see him walking about in his shorts. He was always happy which is so refreshing. He used to be an accountant, but he retired years ago. 'He was very dignified and never spoke about himself or gave any clues about his background. The only clue was his double-barrelled name. 'Ealing is quite a decent community and we usually know each other quite well. It is shocking that this should have happened, a tragedy. He set out a moral way of life.' Ealing Council Leader Julian Bell, who also visited the scene to pay his respects, said he would support a petition to re-name the Mews after Mr Bowes.

We can get through this: A shopkeeper paints a message of love on her boarded up shop in Ealing after it was damaged in the riots . He said: 'I think as a borough we need to pay tribute to this man and I think it is a great idea.  We have a special council meeting on Tuesday to discuss the riots and the aftermath and all the consequences of it and we will begin that by paying tribute to Mr Bowes with one minute's silence. 'We have street naming and numbering sections in the council and they would deal with that petition, but as the leader of the council I would also be asked. 'The Mayor has already said that he is going to set up a fund to help the victims of the riots and that includes Mr Bowes' family. 'It is deeply shocking for everyone in the community and the incident that happened here was terribly tragic. For all the residents of Ealing, our hearts go out to his family and we hope that someone is charged for the actions of the thugs which, sadly, turned into murder. 'He was just doing the right thing and was set up on by people with no values or humanity. I knew for some time that he was very ill and was critical because the police told me. 'I feel despair, sadness and anger, a mixture of all these feelings and emotions. How can people do  such things? For an innocent man to lose his life is awful. 'In the borough we have pockets of deprivation, but Ealing town centre is relatively prosperous. I would never have dreamt that this could happen, that a riot here could result in a man being murdered.' Tributes left at the scene included one from staff at the local shopping centre outside which Mr Bowes had been trying to stamp out a fire.  It read: 'Whilst trying to help he was attacked and died, look after him God - at least he tried.

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 3:55 PM on 12th August 2011 . Perhaps it’s just time to close the doomed thing forever. An amusement park in New York last night again shut a rollercoaster from which an amputee Iraq war veteran fell to his death last month. A chain snapped on the Darien Lake Theme Park & Resort's Ride of Steel, which stranded 32 riders near the top of one of the rollercoaster's hills. Tragic accident: Iraq veteran Sergeant James Hackemer visited the theme park with several members of his family, including his two daughters . Everyone could walk down the side of the track safely and the ride remains closed, park officials said. Army Sergeant James Hackemer, 29, . was riding the same ride on July 8 when he was lifted from his . seat, thrown to the ground and died. Operator error was to blame for the . father-of-two’s death from blunt force trauma and the park had improperly trained . workers, state officials said. Sergeant Hackemer, who was travelling . at 50mph when he flew out of his seat, lost both of his legs to a . roadside bomb in Iraq in 2008. Investigators said the ride was . mechanically fine and safety devices were working properly but . operators did not follow rules posted at the ride's entrance, which . require that riders have both legs. Two violations: The theme park was cited for not properly training the ride's operators and operators being unfamiliar with the coaster's safety requirements . Reopened to the public: The Ride of Steel roller coaster reaches speeds in excess of 70mph and its highest peak is 208ft . A seatbelt and metal bar restrain . riders by the legs, shins and lap. But Sergeant Hackemer was noy wearing . his prosthetic legs when he shifted from his wheelchair into a front . seat of the ride. This wasn't the first serious accident . on the Ride of Steel that first launched following a . $12million improvement to the park in 1999. Shortly after its grand opening, Mike . Dwaileebe, then 37, of Olean, fell out of his seat 10ft to the ground . as the ride was braking on its final approach near the station house. Mr Dwaileebe suffered multiple rib fractures and internal injuries in the accident. Six Flags, the operator of the park . at the time, had argued that the injuries resulted because Dwaileebe, . who weighed more than 300lbs, was too large for the seat's lap-restraint . bar to engage. Park officials later added safety . belts. But a Cattaraugus County jury found the park fully liable and . awarded a $4million verdict to Mr Dwaileebe, before the case was eventually . settled for $2.85million. The Labour Department said Darien . Lake did not properly train the ride's operators on the safety and . operations restrictions and operators were unfamiliar with the coaster's . safety requirements. The ride, which had been closed since . the accident, was re-opened on July 22 after operators received fresh . training in safety procedures and clearer safety signs were posted. Managers were told to review all . safety restrictions on every ride before the start of each operator's . shift and there were due to be more random, unannounced audits to make . sure rules are followed. 'We were all devastated by this . tragedy, and are committed to doing everything we can to prevent . something like this from ever reoccurring,' the park’s general manager . Christopher Thorpe said. Thrill ride enthusiasts said at the time the accident did not deter them from riding the roller coaster. 'Stuff happens,' said Shawn Lingg, . 30, of Rochester, who rode the coaster a few minutes after it reopened the first time. Inspiring figure: Sergeant James Hackemer, pictured with charity workers, often spoke of his desire to stay active . 'People get in car accidents all the time. They don't . stop driving cars.' Bill Pufky of Cicero, who was in the . first car along with his 11-year-old daughter Rachel, said: 'Dad . tightened everything a little tighter.' He called the death 'a tragic . and unfortunate accident.' Sergeant Hackemer came out of his . seat and its restraints on the last and second-highest of three hills on . the coaster, which reaches speeds in excess of 70mph and whose highest . peak is 208ft. The veteran struck the front of the . eight-car train and fell about 150ft, landing on a grassy area. He was . on the ride with his nephew, Ashton, when the tragic accident happened.","Darien Lake Theme Park & Resort Ride of Steel closed .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:07 PM on 12th August 2011 . Silvio Berlusconi will tonight hold an emergency cabinet meeting to bring in reforms aimed at dealing with Italy's mounting debt crisis. The Italian prime minister is expected to slash public spending and impose new taxes on the wealthy in an effort to slow the rate at which the country is piling on debt. The meeting - set for 7pm local time - comes in response to demands from the European Central Bank (ECB) for urgent measures to spur economic growth and balance the budget by 2013. Troubled economy: Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, left, and finance minister Giulio Tremonti attend a debate in the upper house of parliament in Rome . European markets have swung wildly this week on rumours that indebted eurozone governments are teetering on the brink of a new debt crisis. After days of criticism for a lack of clarity on its plans, Berlusconi's centre-right government looks set to levy a 'solidarity tax' on high earners and raise the tax level on the financial sector. The measures were agreed in late-night discussions between Mr Berlusconi and economy minister Giulio Tremonti; but other steps, notably those concerning pension reform, remain to be decided. The government must make €20billion of extra savings and revenue to meet its new balanced budget target and reassure investors it can control debt running at 120 per cent of gross domestic product. Mr Berlusconi and Mr Tremonti held a series of meetings yesterday with President Giorgio Napolitano and Bank of Italy Governor Mario Draghi as they scrambled to nail down details of the package. The 'solidarity tax' would take the form of an extra 5 per cent on income above €90,000 and a 10 per cent addition to tax on income above €150,000, business daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported. The tax rate on financial income is set to jump from 12.5 per cent to 20 per cent, with the exception of income from government bonds - the sale of which are crucial to Italy's continued solvency. Further measures could include a bid to raise the number of working days in a year by ensuring that non-religious public holidays, such as the June 2 anniversary of the founding of the Italian Republic, are celebrated on a Sunday. The market chaos which threatened to spin Italy's borrowing costs out of control last week has eased since the ECB intervened to buy up huge chunks of the country's debt. While Italy's budget deficit is below the euro-zone average and should shrink to around 3.2 per cent of gross domestic product this year, the country's sovereign debt passed the €1.9 trillion mark in June. But the continuing fear among investors that the eurozone's third largest economy is running an insustainable course have led to sharp falls on Italian stock markets. Stock market regulator Consob today announced a temporary ban on short-selling financial stocks in a bid to calm the volatility that has hammered Italian bank shares. In response, the main Milan index was trading nearly 2 percent higher earlier today. Despite its huge public debt, Italy had remained on the sidelines of the eurozone crisis until last month when doubts about the government's unity and capacity to control its finances triggered a massive sell-off of Italian bonds. Proud history: Tourists at the Pantheon, Rome. Many local public services will be privatised after demands from the European Central Bank . Italian media reported that Prime Minister Berlusconi was considering issuing a special video message to explain the austerity plan, which will fast-track a number of measures contained in a €48billion package passed last month. But major disagreements remain and sensitive reforms to the pension system remain undecided, with Berlusconi's Northern League coalition partners and Italy's biggest trade union both strongly opposed to any cuts. Yesterday, Mr Tremonti told a parliamentary committee that the ECB had demanded measures to break down barriers to competition in services and the professions and free up rigid labour market rules. The recommendations included privatisation of local public services, more flexible employment contracts, easier hiring and firing to free up the rigid labour market and cuts to public sector pay. Additional measures included increasing the retirement age for women working in the private sector and a change in rules on when workers can retire based on their pension contributions. Mr Tremonti said the proposals on hiring and firing and cuts to public sector pay, both of which would raise fierce political opposition, were not in the government's plans.","Government set to introduce 'solidarity tax' on richest .

"By . Sara Nelson . Last updated at 4:08 PM on 12th August 2011 . Libyan rebels said they had captured part of the oil town of Brega on Thursday while their forces in the west pushed toward Zawiyah, trying to get within striking distance of Muammar Gaddafi's capital. Gaddafi is clinging to power despite a near five-month-old NATO air campaign, tightening economic sanctions, and a lengthening war with rebels trying to end his 41-year rule. The rebels have seized large swathes of the North African state, but are deeply divided and lack experience, and Thursday's gains in the east broke weeks of stalemate. Left: Mansur Mohamed, nine, makes the victory sign at the seaside of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi, Libya, amid the news parts of Brega have been seized. Right: A rebel fighter poses for a photo at the main square of Benghazi . One rebel spokesman said the opposition had captured the residential districts of Brega but Gaddafi's forces still hold western parts of the town where the oil facilities are located. 'It is liberated. It is under our control now,' spokesman Mossa Mahmoud al-Mograbi said of the eastern part of the town. The residential area where the fighting was taking place is about 15 km (9 miles) east of the oil terminal and sea port. It was not immediately possible for a Reuters reporter to verify the capture of Brega and rebels have repeatedly claimed to have seized towns, only to be repelled by Gaddafi's forces. It is thought the town has changed hands up to eight times in the last six months. An injured rebel fighter is attended to at Benghazi Medical Centre after he was wounded when rebel fighters clashed with forces loyal to Libya's leader Muammar Gaddafi in Brega . A man encourages two children, over an armored car, to make the victory sign at the rebel-held town of Benghazi, Libya, on Tuesday . In the western mountains, rebels said they reached the village of Bir Shuaib, some 25 km (15 miles) from Zawiyah, which has unsuccessfully risen up against Gaddafi twice this year. It lies less than 50 km west of Tripoli, on the main road to Tunisia, which has been a lifeline for Libya but has begun to crack down on rampant smuggling of gasoline. 'We've gone past Nasr village and right now we're about 25 km from Zawiyah,' said Faris, a rebel fighter. Rebels prevented reporters from reaching the front to see for themselves. Rebels in the western mountains do not operate as a single force, as each town has its own command. But when they join forces for major operations they can muster a few thousand men. Their force is poorly trained and short of heavy weapons, despite a French arms drop earlier this year, and most analysts do not think they are capable of capturing Tripoli. In an effort to pile economic and military pressure on Gaddafi, more countries are set to announce next week that they will free frozen assets for the rebels, a British official said. Odey Wanis, nine, plays with a rebel pre-Gadhafi flag in Benghazi, earlier this week . 'While it's hard to predict when this will end, it's easy to see the pressure is building on Gaddafi and it is only a matter of time before he's forced to leave power,' the official said. Britain is playing a leading role in NATO air strikes against Gaddafi's forces, which have weakened his armoury but have not enabled the rebels to deliver a knockout blow. Tightening the economic noose around Gaddafi, Tunisia said on Thursday its troops were patrolling fuel stations to curb the flow of smuggled gasoline into neighbouring Libya. International sanctions and the effects of Libya's civil war have disrupted normal supplies of fuel to parts of the country under Gaddafi's control, but huge volumes of gasoline are instead being smuggled across the Libyan-Tunisian border. 'The armed forces are now conducting checks at fuel stations in the south of Tunisia ... so that neither Tunisians nor Libyans can fill up with large quantities,' Tunisian defence ministry official Mokhtar Ben Nasr told a news conference. 'These checks are aimed at preventing the smuggling of diesel and gasoline to Libya.' The western battle is one of three widely separated rebel fronts against Gaddafi forces. In the east around the ports of Misrata and Brega, fighting had been bogged down in recent weeks while the western rebels have advanced. The two sides have been battling for months over Brega, 750 km east of Tripoli. The rebels see securing the oil facilities as a tipping point in the war and hope to resume oil exports from there as quickly as possible. In the west, doctor Nuri Al-Fasi said one fighter had been killed and four wounded on Thursday in the rebel push. At a nearby field hospital, he looked over a rebel shot in the stomach in the fighting in Nasr. 'This is very serious. I don't think he will make it,' said al-Fasi, shaking his head. Dozens of pick-up trucks packed with rebels drove to a staging post a few kilometres behind the front line. From rebel-held Misrata, east of Tripoli, rebels were fighting to break a partial encirclement by Gaddafi forces, striking south into the nearby village of Tawurgha. Medical sources said six rebels were killed and 70 wounded in their offensive on Tawurgha, from which Gaddafi's supporters have been firing rockets at Misrata for weeks. 'Our rebels have just liberated Tawurgha. This is great news ... as this means that the rockets of Gaddafi's forces cannot reach Misrata any more,' said rebel spokesman Hassan Algallay. Rebels said the offensive was led in coordination with NATO to protect Misrata from missile attacks. He said NATO asked rebels on Wednesday to paint their vehicles yellow and red. The offensive comes days after Gaddafi's government accused NATO of killing 85 civilians, including women and children, in an air strike near Zlitan, west of rebel-held Misrata. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon voiced alarm over recent reports of civililan casualties and called on all sides to avoid killing innocent people. Dozens of Libyans protested outside the Hungarian embassy in Tripoli, which has become an unofficial contact point for European nations and the United States, against NATO airstrikes. Rights group Amnesty International also called on NATO in a statement to 'thoroughly investigate' allegations of civilian deaths in the strikes on the village of Majar, close to the front line at Zlitan.

But now it turns out that the effects of the Japanese tsunami which struck the country in March were felt as far away as the Antarctic. The wake of the giant wave travelled 8,000miles through the Pacific and Southern Oceans until it battered a 260ft tall wall of ice at the southern tip of Earth. As a result several enormous chunks, one of which was the size of Manhattan in New York, broke off and drifted away into the sea. Scroll down for video . Long distance: The wake of the Japanese tsunami travelled 8,000miles through the Pacific and Southern Oceans until it battered a 260ft tall wall of ice at the southern tip of Earth - causing giant icebergs to break off Antarctica . The discovery shows once more the awesome power of the tsunami, which was caused by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake off the northern coast of Japan. It was pieced together by researchers who studied Nasa pictures of Earth to map the path of the wave during the 18 hours it took to cross the globe. Using the satellite images the researchers were able to see the ice sheet calving, or breaking off, in near real time. The Sulzberger ice shelf, which has barely moved in nearly 50 years, was put under so much strain by the powerful wave that vast chunks dropped off. Iceberg in the Antarctic: Researchers who studied Nasa pictures of Earth to map the path of the wave during the 18 hours it took to cross the globe (file picture) The wave was just 1ft high there but there was so much force it had a huge effect. Lead researcher Kelly Brunt, a cryosphere specialist at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said: ‘In the past, we've had calving events where we've looked for the source. ‘It's a reverse scenario - we see a calving and we go looking for a source. ‘We knew right away this was one of the biggest events in recent history - we knew there would be enough swell. And this time we had a source.’ Tragedy: The wave from a tsunami crashes over a street in north-eastern Japan in March, after the magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck the area, killing 15,000 people . The earthquake which hit Japan on March 11 caused waves up to 130ft that went up to six miles inland. Entire towns and villages were wiped off the map as the waves crashed onto the land in terrifying footage that was captured and posted on the internet by survivors. The wave also caused a meltdown at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant which it is feared has left thousands with radiation poisoning.

With just an ice-axe in his hands and crampons on his feet, this fearless climber faces death with each strike of his pick as he races to scale a 4,000ft icy rockface with no ropes to stop his fall. The stomach-churning images show . world-class mountaineer, Ueli Steck, 35, from Ringgenberg, Switzerland . smashing the record for scaling the north face of the Grandes Jorasses - . part of Europe's highest mountain, Mont Blanc. The spectacular pictures were captured by a British extreme photographer in a helicopter 13,000ft in the air. Scroll down for video . The only way is ice-axe... Ueli Steck climbed the Grandes Jorasses in the Mont Blanc massif mountain range without any rope for assistance . Ueli would be facing certain death in these Alpine mountains if he lost concentration for just a moment - yet he was able to scale the sheer face made up of compacted ice and rock in just two hours and 21 minutes. 'I did this ascent because it was an important stage for me as a climber. 'I love the purity of this kind of climbing and the control that you get from being free from ropes. 'That's why I choose to climb in this way. But if I did fall it would mean death at this height, no question. 'For me there is no fear - I'm too busy with my goal of reaching the top,' explained Ueli. Cliffhanger: With no rope to save him, Steck scales Mont Blanc (left) and approaches the summit (right) The technique, called free solo climbing, is reserved at this altitude for just a select handful of elite alpine climbers who have the ability and nerves of steel to face this kind of risk. The incredible pictures also shows Ueli tackling the Ginat route of the Droites mountain, also in the French Alps where at two hours and eight minutes he gained the quickest time for his speed ascent of this 3,200ft-long route. 'This climb was an important part of my career. It's meant that I can go on to even more challenging climbs that will push me even further. 'For me, it's about looking forward to the next big climb, and not just remembering what I've achieved,' added Ueli. On the up: Steck continues his ascent towards the top of Grandes Jorasses - part of Europe's highest mountain . Extreme photographer Jonathan Griffith, 28, from London, needed a great deal of skill to navigate the mountain - and keep up with his subject. As well as hanging out of a flying helicopter to shoot in freezing conditions, he also found himself having to climb the mountain to get access to Steck. 'I think it's best to just offer complete confidence in the pilots at hand. 'I sat with my legs over the side of the heli on the landing rails and shot from that position. 'I've only ever shot from a helicopter twice - I far prefer being in the middle of it all and getting real gritty shots that you just can't take from a helicopter. Mission accomplished: Steck at the top of the mountain after setting a new record . 'The hardest part is simply having the skill to be there in the first place. The high mountains and big north faces are no places for your average photographer. 'You have to be a skilled climber so that you can take care of yourself and move independent of those you are shooting. 'It blows the mind how fast Ueli climbs - he sets the bar so high,' said Griffith. Among Uelis's other climbing feats, he set a speed record for scaling the north face of the Eiger, in Switzerland - in just 2hr 47min.

The widow and son of a fireman who plummeted to his death at a Texas Rangers baseball match after trying to catch a ball walked hand-in-hand behind a fire engine carrying his coffin today. Shannon Stone, 39, died on Thursday after taking his six-year-old boy, Cooper, to a Rangers game, when he fell 20ft from the stands as he tried to catch a foul ball from Josh Hamilton for his son. Front-office executives from the Rangers and firemen from across the state have remembered Stone at a memorial service and then an eight-mile fire truck procession to a cemetery. ‘It's still difficult to accept, obviously, the nature of the death and the timing of the death and the way that it happened,' Brownwood Mayor Stephen Haynes said. The family asked that the church congregation was made up of family and friends. Everyone else was asked to line the cemetery route. The fireman was remembered fondly at the memorial service for his kindness, love of baseball and skill as both a firefighter and a loving dad, witnesses said. Stone took his son to the game in Arlington on Thursday night. They stopped to buy the boy a new glove on the way, and sat in left field, behind Cooper's favourite player, Josh Hamilton. Hamilton threw them a foul ball, but the thrill quickly turned tragic. Stone fell head-first about 20ft onto concrete, with Cooper watching. Witnesses said Stone was conscious after landing and spoke about Cooper being left alone. He was pronounced dead within an hour. An autopsy ruled the cause as blunt force trauma from the fall.

Stone had been with the Brownwood . fire department since 1993. He was voted Firefighter of the Year twice . by his peers, according to the mayor, and had risen to the rank of . lieutenant. He also worked as a paramedic, and as . a rescue technician at Texas Motor Speedway. He also was involved in . disaster relief following Hurricanes Katrina and Ike, and fighting . wildfires. Scotty Burke, who was a Brownwood . police officer for 14 years and is now on the Lake Patrol, described . Stone as a ‘firefighter's firefighter’.

Mourners: John Hammond, Tammy Contreras, Jesse Jauregui, Jessica Rudloff, Jaden Rudloff and Jayli Rudloff, in the pram, stand along the route of the procession to honour Stone in Brownwood on Monday . He recalled that during the town's . annual, three-day reunion celebration, Stone cooked a barbecue for the . officers and firemen working at the event. ‘He always did it out of his . pocket,’ Mr Burke said. ‘Brownwood is a tight place,’ Mr Burke said. ‘When something like this happens, people come together and they take care of you.’ Brownwood is a town of about 20,000 . residents in the Hill Country of central Texas, some 150 miles west of . the Rangers' stadium in Arlington.

Hamilton - who overcame drug and . alcohol addictions to emerge as a devout Christian and an All-Star . outfielder - is said to be particularly heartbroken as he has young . children himself. He said: 'It was just hard for me, . hearing the little boy screaming for his daddy after he had fallen - and . then being home with my kids, really hit home. That's one of the main . things I remember.' He told the New York Times: 'It’s . like it happened in slow motion. Here was a little boy, screaming for . his daddy after he had fallen.

"Cindy Anthony claims a change in medication has sharpened her memory . By . Jacqui Goddard . Last updated at 12:34 PM on 24th June 2011 . Casey Anthony’s own mother attempted to blow up prosecution evidence against her daughter today as she claimed that she was the one who looked up facts about chloroform on the family’s home computer. In a stunning twist to the state’s accusation that Casey researched the dangerous compound three months before using it to overpower her two-year-old daughter Caylee, Mrs Anthony revealed that she had herself pulled up Internet pages about chloroform in March 2008, seeking health information relating to her pets. In testimony that prosecutors later challenged aggressively, Mrs Anthony said that her web searches – previously aired in court as part of the state’s evidence that Casey planned her daughter’s June 2008 murder – resulted from her initially looking up chlorophyll, the substance that gives plants their colour. Cindy Anthony testified at daughter Casey's trial that she searched on the home computer for information about physical injuries and chloroform . 'I was concerned about my smallest . Yorkie – we have two Yorkie puppies. The smallest one was having some . issues where she was extremely tired all the time. Both of the dogs . would eat the bamboo leaves out the back so I started looking up sources . from the back yard that could cause her to be more sleepy, and I . started with ‘chlorophyll’ and that prompted me to look up ‘chloroform’' Mrs Anthony testified in court. Cindy wears a necklace with a photo of her granddaughter Caylee on it . 'Looking at chlorophyll, there’s some . bacteria associated with chloroform. It comes from different species of . plants that have red and brown colour, and that prompted me to look up . chloroform because some species naturally produce chloroform.' Mrs Anthony also told the court in . Orlando, Florida, that she had typed in search terms such as ‘hydrogen . peroxide’ and ‘alcohol’ while seeking to find out more about a health . scare over hand sanitizers and their possible dangers to children that . had been brought to her attention by a colleague in March 2008. She had also inputted other search . terms relating to bodily injuries because 'a good friend of mine was in a . car accident and had multiple chest and head injuries,' she said. In another revelation, Mrs Anthony . said that a stain found in the boot of Casey’s white Pontiac Sunfire car . – which the state has attempted to attribute to Caylee’s dead body . having been stored in the vehicle before being dumped in a swamp – may . have been present when she first bought the vehicle. Mrs Anthony’s sudden claims rattled . prosecutors who have for 26 days held the upper hand in the trial as . Casey’s defence team has faltered and made several damaging legal . blunders. State attorney Diane Drane-Burdick . appeared visibly angry and cynical as she tore into Mrs Anthony’s . evidence, clawing back some ground. She pointed out that Mrs Anthony’s . employment records showed her as having been at work at the times and . dates that the home computer searches were made – which Mrs Anthony . explained by saying that she went home early some days even though her . records indicated otherwise - and asked her why she had only just . brought up her claims three years on. Casey Anthony is standing trial in Florida for a first-degree murder charge, accused by prosecutors of killing her two-year-old daughter Caylee in 2008 . 'I did tell law enforcement. In fact, I told you during my deposition in 2009 that I made those searches,' Mrs Anthony replied. 'You told me that you searched . ‘chlorophyll’ and you spelt chlorophyll for me,' Mrs Drane-Burdick shot . back, adding: 'Did you type into the search bar of Google ‘How to make . chloroform’?' – a reference to FBI evidence that someone typed in those . specific words in March 2008. 'I don’t recall typing in ‘How to . make chloroform’,' Mrs Anthony ceded, also accepting that she had not . been responsible for other searches found by FBI computer analysts on . the family’s home computer, such as ‘self defence,’ ‘how to make . household weapons,’ ‘shovel’ and ‘neck breaking.’ If convicted of daughter Caylee's murder, Casey could face the death penalty . The Anthony's home computer had been used to search for terms such as 'neck breaking', 'death' and 'head injuries' as well as 'chloroform', the prosecution told the jury two weeks ago . 'I didn’t search for ‘neck breaking’ but I do recall that there was a pop-up that was showing a YouTube . (video) that was showing a skateboarder that was going on rails…I recall . it saying ‘a neck-breaking feat’' Mrs Anthony said. The timing of the revelations – which . scored significant points for the defence despite some of the later . doubts raised by prosecutors - came at an ironic time in the trial of . Casey Anthony, who potentially faces the death penalty if convicted of . first-degree murder. She has pleaded not guilty, claiming that little . Caylee drowned accidentally in the family swimming pool. Yesterday, a lawyer for Casey’s parents told CNN that the couple believe their daughter is guilty. Asked: 'Do your clients George and . Cindy Anthony think that she is not guilty', the couple’s lawyer Mark . Lippman replied: 'They don’t think that…they do not believe she is . innocent.' George and Cindy Anthony in the courtroom during the murder trial of their daughter Casey Anthony on Tuesday . He later backtracked, insisting that . he was misunderstood. 'I’ve never said they thought she was guilty. I . only said they have no idea what happened,' Mr Lippman said. 'They have no idea what the facts . are. That’s why they’re sitting in the courtroom every single day. They . hope they can get some semblance of truth. Based on his story it sounds . like I was saying my clients think she is guilty of murder. I never said . that. And any inference to that is wrong.' Mr Lippman added during a brief press conference outside court tonight: 'They (the Anthonys) don't know whether or not she's guilty of the crimes that have been alleged. ...She's still not guilty until the jury comes back and makes a determination of what happened. My clients want to know what happened.' Addressing Mrs Anthony's sudden revelations about her computer searches three years on, Mr Lippman echoed his client's statement in court that she was not the one who had looked up the phrases 'How to make chloroform' or 'neck breaking' on the home computer. But the matters she had recalled, such as her inter-connected searches on chlorophyll and chloroform, stemmed from the fact that her memory had improved since 2008 when Caylee was found dead. 'Normally as time goes on our memory gets a little bit more cloudy, but she was taking medication because of the various issues and the stress she was suffering,' he said. 'Her medication has since been changed by her doctor and it has clarified her memory from three years ago.'",Cindy Anthony claims a change in medication has sharpened her memory .
"Two-year-old girl among the dead . Mosques targeted and homes destroyed . Troops and tanks also enter central city of Homs . By . Sara Nelson . Last updated at 11:25 AM on 15th August 2011 . Syria turned gunboats on the Mediterranean coastal city of Latakia last night, killing at least 26 people protesting against Bashar Assad's regime. The coordinated attacks by the navy and ground troops were the latest wave of a brutal offensive against anti-government protests launched at the beginning of the month and came as thousands marched on the city over the weekend to demand the president's ousting. The assault showed Assad has no intention of scaling back the campaign even though it has brought international outrage and new U.S. and European sanctions. Smoke rises in the city of Latakia as Syrian tanks and navy ships shelled the Mediterranean port city yesterday, killing at least 26 people, activists claim . An image grab taken from a video uploaded on YouTube shows what appears to be a Syrian navy vessel as it sails along the coast of Latakia . 'We are being targeted from the ground and the sea,' said a frightened resident of the al-Ramel district of Latakia, the hardest hit neighborhood. 'The shooting is intense. We cannot go out. They are raiding and breaking into people's homes,' he added, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. As the gunships blasted waterfront districts, ground troops backed by tanks and security forces stormed several neighborhoods including al-Ramel, sending terrified women and children fleeing, some on foot, to safer areas. In this image taken the Shaam News Network shows armoured vehicles as they take up positions along the waterfront of Latakia . Armoured vehicles stationed along the coast road in a residential area of the city . The al-Ramel resident said at least three gunboats were taking part in the offensive, and that many people have been killed and wounded. The shooting targeted several mosques in the area. 'Many homes have been destroyed and the shabiha have broken into shops and businesses,' he said, referring to pro-government gunmen, as they are called by Syrians. Further attacks came this morning as troops backed by tanks entered several towns in the flashpoint province of Homs in central Syria, activists said. Syrian soldiers carrying the coffin of their colleague Ali Ghanem Asad in Latakia . The assault on Latakia began Saturday, when tanks and armored personnel carriers rolled into al-Ramel district amid intense gunfire. The security forces appear to be intent on crushing dissent in the neighborhood, which has seen large anti-Assad protests since the Syrian uprising began in mid-March. On Friday, as many as 10,000 marched there, calling for the president's departure. After their initial assault on the city Saturday, Syrian forces pushed back into Latakia again Sunday. State-run news agency SANA said troops were pursuing 'gunmen using machine guns, hand grenades and bombs who have been terrorizing residents in al-Ramel district.' The agency denied reports the area was being targeted from the sea. It quoted a health official in Latakia as saying two law enforcement officials were killed. At least 26 people were killed in the city on Sunday, said Rami Abdul-Rahman, head of the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. One of the dead was a two-year-old girl who was in a car with her father when security forces at a checkpoint opened fire, he said. The activist network the Local Coordination Committees gave the same death toll and said it included three children. A TV grab taken from Al Arabiya shows a soldier standing in a street near Homs, in Syria. Tanks rolled into the town this morning . Activists said at least two people were killed in al-Ramel on Saturday. Residents and several activist groups said gunboats in the Mediterranean were taking part in the offensive, firing machine guns. Many people were wounded from indiscriminate fire on houses, they said. 'They are trying to take control of the city as they did in other places,' said Abdul-Rahman.Ammar Qurabi, head of the National Organization for Human Rights in Syria, said the state was setting a 'precedent' by using gunboats to shell its own people. Using gunboats to fight protesters, who are mostly unarmed and peaceful, marks a new escalation in the regime's crackdown. But the determined opposition is so far unbowed even though at least 1,700 people have been killed since March, according to activists and human rights groups. Former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak returned to court today to face charges of killing protesters, in a hearing that could decide if the head of the ruling military council will take the stand as a witness. Defence lawyers say that any testimony by Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi on Mubarak's role in trying to suppress the 18-day uprising, in which more than 800 people were killed, could decide the fate of the 83-year-old. Tantawi, who was defence minister for two decades under Mubarak, heads the military council that took power when Mubarak was ousted on February 11 by the mass protests. Mubarak, accused of corruption and ordering the killing of protesters, went on trial on August 3 in a case that has gripped the Arab world, where leaders rule for life and are seldom held to account. The 83-year-old, who is said to have stomach cancer, was pictured today in a cage, and wheeled into court on a hospital trolley. The tough new offensive began with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan at the start of August and killed several hundred people in the first week alone. The brutality fueled international outrage with Syria, a hardline Arab state closely allied with Iran, and led to new sanctions against the regime by the U.S., Canada and Europe. The United States stepped up calls for a global trade embargo on oil and gas from Syria, warning even some of America's closest allies that they must 'get on the right side of history' and cut links with a government that uses violence to repress protesters. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said international opinion was hardening against Assad, noting a 'crescendo of condemnation' from world powers and Syria's Arab neighbors. But she said tougher action was required, too. In Latakia on Sunday, the sharp crackle of machine-gun fire and loud explosions sounded across parts of the city, once known for its beach resorts that attracted tourists throughout the summer season. Gray smoke drifted across the sea front. The city has a potentially explosive sectarian mix. Sunnis, which are a majority in Syria, live in Latakia's urban core, while Assad's minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam, populates villages on the city's outskirts, along with small minorities of Christians, ethnic Turks and other groups. The crackdown, which has targeted predominantly Sunni areas of the city of more than 600,000, raised concerns of sectarian bloodshed in a country that has already seen an alarming rise in sectarian tensions since the start of the uprising. Amateur videos posted on the Internet by activists showed at least one gunship patrolling the coast opposite al-Ramel, and tanks rumbling along the waterfront. The Associated Press could not verify the activists' accounts or the contents of the videos. Syria has banned most foreign media and restricted local coverage, making it impossible to get independent confirmation of the events on the ground. The protests calling for the Assad regime's downfall have grown dramatically over the past five months, driven in part by anger over the government's bloody crackdown. Thousands of others have been arrested, many of them tortured, according to rights groups. The Observatory said in a statement Sunday that it has documented the names of 71 Syrians who have died under torture in Syria since the start of the uprising in mid-March. The government has justified its crackdown by saying it's dealing with terrorist gangs and criminals who are fomenting unrest.","Two-year-old girl among the dead .

New details have emerged of how seriously the British government was bracing itself for a full scale nuclear crisis in the wake of Japan's Fukushima disaster. Documents show how advisers rushed to work out how bad the crisis might get, and the plans drawn up for 'the worst case scenario' to protect British citizens - including the British Embassy in Tokyo issuing iodine pills to expats and visitors in the capital and Sendai, 70 miles from Fukushima. The government's emergency committee Cobra were also on standby to screen passengers landing at Heathrow from Japan for radioactive contamination, it has been revealed. Smoke is seen coming from the area of the No. 3 reactor of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March . A hydrogen explosion at the Fukushima power plant. Britain was bracing itself for 'the worst case scenario' The tsunami-stricken Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant heavily damaged by the earthquake and tsunami . The experts were working on a 'reasonable worst case scenario' with the plant releasing more radiation than Chernobyl in 1986. The devastating 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck the east coast of Japan on March 11 unleashing a tsunami and then a nuclear nightmare centred on the nuclear plant of Fukushima. An explosion knocked out cooling systems and backup diesel . generators on March 12, leading to explosions at three reactors and a fire at a fourth that . was undergoing regular maintenance and was empty of fuel. The radiation leak sparked fears of full-scale nuclear disaster after some 28,000 people were killed in the earthquake and tsunami and sixteen towns, 95,000 buildings and 23 railway stations were destroyed. The new details of Britain's contingency plans were revealed by the Guardian following a Freedom of Information request. Among the documents - prepared for Sir John Beddington, chairman of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) - was advice from . the National Nuclear Laboratory on damage to the plant, public safety . assessments from the Health Protection Agency, (HPA) models of the radioactive . plume. Many documents were not released for fear they may impact on international relations, the newspaper revealed. A man is being tested for possible radiation exposure at an evacuation centre in Fukushima. In Britain, experts were on standby to screen air passengers . Local residents of Kawauchi village who lived within 20km area from the stricken nuclear power plant were evacuated to Koriyama city . They do show, however, that advisers . worked frantically to establish how bad the leak was in the first few days of the . crisis, and feared that an explosion at one reactor or fuel pond could . result in multiple explosions. They said 'the reasonable worst case . scenario' was if there was leaking radiation from six spent fuel ponds . at the plant and all three reactors were damaged. They worked out that if this happened, . 9.92 million terabecquerels of radiation could be been propelled into the air - . almost double that released during the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine in . 1986. However, the accident was not expected to be as bad as Chernobyl. In March, radiation was detected across . Britain, 5,500 miles away from the plant, in Oxfordshire and Glasgow - . although experts said the levels were 'minuscule' and posed no health . risks to Britons. On March 25, the HPA drew up plans to screen air passengers arriving in the UK from Japan in the event of a major leak in radiation. Britain's crisis plan was based on a scenario where almost double the amount of radiation was released into the air than the 1986 Chernobyl power plant disaster, pictured . Japanese officials declared a 12 mile evacuation zone around the plant and another 140,000 living within 18 miles were told not to leave their homes, turn off their air conditioning and stop drinking tap water. Britain advised citizens to give the area a 30 mile berth and to leave Tokyo, 150 miles away. In April, Japan admitted that the . spread of radiation was out of control and that . the government had raised the crisis level to the worst on the international . scale - level 7. Level 7 has only been applied to the Chernobyl . accident in the former Soviet Union in 1986.",Government braced itself for almost double the radiation released by Chernobyl .

Nick Clegg has denied there is a rift between the Government and police after top officers rejected claims ministers were responsible for the robust crackdown which halted the riots. The Deputy Prime Minister, on a visit to affected areas in Manchester, hailed the 'brilliant' job done by officers and insisted no-one was trying to be an 'armchair general'. His intervention came 24 hours after police furiously declared they rather than ministers were responsible for turning the tide and regaining control of the streets. Officers at all levels denounced . criticism by the Prime Minister and claims by Home Secretary Theresa May . that ministers had taken charge. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg talks to local councillors and shop owners in a delicatessen in Manchester . They said politicians were ‘irrelevant’ to police decisions to increase the number of officers on patrol and . take a tougher approach – taken long before Mr Cameron and Mrs May . returned home from holiday. Today, Mr Clegg insisted: 'There is no rift between the police and the Government, we fully support the police 100%. They have done a brilliant job in really difficult circumstances. 'The police themselves have said they want to review what happened and look at tactics and learn lessons.' He added: 'These were very fast events, they were unpredictable and they were unpredicted. But nobody is sitting there as an armchair general trying to second-guess tactical decisions which the police have to take in very difficult circumstances.' The rebellion raised fresh questions about the Government’s reform programme and cast doubt on whether it will be able to push through budget cuts of 20 per cent. Sir Hugh Orde, President of the Association of Chief Police Officers, has hit out at ministers . Latest polls show that seven out of ten voters do not support cuts to the police and fewer than one in three back Mr Cameron’s handling of the crisis. In his statement to Parliament on Thursday, the Prime Minister said there were ‘simply far too few police deployed on to the streets’ and criticised the way commanders ‘treated the situation too much as a public order issue – rather than essentially one of crime’. A day earlier Mrs May claimed she had ‘ordered that all special constables should be mobilised, all police leave should be cancelled and the robust tactics used’. But Sir Hugh Orde, President of the Association of Chief Police Officers said: ‘The fact that politicians chose to come back is an irrelevance in terms of the tactics that were by then developing. ‘The more robust policing tactics you . saw were not a function of political interference; they were a function . of the numbers being available to allow the chief constables to change . their tactics.’ Surveying the damage: David Cameron talks to Acting Borough Commander Superintendent Jo Oakley in Croydon after turning from his holiday in Tuscany . David Cameron met senior officers from the police, fire and ambulance services at a meeting in Wolverhampton on Wednesday . Sir Hugh, a contender for the post of new Metropolitan Police Commissioner, said: ‘The vital distinction between policing and politics remains. The police service will make the tactical decisions.’ Acting Commissioner Tim Godwin made a . pointed attack on Mr Cameron and Mrs May, saying: ‘I think after any . event like this, people will always make comments who weren’t there. The . issue around the numbers, the issue around the tactics – they are all . police decisions and they are all made by my police commanders and . myself.’ He won support from London Mayor . Boris Johnson, who made his second attack on Downing Street in the space . of a week. ‘I completely agree,’ said Mr Johnson. ‘Anyone can have 20/20 hindsight about the decisions that were taken.’ Derek . Barnett, president of the Police Chief Superintendents’ Association, . said: ‘I think the public are looking for politicians to give police the . moral support that is required.’ Officers have denounced . criticism by the PM and Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured in the House of Commons this week, . that they ordered the crackdown which . halted the rioting . And more criticism was heaped on the government's planned cuts from John Tully, vice chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers in the capital. He said the 'omens are not good' that Mr Cameron will back up his tough approach towards dealing with rioters and looters with 'a new, robust attitude on the part of the Government to crime and punishment'. 'The first question mark, obviously, is their determination to keep cutting the size of the police force - a police force which has been working hard and successfully on behalf of the public putting record numbers of criminals in prison,' Mr Tully said in a statement. 'While in Opposition, Nick Clegg called for 3,000 extra police officers. As Deputy Prime Minister, he is now content to say there are sufficient officers and support the 20% cuts. 'Despite what Government politicians say, this cut to police budgets will impact on service delivery and we will see fewer officers on the streets.' He also warned that more prisoners could be released early unless extra prison places were built and challenged the prime minister to 'guarantee' the safety of the innocent majority. 'If the Government really means what it says about protecting the innocent, it must give a guarantee now that there will in future be sufficient prison places to hold those who deserve to be in them and to keep them there. Your call, Mr Cameron,' he said. David Cameron visits a looted supermarket in Salford. Police said they made the tactical decisions to quell the trouble . Two days after Duggan died, the Tottenham riots erupted after his family spent five frustrating hours seeking a meeting and explanation from local police chiefs . The Prime Minister rejected calls to end the police cuts. ‘They have to live within their budgets,’ he said. But he was forced to strike a more conciliatory tone, insisting police and politicians had worked together. ‘There was a need for more on the street, there was a need to change tactics,’ he said. ‘It’s right that police took those decisions and changed those tactics, and increased the number of police officers. ‘Where I think the Government and the police worked well together was through the Cobra emergency planning committee. It helps the police by showing that there was political backing for the changes they wanted to make.’ The Home Secretary also backtracked, admitting that it was Mr Godwin who ‘came forward with new proposals to significantly increase the number of police on the streets of London’. Last night she revealed that 16,000 police would continue to patrol the streets of London. Latest polls show that seven out of ten voters do not support cuts to the police and fewer than one in three back Mr Cameron's handling of the crisis . ‘We have had some quieter nights but we are not complacent about that,’ said Mrs May. ‘The police will maintain their tough arrest policy, their presence on the streets.’ Other senior politicians struggled to contain their irritation at the police rebellion. Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, insisted it was the Prime Minister who had stamped his authority on the crisis. And former shadow home secretary David Davis called the riots the latest in a ‘litany of disasters’ at the Met. He laid the blame with senior officers, demanding ‘real and drastic change at the top’ and adding: ‘London is suffering as a result of its failure to tackle gang culture and control the riots.’ Ed Miliband has admitted Labour is to blame for undermining the ethics of British society . Ed Miliband has admitted Labour is to blame for undermining the ethics of British society. The Labour leader conceded yesterday that the moral decay which David Cameron has blamed for the looting occurred on Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s watch. He admitted: ‘We did better at rebuilding the fabric of our country than the ethic of our country.’ But in his most provocative comments on the causes of the riots, Mr Miliband claimed that the mayhem of the last week was partly caused by poverty, an argument already made by his deputy Harriet Harman. ‘We have got to ask why do we have people in our society who feel that the way they can get on and the right thing to do is go and nick the telly, engage in the kind of looting we saw,’ he said. ‘We have got to avoid simplistic answers. There’s a debate some people are starting: is it culture, is it poverty and lack of opportunity? It’s probably both.’ Polls show that the public rejects claims from left-wing politicians that poverty and cuts causes lawbreaking. One survey this week found that just 8 per cent of voters believe the Government’s cuts were to blame for the riots. Mr Miliband said the riots showed young people have no ‘sense of right and wrong’ and sought to claim the rioters were the same as bankers. ‘It’s about irresponsibility, wherever we find it in our society.’","Police: Our robust tactics were not a result of political interference .

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 3:45 PM on 16th August 2011 . Socialite: Taylor Stein helped break up a black-market baby selling ring after she paid $180,000 for her son . A black-market baby-selling ring that charged at least $100,000 per child was broken up by the FBI - with the help of a socialite who had been tricked into buying her son. Taylor Stein, daughter of rock music promoter Howard, unwittingly became involved in the sting where cash-strapped surrogates were impregnated with sperm and eggs from the Ukraine. As she was about to receive her child, for whom she had paid $180,000, she was contacted by FBI investigators who asked her to record her conversations with the three ringleaders. A trio of baby-sellers have since pleaded guilty to wire-fraud charges and Stein now wants to change the law so adopted children have the right to know the identity of their parents. She said: 'Looking back, there are signs I should have seen. But I didn't, I just didn't.' Single-mother Stein, who lives in Los Angeles, decided to adopt a brother for Djuna, her four-year-old daughter with Estée Lauder billionaire William Lauder, in 2009. But the process became complicated and so when a lawyer, who was a friend of a friend, told her about a baby whose planned adoptive parents had walked away and was now available, she agreed to become its mother. She never received the child as the agency, which targeted wealthy couples over the internet, said in September 2009 that the surrogate had run away. Stein told the New York Post: 'They told me she was a crackhead . . . a vegan, and she wanted to give birth with a doula [labour coach]. 'In fact, she was already onto the agency and [ultimately] was the first person to contact the FBI. [She] is the heroine in all this.' Tricked: The scam, which saw at least 12 babies sold, worked for six years . Within two weeks Stein was contacted by lawyer Hilary Neiman who told her another baby was now available as the intended parents of a Canadian child had backed out of the deal. Although she thought it was 'weird' that she was not allowed to contact the surrogate, despite prospective parents usually encouraged to cultivate a relationship, she started wiring payments to the agency. She received profiles of the supposed surrogate parents, who had blond hair and blue eyes, with their dates of birth and families' medical histories. But the information was all fake. The truth of where the babies were coming from was much more seedy. Prospective surrogate mothers were offered between $38,000 and $45,000 for their services. They were then taken to Ukraine, where the population is overwhelming white and medical checks are not as stringent, to be implanted with fertilised eggs from anonymous donors. Once the surrogate was 12 weeks pregnant a buyer was lined up and the pregnant mothers were then taken to California to give birth because it is one of the few states that lets the name of a non-biological parent to be put onto the birth certificate easily. The scam, which saw at least 12 babies sold, worked for six years. Hilary Neiman, 32; surrogacy lawyer Theresa Erickson, 43; and former surrogate Carla Chambers, 51, all pleaded guilty to wire-fraud charges and will be sentenced in October. Once the trio had been caught, Stein made sure the surrogate mother was paid $26,000 and Neiman paid her back the remaining $154,000. She has now formally adopted five-month-old Ren Friedrick, who was born in March 2011. Stein is now working on a documentary called 'White Collar, Black Market - the Surrogacy Loophole' about the transparency of donors. She said: 'My son has no information about the identity of his real parents, and I think that is a birth right. 'I want to go to the Ukraine to track down my son's donors so that he has some idea of his DNA, and change some laws in DC so that all adopted children have the right to find out the identity of their true parents. 'I want to make a change so my son doesn't feel the victim out of this. He's a game changer. Hopefully, after his story, everything will be different.'",Taylor Stein wanted sibling for love-child she had with billionaire cosmetics boss William Lauder .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:37 PM on 2nd August 2011 . Drama: Warren Jeffs, right, is escorted to court by a Texas Ranger. Jeffs again called for the judge to be removed - saying God wanted it . The sexual assault trial of polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs was interrupted by gasps of astonishment yesterday as jurors were shown pictures showing him kissing and cuddling a 12-year-old girl. The photographs show the head of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and the young redhead, who he is alleged to have raped, grinning and kissing the girl. The images, which are said to have been taken on July 27, 2006 – days after the girl’s 12th birthday - drew gasps from the public gallery while jurors attempted to remain stony faced. The drama at the Tom Green County Courthouse in in San Angelo, Texas, capped a long session that dragged late into the evening after Jeffs made a third attempt to remove the trial judge. This time the 55-year-old claimed God himself had demanded that Barbara Walther should ‘step away from this abuse of power against a religious and pure faith in the Lord’. Jeffs, who faces life in prison if convicted, is accused of sexually assaulting two girls, then aged 12 and 15, that he took as brides in ‘spiritual marriages’. The charges stem from a police raid in April 2008 at the Yearning For Zion compound of his church, an offshoot of mainstream Mormonism that believes polygamy brings exaltation in Heaven. Jeffs has repeatedly called the raid an illegal search and wants a separate hearing on whether authorities violated his First Amendment rights to freedom of religion. Interaction: A sketch of lead prosecutor Eric Nichols speaking to the jury on Friday. Today, he showed them pictures of Jeffs kissing a 12-year-old girl . Warning: Judge Barbara Walther, who limps after suffering from polio, was told by Jeffs that God had sent 'a crippling disease upon her which shall take her life soon' Mrs Walther, who walks with a limp after suffering polio in childhood, has refused - prompting three different calls to recuse her by the defendant, whose followers believe is God’s spokesman. Yesterday, Jeffs, who fired his lawyers last week and is representing himself, claimed his latest motion was based on a revelation the Lord gave him on Sunday. He addressed the judge directly, saying: ‘I, your lord, say to you, I shall bring to light your evil intent now, before all people, to destroy my Church on earth.’ Jeffs also attached what he called ‘Exhibit A’, consisting of 29 orders from the Lord, including one in which God sent ‘a crippling disease upon (Walther) which shall take her life soon.’ He regularly objects when prosecutors enter new evidence — arguing that his religious freedoms are being trampled. Yesterday Jeffs told the court: ‘We are a people of historical abuse. This is not new to us because of prejudice in the populace and government.’ Lawyers usually ignore his objections and let Mrs Walther overrule them. But yesterday lead prosecutor Eric Nichols finally hit out by responded that ‘this is not a proceeding against a people. This is a proceeding against an individual.’ Mrs Walther yesterday ruled that a hearing would eventually take place on Jeffs’s motion, but that the trial would continue . She said new Texas Supreme Court rules meant that an immediate hearing was no longer required to recuse a judge after a case has beguns. Testifying: Former sect member Rebecca Musser, outside court yesterday, said the church teaches young girls that pleasing men . 'pleases God' Evidence: Texas Rangers move boxes of evidence for the trial at Tom Green County Courthouse in San Angelo, Texas . No date has been set for a hearing on Jeffs' motion. The . trial continued with forensic analyst Amy Smuts, of the Human . Identification Center at the University of North Texas in Fort Worth, . testifying that a DNA sample collected from Jeffs had 15 major markers . that matched a sample taken from a girl born to a 15-year-old mother. Miss Smuts said that made her ‘more than 99.99 per cent certain’ that Jeffs fathered the child, who was born in October 2005. Mugshot: Jeffs after being arrested following the 2009 raid on his church . In other testimony, former sect member Rebecca Musser explained that FLDS women are taught that they must rely on their husbands or fathers to find grace in heaven. She also said the church governs all aspects of members' lives, from dictating when they wake up every day to what clothes they wear, what work they do, how they comb their hair, and what they eat. Miss Musser was born into the sect but left in 2002. She was married in 1995, at age 19, to 85-year-old Rulon Jeffs, Warren Jeffs' father and predecessor as ecclesiastical leader. She said Warren personally gave detailed lectures to young girls on what was expected of them sexually once they were ordered into spiritual marriages with older members. ‘They are taught what the duties are as a wife to that husband, not just spiritually but physically,’ she said. ‘You give yourself to him and that means body, mind and spirit.’ Mr Nichols asked: ‘Are young girls taught that giving themselves to that man and pleasing him is, in effect, pleasing God?’ ‘Yes,’ Miss Musser replied. Authorities raided the Yearning For Zion compound, 45 miles south of San Angeleno, after receiving an anonymous call to an abuse shelter, alleging that girls at the compound were being forced into polygamist marriages. The call turned out to be a hoax, and more than 400 children who had been placed in state custody were returned to their families. Old-fashioned garb: Women from Jeffs's polygamist sect pictured after their relocation from Yearning for Zion in 2008 . But police seized marriage records and thousands of pages of documents and eventually charged Jeffs and 11 other FLDS men. All seven sect members who have been prosecuted so far were convicted of crimes including sexual assault and bigamy and received prison sentences of between six and 75 years. Jeffs went through seven attorneys in the six months leading up to the trial, firing his last defence team just as opening statements were to begin.","Pictures show head of Mormon sect with young redhead he is accused of raping .

Hundreds of Somali children are dying as they trek to the world’s biggest refugee camp amid the Horn of Africa’s worsening food crisis, the UN warned yesterday. Elhadj As Sy, Unicef’s regional director for eastern and southern Africa, said many youngsters were so weak from starvation that they died before reaching the Dadaab camp in Kenya. The overcrowded United Nations site houses more than 370,000 civilians who have fled Somalia’s civil war and a devastating drought which has left up to ten million at risk. And Antonio Guterres, the UN's . high commissioner for refugees, said agencies must do what they can to persuade militant groups to allow them access to those badly affected. Ambassador: Sex And The City actress Kristin Davis visiting the Dadaab refugee camp . As many as 12million east Africans . have been hit by drought  - with Somalia thought to be the worst-hit - . and are now in need of urgent help. Thousands suffering from famine are now streaming towards the war-torn Somalian capital . city of Mogadishu - despite fierce fighting between the Government and . the insurgent group al-Shabaab. The . rebels now control almost all of Somalia's centre and south and have . refused to allow foreigners to work in their territory. However a . spokesman for al-Shabaab said last week that they would be willing to . allow in aid for the starving masses. Yesterday, the head of the UN refugee agency said Sunday that . drought-ridden Somalia is the 'worst humanitarian disaster' in the world . after meeting refugees who endured unspeakable hardship to reach . the world's largest refugee camp. Crisis: Dadaab, the world's largest refugee camp, has seen an influx of 61,000 Somalis since the beginning of the year - 20,000 of them in the last two weeks . The . Kenyan camp, Dadaab, is overflowing with tens of thousands of newly . arrived refugees forced into the camp by the parched landscape in the . region where Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya meet. Sex And The City actress Kristin Davis visited the camp this weekend to meet refugees as part of her role as an ambassador for Oxfam. She looked shocked as she met Somalians and heard how they had fled famine, in some cases walking for weeks. She met Madina Farah Yusuf, who arrived at the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya a week ago after walking for 10 days with her seven children. On the way she came across four other young children who had lost their parents. She took them in and brought them all to Dadaab, where they are now taking shelter under a tree. 'Worst humanitarian disaster in the world': Refugees have endured unspeakable hardship to reach the world's largest refugee camp . Brink of tragedy: The actress talks to residents in the refugee camp who have fled their homes as the drought crisis worsens . She said: 'We left Somalia in fear . our lives. There was so much hunger and war. Bandits robbed us of our . food and clothes on the way. I found these four young children as we . came. They were on their own as their mother had died of starvation. 'We brought everyone here (Dadaab) as . we thought we could get help. But we stay under this tree. It gets very . cold at night, and the children cry. We only have one blanket.' The World Food Program . estimates that 10million people already need humanitarian aid.

Dadaab, Guterres spoke with a Somalia mother who lost three of her . children during a 35-day walk to reach the camp. Guterres said Dadaab . holds 'the poorest of the poor and the most vulnerable of the . vulnerable'. The mother, Muslima Aden said: 'I became a bit insane after I lost them. I lost them in different times on my way.' Stories of survival: Ms Davis met Madina Farah Yusuf, who arrived at the refugee camp a week ago after walking for 10 days with her seven children . Guterres . is on a tour of the region to highlight the dire need. On Thursday he . was in the Ethiopian camp of Dollo Ado, a camp that is also overflowing. He said: 'The . mortality rates we are witnessing are three times the level of . emergency ceilings. 'The level of malnutrition of the children . coming in is 50 percent. That is enough to explain why a very high . level of mortality is inevitable.' Dr Dejene Kebede, a health officer for UNHCR, said there were 58 deaths in camps in one week alone in June. Most . of the deaths take place at the registration office and transition . facilities of the refugee camps in the southeastern Dollo region of . Ethiopia, the health officer said.

Up . to 2,000 Somali refugees are crossing the border into Ethiopia every . day, UNHCR said. Thousands of families arrive in poor conditions often . after walking for days in search of food. Guterres . said the influx is overwhelming for UNHCR and other international and . local aid organisations: 'Nothing can compare to what we have seen this . month. I believe Somalia represents the worst humanitarian disaster in the world.' The camps are full and lack capacity to provide the Somali people with food and shelter. This . makes effective health treatment almost impossible, said Jerome . Souquet, head of Doctors Without Borders at the Dollo Ado camps. He said: 'We . can treat the severely malnourished children, but they will definitely . come back to us underfed because there is not enough food and almost all . of them suffer from diarrhea.' Habiba . Osman Ibrahim, a 76-year old Somali refugee from the . al-Shabab-controlled Luk region of Somalia, said she walked for three . days with her two underfed grandchildren. Al-Shabab is Somalia's . dangerous militant group. It had forced out all international aid . groups, but earlier this month said they could return considering the . desperate conditions.

New arrivals: Two Somali children walk across the refugee camp to a registration centre. Thousands of Somalis have fled into neighbouring Kenya and Ethiopia in recent weeks . The . epicenter of the drought lies on the three-way border shared by Kenya, . Ethiopia and Somalia, a nomadic region where families heavily depend on . the health of their livestock. Uganda and Djibouti have also been hit. The . World Food Program said it expects 10 million people in the Horn of . Africa to require food assistance. WFP currently provides food aid to 6 . million people in East Africa. Somalis . desperate for food are also overrunning Dadaab, the world's largest . refugee camp in neighboring Kenya, which is seeing some 10,000 new . arrivals each week, six times the average at this time last year. The . U.N.'s refugee agency says Dadaab's three camps now host more than . 382,000 people, while thousands more are waiting at reception centers . outside the camp.

"Angry birds game, which counts David Cameron and Dick Cheney as fans, worth £1.2billion . Flock of fans have already downloaded 250million times . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:49 AM on 13th August 2011 . Facebook, the world's largest Internet social network acted yesterday to boost its games content. The move came on the same day that Google Inc introduced games on its recently-launched social network Google+. Google launched its social networking site in June, signing up more than 10 million users in the first two weeks. Game: Angry Birds is now on offer on Google+, if you've haven't got an iPhone . The company said it would offer 16 games . from third party developers on Google+, including Zynga Poker, Bejeweled and the infectiously . popular Angry Birds game. The game has become a blockbuster, with users downloading it 250million times to launch furious birds at egg-stealing green pigs. Dveloped by Rovio, there are rumours that companies want to invest in the game which would make it worth an estimated £1.2billion. Its flock of fans spend a combined 200million minutes throwing angry birds at pinching pigs and the game has sold more than three million toys, according to The Times. Google, which has a stake of undisclosed size in Zynga, said it will roll out games gradually . on Google+, and make the game feature available to everyone 'soon.' Games on Google+ have their own separate page, which may help convert Facebook users bored with reading their friends’ game notifications. NEW LOOK: Search engine giant Google brought its own twist to social networking . Vic Gundotra, Google Senior Vice President, Engineering said: 'That means giving you control over when you see games, how you play them and with whom you share your experiences. 'Games in Google+ are there when you want them and gone when you don’t.' 'You can see the latest game updates from your circles, browse the invites you've received and check out games that people you know have played recently. FOUNDER: Mark Zuckerberg in a news conference at Facebook headquarters . 'Your circles will only see the updates when they’re interested in playing games too.' And Google+ users who have no interest in playing online games can just ignore the games tab. Now Facebook is keen to harness the popularity of games on its service. Facebook, which was hosting 100 game . developers for an event at its California headquarters in Palo Alto, announced some new features to improve the . gaming experience on its website, as well as a policy loosening . restrictions on how developers can market their games. The changes will expand the types of . notifications that Facebook users see when their friends are playing . games on the website, rolling back restrictions made last year that . provoked grumbles among some game developers. Facebook head of games Sean Ryan said: 'Our . games ecosystem has continued to grow. But there's no question that we . want to grow it faster in a more high quality way for our users and . developers.' Games such as Zynga's Farmville are some of the most popular activities on Facebook. More than 200million users play . games on Facebook every month, and the company takes a 30 per cent cut of . the sale of virtual goods bought by users during gaming. GOLDEN EGG: Games such as Farmville provide income for Facebook . With the two Web giants competing to attract users to their respective online services, the dueling social gaming announcements underscored what could emerge as a key battleground between the two companies. Jeremy Liew, a partner at venture . capital firm Lightspeed, which has invested in social game companies . said of Google's announcement: 'It turns out that people like to play games, and it's core to the social networking use case.' ONLINE: Sites such as Facebook allow users to keep up to date with friends . Liew added that Google's move to offer games on its social network provides game developers with a compelling alternative to Facebook. But he said the most important consideration for game makers is which social network has the most users. 'Right now no one is going to be willing to give up Facebook because it's where the users are Today. Google+ got a terrific start but it's got a ways to go.' Among the new gaming features introduced by Facebook on Thursday are the ability to expand the size of the window in which games are played on Facebook's site, new ways for users to create bookmarks for their favorite games and a scrolling 'ticker' that highlights the games a person's friends are playing, their recent scores and achievements. In loosening restrictions on game updates within Facebook's general newsfeed, the company must walk a fine line between helping developers promote their games on the network and irking users that are not avid gamers. Facebook's newsfeed - which displays a rolling stream of messages, photos and updates from friends - is a vital distribution channel for gamemakers, allowing companies like Zynga, Electronic Arts' Playfish and Playdom to reach vast numbers of users. But it has caused some backlash among Facebook's non-gaming users, who found the constant notifications about their friends' progress within various games to be irrelevant and annoying. DOTCOM: Google headquarters in Mountain View, California . Last year, Facebook clamped down on the practice, so that Facebook users would receive notifications only about games which they had also installed. Under the new policy, Facebook users will see notifications about any game their friends are playing. But Ryan said the company had developed special algorithms that will only display updates if Facebook has a reason to believe they are relevant to the person. If the person shows no interest in certain types of games, Facebook won't serve them updates in the newsfeed. 'No one wants to go back to the bad old days of people being very unhappy about gaming because they feel like they're being spammed all the time,' said Ryan. 'That's the key which we really spent months and months working on, is that tricky balance of trying to expose a lot more games to people, but only to the people who we think want to play those games.'","Angry birds game, which counts David Cameron and Dick Cheney as fans, worth £1.2billion .

Texas Governor Rick Perry, the new . face in the race for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, has . already jumped to a double-digit lead over Mitt Romney and Michele . Bachmann with the other announced candidates trailing even further . behind. The latest Rasmussen Reports national . telephone survey of Likely Republican Primary voters, taken on Monday . night, finds Mr Perry with 29 per cent support. Mr Romney, the former Massachusetts . governor who ran unsuccessfully for the GOP presidential nomination in . 2008, has 18 per cent of the vote, while Mrs Bachmann, the Minnesota . congresswoman who won the high-profile Ames Straw Poll in Iowa on . Saturday, picks up 13 per cent. Scroll down for video . Corn dog trail: It appears to be becoming a tradition for front runners to scoff on the fatty treats . Texas Congressman Ron Paul, who was a close second to Bachmann on Saturday, has the support of nine per cent of likely primary voters, followed by Georgia businessman Herman Cain on six per cent and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich with five per cent. Rick Santorum, former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, and ex-Utah Governor Jon Huntsman each get one per cent support. The poll figutes were released as Mr Perry hit the campaign trail, slamming Barack Obama by claiming the country needs a president who is 'in love with America'. After announcing his bid on Saturday, the 61-year-old Texas governor gave the country a taste of what's to come at the Iowa State Fair, signing autographs and scoffing on finger food while boldly declaring his love for the U.S.A. Hungry; Rick Perry got stuck in to the campaign trail while tucking in to a pork chop . 'I think you want a president who is passionate about America - that’s in love with America,' Perry said during the visit on Monday. When he was asked by a journalist in Iowa later on Monday at a Republican Party event if he was insinuating that President Obama does not love America, Perry said: 'You need to ask him. I’m saying, you’re a good reporter, go ask him.' The Rasmussen Reports poll marks a significant jump in support for Mr Perry. Just over two weeks ago, a survey of likely primary voters found Romney with 22 per cent support, closely followed by Perry at 18 per cent and Bachman with 16 per cent of the vote. Scott Rasmussen said: 'Governor Perry is enjoying a bounce from entering the race at precisely the right time. Bold: Perry spoke of his deep love for America - and questioned whether the President feels the same . 'Now the difficult part begins for the new frontrunner. 'It’s much easier winning support when people are hoping you will get in the race, than retaining support when you are the frontrunner.' After months of speculation, Perry . joined the presidential race on Saturday, announcing his bid at a . conservative conference in Charleston, South . Carolina. He said at the time that America isn't broken but the government in the nation's . capital is and blamed President Obama for . 'rudderless' leadership. At . a Republican Party meet-and-greet he fiercely criticised Obama's jobs . record, as the President spoke at a town hall meeting 100 miles away in . Decorah, Iowa. I'm hungry too! Perry slammed Barack Obama, who was spotted yesterday with a pie . 'He’s gonna talk about jobs,' Perry said. 'But I think the only job he cares about is the one he’s got. 'I . think it’s fair for Iowans to ask the president tomorrow, where are the . jobs that you promised, Mr. President? That’s a fair question to ask . this man.' He added that . Obama was, in his opinion, the 'greatest threat to our country' and . spoke out about his own record of job creation in Texas, boasting that . his state has 'the strongest economy in the nation'. 'What’s going on in Washington, DC is stunning,' he said. 'Stunningly bad.' He was also caught on videotape saying the prospect of the Federal Reserve chairman 'printing more money' was 'almost treasonous'. 'If this guy prints more money between now and the election, I dunno what y’all would do to him in Iowa but we would treat him pretty ugly down in Texas. 'Printing more money to play politics . at this particular time in American history is almost treacherous - I . mean treasonous - in my opinion.' Speaking of his plans for the Iowa . caucuses, Perry said: 'We’re going to be spending a lot of time here . over the course of the next months. You all do it not unlike running for . agriculture commissioner back in Texas in 1990. A lot of probin’ and . lot of feelin’ and touchin’ and talkin’ and vetting the candidates and . asking questions … it is a good process.' True to form, Perry was photographed in Iowa almost constantly eating on some form of finger food. Making a stand: Perry used to the opportunity to hit out at Barack Obama . Too much? A man in the background holds his stomach as Perry tucks in to a corn dog, as his wife watches on . As he signed autographs and mingled with his supporters, he snacked on pork chops on a stick and corn dogs, among other foods. Announcing . his bid on Saturday, Perry said: 'It is time to get America working . again. That's why with the support of my family and an unwavering belief . in the goodness of America, I declare to you today my candidacy for . president of the United States.' The . conservative three-term Texas governor has touted a record of job . growth in Texas and also is known as a strident critic of federal power . and an opponent of abortion rights and gay marriage. He is considered a . strong fundraiser. Why not? Rick Perry tucks in to some boiled eggs at the Iowa State Fair . Bid: Perry declared his candidacy on Saturday after months of speculation as to whether he would run . Opinion polls indicate Perry entered the race close on the heels of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the early front-runner to win the 2012 Republican nomination. Meanwhile, Tea Party favourite Michele Bachmann made her case this week, winning the Iowa straw poll. The announcement by Perry, who has made his deep Christian faith a big part of his public image, came one week after he led a seven-hour religious rally in Houston to pray for America, a nation he described as 'in crisis.' On Monday, he said despite delays in announcing his bid 'we’re gonna campaign like our life . depends on it. You can count on it in Iowa and New Hampshire and South . Carolina - across this country.'

"By . David Williams . Last updated at 7:48 PM on 16th August 2011 . Forces loyal to Colonel Gaddafi are believed to have more than 200 Scud missiles held in reserve to defend Tripoli as rebel fighters draw closer to the Libyan capital. With rebels threatening to take control of two strategic towns guarding supply lines to the city, Gaddafi's forces fired the first Scud of the six-month long conflict on Sunday. It came as there was mounting speculation that Gaddafi would once again being offered a 'way out' to prevent massive bloodshed in any final battle for Tripoli by being guaranteed a safe passage to Venezuela. Captured: Rebel fighters manhandle a person they believe to be a Gaddafi loyalist sniper in the streets of Zawiyah, about 30 miles from Tripoli. Rebels advanced into the Zawiyah at the weekend . Innocent victims: Libyan civilians carry an injured man into the Bir Moamer clinic in Zawiyah. Hospital staff have reported that at least 20 people, including civilians, were killed in fierce fighting to take control of the town . Significantly, UN envoy Abdel-Elah . al-Khatib, Jordan's former foreign minister, has arrived in the Tunisian . capital Tunis for the meetings with representatives of both Gaddafi and . the rebels. He said there were no direct . negotiations as he met the two sides separately in the neighbouring . country but a Tunisian security official said Mr al-Khatib might also . meet with a representative of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. But Libya's rebel National . Transitional Council (NTC) last night denied it was involved in any . negotiations with Gaddafi's government or with the UN special envoy for . Libya. 'The NTC would like to assure that . there are no negotiations either direct or indirect with the Gaddafi . regime or with the special envoy of the United Nations,' NTC leader . Mustafa Abdel Jalil said at a briefing. Any talks could signal the endgame of a . civil war that has drawn in Britain and the Nato alliance, emerging as . one of the bloodiest confrontations in the wave of unrest sweeping the . Arab world. Heavily armed and motivated: Rebels made significant advances over the weekend and are attempting to encircle Tripoli, which they hope will lead to a political collapse or civilian uprising . A Russian official yesterday said it . was 'deeply disturbed' about Nato's aerial campaign because it has . overstepped the intent of the UN resolution that authorized the strikes. Attacks on non-military targets such . as the main TV station and Tripoli airport call into question Nato's . ability to implement the resolution that authorised the use of force to . protect civilians, the diplomat said on a condition of anonymity. The Scud missile, which is notoriously . inaccurate, was fired from a location 50 miles east of Sirte, Gaddafi's . home town, and landed in the desert east of the coastal oil town of . Brega where rebels are fighting for control. Intelligence officials said the fact . that Gaddafi's forces had begun using the Scuds – fired from the back of . flatbed trucks or fixed positions – was a sign of the mounting pressure . on the beleaguered Libyan leader. Their assessment was echoed by . Shashank Joshi, Associate Fellow at Britain's Royal United Services . Institute, who said : 'It's an obvious sign that the regime's back is to . the wall.' In the protracted months of fighting . up to now, Gaddafi's forces have been using short-range Grad rockets but . have not before deployed Scud missiles, which have an estimated range . of about 185 miles. Notoriously unreliable: A Soviet-made Scud missile, similar to the one fired at Brega. It is said the Gaddafi regime has about 200 of the missiles, but their inaccuracy means they pose little military threat . In the rebel headquarters in the . eastern city of Benghazi, officials said the Scud firing was a sign . Gaddafi would do anything to protect his power. British and French planes have . continued their 'walls of Jericho' strategy to destroy Gaddafi's homes . and compounds – sending a clear message that there is 'no hiding place.' Rebels may still lack the manpower for . an all-out assault on Tripoli, but are hoping their encirclement of the . capital will bring down Gaddafi's government or inspire an uprising. In the past, however, they have frequently failed to hold gains, and a fightback by Gaddafi troops could yet force them back. Referring to the sudden use of Scuds, . Mohammad Zawawi, media director for rebel forces, said : 'Gaddafi troops . are using his last gun. He's crazy … we're scared he'll use chemicals. That's why we're trying to end this war and we hope to end it with the . least number of casualties.' 'We can't prevent the Scuds but we hope Nato can. Nato has the technology to detect them.' Crisis talks: U.N. envoy Abdel Elah al-Khatib, left, meets with Tunisian Foreign Minister Mouldi Kefi in Tunis . Analysts say the rebels' strategy now . is to isolate the capital and hope the government will collapse, but . they say it is possible too that Gaddafi will opt to stage a last-ditch . fight for the capital. In a barely audible telephone call to . state television in the early hours of Monday morning, Gaddafi called on . his followers to liberate Libya from rebels and their Nato supporters. 'Get ready for the fight ... The blood of martyrs is fuel for the battlefield,' he said. Desperate act: The authroisation to use Scud missiles by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi is seen as a last-ditch tactic . He was speaking as rebels made their . most dramatic advances in months of fighting, shifting the momentum in a . conflict that had been largely static and was testing the patience of . Nato powers anxious for a swift outcome. Rebel forces in the Western Mountains . south of Tripoli surged forward at the weekend to enter Zawiyah. The . town is about 30 miles west of Tripoli and, crucially, straddles the . main highway linking the capital to Tunisia. A day later, rebels said they had . captured the town of Garyan, which controls the highway leading south . from Tripoli and linking it to Sabha, a Gaddafi stronghold deep in the . desert. 'Gaddafi has been isolated. He has . been cut off from the outside world,' reported a rebel spokesman from . the Western Mountains, called Abdulrahman. Last night rebels on the outskirts of . Zawiyah said forces loyal to Gaddafi were still on the eastern edge of . the town, from where they have been attacking with mortars, Grad rockets . and sniper fire. Medical workers at one of the town's . hospitals said 20 people, a mixture of rebel fighters and civilians, . were killed on Monday, and the death toll for Tuesday had reached one.

"By . Wil Longbottom . Last updated at 1:37 PM on 16th August 2011 . At first glance, it could be the perfect occupation for a Benedictine monk seeking the isolation to pray and lead a simple life. But the last cowboy monks in the U.S. are being forced to sell off their 1,900-acre farm in North Dakota because of a chronic lack of 'Wrangler Brothers'. Since 1893, Benedictine monks have kept cattle at Assumption Abbey, a Roman Catholic cloister in the hill country established near a then railway town. Rural idyll: Brother Gross has tended the Assumption Abbey herd for 51 years, but the number of monks has dwindled . One of around 40 Benedictine monasteries in the U.S., it originally raised pigs, chickens and dairy cows but switched to beef ranching when these became unprofitable. Now Brother Placid Gross, 76, who has tended the herd for more than half a century, is finally hanging up his spurs as he is unable to carry out the heavy manual labour to look after 318 cattle. Dying breed: Brother Placid Gross, 76, tends to the cattle at the Assumption Abbey Benedictine monastery ranch in Richardton, North Dakota. The farm is being sold off due to a lack of new recruits . St Benedict of Nursia laid down his rule in the 6th century and it is largely regarded as the basis for Western monasticism. Around the year 500, St Benedict became disillusioned with the immorality of Rome and left the city to live as a hermit in a cave near Subiaco. The Rule of Saint Benedict stipulates absolute obedience, forbids private possessions and has a 'three strikes and you're out' policy for monks leaving the abbey. It also forbids monks from striking each other and lay out rules on how much food they are allowed to eat. Celibacy is compulsory and it takes four years to become a St Benedictine monk. Many Benedictine monks, particularly in Belgium and the Netherlands, brew alcohol and wine as it is not forbidden under the rule. Even bringing in hired help to assist . with hay baling and fence repairs would be too expensive and against . the Rule of St Benedict, which requires that monks 'are true monks who . live by the labour of their hands'. Younger . recruits are becoming much less common too. The last U.S. monk to be . accepted at the Assumption Abbey was in 2002, and the 28 remaining in . residence have been unable to recruit more. In the autumn, the abbey will sell of its herd of 155 black angus cows, 155 calves and eight bulls. It will also rent out some of its alfalfa fields and pasture land to neighbours. Brother . Placid told the New York Times: 'It's so good to have the animals here, . to see cows when you look out the window or go for a walk. 'I'll miss it a lot. But I know that there comes a time in life when you have to retire.' The order dates back to St. Benedict, who in the sixth century set rules for monasteries where monks lived communally, sharing duties and spending their time in prayer or working. Once they have joined, monks are expected to spend the rest of their lives with the abbey. Every day, prayer services begin at 6.20am and 11.40am, Mass at 5pm and vespers at 7pm. The monks were normal clothes during the day, but habits for the evening services. They also enjoy watching baseball in the evenings, and get popcorn, beer and rented films on Saturday nights. Brother Placid joined the abbey at the age of 22 after working on his parents' farm. He began wrangling cows while riding bareback, but now uses an all-terrain vehicle to cover the vast ranch.","Benedictine Brother Placid, 76, has tended herd for 50 years .

A 21-strong crew on board a 100ft yacht are recovering today following a dramatic rescue off the Irish coast during one of the world's most dangerous sailing competitions. The US-registered boat, Rambler 100, was taking part in the Fastnet Race when it overturned about 16 miles from Baltimore, County Cork. One woman was airlifted to hospital . after spending several hours in the water and is believed to have been . suffering from hypothermia. The event has a fearsome reputation after the 1979 race was devastated by strong winds and seas, resulting in 15 deaths. Overturned: The Rambler 100 lies upside down off the Irish coast as a RNLI lifeboat rescues the crew during the famous Fastnet Race yesterday . The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) said 16 crew members were sitting on the hull of the vessel and five were missing when a lifeboat from Baltimore arrived at the scene just after 8pm. A local dive team picked the remaining survivors out of the water. Yachting race officials said among the 21 crew members rescued was the former chairman of United Technologies Corporation. George David and his partner, Wendy Touton, were among five people swept out to sea. The others managed to hang onto the hull. Race officials say Mr David and Ms Touton were in the water for 2 and a half hours and she was treated for hypothermia. Mick Harvey, a veteran sailor from Australia who now lives in Newport, Rhode Island, in the U.S. was also was among the crew. Kieron Cotter, coxswain of the volunteer crew, said: 'We picked the 16 people off the hull and took them on board the lifeboat, with our dinghy going back and forth, and organised for other boats in the area to search for the missing five. 'They were picked up by a local diving boat.' The five included a man in his 70s, he added. The crew are believed to have been looked after by locals in Baltimore last night after being brought to shore. A decision is to be made today on whether to try to salvage the capsized yacht. The . alarm was raised when the yacht's personal locator beacon was activated . as it overturned five miles south west of Fastnet lighthouse. Rescue: The lifeboat approaches the yacht where 16 of the 21-man crew were waiting. The five missing members were later pulled from the water . Dangerous: The crew are treated on the yacht during the incident yesterday evening . Cheers: Incredibly, despite five crew missing, all the people were recovered from the freezing water . Mr Cotter, whose crew was on an exercise in the area, said the sea was not rough but visibility was down to one mile as they searched for the stricken yacht and crew. Dozens of yachts were lost and 15 were killed when huge winds and seas hit them, also in the Irish Sea. Hundreds more were left stranded surrounded by bodies floating in the sea. Rescuers from Britain and Ireland worked flat out to find some of the many yachts affected. A Dutch warship and trawlers from France also joined the rescue operation, which was the biggest ever since the Second World War. But this was made difficult because they had to search an area of around 20,000 square miles. Those recovered and their yachts were taken to Ireland, the Isles of Scilly, Cornwall and Devon, as well as Wales. After the tragedy, vessels had to carry VHF radio and restrictions on electronic navigational aids were also lifted. 'Eventually somebody saw something in the distance and it was them,' he said. 'I've never seen anything like it before in 36 years with the RNLI. It was totally amazing. They told us five other yachts had passed within a mile and hadn't seen them.' Mr Cotter said the keel of the boat broke shortly after it passed the Fastnet Rock, causing it to overturn within 15 seconds, throwing everyone overboard. 'One man managed to get up on the hull and get the rest up, but the other five drifted away,' he said. 'It was very dramatic.' The . Irish Coast Guard co-ordinated the major rescue operation, which . involved Baltimore RNLI, the Shannon and Waterford-based rescue . helicopters, and Irish Naval vessel the LE Ciara. One crew member was treated in hospital and 20 were taken back to Baltimore Harbour, where they were assessed by medical staff. Ian Loffhagen, racing manager of the . Rolex Fastnet Race, said the yacht - skippered by George David - . capsized between the Fastnet Rock and the Pantaenius Buoy. 'All 21 crew have been rescued,' he said. Some . 314 yachts - including six Irish boats - are taking part in the Rolex . Fastnet Race and set sail from Cowes on the Isle of Wight on Sunday. The .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:44 PM on 16th August 2011 . The detention of an anti-corruption activist as he began a hunger strike has sparked protests across India, with police rounding up at least 1,200 supporters in New Delhi alone. Anna Hazare began fasting in custody after police arrested him at home to stop the planned public hunger strike in a New Delhi park, which was certain to embarrass India's scandal-plagued government. Hazare's demand for tougher anti-corruption laws has galvanised Indians fed up with the bribery and favouritism that has infested government at all levels and become a political distraction, preventing progress in addressing the widening gap between rich and poor. A supporter of Indian social activist Anna Hazare sits with his mouth taped outside the Chhatrasal Stadium in New Delhi, today . Activists from India's main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hold lighted torches and candles during a protest march in New Delhi against the arrest of Hazare . Across the nation, thousands of people rallied with placards calling for a 'revolution against corruption' and taunting authorities to 'please arrest me'. Some donned white caps resembling Hazare's with the words 'I am Anna Hazare' scrawled in Hindi and English on them. The 73-year-old social activist, clad in simple white clothes, has become an anti-corruption icon by channelling the tactics of freedom fighter Mahatma Gandhi. He had planned the fast weeks ago to press for stronger legislation to create an anti-corruption watchdog, after successfully holding a four-day fast in April to demand a draft law. Hazare waves from a vehicle after being detained by police earlier today . Members of the Socialist Unity Center of India (SUCI) protest against the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government . Police rejected his protest plans after organisers refused to limit the number of fasting days and participants, Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said. 'Protests are perfectly permissible and welcome, but it must be under reasonable conditions,' he said. Hazare waved at a throng of TV cameras outside his home as he was driven away to a police mess hall. His supporters then released a video appeal that he had recorded before his arrest. 'My dear countrymen, the second freedom struggle has begun, and now I have also been arrested. But will this movement be stopped by my arrest? No, not at all. Don't let it happen,' he said. At least 1,200 protesters were rounded up Indian police during the protests . The hunger strikes have catapulted the issue of India's culture of corruption to the top of the TV news and inspired others across the nation to fast in solidarity. A series of scandals unveiled in the last year has embarrassed the government and paralysed Parliament, with lawmakers trading insults and accusations instead of addressing widespread malnutrition and the need for land reform. Today, supporters are protesting in cities including Mumbai, Hyderabad and Kolkata. Many said Hazare's arrest was antidemocratic and a violation of civil rights. Chidambaram said the government was only seeking to maintain order. Indian security personnel stand in front of an arrested supporter as he shouts slogans from a police bus in New Delhi . Hazare has become an anti-corruption icon by channelling the tactics of freedom fighter Mahatma Gandhi . 'We are not prohibiting a peaceful democratic protest. Nowhere in the world is a protest allowed without any conditions,' he said, adding that Hazare's camp had rejected police conditions for holding a safe rally. The governing Congress party accused Hazare of meddling in politics and hijacking public policy with his fast when he should express his views to elected officials. 'He is not fighting against corruption but doing politics,' party secretary-general Digvijay Singh said, adding that the government has a right to take steps to avoid a situation that threatens law and order. The opposition slammed the arrest as evidence that the government is 'imbalanced' on the issue of corruption and demanded Prime Minister Manmohan Singh himself address the controversy. 'The government is hell-bent on crushing civil rights of the citizens,' said Sushma Swaraj, leader of the nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.

Chinese officials have identified another 22 fake Apple stores just weeks after a counterfeit shop sparked an international storm. An investigation was launched after a counterfeit Apple store was spotted in Kunming by U.S blogger BirdAbroad, who was convinced at first that it was a real store. But then she noticed that the sign said ‘Apple Store’ - and Steve Jobs’ electronics giant never writes that on its signs. Counterfeit: Chinese officials have identified another 22 fake Apple stores in Kunming just weeks after a counterfeit shop sparked an international storm . Authorities quickly discovered another five fake Apple shops in Kunming, and have now announced they have found a further 22 - bringing the total to 28 in one city. China's Administration for Industry and Commerce in the Yunnan provincial capital said the stores have been ordered to stop using Apple's logo after Apple China accused them of unfair competition and violating its registered trademark. The market watchdog agency said it would set up a complaint hotline and boost monitoring, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Impressive duplicate: The total number of fake Apple stores found in Kunming now stands at 28 . Reality check: It looks real, but this Apple store in Kunming is anything but . It did not say if the shops were selling knock-off Apple products or genuine but smuggled models. Countless unauthorised resellers of Apple and other brands' electronic products throughout China sell the real thing but buy their goods overseas and smuggle them into the country to escape taxes. In July, inspections of around 300 shops in Kunming were carried out after a blog post by an American living in the city exposed a near-flawless fake Apple Store where even the staff were convinced they were working for the California-based iPhone and iPad maker. China's market watchdog agency said it will set up a complaint hotline and boost monitoring of fake shops . The real thing: The Apple store on Fifth Avenue in New York, complete with its glowing fruit signs . Chinese law protects trademarks and prohibits companies from copying the 'look and feel' of other companies' stores. But enforcement is spotty, and the U.S. and other Western countries have often complained China is woefully behind in its effort to stamp out intellectual property theft. In May, China was listed for the seventh year by the U.S. Trade Representative's office as a country with one of the worst records for preventing copyright theft.",Total of counterfeit Apple shops found in Kunming now stands at 28 .

A woman 'sold' in a black market adoption has been reunited with her long lost mother 34 years after she was snatched from her arms. Sara Hudson and her birth mother, Kathleen Rhodes, were separated in a Long Island hospital parking lot by  late Brooklyn lawyer and rabbi Seymour Fenichel - the ringleader of an illegal adoption scam - in 1976. At a gas station nearby, the newborn was handed over to an older Manhattan woman desperate for a child. After tracking her birth mother on Facebook, Mrs Hudson and her mother embraced for the first time since she was born last week. Tearful: Kathleen Rhodes of Miller Place Long Island was reunited with her biological daughter Sara Hudson, 34, whom she hasn't seen since birth . In an emotional reunion captured by the New York Post, Mrs Rhodes, now 53, said: ''I have been waiting for you to find me. I've always loved you. I've always thought about you.' 'I'm sorry it took me so long,' Mrs Hudson replied, hugging her mother in the Rhodes' Smithtown, Long Island home. Mrs Hudson also discovered she has four sisters. She said she began the search for her . biological mother last year after a medical scare, and was shocked to learn about Fenichel, . who conducted hundreds of black-market adoptions in the 1970s and 80s. Family: (L-R) Caitlyn, 23, Ashley, 26, matriarch Kathleen Rhodes, Sara Hudson, 34, Brittany, 24, and Taylor, 21, pose with their new-found sister . Fenichel, with his daughter, Deborah Greenspan, and Harriet and Lawrence Lauer of Brooklyn, was busted in 1988. A 144-count indictment by the state . attorney general charged they 'sold babies to the highest bidder,' and . 'forced mothers to falsify birth certificates and coerced those who . wavered into giving up their babies, using emotional and financial . intimidation,' according to the Post. In a plea deal, Fenichel, Greenspan and the Lauers avoided jail. Fenichel was disbarred and died in 1994 at age 70. Mrs Rhodes said she was 18 when she got . pregnant. Fearing she could not care for her baby at such a young age, . she dialed a number from a newspaper ad targeting expectant mothers . considering adoption. The ad instructed callers to ask for 'Sister . Marie'. 'All along, I thought I was dealing with nuns,' Mrs Rhodes said. She recalled the woman on the other line asking immediately what race, hair colour and eye colour she and her baby's father had. Fenichel catered to mostly Jewish couples. Innocent: Sara Hudson at age six in her adoptive grandmother's back yard in Rockville Centre, Long Island . Mrs Rhodes, afraid of telling her parents about the pregnancy, said Fenichel convinced her to move to an apartment . near St John's Hosptial, now St Catherine of Siena, in Smithtown. For . two months, he paid her rent and medical bills, and gave her a . $100 allowance for food and clothes. She described speaking to a woman who . identified herself as the 'sister' of the woman who would adopt baby . Sara. As she recently learned, her daughter's adoptive mother has no . sisters. Two days after the birth, Mrs Rhodes . was discharged in a wheelchair. In the parking lot of the hospital the . 'sister' arrived and snatched the baby from her arms. 'She suddenly grabbed the baby, jumped in a car with Fenichel and drove off,' Mrs Rhodes recalled. At the time of last week's reunion, Mrs Hudson's adoptive mother, who was 32 at the time, recalled waiting nearby to receive the newborn. Spotting a police car stationed close . by, she was paralysed by fear: 'Would they arrest us because we were . taking someone's baby?' she asked in an interview with the Post. Years lost: Sara Hudson, here as a teenager, lived for decades not knowing the truth behind her black market adoption . The retired teacher, now 66 and divorced, declined to be named. 'I wanted that baby. I would have killed for that baby,' she said. The woman said she left the logistics of the adoption to her husband, who was a lawyer. Mrs Hudson's adoptive father recalled paying Fenichel $10,000. Mrs Hudson, who had two step-siblings, . said she never felt as though she fit into the family. She moved out of . her adoptive home and attended boarding school in the Adirondacks at age . 12. She later moved to Richmond, Virginia, married and became an . Emergency Medical Technician. Last year, Mrs Hudson almost died from a . blood clot in her lung. Not knowing her medical history, she began her . search for her birth parents. While New York's adoption records are sealed, Mrs Hudson's parents remembered the name 'Catherine Akeson,' Mrs Rhodes maiden name. And on June 1, Mrs Hudson and her . husband discovered a microfilm of a 1977 Smithtown phone book with a . listing for John W. Akeson - her grandfather. Records linked his name to a Kathleen Rhodes. Mrs Hudson wrote her mother on Facebook: 'I was born in June of 1977 in Smithtown, NY, and I am looking for information about my family.' 'Oh my God, it's her!' Mrs Rhodes recalled screaming after she read the note. Mrs Rhodes married Mrs Hudson's father, Larry, six years after she was born.  They had four more daughters: Ashley, now 26, Brittany, 24, Caitlyn, 23, and Taylor, 21. When each daughter turned 16, Rhodes . told each of the children about 'the baby.' The family marked every June 18 with a . birthday cake in her honour and wondered if she would after find and contact the family. Mrs Hudson said she was relieved they had remembered her for so long. 'I never knew if I was wanted,' she said. 'Now I feel much more connected.'","Piar seperated in illegal adoption scam in 1976 .

The 32-year-old looked happy with her outfit choice of high-waisted peach shorts, a white lace top, sky-high camel stiletto sandals and wide, sable-coloured belt.

The two fastest-rising stars in the race for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination were mobbed by adoring Republicans on Sunday as they attended a fundraiser in Iowa. Michele Bachmann, fresh off her win in a closely watched test vote, portrayed herself as a mainstream Midwesterner. Newcomer Rick Perry introduced himself as a common-sense executive focused on jobs. Both candidates attended the same county GOP dinner in northern Iowa one day after the race was upended by Bachmann's victory in the Iowa straw poll and Perry's announcement of his candidacy. Political stars: Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry drew vast attention at the Iowa fundraiser . And while both candidates have strong ties to the influential evangelical wing of the party and are popular with upstart tea party supporters, they told activists at the Black Hawk County GOP's Lincoln Day dinner in Waterloo that they have credibility on the party's leading priority, jobs. 'I happen to think the biggest issue facing this country is that we are facing economic turmoil, and if we don't have a president that doesn't get this country working, we're in trouble,' Perry told about 300 Republicans in Waterloo's Electric Park Ballroom. 'And I've got a track record.' Bachmann touted her experience running her family's small business in Minnesota. 'We started our own successful small company,' she told reporters. 'We know how to build from scratch, putting capital together and starting a business from scratch and building it up so that we can actually offer jobs to people.' A segment of the GOP's establishment and economic conservatives have sat on the sidelines in the early months of the race, waiting for an alternative to former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.

Perry was mobbed by dozens of reporters for his first appearance as a candidate in the leadoff caucus state. It was a sharp contrast to another part of the room, where presidential hopeful Rick Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, moved through the crowd with less commotion. Perry struggled to move from table to table. 'It's going to be a big time,' Perry told Cedar Falls Republican Jeanie Balthazor. In the 24 hours between Perry's announcement in Charleston, South Carolina, and his arrival in Iowa, the ground had shifted profoundly.

But his distant third-place finish, behind Texas Representative Ron Paul, prompted Pawlenty to quit the race Sunday morning. Bachmann, on the other hand, rose sharply to the top of Iowa polls since launching her campaign in June, and made an aggressive push for straw poll support with evangelical pastors and Christian home-school backers.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:01 AM on 16th August 2011 . Feeling the heat: President Obama wipes his brow as he takes questions on his bus tour . Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney has attacked Barack Obama, calling the President's upcoming bus tour of Midwestern states a 'Magical Misery Tour'. The comment, which refers to the Beatles iconic 1967 album 'Magical Mystery Tour', is a continuation of the GOP frontrunner's unrelenting attack on Obama - a strategy he has pursued at the expense of criticising his Republican rivals. The jibe came as Obama set off on a make-or-break bus tour in the U.S. heartland today - where he hopes to re-engage with American voters. The tour could not come soon enough for the beleaguered President, who in a Gallup poll today slumped to a record low approval rating of just 39 per cent. A statement released by the Romney . camp said: 'During his Magical Misery bus tour this week, it is unlikely . President Obama will speak with unemployed Americans, to near-bankrupt . business owners, or to families struggling to survive in this economy. 'He . is more interested in campaigning in swing states than working to solve . the economic crisis that is crushing the middle class. 'Turning this economy around will . require real leadership and the experience of someone who has actually . worked in the private sector.' Obama had a further run-in with a Tea Party activist Ryan Rhodes, a leader of the group in Iowa, who took the president on during an open-air town hall meeting. Rhodes sneered at Obama’s calls for more civility in politics after claiming ‘your vice president is calling people like me, a Tea Party member, a “terrorist”.’ Rhodes was referring to media reports that Vice President Joe Biden had made the remark at a private meeting on debt with House of Representatives Democrats earlier this month. Ryan Rhodes, right, clashed with the President at a town hall meeting in Iowa, yesterday . Obama responded: ‘I absolutely agree that everybody needs to try to tone down the rhetoric. In fairness, since I have been called a socialist who wasn’t born in this country, who is destroying America and taking away its freedoms because I passed a health care bill, I am all for lowering the rhetoric.’ The U.S. President will make five . stops on the three-state trip to Iowa, Illionis and Minnesota -  in the . first bus tour since he famously criss-crossed the country in 2008 . seeking the presidency. The elaborate $1.1 million battle-bus - nicknamed Greyhound one - is the first of its kind to be bought by the Secret Service. It . comes after a summer spent fighting politicians in Washington over the . nation's debt crisis - and a day after two 'fast-rising' Republicans . were mobbed at a fundraiser in Iowa - where Obama will make his first . stop. Tour: The make-or-break tour comes as poll numbers indicated the President had slumped to an all-time-low of just 39 per cent .

Talks: Obama had lunch with five post-9/11 Minnesota veterans at the Old Market Deli in Cannon Falls . Larking around: Obama was pictured clutching a pie and mimicking telephone calls during his tour . Obama will have the chance to absorb the public's anger and do his best to give optimistic answers as he travels between town hall stops. And with unemployment standing above nine per cent, the country feeling the deep pinch of a stunted recovery and suffering the humiliation of a major debt agency lowering its credit rating, it seems he will have a lot to talk about. His aides have revealed he is unlikely to engage any of his potential Republican rivals by name. But, with his poll rating falling, he intends to draw sharp contrasts between his ideas on the economy and the Republican approach. The audience is rapt at the President delivers a speech at Lower Hannah's Bend Park in Cannon Falls, Minnesota on Monday . Audience: Barack Obama speaks during a town hall meeting, Monday, Aug. 15, 2011, at the Seed Savers Exchange in Decorah, Iowa . Playtime: Children from public schools in the town of Chatfield, Minnesota, help Barack Obama get up after he sat down with them for a picture . Front runner: Leading Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney speaks during a campaign stop today . He has dismissed that as little more than slashing spending on vital programs like education and Medicare, the programme that provides health care for the poor. President Obama and the Democrats will this week launch a counter-offensive branding Republican contenders 'Tea Party lackeys' as his approval rating hits an all-time low. The President's approval rating has dropped to below 40 per cent for the first time, according to Gallup's daily tracking poll. The poll released last night said found 39 per cent of Americans approve Mr Obama's performance, while 54 per cent disapprove. Democrats have been trying to depict the Tea Partyers as right-wing zealots bent on destroying the U.S. 'While protecting tax breaks for the wealthy and big oil while proposing to end Medicare, slash Social Security and pile additional burdens on the middle class might win plaudits with the Tea Party, it's not remotely what the American people are looking for,' Democratic National Committee Communications Director Brad Woodhouse said. The trip is timed to dilute the buzz emanating from the Midwest after Republicans gathered in Iowa over the weekend for a first test of the party's White House candidates. The state holds the nation's first nominating test in the long road toward choosing Obama's opponent. Sources also said that he was ready to hear complaints from disaffected Democrats tired of his compromises with Republicans, and from a public disgusted with a dysfunctional Washington. The tour itinerary takes Obama through three states he won in 2008, but where he now needs to shore up his standing. In Iowa, he returns to a state that handed him a key victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in 2008. But it is now where Republicans have been blanketing the state in preparation for its first-in-the-nation caucuses. The first signal that their plan could be bearing fruition came last night when the two fastest-rising stars in the race for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination were mobbed by adoring Republicans as they attended a fundraiser in the state. Michele Bachmann, fresh off her win in a closely watched test vote in the long road to choosing Obama's opponent, portrayed herself as a mainstream Midwesterner.

Crack down on crime: Nick Clegg, speaking today, said he wanted criminals to come face to face with victims in the communities affected across Britain . Nick Clegg today called for convicted . rioters to be forced to wear orange jumpsuits and clean up the neighbourhoods they looted. The Deputy Prime Minister said he wanted criminals to come face to face with victims in the communities affected across Britain. Theresa May also spoke this morning about policing during the riots, repeating comments from last week that the initial response was 'unsatisfactory'. The Home Secretary said: 'The events of the past ten days show police reforms are more urgent than ever.' Her comments came as West Midlands Chief Constable said some of the young people arrested after riots in Birmingham 'have led difficult lives and should be shown compassion'. This morning also saw the Prime Minister visiting Tottenham, where riots erupted last week . Earlier, at a press conference in Whitehall, Mr Clegg said an independent communities and victims panel would allow people 'to have their voice heard'. The Liberal Democrat leader said research would be done to find out 'what happened, who did what and why they did it'. He said: 'It is really important at a time like this that we should not allow hope and optimism to be suffocated by fear and pessimism.' High praise: David Cameron talks to volunteers and MP David Lammy at a community centre in Tottenham where help has been made available for victims of rioting . Ed Miliband meets PCSO Natalie Thomas during a visit to St Pauls in Bristol today following last week's disturbances . Scotland Yard thwarted planned attacks by rioters on iconic sites across London hours before they were due to happen after officers 'break into' encrypted social messaging sites, the Guardian reported. Attacks on the Olympics site, upmarket stores in Oxford circus and the two Westfield shopping centres in East and West London were plotted using BlackBerry Messenger. After scouring the mobile phones of people who had been arrested during the riots they discovered the messages which were bouncing around the heavily encrypted BlackBerry Messenger service. By last Monday they were able to monitor BlackBerry messaging. Police had considered switching off social messaging sites, including BlackBerry Messenger and Twitter. But acting Metropolitan police commissioner, Tim Godwin, said they did not have the legal powers to do so. BlackBerry maker Research in Motion (RIM) says it will co-operate with the police investigation into claims that its virtually untraceable instant BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) service was used to plot the riots. It would not confirm that it possesses an electronic ‘master key’ that could decode messages and reveal users' identities. Twitter has refused to say whether it is helping police to locate those who used its service to co-ordinate the riots. Mr Clegg also confirmed plans for a 'riot pay-back scheme', with offenders helping to clean up areas hit by the disturbances. Victims . will also be given the right to confront those who tore up their local . area, with additional money provided to make that possible. Mr Clegg said: 'In every single one of . the communities affected there will be community pay-back schemes, riot . pay-back schemes, where you will see people in visible orange clothing . making up for the damage done, repairing and improving the neighbourhoods . affected. 'I also want them to face their victims. I want them to face people like the woman I met last week in Tottenham, who said to me that she was still wearing the clothes ... from when her own flat was burned down. 'The offender who did that, who set fire to that building, should have to face her and understand that there are human consequences, to explain why he or she did what they did and to apologise.' As part of the measures to end the 'dismal cycle of repeat crime', Mr Clegg also said that those released from jail from March next year would be 'met at the prison gates' by providers in the Work Programme. The offenders will be put through a 'tough process so that they find work and they stay on the straight and narrow'. Mr Clegg acknowledged the need to look again at how authorities were tackling gang culture. He said: 'I don't think anyone could have witnessed last week's events and somehow been complacent about gang culture. 'There does seem to be some early . evidence that in some areas there was a very strong gang element and . there is even some anecdotal evidence that gangs were co-operating to . maximise their looting opportunities. Thirty officers and sniffer dogs swooped on an address in Hackney today where two more teenagers were arrested in connection with last week's riots. Support: The Prime Minister discusses what can be learned from last week's riots with the emergency services . 'Of course we need to look at that and that is why I think it is right that we revisit our positions on gang culture.' West Midlands Chief Constable Chris Sims told a special city council meeting he had spoken to several of the youngsters detained after last week's violent scenes. He said: 'I spent Saturday evening in . the custody block at Steelhouse Lane Police Station. There are tragic . offenders as well as tragic victims. 'Young . people who have been in care for most of their lives. We need to show . some compassion and be pragmatic about how we deal with these people.' Opposition . Labour councillors said they would launch a probe into the underlying . conditions of high unemployment, poor housing and a lack of education, . thought to result in many young people feeling that they have no future. Meanwhile, . the Prime Minister toured a leisure centre in Tottenham, North London, . which was providing food and clothing for people made homeless by the . fires. He also visited a local fire station. Mr Cameron told firefighters: 'I . wanted to hear first-hand about some of the things you experienced, and . some of the things we need to learn from it. 'Debt of gratitude': Theresa May spoke today of her admiration at how the police had quelled the violence - but admitted the initial response to the riots was 'unsatisfactory' 'It was an incredibly challenging situation, perhaps particularly here in Tottenham. 'I've been all over the country hearing about what happened, but this is where things started. 'It was complicated and made difficult by the tragic killing of Mark Duggan - it's been a difficult situation.' The Tory leader also spoke to some of . the 50 families made homeless by the rioting, when flats were burned . during attacks on shops. The . shooting of Mr Duggan, 29, by police near Tottenham Hale station, which . is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, . was the spark which set off the riots in the area two days later. Home . Secretary Theresa May held a news conference this morning about the . police response to last week's riots and looting across the UK. She said that new curfew powers for police need to be considered in the wake of the riots. Officers should also be given clearer guidance on public order policing, including the possibility of setting up no-go areas. Rampage: Police officers in riot gear block a road near a burning car on a street in Hackney, east London during widespread violence in the capital last week . She said: 'Under existing laws, there is no power to impose a general curfew in a particular area, and, while curfew conditions can be placed on some offenders as part of their Asbo, criminal sentence or bail conditions, there are only limited powers to impose them on somebody under the age of 16. 'These are the sort of changes we need to consider.' Mrs May rejected calls from senior officers to reconsider the Government's 20 per cent cuts to police budgets in the wake of the riots, saying the disturbances of the past ten days showed the reforms were now more urgent than ever. She said: 'I am clear that, even at the end of this spending period, forces will still have the resources to deploy officers in the same numbers we have seen in the last week. 'It's clear to me that we can improve the visibility and availability of the police to the public. 'It's more important than ever that we do so, because we are asking the police to fight crime on a tighter budget.' Ed Miliband criticised the Home Secretary's plan to press on with police cuts, saying it left him 'very worried'. The Labour leader was on a visit to Bristol, where he met members of the community affected by rioting last week. He said: 'It is right that we learn lessons from the policing of the riots, but the most important thing the Government can do is learn lessons itself. 'The lesson the public wants them to learn is that visible effective policing increases public confidence and increases safety on our streets. That is why they should rethink their police cuts.'","Deputy Prime Minister vows to address gang culture .

"Robert Kariuki refused to let her go to the toilet during an ordeal lasting several hours . The Army sapper has been jailed for ten years . By . Allan Hall . Last updated at 12:27 PM on 15th August 2011 . A British Army sapper who raped a woman seven times in a ‘humiliating and degrading’ ordeal has been jailed for ten years and dismissed from the service. Kenyan-born Robert Kariuki attacked the woman in her bed, stuffing a teddy bear in her mouth and covering her face with a pillow after she had spent the night making love with his friend. He threatened to kill his victim and stopped her from leaving her room to even use the toilet during a ‘sustained’ series of seven rapes over several hours. Horror: The victim was attacked at her flat in Paderborn, a garrison town in Germany . Unsuspecting: The victim had invited Robert Kariuki back to her flat in Paderborn, with another friend . The incident happened in July last year. The woman, a German, had invited Kariuki and another soldier to her flat for drinks in the army garrison town of Paderborn. She was estranged from her British army husband at the time. The court heard she ‘willingly’ had sex with the defendant’s comrade in her bedroom while he slept on her sofa. A British Army Corporal who nearly killed a Scottish veteran with a single blow has saved his career because of ‘racial taunts’ which led him to the attack. A court martial in Germany heard how Royal Logistics Corps Cpl. Kennedy Makunde lashed out after twice being called a ‘black bastard’ by Sgt. Wayne Forbes at a pub in the garrison town of Fallingbostel. The court at Sennelager heard that Sgt. Forbes' ‘personality changed’ when he drank, perhaps leading to the altercation with Cpl. Makunde, 32. Makunde struck the senior NCO, who collapsed and hit his head on the hard floor of the Flic-Flac pub and restaurant causing a life-threatening injury that needed almost immediate surgery. Cpl. Makunde, 32 of 7 Regiment, RLC, was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm at the court martial but avoided jail because the court accepted he had been provoked by the ‘aggressive’ Sergeant. He was given six-months’ detention, suspended for a year, and reduced to lance corporal. But when his friend left the apartment at 7.00am the following morning he went into her room, woke her up and began his rapes. The court martial in Sennelager, Germany, heard how he was ‘jealous’ because she was not attracted to him, even though the woman considered him a friend. Kariuki claimed sex had been consensual and that he had not been aware of what had gone on earlier that morning in the victim’s bedroom. Kariuki, based in Germany with 35 Engineer Regiment, was imprisoned for 10 years after being found guilty at an earlier hearing on seven counts of rape, two counts of threats to kill, and one of false imprisonment. The defendant, who has relatives in the UK, America and in Kenya, was ‘dependable and industrious’ and had been earmarked for potential promotion to officer, the court was told. Judge Advocate Alan Large said the fact that Spr Kariuki did not use a condom and forced the complainant to perform oral sex were aggravating features in the case. Sentencing Kariuki, he told him: ‘This was a sustained series of offences. The victim trusted you to stay in the lounge and sleep there. ‘You subjected her to deeply humiliating and degrading sexual violence.’ He will serve his time in a British civilian jail.","Robert Kariuki refused to let her go to the toilet during an ordeal lasting several hours .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:00 PM on 17th August 2011 . Police have thwarted what they called a 'catastrophic' plot by an expelled student to set off a bomb at his former high school. Jared Cano, 17, had threatened to plant a device at Freedom High School in north Tampa and discharge it on the first day of school on Tuesday. He was arrested last night after someone tipped off authorities about the meticulously planned plot. In custody: 17-year-old Jared Cano, who had been expelled from school, said he wanted to 'do something that was more spectacular than Columbine' At his home, police found materials to make pipe bombs, including a fuel source, shrapnel, plastic tubing and timing and fusing devices, Police Chief Jane Castor said. Officers also found a journal containing schematic drawings of rooms inside the school and statements about his intent to kill - as well as a marijuana growing operation in his home. Mugshot: Former Freedom High School student Jared Cano, 17 . He has written a detailed manifesto, outlining a minute by minute guide to his planned killing spree, police said. He is also said to have written that he 'wanted to do something that was more spectacular than Columbine'. Cano faces felony charges of possessing bomb-making materials, threatening to throw, project, place or discharge a destructive device, cultivating marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of marijuana. Authorities said he has multiple juvenile arrests. Charges have included burglary, carrying a concealed weapon, altering serial numbers on a firearm and drug possession. All have been either dismissed or no action has been taken. The St. Petersburg Times reported that prosecutors, at a hearing Wednesday morning, said that when Cano was arrested he repeated his plan to discharge a bomb and cause mass casualties at the school.

'We were probably able to thwart a potentially catastrophic event the likes of which the city of Tampa has not seen and hopefully never will,' Castor told a news conference. She said Cano, who had been expelled from the school, had hoped 'to cause more casualties than were suffered at Columbine' in his attack.

Gerfa Yeatts Lunsmann, her 14-year-old son Kevin and 19-year-old Filipino nephew Romnick Jackaria were snatched by more than a dozen gunmen from a resort on the island of Tictabon. The island lies in the troubled south, near . a stronghold of Al Qaeda-linked militants, officials said. Gerfa Yeatts Lunsmann and her 14-year-old son Kevin were abducted from an island resort in the Philippines. Also pictured is Gerfa's unidentified husband . The mother and son are both naturalised U.S. citizens. Suspicion fell on the terrorist group Abu Sayyaf, . which has been blamed for ransom kidnappings, beheadings and bombings in the . last two decades . Another possibility is a Muslim rebel commander whose group has been linked to . previous abductions. The 400-plus Abu Sayyaf militants, who are fighting for an . Islamist state in the predominantly Christian nation, are holding three other . kidnap victims, including a child, as part of desperate efforts to raise funds, . according to the Philippine army. The assailants seized the trio before dawn from a house in the island village, part of Zamboanga city, and then fled with their captives in two motorised boats, said . police Senior Superintendent Edwin de Ocampo. A police officer shows the passports of abducted U.S. citizens Gerfa Yeatts Lunsmann and her son Kevin in Zamboanga City, southern Philippines . There has been no contact or ransom demand from the . abductors, and their identities remain unconfirmed, de Ocampo said. The abduction took place near Basilan Island, the birthplace . and stronghold of the Abu Sayyaf militants, about 550 miles south of Manila. The largest Muslim separatist group, Moro Islamic Liberation . Front, also has a presence in the area but they have been negotiating with the . government amid a ceasefire that has been largely holding in the restive . southern Philippines for several years. However, the military said a separatist Moro commander . identified as Waning Abdulsalam may have been responsible. Rebel spokesman Von .

"Coroner confirms cause of death was suicide by hanging . Injuries caused by hanging will prevent family from having an open casket at the funeral . Allegations about Russell's sexual preferences were about to be revealed . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:43 PM on 17th August 2011 . New photographs have emerged showing Real Housewives star Taylor Armstrong with a mysterious cut above her eye, just four days before husband Russell's apparent suicide. The 40-year-old displayed the wound outside her Beverly Hills home last week as she carried boxes to her car. In an interview last month, Taylor claimed she had been verbally and physically abused by her estranged husband Russell during their six year marriage. Mysterious: Taylor Armstrong was pictured with a cut above her eye in Beverly Hills last week . Cut: Friends of Taylor claim the wound was inflicted during a football game . However, friends of Taylor insist the cut was not inflicted by her estranged husband, and was inflicted while she was 'playing a game of football.' Taylor filed for divorce last month, alleging in an interview with People magazine that she and Russell, often had 'explosive arguments' in which he would 'curse and call her names. ' The magazine reported that there were times the 'arguments escalated into physical violence, which included grabbing her, throwing objects, shoving her and pulling her hair.' Russell also acknowledged problems when questioned by the magazine. 'Did I push her? Yes, maybe things . happened in the heat of the moment, but it was during a time in our . lives that was not characteristic of who we were,' he said. 'This show . has literally pushed us to the limit.' The news comes as it was confirmed by the LA County Coroner that the cause of Russell's death was suicide by hanging. His body was found on Monday at a house in Mulholland Drive. Split: Taylor had filed for divorce last month after alleging verbal and physical abuse at the hands of her late husband . Reality: Taylor told People that the couple had 'tried hard' to fix their marriage before she filed for divorce . Russell, who was aged 47 at the time of his death, has a record of domestic troubles. Back in 1998, he received a conviction for battery in a domestic abuse case involving his then wife, Barbara Armstrong, according to Entertainment Tonight. Barbara . was granted a protective order against Russell and he was required to . attend a one-year anger management program, as well as weekly Alcoholics . Anonymous meetings as part of his sentence. Meanwhile, it has been alleged today that secrets about Russell's sexuality were about to be revealed, Radar reports. According to sources close to the 47-year-old businessman, he was bisexual and worried that a tell-all book was going to out him. Happier memories: Taylor and Russell pictured attending a Beverly Hills event last September . An insider alleges to Radar: 'About . six months ago Taylor confided in a close friend that she'd found . history for a gay website called Adam4Adam.com on Russell's laptop. 'He . was also spending a lot of time at the gym, but his body wasn't . changing, which she claims led her to believe he was meeting with men . he'd met off the website and not spending time working out as he . claimed,' the source added. The insider said the book went into 'great detail' about Russell's bedroom preferences. 'Not only was it going to come out that Russell was bisexual, but . there were people on the record that were going to talk about the kind . of sex he liked,' the source alleged to Radar. 'He was into S&M type stuff; . choking, and slapping.' Fatherless: Russell is survived by his daughter Kennedy, who is sure to be devastated at the news . In the wake of the tragedy, U.S. network Bravo are said to be considering whether to air the new series . of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills as planned on September 5. Executives at the network are waiting 'at least 24 hours' before deciding. 'No decisions have been made as of yet,' a Bravo source told The New York Daily News. A promo was released last month for the upcoming season, featuring Taylor, . Camille Grammer, Kyle and Kim Richards, Lisa Vanderpump and Adrienne . Maloof. In the preview, Taylor was shown crying over the demise of her marriage to . Russell, with whom she has a five-year-old daughter, Kennedy. Plush: The house on Mulholland Drive, Los Angeles where Russell Armstrong was found hanged . The newspaper reports that the couple allowed cameras to follow them as they attended couple's counselling. The network released a statement expressing their condolences, following the news of Russell's death. 'All of us at Bravo are deeply saddened by this tragic news. Our sympathy and thoughts are with the . Armstrong family at this difficult time.' However, there are reports today that Russell's family are considering taking legal action against Bravo. 'Bravo is at fault and somebody needs to pay,' Russell’s step brother Wade Jackson told RadarOnline. 'Russell’s whole family was very close and they’re considering suing Bravo.' Action: Russell's family are said to be considering suing Bravo, who air the Real Housewives franchise . Jackson also criticised Taylor for getting Russell involved in the show. 'In his line of business he didn’t . want to be a public person on the show, but Taylor pushed him into it,' he claimed. 'He was really upset about the whole thing and told everyone . in the family that he didn’t want to be on the show.' Taylor yesterday released a statement through her representative saying she is 'devastated by the tragic events. 'She requests privacy at this time so that she may comfort her young daughter.' The . reality star was said to have raised the alarm on Monday after . becoming concerned for Russell when he failed to show up for a meeting . they had arranged, and did not respond to her phone calls and texts, TMZ . claim. Lavish: The couple appeared to have it all when they appeared on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills but it was only a facade . The website alleges that she went to the Mulholland Drive house where her ex was staying with a friend that evening, and raised the alarm with the home owner. The owner then looked through Armstrong's bedroom window and saw his dead body hanging, TMZ claim. In . the last interview before his death, Russell spoke to website Rumorfix last . month about how difficult he found it to live with his new fame, and how . it contributed to his marriage break-up. 'It took our manageable problems and made them worse. We are very supportive of each other and love each other. I will support her as best I can moving forward. Going ahead: Bravo executives are deciding whether season two of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills will air next month on schedule . 'This is a devastating time. We had a wonderful marriage and I . don’t want you to get the impression that Taylor and I are bitter enemies — . we’re not. 'We have a beautiful five-year-old daughter who we both love.' Ed Winter of the L.A Coroner’s Office said: 'He hung himself with no suicide note found.' No drugs or alcohol were found in the bedroom where Russell died and he was fully clothed when his body was discovered. Russell is survived by five-year-old Kennedy, Aiden, a 13-year-old son from a . previous marriage and a an 11-year-old son with former fiancée Milette .

"Obama says his plan will cut taxes while bringing jobs . The president leaves tomorrow for a Martha's Vineyard vacation at a $50,000-per-week farm . Critics like Donald Trump blast the president for such an expensive sojourn at such a critical time . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:31 PM on 17th August 2011 . President Barack Obama says he has a plan to boost jobs and relieve the long-term unemployed while cutting taxes - and he'll reveal it when he gets back from his vacation. A White House official said Mr Obama's proposals would be fresh ones, not a . rehash of plans he has pitched for weeks and still supports, like . his idea of an ‘infrastructure bank’ to fund construction jobs. However, the American people won't hear details of the proposals, or any other . solutions to the nation's economic woes, until Obama returns from his . summer sojourn in Martha's Vineyard, the wealthy island enclave off Massachusetts, where his family will vacation for the third . straight year. Got a plan? As he ends his three-day campaign bus tour, President Obama says he has a plan for the economy and stalled job numbers as he gets set for a vacation to Martha's Vineyard . Mr Obama's version will challenge the new 'supercommittee' of Congress to go beyond its goal of $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction. Confirming the deficit-reduction part of his plan directly, Obama told a rural town hall crowd in Illinois on Wednesday: 'I don't think it's good enough for us to just do it part way. If we're going to do it, let's go ahead and fix it.' Obama's major economic speech will come right after the Sept. 5 Labor Day holiday. Republicans were underwhelmed. Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, said via Twitter that Obama could scrap the speech and just hand over a detailed plan to Congress. 'Seriously, just drop it in the mail. Podium not required,’ Mr Buck's tweet said. Getaway: When President Obama goes to Martha's Vineyard, he usually stays at Blue Heron Farm, a sprawling property that rents for about $50,000 a week . Mr Obama will seek to use his economic proposals as leverage against Republicans in Congress, hoping to show a nation disgusted with gridlock that he is the one trying to get results. Obama's re-election campaign and the White House are also sure to use any specific ideas from the president as a way to blunt attacks from the Republicans hoping to run against him in next year's presidential election. Already, Obama has been previewing his line of attack. In Illinois on Wednesday, Obama is likely to touch on his economic plans during the final leg of a campaign-themed Midwest bus tour. Republican White House contender Mitt Romney, campaigning in New Hampshire, needled Obama for showing up with too little and too late on the economy. Taking jabs: Republican presidential candidates like Mitt Romney are using the opportunity to take some digs at the president for going on vacation at such a crucial time. 'But we appreciate the fact that he's going to devote some time to it,' Romney said. 'Not just going to be on the bus tour, not just going to be vacationing in Martha's Vineyard, but giving some thought to the American people.' Obama is due to leave Washington Thursday for the 10-day trip at the $50,000-a-week Blue Heron Farm, but he’s not the only one taking a break this summer. Most lawmakers left town in early August, right after reaching a deal with the White House to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a potentially catastrophic government default. Congress isn't expected to get back to work until early September. Former President George W. Bush was heavily criticized after spending nearly 500 days at his Crawford ranch within his two terms . With the lawmakers away, there's probably not much Obama could get done on the economic front even if he did cancel his trip. And even if Congress stayed in Washington, too, there are no quick fixes for the country's deep economic problems. Rich Galen, a GOP consultant, said both Obama and Congress 'don't have anything to act upon.' He added: 'If anyone knew what the answer to this was, they'd do it.' Then there's the issue of perception. Obama will be vacationing at a rented multi-million dollar estate on an island known as a haven for the rich and famous at a time when millions of Americans are out of work and countless more are financially strapped. Bill Clinton's aides were so concerned about vacation perceptions that they polled the public before deciding where he should go. While Clinton preferred trips to Martha's Vineyard, polling sometimes pushed him toward places like the more rugged Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Former President George W. Bush was criticized for spending nearly 500 days at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, during his two terms in office. He was there in August 2001 when he received a CIA briefing paper warning him of al Qaeda's intentions to strike the U.S. — just over a month before the Sept. 11 attacks. And in 2005, he remained on vacation after Hurricane Katrina swamped New Orleans and devastated the Gulf Coast. His presidency suffered from his response to the storm and his decision to not immediately return to Washington. That's a wrap: President Obama leaves for Martha's Vineyard tomorrow after a three-day economic bus tour also seen as a campaign-themed . Some of Obama's prior vacations have come under fire as well. Last summer, he was chided for not taking his family on a Gulf Coast vacation following the BP PLC oil spill. When he finally did travel to the Florida Panhandle for a weekend, his attempts to soothe public concern about the safety of the region's beaches were tainted when the White House released a photo of the president and daughter Sasha swimming in water that turned out not to be the Gulf. 'Fired' up: Donald Trump has taken a swipe at President Obama, saying the president takes vacation's 'constantly' and now's not the right time . Perhaps mindful of the president's image, the White House booked Obama on a three-day, economy-focused bus tour through the Midwest right before the start of his vacation. He also travelled to Michigan last week to speak at a factory that makes batteries for hybrid and electric vehicles. On Tuesday, real estate mogul Donald Trump led the attack on the president over his escapes. 'We have a president that's constantly - whether it's Martha's Vineyard or someplace else - constantly on vacation. I mean, all the time he's on vacation! 'So I think it sends a very, very bad message. We have to work in this country to bring it back.' White House press secretary Jay Carney said he doesn't think the public begrudges the president a break to recharge and spend time with his family. Besides, Carney said, the president is never really off-duty, since White House advisers go with him and he still receives regular briefings on national security and the economy. 'The presidency travels with you. He will be in constant communication,' said Carney, also noting that Martha's Vineyard is close enough to Washington that Obama could make it home quickly if needed. Short of an unexpected crisis, Obama seems determined to follow through with his Martha's Vineyard plans. And he has adamantly rejected the notion of calling Congress back from its break. 'The last thing we need is Congress spending more time arguing in D.C.,"" he said during a speech in Michigan last week. 'What I figure is, they need to spend more time out here listening to you and hearing how fed up you are.' The big bus: President Obama boards the huge black coach that has drawn fire for its imposing appearance, as well as the revelation that the vehicle was made in Canada . Meanwhile, the president's plans to kickstart the economy have been overshadowed by the hulking, $1.1million bus he is using to tour the country on his three-day Midwest tour - and it was made in Canada. Model: VIP H3-45 made by the Quebec-based coach company Prevost . Cost: $1.1m . Security features: Armoured doors plus a device dubbed the 'football' that allows the President to remotely control US nuclear weapons. Communications: Satellite equipment allows Obama to communicate and teleconference worldwide. Additional features: Slide out panels to increase floorspace,  flat-screen TV, couches. Economy: 6.7 mpg . Other owners:  Kid Rock, David Lee Roth and Kenny Rogers . The big black coach has already drawn fire for its imposing appearance - it has been likened to Darth Vadar's helmet, a police mortuary truck, and called the Battle Bus from Mordor - and the revelation the vehicle was made by Quebec-based company Prevost will dent Mr Obama's chances of reviving his flailing polls. Dubbed 'Greyhound One', the fearsome looking machine stands in stark contrast to the usual campaign trail buses, cheerfully emblazoned with slogans and decked in the Stars and Stripes. Website Gawker came up with the Star Wars-themed suggestion as the President entered day two of his Midwest tour on the new $1.1million bus purchased by the Secret Service. The BBC's Mark Mardell added that the formidable looking machine was, 'big, blocky, black, with painted-out windows.' 'It looks more like a police mortuary van than a symbol of hope arriving on your street.' The impenetrable-looking conveyance is the size of a cross-country Greyhound, painted all in black, with dark tinted windows and flashing red and blue lights. Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan emphasised that the bus wasn't purchased solely for the President and would be used for other dignitaries in the future.","Obama says his plan will cut taxes while bringing jobs .

"By . Martin Robinson . Last updated at 4:25 PM on 17th August 2011 . A predatory grandmother who went on a string of dates with teenagers has been ordered to sign the Sex Offender Register for sleeping with a 15-year old boy. Linda Whatton, 38, of Burnley, Lancashire, has admitted unlawful sexual activity with a child and after sentencing at Preston Crown Court today declared 'Well I won't be doing that again'. The court was told she had slept with the boy, a family friend, at her home during a two-month secret affair. 'The Battersbys': Linda Whatton and her son Tommy Foley, who are known for their late night parties and fighting in the street . But the crime came to light when rumours circulated around Burnley and reached the victim's mother, who helped get her convicted. Speaking after the sentencing, Whatton . who has five children, three girls and two boys, as well as two grandchildren. said: 'I won't be doing that again -.what a mistake. 'People have . been beating me, putting the windows through, calling me ""paedo"". Sex offender: Mrs Whatton (pictured) of Burnley admitted the two-month fling with a 15-year old boy . 'I . only just moved into a new house and I already got my windows put . through.' Whatton's defence was she thought the boy was 16 but her account was rejected . and she was also given an eight-month prison sentence suspended for two . years on top of signing the register. She bedded her teenage lover after he had been thrown out of his family home and he was said to have taken an 'active part' in their affair between August and September last year. Judge Simon Newall said: 'Men and woman should be treated the same with regard to breaches of the law. 'Whether or not I agree that women's sexuality should or shouldn't be considered the same, it's very serious and she needs to be aware of that.' He said reports showed Whatton 'age-inappropriate relationships' and liked to go out with her teenage sons' friends. 'That means she goes out with teenage lads,' added the judge. 'I'm not sentencing her for that but she needs to understand that if she's going to go out with teenage lads they have got to be 16. If it happens again she won't be let off at second time.' He added: 'Normal people that have sex of whatever type with somebody under 16 go to prison. It doesn't matter if it's a man or a woman. 'The complainant was 15 and a half at the time. He seemed to take an active part but it's still a criminal offence.' Earlier the court heard how Whatton, 38, tended to 'go out' with the teenage friends of the elder of her five children and offered one a place to stay. The former hairdresser was arrested for unlawful sex after being given an ASBO for waging a five-year campaign against her neighbourhood. She and her 17-year old son Tommy had . been nicknamed 'The Battersbys', a riotous family from the ITV soap Coronation Street, after staging late night rowdy parties . and starting drunken fights in the street. Prosecuting, Katie Jones said: 'The complainant's mother became aware of rumours circulating in the area that the complainant had had sexual intercourse with some kind of relationship. She confronted him and at first he denied it was true. 'In December he admitted that he had in fact had sex with the defendant and he told his mother everything. The defendant at the time was 37 years old. 'His mother was a witness against the defendant, stating she is the mother of the complainant and she'd had a conversation when her son moved in with the defendant when he was thrown out of the family home. 'She said at the time she'd been relieved he'd found someplace to stay. The defendant asked about when school ended, saying he could stay and his mother said he was only 15 and had to go to school or she'd be fined.' In mitigation defence counsel Paul Lawton cited her 'immaturity' mentioned in the pre-sentence report and said she'd be ostracised by the community. 'What is clear is that by committing this offence she had subjected herself to intense scrutiny. 'She's a single mum with small children and has needs beyond those of a normal 38-year-old. I seek to cite her immaturity based on the pre-sentence report.' He also said she was under 'immense stress' at the time of committing the offence due to parallel court proceedings and that it had been about sexual gratification and was a 'spontaneous decision in drink'. Mr Lawton added: 'She's become a social pariah in her own area. She's been subjected to insults and threats.'","Predatory mum of five caught after rumours spread across Burnley and reached the child's parent .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:28 PM on 17th August 2011 . American troops could unwittingly be putting themselves in grave danger in the Middle East, an official report suggests, after five million pieces of body armour were found not to have properly been tested. The Army cannot be certain that the critical battlefield equipment ever met the standards to protect U.S. troops before it was sent out, the Defence Department's inspector general found. The Pentagon report focused on seven Army contracts for the plates, known as ballistic inserts, awarded between 2004 and 2006 and totalling $2.5billion. Unprotected? 80 per cent of Marines serving in Iraq who had been shot in the upper body died because of inadequate body armour . The inspector general's audit, carried out over a two-year period ending in March, found the tests were incomplete, conducted with the wrong size plates or relied on ballistic test rounds that were inconsistent. Due to the demands of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tests under certain temperatures and altitudes were scrapped altogether. 'Consequently, the Army cannot be sure that ballistic inserts meet ... requirements,' the report said. 'As a result, the Army lacks assurance that 5.1 million ballistic inserts acquired through the seven contracts provide appropriate protection.' The inspector general said it did not conduct its own tests so it couldn't say whether the plates were defective. Campaigner: The report was the fourth in a series by the inspector general in response to probing by Representative Louise Slaughter .

The . service also said 'all inspector general recommendations to improve the . testing processes have been implemented. ... The Army continues to work . with the test community for test improvements to provide the best body . armour possible to the soldier.' This month's report was the fourth in a series by the inspector general in response to Representative Louise Slaughter. Since . January 2006, the New York Democrat has pressed the military about the . effectiveness of body armour after The New York Times reported that 80 . per cent of Marines serving in Iraq who had been shot in the upper body . had died because of inadequate body armour. The . body armour used by most U.S. troops comprises a ballistic vest with . two large, hard ceramic plates that protect the upper body from bullets . and shrapnel. The equipment has been crucial for American forces in Iraq . and Afghanistan for nearly a decade. The 51-page IG report said the Army program manager for soldier equipment could provide only 'limited assurance' that the plates met requirements. The inspector general found that for . all seven contracts the program manager did not have a consistent way of . measuring and recording velocity of the test rounds. Two designs were . approved without valid tests. The . Army said it had created a database for test information, standardised . the protocol for ballistic testing and continues to scan body armour . plates before deployment and during a soldier's tour of duty to ensure . there are no internal cracks. Exposed: The Army said on Tuesday that it had initiated improvements to the testing system before and during the inspector general's audit . 'The Army conducts rigorous and extensive testing of body armor to ensure that it meets U.S. Army standards and is safe for use in combat,' the service said in comments included in the report. In an interview, Rep. Slaughter said she planned to write to Defence Secretary Leon Panetta and Army Secretary John McHugh calling their attention to the inspector general's report. Both Panetta and McHugh are former House colleagues of Slaughter, a 13-term congresswoman. 'This needs to be told,' she said, remembering the dead and wounded from the nation's wars. 'At the least, we should have some confidence that this part is taken care of, that in the future more diligence is taken.'","Report finds $2.5billion worth of protective equipment could be defective .

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 2:35 PM on 17th August 2011 . The husband of a New York socialite has been accused of tricking a group of investors out of $590,000 - which was meant for a shopping website they say he never intended to create. Instead, it has been claimed that Andrew Albert spent the cash on a lavish lifestyle which saw thousands of dollars paid out for groceries, pampering his dog and moving to a plush loft apartment in Manhattan's Tribeca district. The 49-year-old, married to Annie Churchill, is also said to have blown $20,000 on clothing, more than $9,000 on looking after his hair, and nearly $6,000 at health clubs. Allegations: Andrew Albert (left), who is the husband of socialite Annie Churchill (right) has been accused of tricking investors out of $590,000, which was meant for a shopping website they say he never intended to create . He pleaded not guilty in Manhattan state Supreme Court on Monday to charges of grand larceny, scheming to defraud and criminal tax fraud. Prosecutors said Albert, of New York, had told investors he was about to launch a high-end shopping website called ON1AVE.com. It would eventually become the Facebook or Amazon of online shopping, he claimed. Visitors to the site would use an online avatar to 'walk' down a virtual street where they could 'shop' in the stores, which would be linked to actual firms like Prada, H&M and Ralph Lauren. The avatar would be programmed with the shopper's measurements, so users could 'try on' the garments before buying them. But the court heard that the venture was, in fact, a 'sham' Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said: 'Andrew Albert falsely told investors that his shopping website would feature a virtual street akin to famous retail boulevards like Madison Avenue or Rodeo Drive. Business: Andrew Albert said his shopping website would feature a virtual street akin to famous retail boulevards like Madison Avenue in New York . Virtual shops: The website would have allowed shoppers to browse and buy in stores such as Prada (left) and H&M (right) 'In reality, the company he created served as nothing more than a bank account that the defendant used to pay for his personal expenses and lavish lifestyle. 'The defendant's elaborate deception defrauded investors of more than half a million dollars.' José Fanjul, an assistant district attorney, added in court: 'The defendant has shown he is untrustworthy and a self-interested character and is willing to put his own desires ahead of others.' According to documents filed in court, Albert formed a company called Virtual Etail Group LLC (VEG) in June 2008. That winter he started looking for investors. He told prospective partners they would not only be funding the development of the site, but would also become VEG employees and equity members. When specifically asked how he would support himself during the development period, Albert assured investors that he had savings from other projects, as well as stocks and bonds. Prosecutors said that, by June 2008, he had convinced his first investor to put $250,000 toward the online venture. Later that year another investor put up $100,000, while in autumn of 2008 a third person stumped up $240,000. House buy: Andrew Albert is said to have spent some of the cash on a loft apartment in Tribeca, New York . The investors claiming to have been defrauded are Michael Bedrick, described as a close friend of Ms Churchill; three family members, William, Christopher and Maggie Heath; and a group called the Robert Johnston Family Trust. They were each handed an equity share of the firm. The cash was placed into a company bank account, of which Albert was the sole signatory. Prosecutors say Albert then started to transfer tens of thousands of dollars to an account in the name of Equation Entertainment LLC, a nearly defunct media consulting business he had formed in 2004. They allege he used the account, for several years, to pay for rent, clothing, health and beauty expenditures, groceries, restaurants, and other personal expenses. He also used some of the money to move from a small apartment in Greenwich Village to a large $2,000 a month loft in Tribeca, it is claimed. Furthermore, it is claimed he used $51,000 to renovate the property, and $12,000 on moving and storage. And, at the time he was pushing the project, Albert was said to be heavily relying on his wife, who is not implicated in the investigation and has publicly backed her husband, for money. 'He’s innocent, and he’ll be vindicated - definitely, without a doubt,' she told the New York Times during a brief telephone interview. Albert has been released without bail and his lawyer George A Farkas said his client denied defrauding anyone. Mr Farkas added: 'This is absolutely nothing but investors in a high-risk venture not having the patience to wait. There is still time for this venture to get off the ground — maybe, maybe not.'","Money was supposed to be for high-end shopping website .

"By . Wil Longbottom . Last updated at 5:03 PM on 17th August 2011 . Italy's highly-paid footballers are threatening to strike over new taxes being brought in on those earning more than 150,000 euros. Supercuts brought in by Silvio Berlusconi's government to avert a financial crisis in the country would see a 10 per cent tax hike on Italy's higher earners. Thousands of villages popular with tourists during the summer months could also virtually disappear after the government announced it cut the cost of bureaucracy by consolidating municipalities with a population of less than 1,000. 'Solidarity tax': AS Roma's Francesco Totti during a preseason game in Valencia, Spain. Serie A stars could go on strike over tax hikes on those earning more than 150,000 euros . That would mean towns including Portofino - a favourite haunt of Hollywood A-Listers Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones - and the Lake Como town of Laglio, where George Clooney has a home, would be legally abolished. Portofino has a population of only 479 during the winter as tourists travel elsewhere, while Laglio has just 957 people living there. The proposals have sparked a storm of criticism in Italy as the country attempts to clean up its public finances to avoid becoming the next victim of the debt crisis. The start of the Serie A - Italy's top football division - is already in jeopardy because of a contract dispute. Tourist hotspot: Portofino, on Italy's Mediterranean coast, is one of thousands of towns that could virtually disappear under plans to axe bureaucracy . Lifestyles of the rich and the famous: Kylie Minogue walking with her stylist in Portofino earlier this week. The town is popular with celebrities . Players have threatened to strike if an agreement is not signed before the start of the season on August 27, but the Gazzetta dello Sport has estimated the new 'solidarity tax' would cost teams around 50 million euros each. AC Milan vice president, Adriano Galliani, said the players should pay, not the clubs. He told the Corriere della Sella: 'Those making 90,000 euros will have to pay it, I don't see why those who make millions shouldn't do it. 'Otherwise, as far as I'm concerned the players can go on strike for the rest of their lives.' AC Milan is owned by Prime Minister Berlusconi, whose government approved the measures. Most top players, especially foreign stars, negotiate their net income upon joining a team, and it is then up to the club to handle their fiscal obligations. Abolished? Lagio, on the shores of Lake Como, where U.S. actor George Clooney owns this home, is another town which could disappear under the municipality merger . This was allowed under the old collective agreement, but the new one - which has not yet been signed - leaves it up to players alone to pay their taxes. The conflict between the players and the league has been going on since the last collective agreement expired in June last year. Two strike dates were set during the last season, both of which were avoided with last-minute verbal agreements. The supercuts will affect 8,100 municipalities across Italy. Around 29 of the country's 110 provinces will also disappear, along with more than 50,000 jobs. Celebrity haunt: George Clooney and Elisabetta Canalis enjoying a bike ride in Laglio. The pair split two months ago . The cuts are aimed at saving a total of 45.5 billion euros over the next two years. Italy's debt in around 120 per cent of its GDP and the cuts aim to balance its budget in 2013. Other measures in the cuts include raising the pension age for women to 65, more tax on cigarettes and MPs switching to economy flights. Capital gains tax will also increased from 12.5 per cent to 20 per cent. The CGIL  - Italy's largest trade union - has threatened to call a general strike against the austerity measures. Susanna Camusso, the union's general secretary, told The Australian: 'Once again it's the weakest who are being hit and those who pay taxes. 'We will confront this budget head on: a general strike.' It comes as global stock markets . largely fell as hopes of strong action in the euro zone against the . escalating sovereign debt crisis faded. The .

Stocks . around the world lost headway after Germany announced disappointing . growth figures of just 0.1 per cent for the second quarter of this year. There was good news in Belgium, however, after it revealed a 0.7 per cent increase in GDP for the second quarter. The country has been run by a caretaker government for the last 15 months, meaning it has been unable to enact austerity measures despite a public debt level of nearly 100 per cent of GDP. Divisions between the Dutch-speaking and francophone regions have blocked the creation of a government since June 2010. Rudi Thomaes, head of the federation of Belgian enterprises, told the FT: 'Part of the explanation of why the Belgian economy is still strong is that we are late in introducing measures of fiscal consolidation.'","Those earning more than 150,000 euros a year face 10% tax hike .

Happy Tweet: Comedian Stephen Fry posted a picture of himself on Twitter meeting Happy Feet during filming of a BBC documentary at Wellington Zoo . Since he collapsed exhausted on a beach in New Zealand 2000 miles from his home in Antarctica, 'Happy Feet' the penguin has become something of a celebrity. Now after over a month recuperating at Wellington Zoo, the wandering bird has finally been given the all-clear to return to the wild. The Emperor penguin will head back to his friends in the Antarctic in a specially designed cage aboard a research vessel leaving on August 29. Among the hundreds of well wishers to visit Happy Feet at the zoo was comedian Stephen Fry who turned up while filming a documentary for the BBC. A top New Zealand surgeon had to remove nearly 7lb of sand from his stomach which the starving bird had eaten, likely mistaking it for sand. But since then Happy Feet has made a full recovery, gaining about 9lb in weight and passing X-ray and blood tests with flying colors. Rob Murdoch of NIWA, the organization that operates the vessel taking him back home, said: 'The NIWA team are looking forward to having this extra special guest onboard the vessel with us for the journey. 'Happy Feet has captured the hearts of New Zealanders and people across the world, and we're pleased to be able to help safely return him to the Southern Ocean.' A veterinarian from Wellington Zoo will accompany Happy Feet, who will travel in a crate specially designed to keep him cool and comfortable during the voyage.

Labour's Tom Watson said MPs wanted to ask Mrs Brooks about her knowledge of payments to the police. He said the Culture, Media and Sport select committee also wants to quiz James Murdoch on his involvement 'in authorising payments to silence' Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, after his phone was hacked. Rupert Murdoch owes the Dowler family an apology, Mr Watson added. Questions: Rupert Murdoch and his British chief executive Rebekah Brooks, pictured today, have been invited to appear before the Culture, Media and Sport select committee next Tuesday . Mrs Brooks is driven from Rupert Murdoch's London home earlier today . Under attack: James Murdoch arrives at work in Wapping, London, today. He has also been invited to answer questions at a Parliamentary select committee . Rupert Murdoch was urged to bow to the will of Parliament today after it emerged that all three main parties are set to back a call for him to abandon his takeover bid for BSkyB. The Tories and the Liberal Democrats said they would be supporting a motion tabled by Labour leader Ed Miliband (who met the family of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler today, below) when it comes before MPs tomorrow. The text insists it is 'in the public interest for Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation to withdraw their bid for BSkyB'. Mr Miliband said: 'I welcome news that the Government says it will support our motion. It is now for Rupert Murdoch to recognise the strength of public feeling and the will of all the major parties.' The development comes as the Prime Minister, his Liberal Democrat deputy Nick Clegg and Mr Miliband prepare to hold talks this evening on the phone-hacking scandal. Labour has called a debate on the row on one of the regular Opposition Days, when it has the opportunity to determine the subject for discussion on the floor of the House of Commons. News Corp's bid to buy the 61 per cent of shares in the satellite broadcaster which it does not already own was referred to the Competition Commission by Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday. Support for the motion will give Mr Hunt more strength in sticking up for public opposition to the takeover, Mr Miliband said. He said: 'Jeremy Hunt will get a chance to make a decision about the public interest at the end of this process, once it comes back from the Competition Commission. 'We think that if the House of Commons expresses a clear view about what is in the public interest - for the bid to be withdrawn - then that will help him in making the right call.' Mr Hunt is not expected to take part in the vote tomorrow. David Cameron's spokesman said the Government was 'intending to support' the call tomorrow. Asked whether the Government believed that News Corp should heed the will of Parliament, the spokesman replied: 'Ultimately, that is a decision for News Corp but we would always expect people to take seriously what Parliament has said.' Sources close to Mr Clegg confirmed that his Liberal Democrats would also be voting in favour. The vote will follow the Opposition Day debate tabled by Labour. Rupert Murdoch owes the Dowler family an apology, Mr Watson added. He told Radio 4's World at One . programme: 'They have misled Parliament, egregiously, over time, they . have misled the country and they have misled their readers and I think . it is incumbent on MPs to get to the facts. 'Asked . whether the News International trio would be compelled to attend, Mr . Watson said there was lots of 'arcane procedure' to go through but . added: 'We will be sitting next Tuesday and we expect them to attend. 'I suspect that some of them might be too cowardly to turn up but that is up to them to decide.' Mr . Watson, a leading campaigner on phone hacking, dismissed claims that . the criminal investigation meant they would not be able to quiz the . executives. 'As far as I . know the three individuals concerned are not the subject of a criminal . investigation, none of them have been arrested,' he added. 'So . it is not unreasonable for us to ask them why the information their . senior executives gave us in a previous parliamentary inquiry was . actually untrue.' News International said today it would co-operate with the committee. A spokesman for News International, publisher of the News of the . World, the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times, could not confirm . whether all three would attend the hearing. But the company said in a statement: 'We . have been made aware of the request from the CMS committee to interview . senior executives and will co-operate. We await the formal invitation.' A spokeswoman for the CMS committee said it had submitted a 'polite request' for the NI executives to appear before it. If they refuse, MPs could choose to 'compel' Rebekah Brooks to give . evidence, although it was unclear whether that action would be able to . be taken against the Murdochs because they are not British citizens, she . added. The committee could make a report to the House if witnesses continued to . refuse to turn up and the Speaker would then decide whether to refer . the matter to the Standards and Privilege Committee, which would decide . if it wanted to investigate. The most likely punishment would be a fine but any action is rare and MPs would be on 'untested ground', the spokeswoman added. Tory . MP John Whittingdale, chair of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, . said: 'In light of the extraordinary developments this week around phone . hacking, serious questions have arisen about the evidence given to the . committee by a number of witnesses in its previous inquiry into press . standards, libel and privacy.

A demonstration against the pontiff's arrival is planned for Madrid tonight but the authorities acted swiftly after monitoring militant activity online.

Cashing in: Sally Bercow will receive £60,000 for her appearance in Big Brother, with around £20,000 going to her new publicist, Max Clifford . She has justified her decision to take part in Celebrity Big Brother by promising to donate a large sum to charity. But good causes will not be the only beneficiaries of Sally Bercow’s controversial appearance on the show, which begins tonight. It has emerged that Mrs Bercow, the outspoken wife of House Of Commons Speaker John Bercow, will be paid £60,000 for participating in the reality television programme. The mother-of-three will keep £40,000 and pass the remaining £20,000 to Max Clifford to act as her publicist during the show’s run. Aides have described the cash she will pocket as a ‘very small contributor’s fee’ and said she will still make a £100,000 charitable donation. But the lucrative deal is likely to anger MPs who have accused Mrs Bercow of ‘using Parliament for  her own financial gain’ and going to inappropriate lengths to raise her public profile. The 41-year-old, who last year failed in her attempt to become a Labour councillor in Westminster, has hired Mr Clifford to represent her while she is on the show, which has moved from Channel 4 to Channel 5. His other clients include former girl band singer Kerry Katona and Imogen Thomas, the ex-lover of footballer Ryan Giggs. Last night Mr Clifford said: ‘I can confirm [Mrs Bercow] is giving  a £100,000 fee to her chosen charity. She’s also being paid a fee a lot less than that and is paying me out of that.’ While his firm has been appointed to act as media representatives only during Mrs Bercow’s time on the show, there is a chance the arrangement could be extended. Unhappy: Mrs Bercow and the Speaker disagreed over her appearance on the show, and he will remain in India on holiday while the show is on air . The Speaker’s wife is said to be keen to explore other television projects, particularly with music mogul Simon Cowell, who is another of Mr Clifford’s clients. A source said: ‘She is keen to  meet Cowell. And he’s interested in meeting her. So when she’s out  of the Big Brother house, that’s going to happen. ‘Sally has some interesting ideas for TV programmes. There are also some other TV projects, including TV  presenting, which she’s quite keen  to pursue.’ A source also revealed that Mrs Bercow and her husband, who will remain on holiday in India while the show is on air, disagreed over her participation in the programme. Swanky: Mrs Bercow will begin her stay in the new house this evening, with the show broadcast on Channel 5 . Other contestants: Mrs Bercow will compete against Jedward in the show, who are receiving £500,000 each to appear . The source said: ‘John didn’t want her to go on the show – but she didn’t want him to be a Tory politician. So it’s give and take. ‘One of the reasons she chose to go on the show was because you can’t get much more anti-establishment than appearing on Celebrity Big Brother. And that is one of the things that appealed to her – upsetting the establishment.’ Another source added: ‘He [Mr Bercow] asked her not to do it. He thinks the show is completely dreadful. ‘They disagree on a lot of things. She doesn’t like the fact he is a Tory and he doesn’t like her being a socialist. But they love and respect each other as individuals.’ Attack: Tory MP Rob Wilson said it was not appropriate for Mrs Berow to appear on the show for financial gain . Inside the Celebrity Big Brother house, Mrs Bercow will compete with contestants including X Factor twins Jedward, who are each receiving £500,000 to take part, and reality TV personality Amy Childs, who appeared on ITV2’s The Only Way Is Essex. Celebrity Big Brother initially began as a charitable spin-off of the main programme. During its first series, in March 2001, each celebrity participated for nothing with all the money raised – a total of £500,000 – going to Comic Relief. However, by the last series, screened on Channel 4 in January 2010, celebrity participants were commanding hefty fees. Footballer turned film star Vinnie Jones was the highest paid performer in that series, receiving £350,000. He is thought to have donated some of the money to military charity Help for Heroes. Mrs Bercow’s £100,000 charity donation will go to Ambition  For Autism, of which she is a patron. Her eldest child, Oliver, is autistic. When it emerged that Mrs Bercow was going into the house, Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘John Bercow said he wanted to restore respect and dignity to Parliament in his manifesto for Speaker. ‘I am not sure how Sally Bercow going on one of the country’s tackiest shows helps. ‘Is it really appropriate for the Speaker’s wife to use Parliament for her own financial gain?’","Aides say Sally Bercow will pay £100,000 to charity .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:53 PM on 14th July 2011 . Perhaps the excuse of ‘it was my first day’ wouldn’t cut the mustard so well for this unfortunate writer. David Cay Johnston was forced to retract his first-ever column for Reuters, but his huge mistake on a tax story was made more odd by the fact he already has a Pulitzer Prize for financial reporting. Mr Johnston has admitted his piece for the top news agency - in which he claimed Rupert Mudoch’s News Corp got a $4.8billion tax refund for the past four years - was ‘100 per cent dead wrong’. Red-faced: Financial journalist and lecturer David Cay Johnston was forced to retract his first-ever column for Reuters on a tax story about News Corp . He has worked as a lecturer since leaving the New York Times in 2008, after winning a Pulitzer Prize in 2001 for excellent work in exposing loopholes and inequities in the U.S. tax code. But a red-faced Mr Johnston, who has enjoyed a successful 45-year career in journalism, has been forced to write a ‘skinback’ retraction for the first time in his life after a ‘bonehead error’. His story about the embattled company News Corp was followed up by a number of news outlets around the world, including MailOnline. The mistake was highlighted by Robert S. McIntyre of Citizens for Tax Justice, who pointed out News Corp has been using negative numbers to report outflows, rather than tax inflows, since 2007. Successful: Mr Johnston's huge mistake was made more odd by the fact he won a Pulitzer Prize for financial reporting in 2001 at the New York Times . Mr Johnston, who teaches at Syracuse University College of Law in New York, realised that News Corp had in fact paid the $4.8billion sum in cash for corporate income taxes between 2007 and 2010. ‘I will do all I can to make sure . everyone who has read or heard secondary reports based on my column also . learns the facts and would appreciate the help of readers in that . cause’ David Cay Johnston . He said he did not know about the switch in convention for reporting positive and negative numbers because he missed a note on Page 87 of the company’s annual report in 2007. Note 2 on that page said: ‘Certain fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2007 presentation.’ ‘For the first time in my 45-year-old career I am writing a skinback,' Mr Johnston wrote. 'That is what journalists call a retraction of the premise of a piece, as in peeling back your skin and feeling the pain.' ‘I will do all I can to make sure everyone who has read or heard secondary reports based on my column also learns the facts and would appreciate the help of readers in that cause.’ Error: Mr Johnston realised that Mr Murdoch's News Corp had in fact paid $4.8 billion in cash for corporate income taxes between 2007 and 2010 . But not everything in his piece was an error - as Mr Johnston pointed out, News Corp are indeed experts at making use of tax deferrals and it has the third most subsidiaries in tax havens. ‘Until now I have never made a big mistake, but this is a painful reminder that we all put our pants on one leg at a time' David Cay Johnston . ‘Tax is my beat, and I was simply looking for what the record showed since Mr Murdoch is much in the news these days,’ he wrote. ‘ . ‘Having a long career writing not just about tax, but also about journalistic misconduct, I wondered if there was anything of interest in News Corp's annual disclosure reports, known as 10-K forms.’ ‘Until now I have never made a big mistake, but this is a painful reminder that we all put our pants on one leg at a time,’ he wrote, adding that he has tried to correct the error as quickly as possible.","Veteran reporter David Cay Johnston made huge error .

"By . Rebecca Camber . Last updated at 3:24 AM on 18th August 2011 . Former Met chief Sir Paul Stephenson has been cleared of any misconduct during the phone-hacking inquiry . Scotland Yard’s former chief and his top officer, who were forced to quit over the phone-hacking scandal, launched a furious broadside at the police watchdog as they were cleared of misconduct yesterday. Former Met Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson and ex-Assistant Commissioner John Yates reacted with anger after the Independent Police Complaints Commission announced that they had been exonerated over their handling of the inquiry. Sir Paul took a swipe at the watchdog for wasting resources, while Mr Yates was said to be ‘utterly furious’ that weeks after he was forced to stand down the IPCC probe had been dropped. The development came a day after a bombshell letter emerged which suggested that phone hacking was common knowledge at the News of the World while Andy Coulson – who later went to work for David Cameron as his No 10 spin chief before resigning over the hacking furore – was editor. Scotland Yard was plunged into crisis after it lost Sir Paul and Mr Yates, who had a combined 64 years of experience. Both men quit over the furore surrounding the force’s hiring of hacking suspect Neil Wallis – a former News of the World deputy editor – as a PR consultant and Sir Paul’s £12,000 freebie at a luxury health spa promoted by Mr Wallis, who was arrested in July over alleged phone hacking. Yesterday Sir Paul criticised the IPCC for scrutinising his free five-week stay at the Champneys resort in Hertfordshire while he recovered after having a pre-cancerous tumour removed from his leg in January. Acpo president, Sir Hugh Orde fell foul of politicians because of his plain speaking during the officers but that could make him popular with officers. He went for the job in 2008 but missed out narrowly and worked as head of police in Northern Ireland . An officer without controversy, acting commissioner Tim Godwin has worked his way up the ranks. He surprised MPs by saying he though about closing down Twitter and faced criticism for keeping a low profile during the riots . Stephen House has spent six years at the Met as head of the specialist crime command. He is currently the chief constable of Strathclyde Police which was praised by David Cameron last week for its work on combating gangs . Bernard Hogan-Howe is a well-liked ex-chief constable of Merseyside Police and is now acting deputy commissioner at the Met. He is considered a strong candidate as he supervised Soca and the policing of the Olympic Games . Sir Paul said: ‘The outcome of the . Metropolitan Police Authority’s referral of myself to the IPCC is as I . would have expected it to be. I regret resources have had to be expended . on this matter. ‘The IPCC’s comments about my . acceptance of assistance from a friend through my family, unconnected to . my professional life, of services from Champneys’ Medical Services, . which they chose to examine under their powers without any external . referral, does in my view fall a little short of full and proper . context. However, this is a matter for their judgment.’ TIM GODWIN - 2/1 . STEPHEN HOUSE - 5/2 . BERNARD HOGAN-HOWE - 7/2 . SIR HUGH ORDE - 7/1 . Source: William Hill . Yesterday the IPCC also threw out . allegations of misconduct against former Met Assistant Commissioner Andy . Hayman and former Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke. But investigators are still pressing . ahead with a probe into claims that Mr Yates secured a job for Mr . Wallis’s daughter. The officer is accused of arranging a civilian role . at Scotland Yard for Amy Wallis, 27. Mr Yates resigned last month after he . came under fire for his handling of the phone hacking inquiry and his . close friendship with Mr Wallis, 60, during a time when he was involved . in the hacking investigation. IPCC deputy chairman Deborah Glass . said he would face no further action in relation to his handling of the . phone hacking investigation, although she said investigators agreed with . Mr Yates’s own admission that his decision not to review the hacking . evidence in 2009 was ‘poor’. Home Secretary Theresa May said top American policeman Bill Bratton was not in the running for the job . Mr Yates said: ‘I am disappointed with . the IPCC’s decision to investigate my peripheral involvement in . recruitment process of Neil Wallis’s daughter. I strongly deny any . wrongdoing and I am completely confident that I will be exonerated.’ On Tuesday a letter emerged written by . disgraced former News of the World royal reporter Clive Goodman four . years ago in which he claimed that hacking was ‘widely discussed’ at the . paper until Mr Coulson banned all reference to it. The letter was part . of a batch of papers made public by the Commons culture committee. Its . release has led to claims by Labour MP Tom Watson that it pointed to . ‘one of the largest cover-ups’ he had seen in his lifetime. The new documents also reveal that Mr . Goodman said Mr Coulson had promised he could have his job back if he . didn’t implicate colleagues and was paid nearly £250,000 by the company – . even after he was jailed in 2007. Mr Watson has said the latest claims . suggested previous evidence given by Mr Coulson to the committee was ‘at . best misleading and probably deceptive’. Explosive correspondence released by the Commons culture select committee on Tuesday, which includes allegations pointing to a massive corporate cover-up by News International, has re-ignited the phone-hacking scandal. Here, Home Affairs Editor JAMES SLACK examines what it means for the main protagonists. ANDY COULSON . The ex-News of the World editor has always insisted he was unaware of any phone hacking on his watch. A dynamite letter from Clive Goodman, written in 2007 upon his release from jail for hacking royal mobile phone messages, claims that the practice was widely discussed at editorial meetings until Mr Coulson himself banned further references to it. Goodman also says Mr Coulson offered to let him keep his job if he agreed not to implicate the paper’s staff in hacking when his case came to court. Denial: Andy Coulson has insisted he was unaware of any phone hacking on his watch . If true – and these are only allegations at this stage – the former No 10 communications director would stand accused of lying to Parliament, perjury (he denied knowledge of hacking on oath, in the Tommy Sheridan perjury trial) and conspiracy to intercept phone messages. Mr Coulson, who would face a lengthy jail term, is on police bail and unable to defend himself at this stage. LES HINTON . The former executive chairman of News International, which owned the NotW, is at the heart of the latest revelations. The Goodman letter, an appeal against his dismissal, was copied to Mr Hinton in March 2007. Mr Hinton faces the damaging allegation that, for years, he did not pass on the letter to police. Four days after Goodman sent his letter, Mr Hinton appeared before MPs and did not disclose any of its contents. Instead, he said: ‘I believe absolutely that Andy [Coulson] did not have knowledge of what was going on.’ Mr Hinton resigned earlier this year, but could be taken back before MPs and accused of misleading Parliament. JAMES MURDOCH . Questions: James Murdoch . He has insisted he did not know the full extent of hacking at the NotW. In particular, he told MPs that at the time he personally authorised a £700,000 pay-off to one hacking victim, he was not aware of evidence that suggested phone hacking was not limited to a single rogue NotW journalist (Goodman). The letters published on Tuesday show that Tom Crone, an ex-NotW lawyer, and former editor Colin Myler both dispute this. They say Mr Murdoch was told about an email implicating a second reporter. MPs want to know if Mr Murdoch misled Parliament. They are also likely to ask whether it’s conceivable that he was unaware of the 2007 Goodman letter. RUPERT MURDOCH . News International has repeatedly defended itself by reference to an internal investigation conducted by the legal firm Harbottle & Lewis (H&L). It was commissioned in the wake of receipt of Goodman’s letter, and concluded – after the examination of 2,500 emails between NotW staff – that there was nothing to suggest Mr Coulson or other senior executives knew about Goodman’s activities. In his humbling appearance before MPs last month, and with NI using the H&L report to defend itself, Rupert Murdoch said the firm had been employed to ‘find out what the hell was going on’. This caused fury at H&L, which wrote to MPs describing this claim as ‘inaccurate and misleading’. The lawyers say they had a narrow remit to look only at whether Goodman’s claims would stack up in an employment tribunal – not to give NI a ‘good conduct certificate’. DAVID CAMERON . The greater the trouble Mr Coulson finds himself in, the worse it gets for the Prime Minister, whose judgment in appointing the spin doctor – and taking him into Downing Street – is called into ever greater question. If the allegations against Mr Coulson are proved, Mr Cameron will have to explain whether he was lied to, or if he didn’t bother to ask key questions about his friend’s past. Uncertain: If allegations against Coulson are proved, David Cameron will have to give plenty of answers to questions about his spin doctor . Critics ask if it is really likely that Mr Coulson was given such a key job without aides approaching Goodman, or senior NI executives, to check if any new allegations were likely to emerge. Others – notably ex-Met Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson – have resigned for having looser links to NI executives implicated in the hacking scandal than those held by the PM.","John Yates also cleared of wrongdoing .

"By . Wil Longbottom . Last updated at 5:07 PM on 17th August 2011 . A U.S. tourist would face paying $8.30 for a cup of coffee in Zurich after the Swiss franc soared to a new record high this month. Switzerland was considering imposing an exchange rate target to prevent its goods becoming prohibitively expensive as the franc reached $1.28 in today's exchange rate. If it is unable to rein in its runaway currency, Swiss manufacturing could see major job losses as it faces increasing pressure to cut costs. Expensive holiday: A U.S. tourist would have to fork out $8.30 for a cup of coffee in Zurich as the Swiss franc continues to soar in value (file picture) The franc, which appreciated to an all-time high of 70.71 centimes against the dollar earlier this month, has traditionally been seen as a haven during economic hardships and is heavily overpriced against other currencies. Diners at a Swiss branch of McDonalds would pay 128 per cent more for a Big Mac than they would in the U.S., according to a Bloomberg index. Billionaire entrepreneur Christoph Blocher told Bloomberg: 'The franc is catastrophically overvalued. 'It's almost like economic warfare - to wage a war, you must use all measures at your disposal, and you must win.' Pressures: Swiss exports, which account for 50 per cent of GDP, could be badly hit if the franc is not devalued . Economiesuisse, the country's largest business lobby group, added: 'If the franc can't be weakened, many machinery makers will have to take drastic decisions this fall.' Zurich is already the world's second-most expensive city, behind Oslo in Norway, a study by UBS AG revealed. The Swiss government held talks this week over a possible exchange rate target - linking the franc to the value of another currency such as the euro - in a bid to devalue it. 'Taboo': The Swiss National Bank earlier decided not to 'peg' the value of the franc to the euro - a move likely to cause more unrest in the markets . The Swiss National Bank (SNB) lost $21 billion last year in a failed attempt to hold back the franc. But the SNB decided to inject more of the Swiss currency into the money markets in another attempt to cause it to depreciate. In its latest batch of measures - the third this month - the central bank said it would conduct foreign exchange swap transaction to ease the value of the franc and 'will, if necessary, take further measures'. It last implemented an exchange-rate target in 1978, when it attached itself to Germany's deutsche mark. Seven government members are expected to meet later today to discuss the strength of the franc. Exports make up around half of Swiss GDP, raising the very real issue that a continued overvaluing of the franc will effect the economy. After the SNB cut interest rates on August 3, the Swiss franc initially lost around 3.5 per cent against the euro. But over the last two months it has strengthened 7.2 per cent as the euro zone battles to contain a mounting debt crisis. Alexander Krueger, chief economist at Bankhaus Lampe KG in Dusseldorf, told Bloomberg: 'As long as people are concerned, the franc will continue to appreciate, probably beyond parity.' Concerns: This chart shows the soaring value of the Swiss franc over the last 18 months. Below, inflation in Europe has also soared as nation's battle the sovereign debt crisis . CPI index . By this afternoon, the dollar was trading 1.3 per cent lower at 0.7859 francs, while the euro was down 1.2 per cent at 1.13. Over recent days, the Swiss franc has fallen over speculation it could be 'pegged' with the euro. But the decision not to implement it could see it rise again, after last week almost reaching parity with the euro for the first time since it was introduced in 1999. It comes as global stock markets largely fell as hopes of strong action in the euro zone against the escalating sovereign debt crisis faded. The FTSE 100 closed at 5,331.60, a loss of 0.49 per cent. And there was a muted start to trading in New York, with the Dow Jones little changed at 11,411.84. Stocks around the world lost headway after Germany announced disappointing growth figures of just 0.1 per cent for the second quarter of this year.","Diners would pay 128 per cent more for a Big Mac in Switzerland than the U.S.

A Nazi sympathiser suspected of committing an arson attack that killed three members of his own family has surrendered after holding his girlfriend and her baby hostage. Ex-con Matthew Slocum, 23, who has tattoos of swastikas on his arms, sparked an Amber Alert in three states when he went on the run following the tragic inferno in White Creek, New York. He is accused of triggering the blaze which is thought to have taken the lives of his mother Lisa Harrington, her police officer husband Dan and his son Josh at the house he shared with them. Accused: Matthew Slocum is suspected of setting fire to the house in White Creek, NY where his mother, stepbrother and stepfather were found dead . Although detectives are also investigating whether Slocum shot dead all three before torching the property. Police eventually caught up with the fanatic, who was been jailed three times, in Gilsum, New Hampshire. There armed officers persuaded him to let 25-year-old Loretta Colegrove and their four-month-old son Raymond go. Safe: Loretta Colegrove, taken hostage by Slocum, was unharmed after he surrendered to police . Slocum, who was last seen before the blaze wearing a black t-shirt featuring a skull and crossbones, has since been charged with first degree arson and is expected to be returned to New York. The baby and his mother were unharmed. Slocum went on the run while the house was still burning early on Wednesday morning in a 2003 Mustang sparking the alert across New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The search: Slocum was eventually located in New Hampshire . He was found later that evening at a property which is thought to be owned by his uncle and is three hours' drive away. The house in White Creek was a scene of devastation on Thursday as investigators sifted through the rubble to try and find out what had started the blaze. Friends and relatives of the Harringtons had left floral tributes and some lit candles at the end of the drive. Records show Slocum was jailed in 2006 for breaking into a house and stealing cash. He was released but broke his parole conditions twice and was sent back before being released again in December 2009. Siege: Army officers assisted in the hunt for Slocum . Speaking to the Post-Star Washington . County District Attorney Kevin Kortright said police have labelled the . fire ""suspicious"" but have not said what they believed caused it. 'There's still a lot of work to be done,' he added. 'The state (Bureau of) Fire guys say it will take all day today to go over the fire scene.'","Matthew Slocum has swastika tattoos on his arms .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:23 PM on 14th July 2011 . Roger Clemens will face a brand new court battle later this year over charges he lied to Congress about using performance enhancing drugs after an abrupt mistrial was called on Thursday. The judge declared a mistrial in the baseball star's perjury trial after prosecutors showed jurors evidence the judge had ruled out of bounds. U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton said the prosecutors made a grave mistake and Clemens could not be assured of a fair trial after jurors were shown the evidence in the second day of testimony. Former Major League baseball pitcher Roger Clemens refused to comment to the media after a mistrial was called in a federal court in Washington . Walton scheduled a September 2 hearing to determine whether to hold a new trial. He told jurors he was sorry to have wasted their time and spent so much taxpayer money, only to call off the case. 'There are rules that we play by and those rules are designed to make sure both sides receive a fair trial, ' Walton told the jury, saying such ground rules are critically important when a person's liberty is at stake. 'If this man got convicted, he would go to jail, ' Walton said. He said that because prosecutors broke his rules, 'the ability with Mr. Clemens with this jury to get a fair trial with this jury would be very difficult if not impossible. ' Prosecutors suggested the problem could be fixed with an instruction to the jury to disregard the evidence, but Walton seemed skeptical. He said he could never know what impact the evidence would have during the jury's deliberations  'when we've got a man's liberty at interest. ' But Clemens did stop to autograph a baseball as he left . 'I don't see how I un-ring the bell.' Defense attorney Rusty Hardin patted an unsmiling Clemens on the back as the judge announced his decision. Clemens did not speak to reporters as he left the courtroom and made a telephone call in a private corner of the hallway. Clemens pitched for the Yankees, Red Sox, Blue Jays and Astros during his career. He was one of four pitchers to strike out more than 4,000 batters . Clemens and his lawyers remain under a court gag order and they declined to comment as they left the courthouse. The obstruction count charged Clemens with making 15 false or misleading statements, including his repeated denials he didn't take performance-enhancing drugs during his 24-season career and even whether he attended a 1998 pool party at Toronto Blue Jays teammate Jose Canseco's home in Miami. Clemens, 48, pitched for four teams . during his 24-year career in baseball, including the New York Yankees, . Boston Red Sox, Toronto Blue Jays and Houston Astros. He was one of only four pitchers to strike out more than 4,000 batters. Clemens won seven Cy Young Awards . After . the mistrial Clemens hugged a couple of court workers, shook hands with . the security guards, and signed autographs and a couple of baseballs . for fans. 'I'm not going to say anything,' Clemens . said, sounding frustrated at the mass of reporters and camera crews. He . and his legal team ducked into a nearby restaurant to escape the horde . of news people. Walton interrupted the prosecution's . playing of a video from Clemens' 2008 testimony before Congress and had . the jury removed from the courtroom. Government prosecutors Steve Durham, right, and Daniel Butler left after their team played a video against the judge's orders for jurors to see . Clemens is accused of lying during that . testimony when he said he never used performance-enhancing drugs during . his 24-season career in Major League Baseball. Clemens' lawyer Rusty Hardin was all smiles as he left the courtroom . One of the chief pieces of evidence . against Clemens is testimony from his former teammate and close friend, . Andy Pettitte, who says Clemens told him in 1999 or 2000 that he used . human growth hormone. Clemens has said that Pettitte misheard him. Pettitte also says he told his wife, Laura, about the conversation the same day it happened. Prosecutors had wanted to call Laura Pettitte as a witness to back up her husband's account, but Walton had said he wasn't inclined to have her testify since she didn't speak directly to Clemens. Walton was angered that in the video prosecutors showed the jury, congressman Elijah Cummings referred to Pettitte's conversation with his wife. 'I think that a first-year law student would know that you can't bolster the credibility of one witness with clearly inadmissible evidence, ' Walton said. He said it was the second time that prosecutors had gone against his orders - the other being an incident that happened during opening arguments on Wednesday when assistant U.S. attorney Steven Durham said that Pettite and two other of Clemens' New York teammates, Chuck Knoblauch and Mike Stanton, had used human growth hormone. Walton said in pre-trial hearings that such testimony could lead jurors to consider Clemens guilty by association.",Prosecutors played a video from Clemens' 2008 testimony before Congress .
"By . Colin Fernandez . Last updated at 12:55 AM on 19th August 2011 . Deceit: Dr Ellen MacInnes (pictured) was banned from the roads for drink-driving and used a sample of clean blood from her own patient in Essex to try to con testers that she was all clear . A family doctor has been found guilty of a ‘grave abuse of trust’ for taking blood from a patient and pretending it was her own in an attempt to beat a drink driving ban. Dr Ellen MacInnes, 46, claimed she was checking for an ‘underlying medical condition’ when she took a syringe of the female patient’s blood. But she instead submitted the vial as if it were her blood to medical experts working for licensing authority the DVLA – along with a forged signature from another doctor – in an effort to convince them she was sober after a string of drink driving convictions and a driving ban. A General Medical Council panel heard that the married mother of four had sent the ‘clean’ sample of blood with the forged signature in an unsuccessful attempt to deceive the DVLA and have her licence reinstated. The same day she had already submitted a genuine sample of her blood at the Whitley House Surgery in Chelmsford. Confronted with two samples of blood bearing her name – one ‘clean’ and one containing ‘abnormalities’ – on May 26 last year, staff testing it for the DVLA at the Broomfield Hospital Laboratory became suspicious. She was required to give another sample and admitted her deception during a further blood  test at the former Royal London  Homeopathic Hospital on August 17 last year. But as the doctor left the room, and the nurse washed her hands, Dr MacInnes snatched the blood vial and fled the hospital. In an apparent attempt to see if  her blood would come out clean  if tested, she sent a sample of it for analysis to the Baddow  Village Surgery in Chelmsford – where she once worked – using forms filled out with a former patient’s name. When her sample came back showing ‘abnormalities’ she accessed the surgery’s computer to wipe all traces of it. Dr MacInnes, of Chelmsford, was found guilty of three charges of  dishonesty by the GMC and suspended for 12 months for serious professional misconduct. GMC panel chairman Dr Surendra Kumar told Dr MacInnes: ‘The panel heard you took the blood from Ms A under the pretence it was to be tested to discover if she had an underlying illness. Dr MacInnes was formerly of the Baddow Village Surgery in Essex (pictured) but has been suspended for a year . ‘The panel took a grave view of your abusing her trust in you in such a way.’ He added: ‘Your dishonest actions have the potential to undermine the reputation of the profession as a whole.’ Dr MacInnes admitted the charges of dishonesty, but claimed they were ‘sudden irrational decisions’ – a view the GMC said was ‘not credible’. She was previously suspended by the GMC’s fitness to practise panel in 2009 for a period of six months following a spate of drink-related incidents. The previous misconduct hearing was told her brushes with the law began in 2004 when she was convicted of drink driving and disqualified at North West Essex Magistrates’ Court. In January 2006 a practice nurse smelt alcohol on the doctor’s breath ‘from some feet away’ while  she was fitting a contraceptive coil. She was fired later the same month after she appeared drunk and smelling of alcohol at a surgery meeting. A further drink driving conviction followed in 2007.","Suspended by the GMC in 2004, 2009 and in 2011 for working or driving under the influence of alcohol ."

In 1981, Bucks Fizz could not have been happier as they triumphed in the Eurovision Song Contest with Making Your Mind Up and their iconic skirt-ripping routine. Fast forward 30 years and relations between the four members are decidedly colder. Yesterday three of them, Cheryl Baker, Mike Nolan and Jay Aston, sat in the austere surroundings  of a hearings room at the Intellectual Property Office in London, which rules on copyright and trademark issues. Scroll down for video . Legal battle: From left, Cheryl Baker , Mike Nolan and Jay Aston are fighting for the use of the Bucks Fizz name . Decade-long battle: Cheryl Baker, Mike Nolan and Jay Aston arrive at the Trade Mark Registry in London. They currently perform under the name The Original Bucks Fizz . It is a far cry from the glitzy world of Top Of The Pops they once inhabited. They were there for a legal battle with the fourth member of the original line-up, Bobby G, over the right to use the name. The two camps are no longer on . speaking terms. Yesterday Bobby G appeared via video link from 150 miles . away in Newport, South Wales, as it was closer to his Devon home. Line-up: Three of the original Bucks Fizz, Cheryl Baker, Mike Nolan and Jay Aston, arrive at the Trademark Registry offices. The case will be decided towards the end of next month . Bobby G – real name Robert Gubby – . has continued to perform under the name Bucks Fizz with new members ever . since the last of the other originals left 14 years ago. Determined: Bobby G, real name Robert Gubby, believes he has the right to the Bucks Fizz trademark and is fighting his former bandmates . His wife Heidi Manton, who has been . in the group for 18 years, owns the trademark. Singers Tammy Choat and . Paul Fordham complete the line-up. But Cheryl, 57, Mike, 56, and Jay, . 49, who have been reunited as a trio since 2009, want to call themselves . The Original Bucks Fizz and trademark that name. Bobby G, 53, objected, saying it infringed his trademark, so Cheryl, Mike and Jay are now asking for it to be revoked. Yesterday the trio’s solicitor Dean Dunham said the use of the name Bucks Fizz by Bobby G ‘misleads’ the public. The Original Bucks Fizz’s manager . David Hahn has received emails and phone calls from disappointed fans . who had booked tickets for Bobby G’s band expecting to see the original . members, the hearing was told. Some fans are said to have asked ‘Where’s . Cheryl?’ when they bought tickets to see Bobby G’s group. Mr Dunham also gave examples of adverts for Bobby G’s act which used a photo of the original band. He said: ‘The public perception of the words Bucks Fizz is simply the band that consisted of my three clients as well.’ The name Bucks Fizz was originally registered by the Big Note Music, the company the band was first signed to. In 1990 the trademark expired. Bobby G’s side registered it in 2001 after a legal dispute with Mike Nolan. Mr Dunham said Mr Nolan signed an . agreement not to contest the registration but at the time had not fully . recovered from injuries he suffered in a 1984 coach crash which left him . in a coma. Bobby G claims only his  version of the group has a ‘direct connection’ to the original, as it had been operating continuously. Eurovision success: Mike Nolan, Jay Aston, Cheryl Baker and Bobby G after winning the song contest in 1981 . The other version: Bobby G with Tammy, Heidi and Paul . Speaking after the hearing Cheryl said she had not seen Bobby G for five years. She added: ‘It’s really sad that it’s come to this. ‘We do proper theatre shows and we’re on TV.

"By . Louise Boyle . Last updated at 2:08 PM on 17th August 2011 . Fresh evidence has emerged that Rebekah Brooks has not fully cut ties with News International, after it was alleged that she will be hanging on to her chauffeur-driven car, paid for by the company. It adds weight to claims that Mrs Brooks is being lined up for a senior role in Rupert Murdoch's empire once the phone-hacking scandal has died down. The former News International chief executive, who was also News of the World editor, resigned on July 15 following claims that journalists at the Sunday tabloid hacked into murdered teenager Milly Dowler's voicemail while she was in charge. Rebekah Brooks has allegedly been told by Rupert Murdoch to travel until the scandal quietens down and then he will find her another role . A former colleague told the Daily Telegraph: 'Brooks has been allowed to keep her chauffeur-driven car for two years.' A News International spokesman was unable to comment on the allegations today. Representatives for 43-year-old Mrs Brooks added: 'We are unable to comment on the contractual arrangements for the conclusion of Rebekah’s employment at News International.' It comes as News International faced fresh accusations yesterday that  phone-hacking was ‘widely discussed’ at the News Of The World and was condoned by former editor Andy Coulson. A letter, penned by disgraced royal correspondent Clive Goodman, said hacking was carried out by other members of staff and ‘with the full knowledge and support’ of the paper’s senior managers. It was written by Goodman to parent company News . International’s head of human resources four years ago, but its . existence was made public only yesterday by a . committee of MPs. Questions: Former editors of News Of the World Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks. Further allegations of phone hacking have emerged at the now-defunct tabloid . It marks a dramatic escalation of the scandal which has already led to the closure of the paper. After repeated calls for her resignation, Mrs Brooks finally handed in her notice last month. Mrs Brooks has firmly denied any knowledge and branded the actions of the journalists, who allegedly hacked into thousands of people's phones, as 'unthinkable'. In an internal email to staff telling them that she was standing down, she wrote: 'I feel a deep sense of responsibility for the people we have hurt. 'I now need to concentrate on correcting the distortions and rebutting the allegations about my record as a journalist.' Rumours have also appeared on the internet suggesting the media tycoon has advised Mrs Brooks to 'travel the world' until the hacking and bribery scandal quietens down and then he'll find her another role. Hacked: Mrs Brooks insists she was unaware that the newspaper had listened to the voicemails of Milly Dowler, pictured . The Daily Telegraph had earlier reported a . source claimed: 'My understanding is that Rupert has . told her to travel the world on him for a year and then he will find a . job for her when the scandal has died down.'

"By . Hugo Duncan . Last updated at 3:35 AM on 19th August 2011 . The stock market suffered its biggest collapse in three years yesterday as the global economy plunged deeper into crisis, wiping billions off the value of Britain's leading companies. Every blue-chip firm listed in London fell in the worst single day of trading since the dark days of 2008 when investment bank Lehman Brothers imploded. As analysts spoke of 'a tidal wave of selling', the FTSE 100 index fell 239.37 points to 5092.23 – a drop in value of £62.3billion. Plummeting: The FTSE crashed by 5 per cent today against a backdrop of the euro zone crisis and damaging U.S. unemployment figures . Elsewhere, the German stock market . fell 5.8 per cent, Paris dropped 5.5 per cent and the Dow Jones . Industrial  Average dropped 3.9 per cent in  New York. The Lehman debacle tipped the global . economy into recession – and fears are mounting that the developed world . is on the brink of another devastating downturn. One reason for the panic was the . revelation that a lender in the eurozone was forced to go cap in hand to . the European Central Bank for £300million in emergency funding. Analysts said the 'worrying' development showed banks are too nervous to lend to each other – just as . they were at the height of the financial crisis. Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley . warned yesterday that the United States and the eurozone are 'hovering . dangerously close to recession'. Despair may have engulfed the markets, but one British entrepreneur found himself £300million richer yesterday. Dr Mike Lynch, the son of an Essex fireman, saw his software firm Autonomy sold to U.S. giant Hewlett-Packard for £7billion. The deal values his 8.1 per cent stake in the FTSE 100 firm at £567million. It was worth just under £284million before the takeover bid was announced. It is an extraordinary success for Dr Lynch, who began work on the firm when he was writing his post-doctoral thesis at Cambridge University on 18th century theologian Thomas Bayes, who tried to prove the existence of God through mathematics. Autonomy now has more than 16,000 clients worldwide including Nasa, Procter & Gamble, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The technology Dr Lynch developed allows computers to analyse data across a range of media, making it useful for tracking down fraud or even searching for terrorists. Investors are also increasingly . concerned about the health of the banking system in Europe as the . debt-crisis crippling the single currency bloc rumbles on. Officials at the Bank of England said the exaggerated sense of fear in the markets may be holding back the recovery. The man who became a hate figure to . many in Britain for designing the modern European Union yesterday . admitted that it was now 'on the edge of the precipice'. Jacques Delors, 86, a federalist . Frenchman, used his time as European Commission chief in the 1980s to . expand its power over national governments and pave the way for the . single European currency. Will Hedden, at IG Index in London, said: 'Panic selling accelerated in the biggest losing day yet of this summer sell-off. 'The fear factor has reached boiling . point. Banking stocks have been decimated across Europe, with . indiscriminate selling even in banks that maintain that their exposure . to the crisis is slim. 'No sector is surviving this tidal wave of selling.' Damaging confidence: Analysts say German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy's plans to bail out debt-ridden eurozone members would disproportionately hit the UK . The financial markets have been rocked . by a crisis of leadership in recent weeks as politicians on both sides . of the Atlantic failed to come up with policies to tackle debts and . promote growth. The FTSE 100 index has lost 1,000 points, or £260billion of its value, since its 2011 peak in February. Dark days: Today's jobless figures have done nothing for Barack Obama's domestic standing . The majority of the slump has taken place this month in one of the most bruising episodes in stock market history. It has hit the value of retirement . pots for millions and left investors across the country nursing heavy . losses. UK bank shares were the worst hit in London yesterday with . taxpayer-supported Royal Bank of Scotland down 11.3 per cent and Lloyds . Banking Group down 9.3 per cent. The shares are worth less than half . what they were when the Government bailed the banks out – meaning UK . taxpayers are sitting on losses of £34.5billion in the two companies. The European banking sector has lost . 30 per cent of its value this year. French banks were back in the firing . line yesterday with Societe Generale down 11.6 per cent. It came after . the ECB provided more than £300million of emergency funds to an unnamed . lender – the first such loan since February. 'This shows that the situation has escalated,' said Citigroup analyst Juergen Michels. Morgan Stanley cut its global growth . forecasts for this year from 4.2 per cent to 3.9 per cent and for 2012 . from 4.5 per cent to 3.8 per cent. 'The path now looks even more bumpy, . below-par and brittle than previously thought,' said Joachim Fels, who . co-heads Morgan Stanley's global economic team. He said the main reason for the . downturn was the failure of politicians and regulators in Washington and . Europe to tackle the sovereign debt crisis crippling the world economy. Hundreds of thousands of families in . the UK are over-indebted and 'vulnerable' if financial conditions get . worse, a senior Bank of England director said last night. Andrew Haldane, the Bank's executive . director in charge of ensuring financial stability, said one in 14 . British households is in negative equity. ANALYSIS by RUTH SUTHERLAND, Associate City Editor . 'The only thing we have to fear is fear itself': President Franklin D. Roosevelt signing the Banking Bill at the White House in 1933 . During his inaugural address in 1933, newly elected U.S. President . Franklin D. Roosevelt famously told the American people: 'The only thing . we have to fear is fear itself.' Today, the world is clouded with economic and political uncertainty just . as it was in the dark days following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and . the Great Depression. As people are forced to watch impotently as stock markets lurch once . again into turmoil, wiping billions of pounds off the value of their . savings and pensions, it is understandable that many are riven with . anxiety. Fear is stalking the trading floors and it is contagious, casting an ominous shadow over all of our lives. But the question is whether the extreme reactions we have seen on the stock markets over the past few weeks are justified. As Andrew Haldane, a senior director at the Bank of England, pointed out yesterday, the fear factor is rampant on the markets. Not all of it is rational, and these waves of terror engulfing the stock exchanges are actually making matters worse. During the boom, traders were swept along by a wave of euphoria and . loaded themselves with risks that proved to be wildly over-optimistic. Haldane now believes the markets may have switched to the opposite pole, . with traders abnormally reluctant to take  risks because the . psychological scarring from the losses of the last meltdown is still . fresh and painful. That exaggerated fear of risk – equally irrational as the mindless . exuberance of the boom years – is in itself a brake on economic . recovery. When stock markets plunge, companies become reluctant to expand or . invest. Consumers cut down on their spending and stay out of the shops. Instead of applying our energy to creating growth, building new . businesses and embarking on new ventures, firms and individuals retreat . into a paralysing state of gloom and timidity. With markets in the paranoid state of the past few weeks, even minor or . quite predictable pieces of news can produce enormous swings on the . trading screens. No-one should underestimate the power of herd-behaviour . on the markets, which are driven by the opposing forces of greed and . fear. Driven by greed and fear: A man walks past the London Stock Exchange in the City of London. A Cambridge study found hormone levels significantly affected traders' behaviour . Cambridge University researchers even found in a study of saliva from . City workers that hormonal activity among young male traders magnified . the booms and busts. They discovered that when dealers hit a winning streak their . testosterone levels soared, making them overconfident and intoxicated . with their own success. But when markets dipped, the researchers saw a rise in the stress . hormone cortisol, which made the dealers shy of risk and magnified the . downward slide in markets. But there are some very good reasons to be fearful. The banking crisis . that caused the market meltdown in 2008 has transformed itself into a . sovereign debt crisis. Question marks now hover over the indebtedness not only of smaller . nations such as Greece and Portugal, but even the United States, whose . Treasury bonds were once considered impregnable. Many households, banks and countries remain dangerously mired under the weight of their own foolish borrowings. Keep calm and carry on: A stock market trader grips his forehead as shares tumble in this picture from the 2008 crash. Dealers can and do wipe millions from the value of shares as the mood takes them . But panic does not help. We should not allow the economic recovery in . this country to be held hostage to hysteria in the dealing rooms. The dealers can and do wipe billions of pounds off share values as the . mood takes them – often for the points slashed from the FTSE 100 to be . restored the next day. But whatever their frenzy leads them to do, most of the real assets that . are vital to our economy remain unaffected. Our homes, offices and . factories are still standing; we still have our brainpower and most of . all our resilience. To use another catchphrase from the 1930s, when markets succumb to a bout of madness, we need to 'Keep Calm and Carry On.","Analysts tell of markets hit by a 'tidal wave of selling'

But that hasn’t put Trina Grimes Scott, 32, off former Louisiana governor Edwin Edwards, 83, as she has agreed to accept his hand in marriage. Mr Edwards attended his first public event on Tuesday since completing his jail sentence, with his beautiful blonde fiancé, to the awe of onlookers. Together: Trina Grimes Scott, 32, left, is engaged to former Louisiana governor Edwin Edwards, 83, who has just finished an eight-year jail term . He was befriended by Miss Scott during an eight-year prison sentence followed by six months in home confinement, which he finished this month. They became engaged despite the 51-year age gap, but he said at the awards dinner this week: ‘A man is only as old as the woman he feels.’ Mr Edwards is a twice-divorced great-grandfather who served 16 years as Louisiana governor and has been with Miss Scott for around a year. He was speaking on Tuesday night at the Foundation for Historical Louisiana awards dinner in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Appearance: Mr Edwards attended his first public event since completing his sentence with his beautiful blonde fiancé Miss Scott, at an awards dinner . He was married to Elaine for 40 years before a 1989 divorce and later married Candy in 1994 before they divorced when he was in jail in 2004. Miss Scott wrote on Facebook that her new fiancé is ‘such a pleasure to take care of’, reported The Times-Picayune last month. Tuesday marked his first public appearance since his sentence for bribery and extortion related to the award of state casino gambling licenses. ‘I really feel like I came out of prison more popular than I went in,’ he said. Not so happy: Mr Edwards arrives at the Ecumenical House, a halfway house, to begin serving the remainder of his sentence in January 2011 . ‘I think in some part because people realise that an injustice occurred and that I handled it like a man. I took it. I survived. I said that I would walk out, and I did.’ ‘I really feel like I came out of prison more popular than I went in' Edwin Edwards . He was at the event where his biographer, Leo Honeycutt, and others were being honoured for their work in historic preservation. Shaun Sanghani, a TV producer who is in discussions with Edwards about starting a new reality show, was also there. ‘I've never seen a reality show, but I hear about them,’ Mr Edwards said. ‘I want to assure everyone that if we have one there will be nothing in it that's embarrassing to my state or to me or my family.’","Edwin Edwards, 83, is twice-divorced great-grandfather .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:32 AM on 15th July 2011 . An obsessed TV producer who hounded a former classmate for eight years was branded 'the stalker who wouldn't stop stalking'. Elliot Fogel, a freelance producer for Sky Sports news, has been convicted of breaching a restraining order for the third time. He was jailed for four months last year for a previous breach. He Googled therapist Claire Waxman more than 40,000 times in one year, broke into his victim's car and made hundreds of late-night phone calls to her home. Elliot Fogel and Claire Waxman leaving Wood Green Crown Court. He was jailed last year for stalking her . Fogel, 36, of Edgware, . north-west London, first developed an unhealthy obsession with Mrs . Waxman while they were students at a college in St Albans, . Hertfordshire. After repeatedly telling him to leave . her alone, she heard nothing more until she received a dinner . invitation from him ten years later - which she declined. A few months later, in December 2003, . Fogel was spotted jogging on the spot outside Mrs Waxman's home and began spending more and more time around her workplace. After his arrest, a police search of . his computer revealed he had Mrs Waxman's wedding photographs and a . Google Earth aerial map of her home. He had also paid for background . searches to be carried out on both her husband, Marc, and her father, and had . posed as a prospective parent at the nursery her daughter attended. Claire Waxman was stalked for 8 years by Elliot Fogel . A restraining order was put on him in . 2006, which he breached the following year. He was jailed for sixteen . weeks in January last year for a further breach, but he went on to . breach it again and has now appeared before a court for the fourth time. The original order banned him from . going to her home address, her parents' address or within a mile of her . work after she told the court she felt like a 'sitting duck'. She said she suffered a miscarriage, developed an eating disorder and had to move . home five times as a result of her ordeal. On February 1 this year Fogel . entered the exclusion zone again on the same day a court dismissed a . civil case brought by the stalker against his victim, who he claimed had . waged a Facebook 'hate campaign' against him. Claire Waxman lives in Mill Hill, north London, with her husband and daughter . Giving evidence from behind a screen . at Wood Green Crown Court, Mrs Waxman said she left her office on . Station Parade, Willesden, and walked to her car parked in Blenheim . Gardens nearby on her way to pick up her son from nursery - a routine . she followed the same time most days. The 36-year old said: 'Halfway down I . felt a car slowly driving next to me. I was on the phone to my husband . to tell him about the results of the case and felt the car next to me. 'I walked over and was shocked. I . could see Mr Fogel looking at me. I recognised his car and I recognised . him. He was right by the kerb and I was on the pavement right next to . him. 'I shouted to my husband, ""I have to . go"", because I wanted to take a picture of him on my phone. But he saw . me and drove off. I rang staff at my work because I was shaking. 'It was slow enough for him to stop and look at me. He gave me a very strange smirk.' Fogel claimed that while he was aware . he was going through the exclusion zone, it was the easiest route for . him to reach Willesden Green County Court, where the legal proceedings . were taking place, and it was a chance encounter. Nevertheless, Julie Whitby, prosecuting, said . it was simply an attempt to force Mrs Waxman . to court so he could see her. Speaking when Fogel was originally jailed for the breach she said: 'This is a case of the . stalker who will not stop stalking. This is a man who has a history of . harassing Claire Waxman. He is an intelligent young man who knows what . he is up to. 'If you have an obsession with someone, bringing them to court is one way of seeing them, of coming into contact with them. 'It is another form of stalking. Make . sure she is there and have contact with her. She thought there was a . restraining order in place to protect her. 'We have a young man who is without . regard for the order and with every intention of keeping up his campaign . of harassment against Claire Waxman. It is a case of ""chip, chip . chip"".'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:46 PM on 18th August 2011 . There must be consistency in sentencing for those found guilty of riot-related crimes, the country's former top prosecutor said today. Youths who are found guilty of a crime should receive similar sentences to those found guilty of the same offence, otherwise It is 'just not justice'. Lord Macdonald, the former director of public prosecutions in England and Wales, urged judges to avoid the 'moral panic' elsewhere in society when sentencing those involved in the riots and looting. The statement came after the news a university student who stole three or four bottles of alcohol from a Tesco store during the . riots was handed a 16 month jail term. Rioting: Sentences for similar offences shouldn't be wildly different . Lord Macdonald called on the Sentencing Council, who have not met since the riots, to issue new guideline 'as soon as it can feasibly do so'. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: 'I think it's important that the courts retain their objectivity, remain dispassionate and don't get swept up in any sort of moral panic that might be existing elsewhere in civil society. 'We shouldn't be finding ourselves in a situation where people are receiving wildly different sentences for offences that seem on the facts to be relatively similar. I mean that's just not justice.' He added that within the riots and looting there was a range of offences being committed. He explained that someone who was not . at the scene and received a small amount of low value property later . was guilty of a far less serious offence than someone who smashed a shop . window, stole property and then set the place alight. He said: 'I think those differences need to be clearly reflected in sentencing,' Lord . Macdonald added that there was the risk of a 'collective loss of . proportion', saying that some sentences look 'very severe' and 'appear . out of kilter with each other'. There has been criticism over the sentencing of Jordan Blackshaw, 20, and Perry Sutcliffe-Keenan, 22, who were both jailed for for creating riot Facebook pages . A 16-year-old boy from west London, accused of murdering a pensioner during the riots in the capital, has been refused bail. The boy appeared by videolink for a half-hour hearing at the Old Bailey so his counsel Abdullah Al-Yunusi could apply for bail. But Judge Anthony Morris refused the application and remanded him in custody to a hearing at the same court on September 9 . The youth, from Hounslow, west London, is also charged with violent disorder and four counts of burglary - relating to looting at a William Hill bookmakers, a Tesco Express, a Blockbusters video shop and a Fatboys restaurant. He appeared at Croydon Magistrates' Court earlier this week with his mother, who was also remanded in custody accused of perverting justice by disposing of the boy's clothing . A man who looted a Krispy Kreme doughnut shop during the riots has been remanded in custody. Thomas Downey, 48, was caught by riot police carrying a box of the snacks during the disturbances in Manchester, the court heard . Downey, of no fixed address, had been released from Strangeways prison . at 7pm before traveling to the town centre for an Alcoholics' Anonymous . meeting. But by 1.30am, Manchester Crown court heard, he was drunk after drinking a bottle of sherry. In mitigation, Zoe Nield told the court Downey left prison with just £4 in his pocket. She said: 'He can't recall the events because he was drunk but he had expressed remorse.' Downey is held in custody for sentencing on Thursday. The pair were found guilty of . inciting riots, which never actually happened,  and both received . lengthy sentences of fours years. The . judge justified the sentences saying the pair, who pleaded guilty and . had no prior convictions, could have caused panic in their home towns. Lord Macdonald said new guidelines should be put in place to address sentencing for the riots. He . said: ''It would be a very good idea if the Sentencing Council could . meet and issue some guidelines for sentencing in this area,' 'The whole point of guidelines is to achieve consistency and fairness. 'I think the council should issue guidelines as soon as it can feasibly do so.' The Sentencing Council said it has not been asked by the Government to amend existing guidance to deal with future unrest. Adding: . 'Were we to receive such a request, it would be considered by the . council at its next meeting in line with its normal processes.'

He dropped the bottles when police arrived at the scene . Judge Robert Atherton told McGrath, . who pleaded guilty to burglary at an earlier hearing: 'You followed the . example of others by squeezing under the shutter and seeing what you . could steal.'

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 12:01 AM on 19th August 2011 . Pope Benedict has denounced economic structures that put profits ahead of people at the start of a trip to recession-hit Spain where the costs of the pontiff's visit have sparked violent protests. 'The economy cannot be measured by the maximum profit but by the common good,' Benedict told journalists on the plane taking him to Madrid for a four-day trip centered around the Roman Catholic Church's World Youth Day festivities. 'The economy cannot function only with mercantile self-regulation but needs an ethical reason in order to work for man,' he said. Scroll down for the Pope's full schedule in Madrid and video... Popular figure: The Pope is swamped by thousands of supporters as the entourage winds its way through central Madrid . The Pope arrived in Madrid to jubilant scenes yesterday morning at the start of a four-day trip to the Spanish capital. But the trip  was not without controversy - protesters marched on the city's central Sol Plaza to voice . their concerns about the 50million euro price tag for the visit. The Spanish economy is struggling to . exit a recession which has left one in five unemployed, of which a large . proportion are young people. Disaffection over government spending cuts, a sickly economy and a lack . of job prospects has spawned a protest movement named Los Indignados . (Indignant Ones) whose young supporters occupied Madrid's Puerta del Sol . square in May. Warm welcome: Pope Benedict, accompanied by Madrid's Archbishop, Antonio Rouco Varela acknowledges the crowds . Centre of attention: While security personnel keep on alert around the Popemobile, enthusiastic supporters take photographs of the religious leader . The costs of 84-year-old Benedict's visit to Spain at a time of economic . hardship has reignited protests by Los Indignados and others, including . gay and lesbian groups, and demonstrations turned violent on Wednesday . night. Eight people were hurt and eight were arrested as a result of clashes . between pilgrims and protesters, police and emergency services . said. But a protest in Puerta del Sol against the police action last night . drew barely 200 people and failed to dampen the enthusiasm of the . thousands of pilgrims gathered in nearby Cibeles square.

Benedict's arrival in Cibeles after receiving the keys to the city from . Madrid's mayor. Benedict expressed his solidarity and support for young people faced . with an uncertain jobs outlook, but warned of the challenges of . consumerism and hedonism and the 'widespread trivialisation of . sexuality' in a speech on his arrival at Madrid's Barajas airport . yesterday morning. He reinforced his message later to the young pilgrims in Cibeles square, . criticising people who 'create their own gods, believe they need no . roots or foundations...letting themselves be led by the whim of each . moment'. Screaming: These pilgrims were very vocal in showing their support for the Pope as he passed them in central Madrid . Cheers: The Pope has so far received a warm welcome everywhere he has been in Madrid, despite protests against his visit descending into violence last night .

The bags include a map of Madrid, a bottle of non-alcoholic beer, their pilgrim pass, a guide, a cross and a fan. He said: 'We interpret this as a very special distinction for our country.' He added that there was a 'crisis of . values' and that these were not easy times for youngsters. 'It is time . for us to double our efforts,' he added. Pope . Benedict replied, in clear Spanish, by giving his thanks to the King . and Queen, to the authorities and the pilgrims who had congregated at . the airport. He praised the hospitality of the people of Madrid, and the work of the volunteers of the World Youth Day. The 84-year-old also said that youngsters faced many challenges, including corruption and consumerism.

Farewell: Pope Benedict XVI was welcomed by Italian Government undersecretary Gianni Letta before boarding an plane to Madrid . Wednesday night's violence came on the same day that police arrested a 24-year-old chemistry student suspected of planning a gas attack against the protesters opposing the visit. A statement from officers said Jose Perez Bautista, of Puebla, Mexico, boasted online how he planned to attack anti-Pope protesters with 'suffocating gases' and other chemicals. He had been working as a volunteer for the visit and was arrested at a convention centre where the hundreds of thousands of pilgrims coming to town for the papal visit are supposed to pick up their accreditation. Police searched his apartment in the wealthy Salamanca district of Madrid and seized an external hard-drive and two notebooks with chemical equations that had nothing to do with his studies.

Archaeologists found a 13ft-wide timber structure complete with stabilising posts running for 1,600ft (500m) across wetland near the River Waveney at Geldeston. The wood is in such good condition that it almost looks modern, according to experts, who believe that the structure could be the work of the Iceni tribe. Scroll down for video . Road to nowhere? University of Birmingham researchers investigate the Iron Age structure . Wood you believe it? The 2,000-year-old structure was very well preserved . It's thought that the road would have helped traders move across the wetlands of Norfolk . Wood often disintegrates over time, but this structure was found buried in peat, which helped to preserve it. Kristina Krawiec, a University of Birmingham archaeologist who was on the dig team, told the BBC: ‘Instead of getting post holes, we're getting the posts that would have gone in them. We're understanding more about the technology and skills that went into these sort of things.’ The archaeologists at the excavation, which took place in June, even found tool marks in the wood, which is incredibly rare. The road was dated using . dendrochronology – otherwise known as tree-ring dating - where ring . patterns on wood are analysed to determine its age. Water find: The road was excavated near the River Waveney in Norfolk . A more thorough test will be carried out, but if it does originate from 75BC, then the structure pre-dates the Roman invasion by 100 years. The Iceni ruled over most of the area now known as Norfolk between 100BC to around 100 AD, when, despite their best efforts, they were defeated by the invading legions. Their road would not only have facilitated movement around the area’s soggy land, but would have been used to mark territory and demonstrate their power, as it would have looked very impressive to anyone passing through the area. John Davies, chief curator at Norwich Castle Museum, explained to the BBC that some of the tools he has on display may have been used to make the road. He said: ‘This particular track way is very interesting to us because we have tools... which may actually tie in with some of the tool marks and methods of construction we are turning up in the excavation.’ Watch Digging For Britain, which airs on BBC2 in September, to find out more about the road.","Experts believe road was made by the Iceni tribe .

Google chief executive Larry Page said in a statement: 'Motorola Mobility's total commitment to Android has created a natural . fit for our two companies. 'Together, we will create amazing user experiences that supercharge the . entire Android ecosystem for the benefit of consumers, partners and . developers.' Analysts believe Google's purchase is a reinforcement strategy in the face of seemingly unstoppable competition from Apple's iPhone. Jason Jenkins, editor of technology website CNET UK, . said: 'Many of the main phone manufacturers are currently busy suing . each other, with each claiming that the other has ripped off their ideas . in some way. Motorola Mobility has remade itself as a maker of smartphones based on Google's Android software . 'As the maker of the Android operating system that powers millions of phones worldwide, Google faces the possibility that its efforts to grab more of the smartphone sector will be hampered by these lawsuits. 'This purchase, and the patents that come with it, helps shore up its position in its war against Apple's iPhone.' He added: 'One of the oddities of today's announcement is that it places Google in direct competition with the companies it partners with - HTC, Samsung and the like - as it will now effectively be making not only the software that powers mobile phones, but the hardware too. 'Google has been quick to put out statements from Sony Ericsson, LG and HTC that welcome the move, but I can't help but wonder how comfortable they really are with this deal.' The acquisition has the approval of both companies' boards and is . expected to close by the end of this year or early 2012. It dwarfs . Google's previous biggest deal, the 2008 purchase of DoubleClick for . $3.2billion (£2billion). In premarket trading, shares of Motorola Mobility soared 60 per cent, or . $14.72 (£9.01), to $39.19 (£24.00).

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 1:38 PM on 18th August 2011 . Gunman Anders Breivik had a second larger bomb that was ready to be deployed at his farm, a Norwegian TV channel has reported . Norwegian gunman Anders Breivik had prepared a second bomb that was bigger than the one which detonated in Oslo killing eight people. Public broadcaster NRK reported yesterday that military sources had discovered a 3,300lb device at his farm around 85 miles north of the city. By comparison, the bomb which went off in the capital weighted 2,095lbs according to estimates. Despite the claims, the Norwegian police denied that they had found any device. Using Twiter, spokesman Roar Hanssen said: 'A lot of modified fertiliser was found at the farm . 'However that is just one of many bomb components. Important elements were missing and it still needed a lot of work before that became a bomb able to be deployed.' The reports of the second bomb came as a judge denied a request by the extremsist to wear formal tailcoat for his appearance on Friday. Judge Hugo Abelseth called the suggestion 'disturbing' as he also closed the court for Breivik's appearance. He said: 'In light of the extreme seriousness of the case, such an attire could be disturbing, insulting and provocative.' Speaking after the refusal, Breivik's lawyer Geir Lippestead explained that the killer had wanted to wear the coat as he wanted to show his respect for the judicial process. But Judge Abelseth stressed that 'ordinary, proper clothing is enough to show that he takes the judicial process seriously.' Friday's hearing will determine if Brievik will remain in solitary confinement after the first four-week period has passed. Devastation: The bomb that killed eight in Oslo weighed 2,095lbs experts have estimated, with the reports the device at Breivik's farm weighed more than 3,000lbs . The gunman claimed on Tuesday that he called police in the middle of his bloody rampage to surrender after phoning police and telling them 'mission accomplished'. The 32-year-old - who eventually murdered 69 people - spoke to a control worker. The call ended - inexplicably, though Breivik claims he was ignored - and he was left expecting a call back. However, officers couldn't get in touch with him again, it is claimed. He went on to kill another 20 people on the island of Utoya after attempting to hand himself in. Far-right extremist Breivik was apparently promised a call back after getting a 'garbled' response. Reconstruction: The 32-year-old, in a bulletproof vest, pretends to hold a gun as Norwegian officers recreate what happened as Breivik went on the rampage . By the time officers did try and ring him back the phone was switched off, the Sun reported. He apparently told them: 'Mission accomplished and I will surrender to the Delta force.' The rampage went on for two-hours in total as Breivik killed 69 and injured dozens more after a bomb had been detonated in the centre of Oslo which killed another eight people. He was eventually arrested after he had made a second call to officers. On the police log of the call it said: 'A Norwegian-speaking man says that he will surrender to police'. He . first got through to the control room at 17.58 before ringing again at . 18.26 shortly before he was arrested following his rampage on July 22. Although he got through to police twice, Breivik has told police that he tried to ring at least ten times.

"Armstrong's mother wants to bury son in Texas . Friend claims Armstrong 'begged' for a full bottle of Xanax three days before death . Coroner confirms cause of death was suicide by hanging . Injuries caused by hanging will prevent family from having an open casket at the funeral . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:22 AM on 18th August 2011 . Taylor Armstrong is taking charge of the memorial service arrangements for her estranged husband Russell, according to reports. The reality star has begun making preparations for the service, thought to be next week. Despite the couple being embroiled in a bitter divorce at the time of Russell's death, Taylor is determined to handle all the arrangements. Determined: Taylor Armstrong has taken charge of planning Russell Armstrong's memorial service, according to reports . According to Radar Online, Russell's mother wishes for her son to be buried in Texas, but has yet to work out the details with his estranged wife. A fried of the couple, Russ McCullough, has told TMZ that Russell 'begged' him for a bottle of Xanax days before his death. McCullough, who appeared in episodes of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, alleges that he gave one pill to his friend after a particularly downcast dinner in which Russell could not afford to pay his bill. According to McCullough, Russell was . 'distraught' over his portrayal on the reality series and said 'this is . as bad as it gets,' he told TMZ. McCullough refused to provide the bottle of Xanax as he feared his friends may abuse the drug, the website claims. Estranged: Despite being embroiled in a bitter divorce before Russell's suicide, the reality star is making preparations for the service . Today new pictures emerged showing Taylor with a mysterious cut above her eye, just four days before Russell's apparent suicide. The 40-year-old displayed the wound outside her Beverly Hills home last week as she carried boxes to her car. In an interview last month, Taylor claimed she had been verbally and physically abused by her estranged husband Russell during their six year marriage. However, friends of Taylor insist . the cut was not inflicted by her estranged husband, and was inflicted . while she was 'playing a game of football.' Taylor . filed for divorce last month, alleging in an interview with People . magazine that she and Russell, often had 'explosive arguments' in which . he would 'curse and call her names. ' Mysterious: Taylor Armstrong was pictured with a cut above her eye in Beverly Hills last week . The magazine reported that there were times the 'arguments escalated into physical violence, which included grabbing her, throwing objects, shoving her and pulling her hair.' Russell also acknowledged problems when questioned by the magazine. 'Did I push her? Yes, maybe things . happened in the heat of the moment, but it was during a time in our . lives that was not characteristic of who we were,' he said. 'This show . has literally pushed us to the limit.' The news comes as it was confirmed by the LA County Coroner that the cause of Russell's death was suicide by hanging. His body was found on Monday at a house in Mulholland Drive. Split: Taylor had filed for divorce last month after alleging verbal and physical abuse at the hands of her late husband . Russell, who was aged 47 at the time of his death, has a record of domestic troubles. Back in 1998, he received a conviction for battery in a domestic abuse case involving his then wife, Barbara Armstrong, according to Entertainment Tonight. Barbara . was granted a protective order against Russell and he was required to . attend a one-year anger management program, as well as weekly Alcoholics . Anonymous meetings as part of his sentence. Meanwhile, it has been alleged today that secrets about Russell's sexuality were about to be revealed, Radar reports. According to sources close to the 47-year-old businessman, he was bisexual and worried that a tell-all book was going to out him. Fatherless: Russell is survived by his daughter Kennedy, who is sure to be devastated at the news . An insider alleges to Radar: 'About . six months ago Taylor confided in a close friend that she'd found . history for a gay website called Adam4Adam.com on Russell's laptop. 'He . was also spending a lot of time at the gym, but his body wasn't . changing, which she claims led her to believe he was meeting with men . he'd met off the website and not spending time working out as he . claimed,' the source added. The insider said the book went into 'great detail' about Russell's bedroom preferences. 'Not only was it going to come out that Russell was bisexual, but . there were people on the record that were going to talk about the kind . of sex he liked,' the source alleged to Radar. 'He was into S&M type stuff; . choking, and slapping.' In the wake of the tragedy, U.S. network Bravo are said to be considering whether to air the new series . of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills as planned on September 5. Executives at the network are waiting 'at least 24 hours' before deciding. 'No decisions have been made as of yet,' a Bravo source told The New York Daily News. Plush: The house on Mulholland Drive, Los Angeles where Russell Armstrong was found hanged . A promo was released last month for the upcoming season, featuring Taylor, . Camille Grammer, Kyle and Kim Richards, Lisa Vanderpump and Adrienne . Maloof. In the preview, Taylor was shown crying over the demise of her marriage to . Russell, with whom she has a five-year-old daughter, Kennedy. The newspaper reports that the couple allowed cameras to follow them as they attended couple's counselling. The network released a statement expressing their condolences, following the news of Russell's death. 'All of us at Bravo are deeply saddened by this tragic news. Our sympathy and thoughts are with the . Armstrong family at this difficult time.' However, there are reports today that Russell's family are considering taking legal action against Bravo. 'Bravo is at fault and somebody needs to pay,' Russell’s step brother Wade Jackson told RadarOnline. 'Russell’s whole family was very close and they’re considering suing Bravo.' Action: Russell's family are said to be considering suing Bravo, who air the Real Housewives franchise . Jackson also criticised Taylor for getting Russell involved in the show. 'In his line of business he didn’t . want to be a public person on the show, but Taylor pushed him into it,' he claimed. 'He was really upset about the whole thing and told everyone . in the family that he didn’t want to be on the show.' Taylor yesterday released a statement through her representative saying she is 'devastated by the tragic events. 'She requests privacy at this time so that she may comfort her young daughter.' The . reality star was said to have raised the alarm on Monday after . becoming concerned for Russell when he failed to show up for a meeting . they had arranged, and did not respond to her phone calls and texts, TMZ . claim. The website alleges that she went to the Mulholland Drive house where her ex was staying with a friend that evening, and raised the alarm with the home owner. The owner then looked through Armstrong's bedroom window and saw his dead body hanging, TMZ claim. Going ahead: Bravo executives are deciding whether season two of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills will air next month on schedule . In . the last interview before his death, Russell spoke to website Rumorfix last . month about how difficult he found it to live with his new fame, and how . it contributed to his marriage break-up. 'It took our manageable problems and . made them worse. We are very supportive of each other and love each . other. I will support her as best I can moving forward. 'This is a devastating time. We had a wonderful marriage and I . don’t want you to get the impression that Taylor and I are bitter enemies — . we’re not. 'We have a beautiful five-year-old daughter who we both love.' Ed Winter of the L.A Coroner’s Office said: 'He hung himself with no suicide note found.' No drugs or alcohol were found in the bedroom where Russell died and he was fully clothed when his body was discovered. Russell is survived by five-year-old Kennedy, Aiden, a 13-year-old son from a . previous marriage and a an 11-year-old son with former fiancée Milette .

More is being learned about the last man to see Robyn Gardner alive as it is revealed he will spend more time behind bars in the woman's disappearance in Aruba. Aruban authorities detained Gary Giordano, 50, of Gaithersburg, Maryland, last week in connection to Miss Gardner's disappearance. On Monday, Carrie Emerson said it's her daughter's dream to be a model and actress, but when Mr Giordano called about a possible gig, she was suspicious. Scroll down for video. Indecent proposal: Carrie Emerson, right, says she received a call from the prime suspect in the disappearance of Robyn Gardner with a modelling offer for her daughter, right . Mrs Emerson said Giordano told her he was a producer, and wanted to take her 18-year-old daughter, who goes by the name Taylor Tyler, to Aruba for a photo shoot. 'He started telling me stuff like that he would protect her. He said, ""It's not going to be another Natalee Holloway or anything.""' Suspicious about the offer, she refused, and Mr Giordano became frustrated. Flirting with disaster: The mother of Taylor Tyler says Gary Giordano called after seeing photos of her daughter on the internet . Mrs Emerson told ABC News: 'He got very angry with me at that point. He started telling me that if I went and slept with him he would make sure I was taken care of well financially. 'He said that “if you ever let your daughter sleep with me too, I'll take care of both of ya'll for the rest of your lives financially.""' On Monday, Mr Giordano was ordered to be held another eight days in Aruba while authorities continue to investigate. His defence lawyer had argued Giordano has cooperated with investigators and should be immediately released because there is no evidence against him. Michael Lopez, Mr Giordano's Aruban attorney, denied statements by prosecutors that his client is no longer answering questions about what happened to Miss Gardner, his companion on a short trip to the Dutch Caribbean island. Mr Giordano had granted four interviews to investigators and accompanied them twice on visits to the area where he said Gardner disappeared while they went snorkeling, Lopez said in a written statement. Missing: Robyn Gardner disappeared while on holiday in Aruba with 50-year-old Gary Giordano who is being held by police . Suspect: Former wives and girlfriends have complained of how Gary Giordano could become angry and controlling . 'To date, our client has given all . possible cooperation to the investigation,' he said. 'Where our client . has been asked the same question more than once he referred to previous . statements.' Aruban Solicitor General Taco Stein has said that investigators believe the 35-year-old woman from Frederick, Maryland, is dead. 'We cannot deduce that there is hard proof to sustain a demand by the public prosecutor against our client,' Lopez said. The claims from Giordano's lawyer . comes as former wives and girlfriends told how he could not control his . anger and stalked them, even allegedly hiding outside one lover's house . dressed as a deer. Previous lovers have told how he . courted them with his blue-green eyes, tall physique and offers of . cruises and vacations, and his $1.3 million stone mansion in an . upper-class Washington DC suburb. Mr Giordano, a self-employed businessman and twice-divorced father of three sons, has denied any wrongdoing since the disappearance of Miss Gardner. Her remains have not been found, despite four days of searching the area where Giordano told officials an ocean current pulled her away as they snorkelled on August 2. Mystery: Ms Gardner was visiting the island with Gary Giordano, who was detained for questioning . Federal involvement: FBI agents searched Giordano's home in Gaithersburg, Maryland on Friday evening . FBI agents combed through Giordano's home Sunday night. Mr Stein said a pink shirt and black sandals found . during a search of an abandoned phosphate mine - near where Giordano . told authorities Gardner disappeared - did not belong to the woman. Giordano has told authorities that Ms Gardner never made it back to shore after the two became separated. The exact nature of their relationship is not clear, and she had a boyfriend at home in Maryland. Police . said they doubt certain aspects of his story, including whether the . pair went into the water, and say they're seeking witnesses to build . their case against him. Court . records and former romantic interests reveal a man who could be . threatening and who has had several volatile relationships. 'He can't control his anger,' his first wife, Sharon Cohen, wrote in court papers in 2001. Missing: Thirty-five-year-old Robyn Gardner, of Maryland, disappeared on August 2 while on holiday in Aruba . Search: Police said clothes found in the shaft of an old phosphate mine near Baby Beach, Aruba, did not belong to the missing woman . Giordano married Cohen in 1987 and they had three sons, but the relationship deteriorated until they divorced in 2003. At one point, each accused the other . of abuse, with Giordano alleging that his wife struck him in the back . with a steel cooking spoon during a heated argument. She countered that he had a nasty temper, throwing phones, cursing and becoming violent with one of their sons. Giordano apparently struggled with relationships after his first marriage ended. He and his second wife divorced in 2008 after just two years. In the last three years, other women he dated - many of them thin and blond like Miss Gardner - found that their romantic relationships with him turned ugly. One woman accused him of threatening her by saying 'the world would be better off without me' and of secretly videotaping their sexual encounters. The scene: The Renaissance Aruba Resort & Casino in Oranjestad, where Ms Gardner and Mr Giordano were reportedly staying during the holiday . The woman met with prosecutors, but told authorities she didn't want to pursue the case. She claimed in court documents that Giordano retaliated by putting revealing photos of her in neighbours' mailboxes. Unsolved: Natalee Holloway was 18 when she vanished on Aruba on holiday in 2005 . Jeanette Farago, a former neighbour, started dating Giordano around the time of his second divorce. She said Giordano was charismatic but could become angry and possessive, though she said she never felt physically threatened. Once, he wanted to take her on a cruise but became irate when she didn't want to go, she said, a situation Ms Gardner also found herself in, according to a friend. Farago said Giordano insisted on having her email password so he could ensure she was not seeing anyone else. If . she said she was going to the grocery store, he would want photographic . proof. Sometimes, she said, he would spy on her and text her details of . her outfit so she knew he was watching. He even hid in the woods behind her home to watch her, dressing in a deer costume, she said. 'He's Mr Perfect,' she said, and then he's 'totally different'. Giordano and Miss Gardner, who is from Frederick, Maryland, arrived in Aruba on July 31 and shared a room at a Marriott hotel. Investigators have surveillance tape of them at a restaurant near Baby Beach, not far from where he says she disappeared while snorkelling. But no witnesses saw them go into the water and police have no knowledge of what else they did on the island. Aruba has experience dealing with missing person cases following the still unsolved disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway during a high school class trip to the island in 2005. Her remains were never found and the main suspect, Joran van der Sloot, is in jail in Peru on charges of killing a 21-year-old woman there last May.

After Google’s robot-controlled cars travelled 160,000 miles without a hitch, it was always going to be a human that caused the first crash. A Google self-driving prototype Toyota Prius went into another vehicle near the firm’s headquarters in Mountain View, California. Oops: A Google self-driving prototype Toyota Prius has crashed into another vehicle near the company's headquarters in Mountain View, California . But the technology giant said the crash was the fault of a human at the car’s controls, with witnesses claiming it caused a five-car pile-up. Google has been testing out the cars in California and Nevada and this was the first time one has had an accident. The autonomous Prius was in a five-car pile-up bizarrely with two other Prius cars and two Honda Accord vehicles, reported Jalopnik. Google’s car rear-ended another Prius that hit a Honda Accord, which struck another Accord that hit another Prius, witnesses said. It’s not yet proven that a human was driving but experts say the car’s sensors, cameras and lasers would have avoided a collision. Company response: The technology giant said the crash was the fault of a human at the car's controls, with witnesses claiming it caused a five-car pile-up . However the crash could have been caused by a bug in the computer software, which does all the work while humans ride in the car. 'Safety is our top priority.

"California overdue 'the big one', say scientists . By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 10:23 AM on 1st July 2011 . Quiet of late: The San Andreas Fault is overdue a substantial earthquake . A huge earthquake could soon hit the U.S. West Coast - which has been spared the natural disaster in recent years because of flood control measures. Scientists have claimed the San Andreas Fault, which runs 810 miles through California, is long overdue a quake of at least magnitude 7.0 - the same size that devastated Haiti in 2010. And they said human efforts to control flooding in the area could be the reason for the recent lull in tremors. Major earthquakes in the southern portion of the fault normally happen every 180 years - but worryingly one has not occurred for 300 years. The group analysed images of sediment layers deposited at Salton Sea, currently the largest lake in California, which was once home to the giant pre-historic freshwater Lake Cahuilla. The way the sediment is laid down meant they could identify when flooding or earthquakes took place. In its day, Cahuilla would have dwarfed the Salton Sea by filling the Coachella, Imperial and Mexicali valleys of southeastern California and northeastern Baja California. It is also where the southern San Andreas Fault ends. U.S. Geological Survey marine geologist Daniel Brothers said: 'We have gone back through time and built one of the longest and most robust earthquake records available.' The group's findings suggested that episodic flooding of the lake by the Colorado River during the past 1,200 years triggered earthquakes on underlying small faults. Same again: Scientists believe an earthquake, bigger than the magnitude 6.9 that hit San Francisco in 1989, is due to come soon from the San Andreas Fault . These, in turn, could have impacted the nearby San Andreas Fault, apparently causing it to rupture with large earthquakes. Past studies had suggested that flooding could trigger seismic activity through the rapid filling of lakes. Analysed: Scientists looked at images of sediment layers deposited at Salton Sea . Tremors: Research suggested episodic flooding of the pre-historic Lake Cahuilla by the Colorado River triggered earthquakes . Brothers added: 'But as far as I know, nobody has presented convincing evidence of this relationship using geologic records. 'We didn't set out to study the relationship between flooding and earthquakes. 'The idea presented itself while we were interpreting our data and we realised we couldn't separate the timing of flooding and fault rupture.' Brothers added in the journal Nature Geoscience that, in the past century, human control of the Colorado River may have contributed to the dearth in earthquakes currently seen in the southern San Andreas. This has led to concerns that energy could be building up in the fault without floods to help release the stress. He added: 'We don't know if the next earthquake on the San Andreas Fault will be bigger because of the prolonged quiescent period. 'We have to wait and see if we've actually reset the recurrence interval and if the earthquakes are actually larger.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:41 PM on 19th August 2011 . Executed: Jerry T. Jackson was put to death via lethal injection at Greensville Correctional Center in Virginia . A prisoner who raped and murdered an 88-year-old widow has been executed despite a campaign to have his death sentence commuted. Jerry Terrell Jackson, 30, was sentenced to death for the 2001 rape and murder of seamstress Ruth Phillips, 88, in her apartment in the city of Williamsburg, Virginia. He was pronounced dead at 9.14pm on Thursday at Greensville Correctional Center after his execution went ahead despite a campaign to save his life by lawyers and a reverend who spent years visiting him in jail. Jackson was close to a reprieve last . year when U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema allowed a two-day . evidentiary hearing in which Jackson's brother and sister testified . about the abuse he suffered at the hands of his father and stepfather . while growing up. Brinkema ordered that Jackson should . receive a new sentencing hearing, saying the testimony 'painted a . graphic picture of an unwarranted, continuous, sadistic course of . conduct that terrorized and dehumanized Jackson throughout his . childhood.' However, earlier this year a federal appeals court overturned that ruling on a technicality. Recently, Jackson's lawyers had . argued that jurors should get a chance to hear the graphic details of . Jackson's horrific childhood abuse. But that argument was not enough to . sway Governor Bob McDonnell, who denied a request to commute Jackson's . sentence to life in prison last week. On the day of the execution the U.S. Supreme Court denied a further request to block the execution. In a recent telephone interview, . Jackson talked about the abuse, which began with a broken arm when he . was 19 months old and continued with sexual abuse and beatings with a . fist, belt and once a two-by-four for more than a decade. Execution chamber: The room at Greensville Correction Center where Jackson was put to death using a controversial cocktail of drugs, which may cause suffering . Jackson acknowledged killing . Mrs Phillips. Although he said it wasn't an excuse for what he did, Jackson . said he didn't think it would have happened if he could have escaped the . abuse as a child. 'I don't think I would have ended up this way,' he said. 'I don't think I would be on death row.' Jackson also expressed regret for his actions, saying: 'I'm sorry Mrs. Phillips lost her life due to something that I done.' Victim: Ruth Phillips, 88, was raped and murdered by Jackson in her apartment in Williamsburg in 2001 . 'I'm sorry to Mr. Philips (her son) that he hurt so much. I'm sorry that he lost his mother.' The Reverend Christine . Payden-Travers, who has written to and visited Jackson for several . years, called him a loyal and caring friend to many people. She was with Jackson until he was . taken into the death chamber. She then witnessed the execution, holding . her bible, shutting her eyes and appearing to mouth a prayer. She had called up until the final hours for Jackson's life to be spared. 'He is not a monster,' she said. 'There is good in him as well as the bad that he's done. 'I wanted him to know there was . somebody with him who loved him and who saw him as a beloved child of . God. And to know that in the midst of the state taking his life that . there were people there that cared about him.' The execution also went ahead despite controversy over the method used. Due to a shortage of a drug called sodium thiopental, many states have replaced it with pentobarbital, an epilepsy drug manufactured by Danish firm Lundbeck. Lundbeck is on record as opposing the 'distressing misuse' of its product and in a recent Georgia execution there was some evidence the inmate suffered when the drug was used. Worried: Jerry Jackson had followed the controversy over the use of pentobarbital and had concerns about its use in his execution . Lawyers in several states have contested the use of pentobarbital, but federal courts have ruled that there is not enough significant evidence to prevent its use in two dozen executions this year. Jackson had followed news reports about the use of pentobarbital, including the Georgia case, and was said to be concerned about its use. When asked if he had any final words, Jackson shook his head and said 'no'. While waiting for the cocktail of three drugs to be administered Jackson tapped his foot as he lay strapped to a stainless steel gurney. The execution team took around 15 minutes to insert two intravenous lines, one in each of his arms. Within four minutes of the lines being inserted, he was pronounced dead. Jackson was the 31st person to be executed in the U.S. this year. Department of Corrections spokesman Larry Traylor said the execution team had carried out the order of execution in a 'professional and constitutional manner.' The family of Ruth Phillips, Jackson's victim, did not witness the execution, though her son Richard - who found her dead in her apartment on August 26, 2001 - said the execution was long overdue. Mrs Phillips, a widow for 30 years, had moved to Virginia from New Hampshire in the late 1990s so that she could be near her son and be safe. She worked as a seamstress making slip covers and draperies up until her death. During Jackson's court case it was revealed that he had broken into her home while she was asleep. When awoke to find him rummaging through her purse and offered him anything he wanted if he would leave. Instead, he put a pillow over her face and raped her. Jackson fled the scene in Mrs Philips' car and used the $60 he stole from her apartment to buy marijuana. Rev. Paden-Travers and Jackson's lawyer declined to comment after the execution, the 32nd in the U.S. this year.","Jury didn't know Jerry Jackson had been violently abused since he was 18 months old .

"By . David Williams . Last updated at 2:45 AM on 20th August 2011 . Two terrified British women hid for more than five hours in a basement ‘panic room’ yesterday after Taliban gunmen and suicide bombers stormed the headquarters of the British Council in Kabul. At least ten people were killed in the attack which again showed how the Taliban is able to strike against some of the most secure buildings in the Afghan capital. The women teachers and their bodyguard were among four Britons sleeping in the council’s sprawling compound who made it to the underground bunker after a car driven by a suicide bomber smashed a perimeter wall. Scroll down for videos of the aftermath of the blasts... Casualty: An unidentified man wearing a Union Flag on his shoulder is carried from the compound yesterday . Afghan policemen carry a wounded colleague past British military vehicles at the site of the bombings . Martin Davidson said: 'We are deeply shocked and saddened at the events that have taken place in Kabul and our thoughts are with the families of those injured or killed in this appalling attack. 'When the attack took place, three staff from the UK were in the compound and are now safe. 'We have 25 Afghan-appointed staff, none of whom are based at the compound and none of whom are physically affected by the incident. 'We are working with international partners and the Afghan government to contribute to the development of the next generation of leaders in Afghanistan. 'Our work in education gives them the skills that they need to contribute to the development and economic well-being of post-transitional Afghanistan. 'Young Afghans want to be part of that wider world and they demand the skills, including English language, to be able to do this. 'This attack must not and will not prevent the British Council from giving those young Afghans the support they need to be part of that wider world.' This signalled the beginning of a five-hour gun battle that left a member of the New Zealand Special Forces among the dead. All of the Britons were uninjured but . were said to be traumatised and recovering last night at the British . Embassy as security in Kabul was stepped up. British Council chief executive Martin . Davidson said: ‘Clearly, they are deeply shocked. They were inside the . compound for a very long period of time.’ The two British women, both English . teachers at council-run projects in the city, had been trained to go to . the ‘panic room’ – which is secured from the inside and fitted with a . direct link to the embassy – in an emergency. The Taliban said it had targeted the . council to mark the 92nd anniversary of Afghanistan’s full independence . from Britain – and warned there would be more attacks on foreign targets . in the city. Eight Afghan policemen, a local . municipal worker and the New Zealand soldier were all killed and 20 . others wounded after the insurgents set off eight explosions. A gunman was then able to fight his way into a fortified area of the council from where he held off Afghan and Nato forces. A photograph showed a Union Flag . insignia on the left shoulder of one casualty as he was carried on a . stretcher from the wreckage of the building but last night his identity . was unclear. Officials said the death toll inside . the compound would have been higher had it not been for the bravery of . the Nepalese security guards – former Gurkha soldiers – who repelled the . initial wave of attackers. Britain’s ambassador to Afghanistan, . Sir William Patey, confirmed that all militants were killed, adding : . ‘This was a dastardly, cowardly attack designed to attack British . interests, but ultimately ending in the deaths of many Afghans, and we . regret the death of the Afghans in this.’ David Cameron condemned the attack on . the cultural centre as ‘vicious and cowardly’, promising it would not . stop the work of the British Council in supporting the Afghan people. Afghan police said it appeared to have . been a well-planned three-phase attack begun when a suicide attacker . detonated his explosive vest at a square in western Kabul – where police . were guarding a key intersection – shortly after 1.30am UK time. At least eight people have been killed after two suicide bombers targeted the British Council in Kabul . Blast: A British security guard (left) and an Afghan policeman walk in front of the site of the explosion at the British Council . Ten minutes later, a suicide car . bomber detonated his vehicle outside the front gate of the British . Council, destroying a wall, which allowed the attackers to pour into the . compound. A number of Afghan policemen were . killed in the blast, others buried in the rubble. The impact of the . explosion was so great that it was heard across the city, shattering . windows a third of a mile away. As the area was evacuated, local . shopkeepers said as many as nine insurgents armed with rocket-propelled . grenades, heavy machine guns and AK-47s started firing as they ran . towards the British Council building. British and U.S. soldiers arrived at the scene to support Afghan and Nato Special Forces in a gun battle that raged for hours. Scores of troops surrounded the . compound while two Apache attack helicopters hovered on watch above. The . Taliban said it was sending two messages. ‘One to the Afghan government and one . to the British,’ spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said by telephone from an . undisclosed location . One of the two police officers who was killed is carried away from the smoking wreckage by his colleagues . British and Afghan security personnel quickly moved in to deal with the clash at the British Council . Despite the attack by the Taliban, bombings in Kabul these days are relatively rare . ‘We are now reminding them that we . will become independent again from all foreigners, especially from the . British,’ Mujahid said, referring to Afghanistan’s independence from . British rule in 1919. Mr Davidson said there had been no . specific threat against the British Council and the attack came as a . ‘complete surprise and shock’. The council also has 25 Afghan staff, but they are not based at the compound. After the U.S., Britain has the largest force in the Nato-led war against the Taliban, with around 9,500 troops. The attack comes a month after Nato . handed over security responsibilities to the Afghans in several areas . across the country, as part of a transition process to be completed by . the end of 2014. Afghan forces were given . responsibility for the city of Kabul in 2008.  But Nato helicopter . gunships had to be deployed there in June to end a siege of one of the . city’s top hotels after a Taliban attack.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:01 PM on 21st August 2011 . The Iranian lawyer for two American men sentenced to eight years in an Iranian prison said Sunday that he will appeal the verdict. Masoud Shafiei, who represented Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal, said his clients did nothing wrong and he would appeal the verdict and sentences. He said: 'I will use entire legal capacity to defend them.' Scroll down for video . Detained: The two men, pictured on their first appearance in court, said they were hiking on the Iranian border when they were taken into custody . Under Iranian law, a conviction of espionage can carry up to a 10-year prison sentence. However, a sentence for illegal entry can run from six months to three years in jail. The terms are often significantly reduced upon appeal. Bauer and Fattal, both 28, were sentenced to . three years each for illegal entry into Iran and five years each for . spying for the United States. Shafiei said the men were notified about the ruling by Iranian authorities. Iranian state TV first reported the verdict Saturday. On Sunday, Tehran's chief prosecutor Jafari Dowlatabadi confirmed the sentences and said the Americans have 20 days to appeal. Relatives of Bauer and Fattal said the sentences have hit them hard, but they remain hopeful the men will eventually be released. Jailed: Americans Shane Bauer, left, and Joshua Fattal, pictured before their arrest, have been sentenced to eight years in prison in Iran . The two men were arrested in July 2009 on the Iran-Iraq border. A third American who was taken with them, Sarah Shourd, was released in September 2010 on $500,000 bail and returned to the United States. Mr Dowlatabadi said Shourd's case 'is still open and she will be tried in absentia.' The Americans say they mistakenly crossed into Iran when they stepped off a dirt road while hiking near a waterfall. While other parts of Iraq remain troubled by violence, the semiautonomous Kurdish north has drawn tourists in recent years, including foreigners. The case has added to tensions already high between the U.S. and Iran over other issues, including Tehran's disputed nuclear program. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said the U.S. is 'deeply disappointed' by the sentences and the men have the nation's and President Obama's 'unflagging support.' 'We continue to call and work for their immediate release - it is time for them to return home and be reunited with their families,' she said. Samantha Topping, spokeswoman for Bauer and Fattal's families, sent a statement Sunday, saying relatives had been notified of their sentences. 'Of the 751 days of Shane and Josh's imprisonment, yesterday and today have been the most difficult for our families,' it said. 'Shane and Josh are innocent and have never posed any threat to the Islamic Republic of Iran, its government or its people.' But the statement also said the families still hoped the two would be released, based on remarks from Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi. He said earlier this month that he hoped the trial 'will finally lead to their freedom.' Captured: The Americans deny the charges and say they were just hiking . The families had been hoping that meant the men would be freed in the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, when pardons are usually handed down. Their Sunday statement appealed 'to the authorities in Iran to show compassion and allow them to return home to our families without delay. 'We also ask everyone around the world who trusts in the benevolence of the Iranian people and their leaders to join us in praying that Shane and Josh will now be released.' The gap between words by Salehi and the verdict indicates increasing rift between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's administration and hardline judiciary, controlled by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters. Ahmad Bakhshayesh, a professor of . politics in Tehran Azad University, said the sentences are a . message to the U.S. that 'Iran is trying to relay a tit-for-tat message . to Washington that we sentence Americans as you did it against Iranian . nationals in the U.S.' Over the past months, Iran has . brought up the cases of several Iranians being held in U.S. custody, . particularly Shahrazad Mir Gholikhan. The mother of twin girls was . sentenced in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 2009 to serve more than five . years in federal prison for her role in a scheme to smuggle 3,500 pairs . of military night-vision goggles to Iran in violation of the U.S. embargo. Iran also has demanded an investigation into the alleged mistreatment of its own citizens in U.S. custody.

"Susan Powell hasn't been seen since 2009 . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:54 PM on 21st August 2011 . Missing: Susan Powell hasn't been seen since December 2009 . A remembrance rally for a missing mother-of two descended into chaos on Friday as family members traded allegations in public. Josh Powell is the only person of interest in the December, 2009 disappearance of his wife, Susan Powell. Tensions reached a boiling point between the two feuding families as loved ones gathered in Puyallup, Washington to pass out flyers and comb for leads. Steve Powell, Josh Powell's father, confronted Chuck Cox, Susan Powell's father, calling him a 'liar' and a 'cyberbully.' 'Their group has accused me of murdering my daughter-in-law,' Steve Powell told KOMO-TV. Josh Powell, 34, has maintained that he and his sons were camping in the middle of a blizzard the night his wife went missing from their West Valley, Utah, home on December 6, 2009. He has claimed that Mrs Powell left on her own, describing his wife to Salt Lake City Tribune as 'extremely unstable.' Scroll down for video . Frustrated: Chuck Cox said he had fresh hope when police held a press conference on Friday to announce a tip had led them to Ely, Nevada . Mr Powell responded to the uproar with an emotional plea for his wife's family to leave him and their two sons alone. He told KOMO-TV: 'Putting this in my neighbourhood is not appropriate. They're trying to push an agenda... I . don't know what happened to her. There are 1,000 different theories that . people need to consider in strong and serious ways.' The void left by a lack of credible . leads in the case has been filled by several public family feuds. Susan’s father-in-law, Steve Powell, . read Susan’s diaries and came to the conclusion an emotionally turbulent . upbringing led to her running away with another man. He even considered publishing extracts from the diary online. He told ABC4 News: ‘Susan led a very . troubled childhood where there was emotional abuse at her family's home. It affected her and her older sister.’ Family: Susan with her husband Josh and two young boys . Good news: Husband Josh Powell welcomed the police update, saying it was 'the best news that I've heard in two years' The allegation led to a furious . response from Susan’s father, Chuck Cox, who told the news channel: 'We . deny all allegations, they are just totally ridiculous and we’re very . disappointed and believe it’s unconscionable that he would first read . those journals and then think he had the right to publish them.' Up until now Mr Cox has maintained that his son-in-law is the only focus of investigation in the case. He added: ‘I don't know of them (the police) moving in any other direction.’ Mr Cox also took aim at investigators for keeping the family in the dark as new leads emerge in the two-year-old case. He said he had fresh hope when police . held a press conference on Friday to announce a tip had led them to . Ely, Nevada, where the search for Mrs Powell continues. But with every search drawing up a . blank since her 2009 disappearance, Mr Cox said the West Valley, Utah . police announcement erased his hopes for answers. Development: Significant new clues have led police to Ely in Nevada, where a team will conduct a search . 'I was disappointed in the news . conference, they didn't tell me anything. That's basically what I . thought was what's the point?' he asked. Mr Cox said he has no knowledge of . his daughter having ever been in the area around Ely, Nevada, where West . Valley police said they would be searching this week after obtaining . 'credible information' from a search warrant led them there. 'I don't know on what basis they're searching that area,' Mr Cox said. Ely is more than 200 miles southwest of West Valley, where the couple lived with their sons, then ages two and four. The case has baffled the West Valley . authorities, but the new evidence that they’ve received was deemed . important enough to warrant an official statement. The statement read: ‘A team of West . Valley Police Department detectives will arrive in Ely, Nevada, and its . surrounding area, to conduct a search and investigate the information . received.’ In an interview with KSL.com, Sgt . Mike Powell (no relation) from West Valley Police added: ‘We've received . some credible information that definitely needs some follow-up. We want . the public to be aware of what's going on.’ Meanwhile, husband Josh Powell welcomed the update, telling King TV it was ‘the best news that I’ve heard in two years’.

"By . Jason Groves . Last updated at 10:51 PM on 21st August 2011 . Former Prime Minister Tony Blair says the riots are caused by youths from 'profoundly dysfunctional' families . Tony Blair yesterday took a swipe at David Cameron’s ‘muddle-headed’ handling of the fallout from the riots. In a rare intervention in domestic . politics, the former Prime Minister suggested Mr Cameron was wrong to . blame the riots on a general ‘moral decline’ in Britain. ‘I think we are in danger of the wrong analysis leading to the wrong diagnosis, leading to the wrong prescription,’ he said. But he risked charges of hypocrisy by . admitting that, when in opposition, he had exploited the 1993 murder of . toddler James Bulger by two ten-year-old boys to make political points . about a wider ‘moral breakdown’ in society. Mr Cameron said last week that he was . determined to tackle a ‘slow-motion moral collapse’ and mend Britain’s . ‘broken society’. Yesterday he pledged to lead a fightback against the . ‘destructive culture’ which he said had taken hold. But Mr Blair said the riots were . largely due to the actions of a hard core of problem families rather . than a wider moral decline. He spoke out as it emerged that . Scotland Yard believes up to 30,000 people were involved in looting, . arson and criminal damage during the riots in London. Metropolitan Police figures show . 3,296 crimes were committed during four days of rioting in the capital. Between five and ten people were linked with each crime, so police . believe they may be looking at between 15,000 and 30,000 suspects. Not a major problem: Mr Blair said that 'alienated youths from dysfunctional families' were the main cause of this month's rioting . Mr Blair suggested the Prime Minister . was wrong to order a review of all social policy in the wake of the . riots. ‘Focus on the specific problem and we can begin on a proper . solution,’ Mr Blair said in an article in the Observer. ‘Elevate this into a high-falutin’ wail about a Britain that has lost its way morally and we will depress . ourselves unnecessarily, trash our own reputation abroad, and worst of . all, miss the chance to deal with the problem in the only way that will . work.’ Mr Blair said politicians ‘miss the . point’ about the riots when those on the Left say the culprits were . victims of social deprivation and those on the Right say they needed to . take responsibility for their actions. He said the main problem lay with . alienated youths from dysfunctional families living ‘at odds with any . canons of proper behaviour’. Mr Blair says David Cameron and Ed Miliband's parties are missing the true cause behind the riots . He went on: ‘The key is to understand that they aren’t symptomatic of society at large. Failure to get this leads to a completely muddle-headed analysis of what has gone wrong. Britain as a whole is not in the grip of some general “moral decline”.’ Mr Blair accepted that he made a mistake in 1993 when he suggested, as shadow home secretary, that the killing in Liverpool of two-year-old James Bulger had deeper causes in the breakdown of communities. He said at the time: ‘We cannot exist in a moral vacuum. If we do not learn and then teach the value of what is right and what is wrong, then the result is simply moral chaos which engulfs us all. ‘I have no doubt that the breakdown of law and order is intimately linked to the break-up of a strong sense of community. And the break-up of community in turn is, to a crucial degree, consequent on the breakdown in family life.’ The speech helped to undermine John Major’s Conservative government. Yesterday Mr Blair said: ‘I now believe that speech was good politics but bad policy.’","Former prime minister says the riots are the product of a modern 'phenomenon'
