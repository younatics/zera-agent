As a solicitor and lay preacher, Anthony Weston believes in the rule of law and the word of God. But neither could help him keep drug addict Matthew Kaye on the straight and narrow. For, far from showing his gratitude after Dr Weston had represented him in court and provided him with charity and advice at home, Kaye instead chose to raid his office and plunder his silverware. Burglar: Matthew Kaye, left, abused trust and kindness of solicitor and lay preacher Anthony Weston, right, by breaking into his home and stealing his silverware collection . The 30-year-old pleaded guilty to . breaking into Dr Weston’s premises in Hereford and stealing silver . objects including a pen holder, an ashtray and a paper knife. Yet even after suffering such a . flagrant abuse of his kindness, Dr Weston, who is in his seventies, . shook Kaye’s hand as he left the dock. Kaye had previously been given cash gifts by Dr Weston, who also took him to some of his church services. Prosecutor Tim Hills told Gloucester . Crown Court that Dr Weston had known Kaye since he was in his early . teens, representing him. ‘He took him under his wing,’ said Mr Hills. ‘In addition to being a solicitor, Dr . Weston is a lay preacher working with a number of churches in . Herefordshire and he used to take the defendant with him to services. ‘The defendant has been a guest in . his home on a number of occasions, and over the years Dr Weston has . helped him financially and with pastoral care.’ Mr Hills said that on October 1 last . year Dr Weston and his wife Rosemary were upstairs in their home having . lunch when Kaye called and asked for some money. Dr Weston gave him £5. Later, Dr Weston discovered that the . window of his office downstairs had been broken and the silverware . stolen from his desk. He and his wife had to go out at that time, and . when they returned Dr Weston found Kaye in the room. Kaye claimed he had climbed in through the window to confront the ‘real’ burglar after seeing it broken. But later forensic tests revealed that Kaye’s blood was on a piece of silver that had fallen under the desk during the raid. Kaye’s fingerprints were the only ones found on the window and on a brick used to smash it. When police arrested Kaye for the burglary he denied it, but confessed when he was due to stand trial. Judge William Hart sentenced him to . 38 weeks’ jail, suspended for 12 months, and placed him under a 10pm to . 6am curfew for 12 weeks. Judgement: Kaye pleaded guilty at Gloucester Crown Court, pictured, to burglary and was given a 38 weeks jail sentence suspended for two years . The judge told Kaye: ‘Anthony  Weston . has been kind to you over  the years. You let down a man who deserved . only kindness in return for the kindness he showed to you. ‘I hope you feel ashamed of what you did. Repaying him in this way was sad indeed.’ Passing sentence, Judge Hart quoted . from a victim impact statement made by Dr Weston in which he said how . ‘disappointed’ he would be if it turned out Kaye was the burglar. ‘He has been both client and friend for some years,’ Dr Weston stated. ‘I have tried to help him and have given him some money presents as  a friend. ‘I have taken him to various services . in Herefordshire. I have also had conversations with him about baptism . and a marriage service for him and his girlfriend.’ The judge told Kaye: ‘Dr Weston is . clearly not a man who puts material possessions at the top of his list . of important things and he is obviously far more affected by the breach . of trust represented by your behaviour.’","Dr Anthony Weston helped drug addict Matthew Kaye, 30, since his teens .

The swarm would be launched into orbit in a single rocket, New Scientist reports - then would form into a 'swarm' that would attack a 250m space rock head on. Until now, research into an 'asteroid shield' for our planet has focused on huge satellites carrying equally vast weapons. But . Strathclyde researchers think that smaller 'fighter' satellites could . work together to destroy a huge asteroid. Dr Massimiliano Vasile, of . Strathclyde’s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, is . also researching another approach, where the small satellites would be . armed with lasers, rather than using impact to deflect the asteroid. Instead of knocking it off course, small laser satellites would 'chew away' at an approaching space rock. He said: ‘The approach we are . developing would involve sending small satellites, capable of flying in . formation with the asteroid and firing their lasers at the asteroid at . close range. ‘The use . of high power lasers in space for civil and commercial applications is . in its infancy and one of the main challenges is to have high power, . high efficiency and high beam quality all at the same time. ‘The . additional problem with asteroid deflection is that when the laser . begins to break down the surface of the object, the plume of gas and . debris impinges the spacecraft and contaminates the laser. 'However, . our laboratory tests have proven that the level of contamination is . less than expected and the laser could continue to function for longer . than anticipated.’ A swarm of relatively small satellites . flying in formation and cooperatively firing solar-powered lasers onto . an asteroid would overcome the difficulties associated with . current methods that are focused on large unwieldy spacecraft.

Dr Vasile said: ‘The Tunguska class of events are expected to occur within a period of a few centuries. 'Smaller . asteroids collide with Earth more frequently and generally burn in the . atmosphere although some of them reach the ground or explode at low . altitude potentially causing damage to buildings and people. ‘We . could reduce the threat posed by the potential collision with small to . medium size objects using a flotilla of small agile spacecraft each . equipped with a highly efficient laser which is much more feasible than a . single large spacecraft carrying a multi mega watt. 'Our . system is scalable, a larger asteroid would require adding one or more . spacecraft to the flotilla, and intrinsically redundant - if one . spacecraft fails the others can continue.’ Dr Vasile is now investigating the use of the same concept to remove space debris. The number of objects in orbit classified as debris is ever-increasing and with no widely accepted solution for their removal. Researchers . at the University of Strathclyde believe the space-borne lasers could . be used to lower the original orbit of the space debris and reduce the . congestion. Dr Vasile . said: ‘The amount of debris in orbit is such that we might experience a . so called Kessler syndrome – this is when the density becomes so high . that collisions between objects could cause an exponentially increasing . cascade of other collisions. ‘While . there is significant monitoring in place to keep track of these . objects, there is no specific system in place to remove them and our . research could be a possible solution.‘A . major advantage of using our technique is that the laser does not have . to be fired from the ground. Obviously there are severe restrictions . with that process as it has to travel through the atmosphere, has a . constrained range of action and can hit the debris only for short arcs.’","'Squadron' of 'pebble' sized asteroids would deflect asteroid .

Many a British holidaymaker has rubbed the sleep from their eyes to gaze in bewilderment at the rows of sunloungers requisitioned long before breakfast. Now research may have solved the mystery of how German tourists always get their towels there first. According to a major study of sleeping habits, they spend less time asleep – and get out of bed more quickly when the alarm goes. Scroll down for hilarious Carling Black Label video . The Carling Black Label advert shows a British holidaymaker expertly throwing his towel onto the sun lounger, beating the German tourists to reserving the first sunbed . While Britons sleep for an average of . seven hours and 21 minutes each night, our counterparts in Germany get . by with eight minutes fewer. And while we take advantage of the snooze . button to get an average of 20 more minutes in bed, they are up and . about after just 15. Professor Russell Foster, a . neuroscientist at Oxford University, looked at the sleeping habits of . more than 10,000 participants from both countries. He said his findings may be down to the fact that Germans begin to work earlier. They usually get to the office at 8.20am, while we are typically at our desks by 8.50am. Towels down: Germans have a natural advantage getting to the sunloungers first because they sleep less, a study has found . But while our later starts might  cost us a comfortable poolside lounger, there is good news too. Our sleeping habits are more in tune . with our natural body clock, according to Professor Till Roenneberg, . head of the Munich Centre for Chronobiology, who contributed to the . study. He said that we have lower levels of . ‘social jetlag’ – the difference between our actual sleeping habits and . our natural sleep cycle –  because our habits ‘better suit our sleep . needs’. Professor Foster said: ‘The fact Britons are sleeping more and . have less social jetlag would promote more creativity. In terms of . quality wake time at work, this is good news.’ Germans abroad: But thsi time it's football fans celebrating the Euro 2012 championships - at which towels are needed only to dry off the excess beer . And without casting aspersions on the . ability of the Germans to enjoy a joke, sleeping longer may also account . for the famous British sense of humour. Professor Foster said: ‘Sleeping . longer is known to help us with memory but also language skills and . creativity. That includes our sense of humour – our ability to look at . the world and laugh is very much influenced by sleep.’","British people sleep for seven hours 21 minutes per night - and the Germans sleep for eight minutes less .

YouTube videos featuring 69-year-old Vern Traversie, a Lakota man who lives on the Cheyenne River Reservation, went viral in Native American communities earlier this year. In them, Traversie talks about being mistreated at the South Dakota hospital and shows his abdomen. Though he himself is blind, Traversie says he was told by others that the scars left after his heart surgery form the letters. Scroll down for video . Scars: Vernon Traversie shows off the scars he still bears today - almost one year after the surgery .

But others say they can't make out . the letters, including police who investigated his allegations and . hospital officials. No criminal charges have been filed in the case. Chase Iron Eyes, a lawyer for . Traversie, filed a lawsuit on Monday in U.S. District Court in South . Dakota against Rapid City Regional Hospital, its board of directors, . physicians and TRS Surg Assist Inc. The lawsuit alleges a civil rights . violation based on race and cites the scarring from Traversie's . double-bypass surgery done in August 2011 as evidence. It seeks a jury . trial and damages. 'Defendants injured, carved, burned, . and/or cared for Plaintiff's abdomen in such a manner that scars . resembling three letters ""K"" were permanently placed on Plaintiff's . abdomen for no medically necessary purpose or reason, and in the process . injured, carved, burned, and/or cared for other portions of Plaintiff's . body to cause injury, specifically his abdomen and back,' the lawsuit . stated.

Traversie said he hadn't been aware . the lawsuit was filed on Monday, although he knew a lawyer was planning . to file one at some point on his behalf. 'I think the Native people have been . fighting racial hatred for many years in South Dakota, but you know, . it's not all the people that are hateful toward Native Americans,' said . Traversie, who recently had another heart surgery in Bismarck, North Dakota. 'We have a good segment of our . society -- white society -- in South Dakota that are Christian people . and they get along good with the Native Americans. In my instance, I . believe I'm dealing with the Ku Klux Klan, and that's a small minority.' As well as the marks on his skin, he . said the staff was also abusive towards him and when he told them how . much pain he was in, no one did anything to help him. 'I had a confrontation . with a male nurse while I was in intensive care,' he said. 'I was in so . much pain, I begged him for pain medication.

On . the day he was discharged, a nurse at the hospital told Mr Traversie . that he should get someone to take a picture of the surgery scars on his . stomach and his back. The nurse said she would not testify on his behalf but couldn't live with herself without at least alerting him to the scars. She . said to him: 'My conscience won’t let me be. It’s bothered me for days. Something was done to you, and I believe it was wrong. 'I can’t sleep. I keep thinking about what they did to you.' Scars: Mr Traversie had an old wound reopened on his back and two more cuts above it. On his abdomen the letters K can be seen .

"TalkTalk and Sky customers put up with 60% difference between advertised speed and the connection they actually receive . BT provides best service, with users paying for 8 Mbps but receiving just 2 Mbps . Opposition calls on Government to upgrade its broadband plans . By . Alex Gore . PUBLISHED: . 12:41 EST, 12 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:44 EST, 12 May 2012 . Sluggish broadband: Internet users are receiving an average of five megabits per second less than they are shelling out for . Internet users are receiving an average of five megabits per second (Mbps) less than they are shelling out for. The huge 42% gap has been revealed by a new survey of more than 3,000 people, whose broadband speeds were tested over three days. TalkTalk and Sky subscribers are having to put up with a massive 60% difference - the largest between an advertised speed and the sluggish service customers are actually receiving. TalkTalk customers said they were promised 30 Mbps but were receiving only 5 Mbps, while Sky users are getting just 4.8 Mbps instead of the 12 Mbps they are paying for. Virgin's online users report a 41% gap, having been promised 30 Mbps but only receiving 17.7Mbps. Other complaints reported by the Guardian survey include broadband black spots in city centres, exposed copper lines that fail in poor weather and having to move businesses out of homes because of slow connections. Top of the pile is BT, whose customers pay for 8 Mbps and get 2 Mbps less, with those signed up to its budget Plusnet option experiencing a 27% gap. 'If you were buying a dozen apples and you got three, you wouldn't put up with it,' said Hugh Colvin, an arts organiser who lives by the Welsh border. Mr Colvin, who pays for two telephone lines so multiple family members can surf the internet at once, added: 'It's outrageous that I pay the same as somebody who is in the middle of London getting 10 times the speed.' Civil servant David Combe, from Basingstoke, who shares his BT line with his partner and two children, said: 'If anyone wants to watch iPlayer there is no point a second person going online. It's like sharing a bathroom.' Changes to advertising rules, which came int force in April, mean internet service providers can only claim 'up to' speeds if at least 10% of customers are actually receiving them. Bandwidth: TalkTalk users are promised 30 Mbps but recieve only 5 Mbps . The threshold has been criticised for being too low but more and more broadband companies are using individual quotes instead of advertising blanket speeds. TalkTalk said no one agrees a contract without receiving a speed estimate tailored to them, while BT said it removed blanket claims from its website in April and has been providing personalised quotes for years. A Sky spokesman said the company emphasises its unlimited download allowances instead of headline speeds and stressed all the evidence shows customers are very positive about the service. A Virgin Media spokesman said it has long argued for greater clarity in broadband advertising but added providers continue to hide behind catch-all claims. He said: 'We are committed to continuing to lead this industry which is why we only advertise speeds that our customers can reasonably expect to actually receive. 'Ofcom's independent and comprehensive research consistently shows we deliver what we say, with our 30Mb service actually providing almost 31Mb on average.' Broadband is 2 Mbps according to Ofcom, the minimum bandwidth needed for video applications such as BBC's iPlayer. But the survey found nearly a fifth of people are receiving 2 Mbps or less. Connection speed: Ofcom classes broadband as 2 Mbps or over . BT is rolling out a £2.5bn upgrade of its copper network, which includes fibre optic cables being fed from telephone exchanges to street cabinets. It hopes to reach two-thirds of the country by the end of 2014 and, with Government support, the entire country in five years, resulting in speeds of up to 76 Mbps. Customers will be able to order an all-fibre line from BT from next year but it could be unaffordable for most, with prices estimated at up to £1,000. BT Group chief executive Ian Livingston said the UK will be leading the way for Europe, adding: 'We'll be giving fibre to within 400m of the average home. 'If people really want and need faster speeds, we can provide it.' Labour has called on the Government to update its broadband plans, with more fire connections to homes, businesses and schools. Communications minster Ed Vaizey has boasted the UK will have the best broadband network in Europe by 2015.","TalkTalk and Sky customers put up with 60% difference between advertised speed and the connection they actually receive .

Behind bars: Nek Alam (pictured), 72, and three of his sons have been jailed for subjecting a vulnerable member of their family, Ghalib Hussein, to a three-year campaign of cruelty . A father and three sons who subjected a child-like man to a campaign of 'Dickensian-like' cruelty because they regarded him as a financial burden on their family have been jailed. Victim Ghalib Hussain, 27, who cannot read or write, is said to have suffered regular beatings and threats over a three-year period by relatives who wanted to punish him as they believed he was 'slow in the head' and a 'mental case'. During his ordeal, it was claimed Mr Hussain, who was nicknamed 'The Clown' by his family, had one end of a pair of jump leads clamped onto his nose whilst he was hit with the other end and was whipped with a belt and a stick. A jury was told he also had to kiss the feet of his uncle whilst in a 'punishment position’ and was given what he called 'pigeon food' - bad food in the house or the leftovers. He was also not allowed to eat until he was told he could. On other occasions, Mr Hussain was also allegedly punched in the face when he failed to remember Arabic text taught in a mosque and was also warned he would be buried alive in a cemetery and have his tongue ripped out. He was later rescued by police who found him huddled on a settee at his home in Accrington, Lancashire, and unable to stand due to a broken right hip suffered when he was forced to the ground and jumped on. He had earlier been found wandering around the town centre and he clung onto a lamp-post in a distressed state when officers tried to take him home. At Burnley Crown Court, his uncle and Alam’s sons shopworkers Janghir Alam, 29, Zahir Alam, 33, and Zahoor Alam, 32, pleaded guilty to putting Mr Hussain in fear of violence by harassment, between January 2007 and July 2010. Nek, father of two Zahir and father of four Zahoor were each sentenced to 15 months imprisonment and Janghir also a father of four was jailed for 10 months. All were acquitted of more serious charges of false imprisonment, making threats to kill and causing grievous bodily harm at an earlier hearing. The jury was told Mr Hussain had been unable to read or write and to speak little or no English and had little or no formal education. He suffered from epilepsy, was described by certain family members as being 'slow in the head' with little or no knowledge of the world and was said to have no friends. Jeremy Lasker, prosecuting, said Mr Hussain came to Britain in about 2006 from his native Pakistan as a result of an arranged marriage to Nek Alam’s daughter, Sofia. Jailed: Brothers Zahir Alam (front left) and Janghir Alam (right), with their father behind, wanted to punish Mr Hussain because they believed he was 'slow in the head' She later rejected her husband and the victim was left 'stranded and alone' in the Alam household. Mr Lasker said: 'It’s pretty clear that he was not regarded with much affection by his relatives. Mr Hussain, the crown say, because of his problems, was unable to work in order to pay his way. 'As a consequence of that, the financial burden for his care and upkeep fell upon the rest of his family. 'It’s against this particular background that Ghalib Hussain was ill-treated and assaulted on a regular and continuing basis by his uncle and cousins. 'Those assaults or beatings appeared to have been carried out for the most part as a result of punishments, either because he had done something wrong or was perceived to have done something wrong.' Brutal: It was alleged that Zahoor Alam (pictured) took a pair of jump leads, attached one end to Mr Hussain's nose and used the other end to hit the palms of his hands . Mr Lasker said on June 26, 2010 police were asked to look out for a man described as vulnerable and found Mr Hussain, in traditional Asian dress, walking the streets. A member of the public helped translate and he was asked if the officers could take him home. But he became visibly distressed and was seen to cling to a lamp-post. 'He reported about being beaten and said the people living there would not let him return to Pakistan,' said Mr Lasker. A relative arrived at the scene and took him home where it is claimed he was subjected to another beating for daring to speak out. Four days later, a social worker visited the address with a police officer and insisted on speaking with Mr Hussain alone. He was initially told Mr Hussain was in London, but the victim was found huddled on a settee in a front room. The court heard the victim said he didn’t want to speak loudly in case he was overheard and then told the officer of his treatment. Mr Lasker said Mr Hussain, who was unable to stand up, was taken to hospital by ambulance on July 1 and had surgery to insert a number of screws in his broken right hip. He remained there until July 20. On his release, he gave an account of what he claimed had happened to him. The prosecutor said the crown alleged that on June 26, 2010, Mr Hussain had been forced to the ground and Zahir and Zahoor Alam then put their weight on him and jumped on his leg. Janghir Alam hit him with his belt. Mr Lasker claimed: 'The crown say he was made, whilst on the floor, to kiss Nek Alam’s feet whilst he was in a punishment position and told he would be buried alive in a cemetery and have his tongue ripped out. It was alleged that Zahoor Alam took a pair of jump leads, attached one end to the victim’s nose and used the other end to hit the palms of his hands. The father and sons were later arrested. Mr Lasker told the jury: 'These four defendants deny any of this cruel and violent behaviour which the crown say took place.' When interviewed and arrested, Nek Alam said Mr Hussain was 'mentally sick' and was spoilt by his grandmother. Janghir Alam said he was 'a burden', while Zahir Alam said he had 'a childish mind' and would be referred to as 'the clown or the mental case'. Mr Hussain was now in a care home and his immigration status was in a state of flux, as, was his future well-being. He gave evidence to the jury for several days, screened from the defendants. He had been accompanied by carers who now look after him. Sentencing, Judge Jonathan Gibson said: 'I am satisfied that this is a case where frustrated reactions to Mr Hussain’s behaviour, overflowed and the behaviour was clearly, it seems to me, as a result of Ghalib Hussain’s disability.' After the case, Det Sgt Julie Cross of Lancashire Police said: 'The victim was subjected to years of harassment and emotional abuse and has been treated in the most dreadful manner. To treat a family member in this way is appalling.'","Ghalib Hussain claims he was beaten because he was 'slow in the head'

A council bill for a roof repair has soared an incredible 440 times from £700 to more than £300,000. Ten owners in an Edinburgh tenement were given the original quote to repair a leak in a flat roof. The full scale of the outrageous charges was only revealed when one of the residents used the Freedom of Information Act to get official files. Council battle: Bruce Thompson and Edna McLeod outside their tenement on Comely Bank Place . Bruce Thompson, 67, has been battling the council for five years over its handling of what should have been a simple, affordable repair. The residents of the building in leafy Comely Bank believe much of the work was unnecessary and made matters worse. Edinburgh council has been at the centre of a long-running repairs scandal which has seen seen council workers accused of taking bribes and favouring certain companies for construction jobs. Contractors have also been accused of charging up to 20 times the estimate and just today it emerged that one of the council's most senior officials has been suspended in the wake of an investigation. Mr Thompson said: 'It all started five years ago when the council were called in to repair a flat roof. 'It was just a leak. We had had a quote for £700, but two people in the block objected so we had to get the council in. 'They said we needed a whole new roof. Two years later work started and at that time the quote was £65,000, which I don't think was necessary.' By August 2009, the estimated cost had reached £230,000 - almost £20,000 per flat. Mr Thompson and his partner Edna McLeod, 60, received Freedom of Information files last week, which contained the bill for the work. He said: 'It was for £252,000, but once you add VAT and the other costs it was £307,000. 'There was also a letter from the external consultant saying he was amazed it was that amount of money.' The roof at the top of the tenement on Comely Place: The original work was simply intended to fix a small leak . The property repairs scandal has already begun to claim scalps at the very top of Edinburgh council. Dave Anderson, the city's director of city development, was sent home from work on Monday after disciplinary proceedings were begun against him, Edinburgh Evening News reported. He had previously had overall responsibility for running the council’s 'statutory repairs' service, that has been subject to a long-running corruption probe and police investigation. Meanwhile, the Comely Bank homeowners have still not received an official bill for their roof repair. Mr Thompson, who is a consultant to the licensed trade, also obtained a second box of documents through FOI, but most of the contents had been heavily censored by the council. He said: 'We are quite convinced there are things in these letters they don't want us to see. They fought tooth and nail to stop us getting them. 'I have letters from experts saying it was totally unnecessary, badly done and a complete mess. 'The flat roof they were called in for hasn't been done, but they used it as a platform and have made it a lot worse.' Expensive: The price of the repair has now soared to £307,000, including VAT and other charges . In one her first decisions, the new Scottish Information Commissioner, Rosemary Agnew, has set the council must give Mr Thompson full versions of the two documents he requested.

In her first three reports since taking up the post in May, commissioner Rosemary Agnew said the council did not answer specific questions initially, then gave broad information and only eventually provided the relevant details. Although she did not order the council to take any further action, the Commissioner was satisfied that 'although Mr Thompson has raised his concerns in relation to a specific property, the council's management of statutory notices, both in general and in specific cases, is a matter of general public interest'. She added: 'Given the serious nature of the concerns raised, there is a strong public interest in understanding the work of the council in this area.'

More than 100 armed police officers swooped on a home and engaged in a tense 19-hour stand off with a man armed to the teeth - with a bottle of Cillit Bang. But despite his kitchen arsenal of bleach-based products, Richard Jablonski was unable to make a clean getaway. Instead, the crack tactical operations squad arrested him for possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear and violence. Under siege: At least 100 officers surrounded he home of Richard Jablonski's, who was armed with a bottle of household cleaner . Bang! And the dirt is gone: Cillit Bang was made famous by adverts featuring the loud-mouthed fictional character Barry Scott . No messing: At least 100 armed officers surrounded Richard Jablonski's home last January after reports he had armed himself with a gun . Incredibly, Jablonski, 38, was later charged and hauled before a court. But the bizarre case was finally dropped at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Tuesday after prosecutors failed to offer any evidence. Jablonski, from Stoke-on-Trent, . Staffs., had been due to stand trial early next month but Judge Paul . Glenn returned a not guilty verdict. Staffordshire . Police refused to reveal the cost of the case - despite coming under . pressure from their own police authority members. But estimates based on officers’ overtime and the cost of an armed response team have priced the siege at around £30,000. A similar siege involving 50 officers surrounding a house for 20 hours in Gloucester cost taxpayers £15,000. If the case had gone to trial at crown court, the final bill would have run into hundreds of thousands of pounds. Paul Spratt, prosecuting, told the court: 'When officers got to the address the defendant was alleged to have produced a gun, before retiring into the property and holding them at bay. 'The defendant asserted what he was holding was a bottle of Cillit Bang. 'There is an unresolvable conflict between the evidence from the police and the evidence of the defendant. 'Therefore the prosecution offers no evidence in this case.' Armed police had cordoned off part of an estate as they tried to coax Jablonski out of the house during the siege on January 6. Cillit Bang is known for its gaudy TV ads featuring famed shouter Barry Scott, as well as claims to have 'miraculous' cleaning powers. Launched in Hungary in 2003, Cillit Bang was unleashed on the UK in November 2004 as a rival to the then all-conquering Mr Muscle. The £5m TV ad campaign introduced the nation to the fictional Barry Scott, played by actor Neil Burgess, who would demonstrate Cillit Bang's cleaning ability before barking the product's slogan, 'Bang! And the dirt is gone'. While the initial reaction to the ads was one of mockery, the degreaser quickly gained a cult popularity, while huge sales followed thanks to its industrial-strength cleaning ability. The consumer goods firm behind the product, Reckitt Benckiser, are among the biggest worldwide, while its Dutch chief executive Bart Becht has made millions from the cleaner. Mr Becht, hailed by experts as a 'very, very successful marketer', broke the British record for executive pay in 2009, taking home more than £90m in cash and shares in one year. Cillit Bang has not been a complete success story however; in 2010 it topped a UK-wide poll to find the country's most disliked brand name. After the incident, officers recovered a BB gun from Jablonski’s kitchen - although it is now accepted he was not holding the firearm during the siege. Staffordshire Police today defended the costly operation. In a joint statement with Staffordshire Crown Prosecution Service, the force said: 'The CPS, after consulting with Staffordshire Police, has decided to offer no evidence, for legal and evidential reasons. 'For the duration of the incident the . police response was overseen by highly-trained and skilled officers who . managed the situation in a measured manner and ultimately brought it to a . safe and peaceful conclusion.

Terror on the streets: A 22-year-old gunman, later identified as Amir Bey, was toting a riffle on the streets of Philadelphia early Friday morning . Rebel without a cause: Authorities speculated Bey could have been attempting 'suicide by cops' Suspect: Amir Bey was arrested at the scene and rushed to the hospital . According to NBC Philadelphia, Bey was walking around the temple and firing shots into cars, shattering several windscreens. He also allegedly fired a few shots into the Masonic Temple. Authorities immediately shut down road and pedestrian traffic, as well as all SEPTA services around City Hall; the SWAT team was also alerted around 6:30am. NBC Philadelphia reports that Bey was aimlessly pacing in front of the temple, wearing a green shirt and jeans, and carrying the riffle. Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey described the tense scene to CBS Philly: ‘As SWAT was arriving, literally pulling up to the scene, the offender took a shot at police. He was in the middle of the street. Police responded and returned fire.’ It is unclear how many times Bey was shot, but authorities guess he was hit by anywhere from 10-15 bullets. He was arrested at the scene and immediately taken to Hahnemann University Hospital, where he remains in critical condition. Deputy Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel described the gunman as mentally unstable. He says it's possible that 22-year-old Amir Bey wanted officers to kill him. ‘Suicide-by-cop’ is a colloquial term used to describe someone who potentially wishes to kill themselves and engages in life-threatening behaviour, causing police to intervene with deadly force.

Players, including captain John Terry, showed off the Champions League trophy, which they won on Saturday night in a dramatic penalty shoot-out in Munich. Jubilant fans waved flags as the open top blue bus passed by and players waved club scarves.

When the players were given a microphone and asked to say a few words, Terry led chants of ""Championes, championes, ole, ole, ole"". The Blues were crowned European club champions for the first time in their history when they overcame Bayern Munich in the German side's home stadium after the match went to extra time. Around 25,000 Chelsea fans packed behind one of the goals in the Allianz Arena, while many more crammed into bars in London and around the UK to follow the action live on TV. Even Prime Minister David Cameron managed to catch the nail-biting shoot-out, watching the drama unfold alongside German chancellor Angela Merkel and other world leaders at the G8 summit at Camp David. Didier Drogba was Chelsea's hero, scoring the equalising goal in the dying minutes of normal time and netting the spot kick to win the shootout 4-3. It followed his match-winning goal which saw the west Londoners overcome Liverpool 2-1 in the FA Cup final at Wembley earlier this month. At 34, Drogba is said to be leaving Stamford Bridge, so his winning goal could well be his last kick for the club. But the Ivorian star will certainly be immortalised as a Chelsea legend by the fans.

Thousands of people are being wrongly told they have shin splints, leaving them in pain and without proper treatment, warn experts. Shin splints is a 'catch-all' diagnosis for lower leg pain triggered by sporting activities such as running, dancing and football. But it actually covers 31 different conditions which means many sufferers are failing to get targeted help that would put them back on their feet, it is claimed. Wrong call: Shin splints is a 'catch-all' diagnosis for lower leg pain triggered by sporting activities such as running, dancing and football . New research from The College of Podiatry shows that one in six people think they have shin splints - sometimes based on the opinion of coaches - but haven't sought a formal diagnosis. The survey of 2,000 people found one in three people have lower leg pain occasionally and one in ten say they often suffer with it. But exercise induced leg pain can be caused by a range of factors, including a growing trend for running, overuse injuries and training errors. Other causes include inadequate footwear, poor muscle strength, poor core stability and balance, says the College of Podiatry, which represents health professionals diagnosing and treating disorders of the feet. Experts at The John King Centre for Leg Pain at BMI London Independent Hospital say using the term shin splints is resulting in half of such cases being misdiagnosed. As a result many sufferers are unable to exercise, remain in pain and even immobile in some cases. Dr Nat Padhiar, a Consultant Podiatrist and Honorary Reader who is a Lead Clinician and Team Leader for Podiatry at the London 2012 Olympic & Paralympic Games said: 'I would like the term shin splints to be banned - there should be a law against it. 'It's a meaningless non-specific broad term used by clinicians, athletes and coaches to describe pain in the lower leg and it may prevent patients getting a correct diagnosis and could lead to long-term damage as a result,' he said. Dr Padhiar, who works at The John King Centre said: 'If you experience ongoing leg pain in the tibia - the sihn bone - and you have been told you have shin splints, it is vital to seek expert advice from a qualified health professional. 'This can be a consultant podiatrist, lower limb orthopaedic specialist and some specialist physiotherapists. 'Some conditions mean athletes can't run for more than ten minutes without pain, or even walk, while others can lead to a stress fracture.' 'These conditions may not be life-threatening, but it's as serious to an athlete who cannot exercise and they should make sure they seek proper help early on,' he added. He said there is good evidence that cases of exercise induced leg pain are increasing. The highest rate is among people doing cross country and long distance running - almost one in two regular runners will be affected at some point - followed by dancers. Preventive measures are possible, he added. 'When taking part in exercise and sport, make sure you prepare well and take into consideration all aspects of that sport or exercise, including appropriate footwear that is specific to that sport.'","Shin splints is 'catch-all' diagnosis for lower leg pain triggered by sports like running, dancing and football .

A babysitter accused of shaking his girlfriend's baby to death shook the child after he disturbed him while he was sending flirty texts to another man, a court has heard. Jason Redgrave, 25, allegedly slapped six-month-old Ethan Hopson so hard that he caused severe brain injuries, causing the little boy’s death in December. Hull Crown Court heard that Redgrave, from Grimsby, Lincolnshire, became annoyed when Ethan started crying because he was absorbed in sending and receiving flirtatious and sexually-charged text messages to and from the other man, suggesting they struck up a gay relationship. In court: A court artist's impression of Jason Redgrave, left. He had arrived at Karly Hopson's home to babysit Ethan so she could go out for a friend's birthday . Redgrave denies murdering Ethan between December 16 and 23. He also denies a charge of manslaughter. Mr Lumley said Redgrave was not Ethan’s father but he did have a son of his own. Redgrave began a relationship in November with Ethan’s mother, Karly Hopson. Redgrave contacted her through Facebook, and they exchanged messages before meeting and beginning an apparently 'intense' relationship. Redgrave and Karly had been seeing each other for about three weeks when he volunteered to babysit for her at her Cleethorpes home while she went out to celebrate a friend’s birthday. He sent her two text messages to say Ethan was asleep. He claimed he later went up to check on the baby and discovered that Ethan 'appeared to be lifeless'. He sent a text message at 10.52pm, saying: 'Karly, ring me now.' A recording of a 999 call made by Redgrave to the ambulance service was played in court. In it, Redgrave told the operator: 'I’m looking after my girlfriend’s baby. He’s barely breathing. I have laid him down flat and don’t know what position to put him in. He’s unresponsive. Summat’s wrong. Please.' Miss Hopson ran from the bar 'in a state of utter panic' and flagged down a driver to beg for a lift to her home. She found a paramedic trying to resuscitate Ethan. Miss Hopson travelled with Ethan in an ambulance to Grimsby’s hospital. Miss Hopson telephoned Redgrave and asked him what had happened. He allegedly told her: 'They are going to think I have done it and I am going to go to prison.' In happier times: Redgrave allegedly shook or slapped the baby so hard it caused major brain injuries which lead to his death, Hull Crown Court heard . At the hospital, Redgrave kept telling Miss Hopson he was sorry and that he should have checked Ethan more often. Ethan was still alive and he was given intensive care but the doctors decided the injuries had been deliberately caused. He was transferred to Sheffield Children’s Hospital for special care. Nicholas Lumley QC, prosecuting, said: 'Ethan Hopson would have been celebrating his first birthday on Sunday. 'The fact that he didn’t do so was that this man, Jason Redgrave, while babysitting for him, shook and hit him with such force that he suffered head injuries from which he never recovered. Victim: Ethan Hopson died later in Sheffield Hospital as a result of numerous non-accidental injuries, the court heard . 'There was nobody else in the house. It can only have been him. While he may not have set out to kill Ethan, he deliberately caused those injuries, intending to cause really serious injury to Ethan. That’s sufficient. 'If even in a moment, he intended to cause that harm, however fleeting that intent, however quickly regretted, however quickly he sought help, well that’s still murder.' Mr Lumley said that, while Ethan was still alive, Redgrave told police: 'I haven’t gone out to hurt him at all. I have not done anything to that child to cause any injuries to him intentionally or recklessly. 'I don’t know what caused that condition. I can’t tell you because I don’t know.' Ethan died on December 22, with his mother at his side. Mr Lumley said Ethan suffered bruises on the side of his face, between his eyes and on his scalp. There were four areas of blunt-force trauma. Bruising on his face was consistent with a slap and there was bleeding between his brain and his skull, as well as bleeding in his eyes, affecting both retinas. These suggested Ethan had been shaken, hit on the head or his head struck against another object. 'The injuries were caused by the deliberate, intentional application of force to Ethan,' claimed Mr Lumley. He told the court that Redgrave exchanged suggestive text messages with a Grimsby man before Miss Hopson went out - and 35 more were exchanged between them after that. They included explicit messages suggesting that the two men wanted to indulge in a gay relationship. The case continues.",Jason Redgrave allegedly slapped six-month-old Ethan so hard he caused severe brain injuries .

A new mother who contracted an aggressive flesh-eating bacteria just days after giving birth to twins is now walking and could leave hospital as early as this week. The astounding recovery comes two months after Lana Kuykendall, from Charleston, South Carolina, spotted a small bruise on the back of her leg that was growing by a quarter of an inch every hour. It was diagnosed as necrotizing fasciitis, a serious . infection of the skin, and doctors carried out nearly 20 operations in a bid to stop the disease, removing muscle tissue from her legs. 'It's been a long road, a lot of . which I don't remember, but we're recovering and that's what matters,' Lana told Today as she sat grinning beside her husband Darren. Scroll down for video . Road to recovery: Lana Kuykendall, who contracted a flesh-eating bacteria days after giving birth to twins, is getting ready to go home two months on. She is pictured with her husband Darren . 'It'll be nice to be home with the family and hopefully start our life as a whole family - for more than a few hours,' she added. Five weeks ago, Lana, 36, was able to hold her babies for the first time since she became infected, after her condition improved and doctors deemed her well enough to be exposed to them. Heart-wrenching photographs captured the moment she held Ian and Abigail, with her husband and nurses looking on. She has now moved from Greenville Memorial Hospital to a rehabilitation facility, where she has learned to walk and care for her twins for when she returns home, which could be this week. Therapy: After noticing a bruise on the back of her leg, Lana underwent 20 operations. She has now been moved from the hospital to a rehab center, where she is pictured walking down stairs . Battle: Doctors removed large amounts of muscle from her leg to stop the flesh-eating bacteria . Darren, her husband of four years, said the babies have helped motivate her recovery. 'It was touch and go each and every . day, and it was stressful,' Darren, a firefighter, said. 'I knew that she was a fighter from the word go, and I . love her with all my heart.' Her physical therapist, Lindsay Swift, added: 'She's a fighter. She works hard every day and she pushes through it.' A video of Lana in the rehabilitation facility shows her walking down steps and lifting her legs. Her . doctor, Dr Spence Taylor, credited her medical knowledge and fast . reaction for her recovery. If she had waited longer to seek medical . advice, she might have lost her limbs. Fighter: Five weeks ago, she held her twins, Ian and Abigail, for the first time since she was hospitalised . Reunion: Lana said she is looking forward to being a family again - for more than a few hours . 'Time is of the essence,' he said. 'So . the immediate recognition and getting to the doctor are very important. It is an inspirational case that all physicians aspire to take care . of.' Lana, a paramedic, . noticed a dark spot on the back of her left leg on May 11 and thought it . might be a blood clot, so immediately checked herself into hospital. 'Blood . clots aren't something to be played around with, they can be . dangerous,' she told Today. 'That's what I thought it was at the time, . so I just knew I needed to get . help.' The relentless necrotizing fasciitis . was caused by the skin bacteria Group A streptococcus, according to Dr. Bill Kelly, epidemiologist for the Greenville Hospital System. Before and after: Left, Lana is pictured with the babies before the flesh-eating bacteria was detected, and right, she grins with the babies from her hospital bed as she continues her amazing recovery . Strong: Georgia grad student Aimee Copeland, another flesh-eating bacteria victim, lost her limbs to the deadly disease. She is pictured grinning outside the hospital with her parents . 'Around 11:30 the spot was the size of her palm,' her friend, Kayla Moon, told Today. 'By the time she went in to surgery and they thought they knew what it was, it had consumed practically her whole leg.' She underwent surgeries and her condition was upgraded to 'good' in early June. It came after Aimee Copeland, 24, a graduate student from Georgia, was admitted to hospital with the flesh-eating bacteria after falling from a zipline on May 1. Doctors blamed her infection on Aeromonas hydrophila bacteria, which are found in fresh water and may have entered the wound when she fell into the river. Doctors had to amputate all of her limbs to stop the spread of the bacteria, but she has been pictured smiling in hospital and said she plans on walking at her graduation in December. Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat. The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications. Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons. See below for video .

Syria's ambassador to the UN was attacked last night for making an 'utterly grotesque' comparison between the bloody repression in his country and last year's riots in Britain. At least 15,000 people have been murdered by dictator Bashar al-Assad's regime since the uprising began in March last year. By comparison, five people lost their lives in the riots that swept across England last summer – none of them at the hands of the police. Widespread uprising: Syrians attend an anti-Assad protest after on the outskirts of Idlib on June 8. Syria's ambassador to the UN has described protest like this as being like the London riots . But Syria's UN ambassador Bashar Jaafari appeared to suggest that his government should not be criticised for the brutal crackdown – claiming that David Cameron had stressed the need for national security when dealing with the riots. Syrian government forces have carried out a series of bloody massacres against civilians. But Damascus refuses to accept responsibility, claiming they are conducted by terrorist groups. Mr Jaafari said: 'Our national security is also important. 'We are a sovereign state and in all the presidential statements there is a clear cut reference to safeguarding the sovereignty of Syria. 'You may remember the Prime Minister, what he said one day when the troubles erupted in London. He said that when it is related to the national security, “Don't talk to me about human rights”.

Syrian government forces have carried out a series of bloody massacres against civilians since the uprising started last March . Syrian rebels take position during clashes with government forces in Idlib, north Syria . 'I am not repeating what he said. I am saying we care about the human rights of our people but we cannot do everything alone. There are third parties in the domestic crisis in Syria.' Mr Jaafari appeared to be referring to comments made by Mr Cameron last year when he said he would 'not let any phoney concerns about human rights get in the way' when it came to finding and charging suspected rioters. Mr Jaafari's comments drew angry criticism from Britain's ambassador to the UN, Sir Mark Lyall Grant. He said: 'Coming from a representative of a regime that is now responsible for the deaths of well over 15,000 citizens, the Syrian ambassador's comparison of his regime's response with what happened in England last summer was utterly grotesque. 'It just goes to show how untenable the position of the Syrian regime has now become, and how desperate are the few remaining people willing to defend it.' Labour MP Ann Clwyd, a member of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said: 'It is so crass. People will be shocked by that assessment, which bears no relation to reality. The carnage that is going on in Syria, with innocent men, women and children being slaughtered, cannot be compared to the riots – it is absolutely ludicrous.' It emerged last night that Assad could be offered safe passage to a UN conference on the future of his country under a plan being pushed by Britain and Syria. David Cameron and the US are prepared to open talks with Assad on moving to a transitional government led by someone else and including figures from the current regime and the opposition. One UN official said it was possible that the deal could include clemency for Assad, though that would be highly controversial.","At least 15,000 have been murdered by Bashar al-Assad's regime .

Evidence: Dr Freddy Patel, pictured leaving Southwark Crown Court today, carried out the first post-mortem on Ian Tomlinson two days after his death during the G20 protests in 2009 . The pathologist who examined the body of Ian Tomlinson threw evidence down the sink as he had already made up his mind about the cause of death, a court heard today. Consultant forensic pathologist Dr Freddy Patel, 64, carried out the first post-mortem on Mr Tomlinson on April 3, 2009 - two days after his death during the G20 protests in the City of London. His findings led to the official line that the newspaper vendor had died of natural causes in the form of a heart attack. This theory was only questioned when footage later emerged of PC Simon Harwood hitting Mr Tomlinson with a baton and shoving him to the floor. The father-of-nine collapsed minutes later. Two subsequent post-mortems involving three pathologists concluded that Mr Tomlinson had been killed by internal bleeding caused by a liver injury, the hearing at Southwark Crown Court was told. Harwood denies manslaughter, claiming that his actions were ‘necessary, proportionate and reasonable’ in the circumstances. Prosecutor Mark Dennis today questioned whether Dr Patel had given proper consideration to the three litres of 'internal abdominal fluid blood' - which he later threw down the sink - and blood clots found in Mr Tomlinson’s stomach cavity. Other doctors believe this came from internal bleeding caused when Harwood attacked the 47-year-old as he walked away with his hands in his pockets. When asked how much attention he gave to the plum-coloured liquid, Dr Patel said: 'My impression was that there was more body fluid than blood. 'Having done my examination and having come to a cause of death in my mind it was obvious it couldn’t be three litres of blood, if it was three litres of blood I wouldn’t have given the cause of death that I did.' Mr Dennis, who pointed out the fluid had been 'poured down the drain into the mortuary sink', replied: 'Slight chicken and egg problem there Mr Patel. On that day did you not see any need to keep the three litres of liquid, blood, fluid, so it could be checked to see what mix it was?' Dr Patel said: 'I didn’t keep it, it is not the thing that is kept by pathologists.' But he admitted that the fluid could have been tested by other professionals to see how much of it was blood, if he had not thrown it away. Scroll down for video . Trial: PC Simon Harwood, pictured leaving court with his wife Helen, denies manslaughter after footage emerged of him hitting Mr Tomlinson with a baton and shoving him to the floor minutes before the newspaper vendor collapsed and died . Dr Patel was asked if he stood by his findings. He replied: 'Yes, I do. I have been searching other experts and pathologists for other evidence that would persuade me to believe that death was due to internal haemorrhage and if that was the case I would be the first one to rectify the matter.' Despite three other pathologists discrediting his findings, Dr Patel told the hearing that he still believed his ruling was correct. He said: 'I actually saw the blood mix and secondly having examined the body looking for injuries that could be caused by significant blood loss and there was none.' Spots found on the liver could not have produced enough blood to kill Mr Tomlinson and any injury he received from Harwood could not have caused him to collapse and die minutes later, Dr Patel said. At the request of the police and coroner he had looked specifically for 'assault crush injuries associated with public disorder' but the footage had not emerged. The court was previously shown film footage of the moment Mr Tomlinson journey that day using video from he walked past PC Simon Harwood - who is primed in a strike position behind him . Starting to fall: PC Harwood is accused of hitting Mr Tomlinson with a 'forceful baton strike' from behind . As Mr Tomlinson is helped to his feet, PC Harwood is no longer visible on the CCTV footage . Externally he found a superficial cut . above Mr Tomlinson’s right eyebrow and bruises and grazes to his legs . and knees, including a large 14cm by 6cm bruise to his thigh thought to . have been caused by the baton strike. But . his 2009 report concluded: 'There were no defence injuries, no crush . injuries and no significant marks of violence from assault or forceful . restraint.' Dr Patel, who . maintained that the bruises were not related to death, added today: 'At . the time of my examination there was no mention of a baton strike.' Other . bruises and a 'pattern mark' to the back of his leg could be attributed . to impact when he collapsed and were not consistent with bites from a . police dog, he said. Internal fractures to the ribs and bruising were likely to have been caused during resuscitation. Family: Mr Tomlinson's widow Julia and her son Paul King arrive at court for a hearing last week . Mr . Tomlinson showed signs of alcoholism and chronic liver disorder which . Dr Patel concluded could have caused the internal bleeding. He . found severe atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, was the . 'most significant pathological evidence' and therefore recorded a cause . of death as a heart attack. The court previously heard that Harwood . was bristling with aggression after a protester had scrawled ‘all cops . are b*******’ on a police carrier. The prosecution compared the policeman to a thug.

A DJ who was left impaled on iron railings after he attempted to scale an 8ft-high fence while 'a bit drunk' today revealed that he suffered almost exactly the same mishap as a child. Richard Bamber, 37, was left dangling in agony after he became impaled on a jagged spike near luxury flats in Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter on Saturday morning. He spent the next 15 hours with a railing embedded in his leg while doctors worked out how to safely remove it. Incredibly, this is not the first time Mr Bamber has impaled himself on an iron railing having been speared through the armpit at the age of five in a similar accident. He said: 'The funny thing is that I did do something similar when I was five. I was leaning against some railings near my home in order to get a better look at the nearby trainline and I just slipped. 'That time I was able to free myself and I went home and told my mum that I had hurt my arm. 'When she looked, there was a perfect hole in my armpit. I suppose I should have learned my lesson then.' During Saturday's incident, the railing was just inches from several major arteries and could have pierced a vital organ. But after a one-hour operation to remove it on Sunday, Mr Bamber was back home on Monday night. A fork-lift truck driver by day and DJ by night, he got trapped in the car park after leaving a friend's flat before deciding to scale the iron fence. He said: 'I was a bit drunk and I just took a look at this fence and thought, ""Yeah, I can make that."" 'There was a wooden bit at 90 degrees to the fence so I got up on that first with the intention of leaping over but, obviously, I underestimated the gap. 'At first I thought I had just caught myself on something. It was a bit like when toddlers fall over and it takes them a few seconds before they start to cry. 'I didn’t feel anything until I looked down and saw what I'd done.  I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, I just thought ""Oh no, you’ve actually done it.""' All smiles: Mr Bamber poses with two friends following surgery at Birmingham's Sandwell General Hospital . Painful: The iron railing remained stuck in Mr Bamber's leg for 15 hours before doctors could operate to remove it . Several passers-by were alerted by Mr Bamber's cries for help. One man even helped to support him while they waited for assistance and then the paramedics took over. Mr Bamber said: 'At first it really hurt but I think after a while I got used to it because I remember having a bit of a joke with this chap while he was trying to hold me up. 'After that everything is a bit of a blur. The paramedics arrived and pumped me full of drugs so I couldn’t feel anything. I wasn’t even aware that they had set me on fire trying to get me off the fence.' He only heard later from friends that the extremely hot cutting tools used to remove the iron railing had set fire to a blanket used to keep his legs warm. However, he does remember a crowd forming around the scene as it took emergency workers around half an hour to release him from the fence. Emergency crews were forced to call on the help of the Specialist Technical Rescue Team - who used hot gas cutting tools and an angle grinder to remove a section of the railings.

"By . Emily Allen . PUBLISHED: . 09:50 EST, 26 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:44 EST, 27 June 2012 . Embarrassed: Dr Malcolm spoke of his 'deep regret' over the affair at the hearing . A respected family doctor who lost his job after he had a two year extra marital affair with a patient told of his shame, embarrassment and 'deep regret' at the fling today. Married GP Dr Malcolm Kelvin, 58, swapped sexual texts with the woman and conducted the secret affair at his surgery after his colleagues had gone home for the day. The woman, 50, who was also a health care assistant at the medical practise was said to have 'disposition, sensibility and was in control of her life.' But the illicit romance ended after Kelvin’s wife looked at his mobile phone and discovered the flirtatious texts between him and his mistress. Kelvin was a called to meeting by his three fellow partners at the Mount Farm Surgery in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk where he admitted the affair and later resigned. 'Today he apologised 'most humbly' for the affair as he faced a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) fitness to practise hearing in Manchester where he faces being struck off for misconduct.' He admits the affair was improper but denies using his professional position as a doctor in order to secure a relationship with patient A claiming he regarded his mistress as a work colleague. 'I am appalled by my behaviour at the time,' said the doctor. 'I have asked myself thousands of times how I managed to get myself into the position and how a well-respected GP, with a good character finds his career collapsing around himself over such a fundamental breach of the sort of trust and honour that goes with my position.' Earlier the hearing was told Kelvin, who joined the practice in 1984, met his mistress whilst she was working at the surgery. She was also Kelvin’s patient at the practise and had been to six appointments with the doctor during the affair after suffering a shoulder complaint. Each appointment with the woman - known only as Patient A should have lasted no longer than 10 minutes. But the hearing was told the appointments appeared to be not only at the end of surgery but on two occasions they over-ran - one by 57 minutes and another by 18 minutes. Kelvin was a called to meeting by his three fellow partners at the Mount Farm Surgery in Bury St Edmonds, Suffolk (pictured) where he admitted the affair . A distressed Kelvin eventually confided in another partner at the practice about the relationship with patient A in January 2011 after his wife discovered a text message on his phone which gave the relationship away. It emerged the texts had began as early as 2008. When asked if he admitted the relationship with patient A, Kelvin said: 'Sadly and with deep regret, yes. She had disposition, sensibility, aged about 50, and in control of her life, that’s what I would probably say. 'She was an extremely good employee, good at her job, with attention to detail, a good sickness record and was not in any way prone to sickness at all. 'I think I was feeling slightly ignored at home. I cannot tell you how the first text happened, it just sort of developed. I honestly couldn’t tell you who sent the first text. There were certainly some texts of a sexual nature.' He said the sexual relationship didn’t start until March 2010 when Patient A ran smoking cessation advice sessions and he was on a rota working extended hours. Kelvin continued: 'Our working life together presented us with the opportunity to have a sexual relationship once the surgery was closed for business and the secretaries had gone home for the day. 'I am embarrassed to say this but it is important that I acknowledge that that was the situation that developed.' He said the pair had not struck up a sexual relationship before Patient A visited him for an appointment about her shoulder on October, 15, 2009. Kelvin said there was no sexual contact between the two during appointments and when asked about the lengthy appointments, he suggested the computer must have been set to log off after a failure to shut down. Speaking of the sexual encounters, Dr Kelvin added: 'They were after the extended hours, when the building was empty - around 8.30 or 8.45pm, something like that. 'The affair developed between patient A and myself because we worked together - had patient A not worked in the surgery, the affair would have never developed.' He also said the affair would have happened, even if patient A registered with another practice - because they still worked together. 'It is my great shame that I’m here now because of that,' he added. 'I should have never started any kind of sexual relationship with her, it was inappropriate on all sorts of levels. 'It was only when my inappropriate behaviour was discovered that I actually came to realise what I had been doing, for which I apologise most humbly.' 'It was based on two people working together, but that doesn’t excuse it. I now accept that I crossed the boundary. 'It developed because we worked together as work colleagues and there was no real link in my mind or her that the relationship developed because she was a patient. 'I didn’t give it the significance that it obviously should have had'. The hearing was told on January 18, 2011 a meeting was set up between Kelvin and the other three partners where he admitted everything and was suspended as a result. Counsel to the GMC Elizabeth Nicholls said: 'He admitted to his colleagues and partners that he had a relationship with her and had admitted that the sexual liaisons had taken place in the surgery premises.' Patient A did not give evidence at the hearing but submitted a letter to the surgery confirming that the relationship had taken place over a two year period. She said: 'I was very aware that what we were doing was wrong. I have deeply hurt my family and let down my work colleges. It’s something I have to live with, I only hope in time that they will forgive me.' The hearing was told the woman’s medical appointments with Kelvin had been set late in the day as they would fit in better with her 9-6pm working patterns. Kelvin’s lawyer Gordon Bebb, defending, said: 'It’s admitted that in relation to patient A, Doctor Kelvin engaged in an improper emotional and sexual relationship, but it is not admitted that he abused his professional position.' The hearing continues.","Dr Malcolm Kelvin resigned after being called to a meeting by his three fellow partners .

"By . Graham Smith . UPDATED: . 09:47 EST, 11 July 2012 . An American sentenced to . two-and-a-half years in a Thai prison for translating a banned biography . about the country's king and posting the content online has been freed . by a royal pardon. Joe Gordon was convicted in December for translating excerpts of the book The King Never Smiles from English into Thai. The punishment was a high-profile . example of the severe sentences meted out for defaming Thailand's royal . family, an issue that has raised concern about freedom of expression in . the south-east Asian kingdom. Rough justice: Joe Gordon is led into the Bangkok Criminal Court for sentencing last December. He was freed by royal pardon today . No reason was given for the pardon, . but U.S. officials have pressed Thai authorities to release the . Thai-born American since he was first detained in May 2011. Mr Gordon was freed from Bangkok's Remand prison late yesterday. U.S. Embassy spokesman Walter . Braunohler said: 'We are pleased that His Majesty King Bhumibol . Adulyadej granted Joe Gordon a royal pardon, which allowed him to be . released from prison. 'We urge Thai authorities on a . regular basis, both privately and publically, in Bangkok and in . Washington, to ensure that freedom of expression is protected in . accordance with its international obligations.' Much loved: Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej pictured on his 84th birthday last year . Mr Braunohler declined to comment on Mr Gordon's whereabouts or what his future plans were. Mr Gordon's lawyer, Arnon Numpa, said he would likely return to the U.S. within several days. Bhumibol, the world's longest-reigning monarch, is revered in Thailand and is widely seen as a stabilising force. But Thailand's lese-majeste laws are . the harshest in the world. They mandate that people found guilty of . defaming the monarchy - including the king, the queen and the heir to . the throne - face three to 15 years behind bars. The nation's 2007 Computer Crimes Act . also contains provisions that have enabled prosecutors to increase . lese-majeste sentences. Opponents of the laws say that while . the royal family should be protected from defamation, lese-majeste laws . are often abused to punish political rivals. That has been especially true amid the political turmoil that has followed a 2006 military coup. Many had hoped the administration of . Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, which assumed power after elections a . year ago and has prominent supporters who have been accused of . lese-majeste, would reform the laws. The issue remains highly sensitive, . however, and Yingluck's government has bee as aggressive in pursuing the . cases as its predecessors. Mr Gordon, posted links to the banned . biography of the king several years ago while residing in the U.S. state of Colorado, and his case has raised questions about the . applicability of Thai law to acts committed by foreigners outside . Thailand. Behind bars: Mr Gordon was arrested and detained while on a visit to Thailand in May last year . In the banned book, author Paul M Handley retraces the king's life, alleging that he has been a major stumbling block to the progress of democracy in Thailand as he consolidated royal power over his long reign. Mr Gordon, who lived in the U.S. for about 30 years, was visiting his native country to seek treatment for arthritis and high blood pressure at the time of his arrest. After being repeatedly denied bail, he pleaded guilty in October last year in hopes of obtaining a lenient sentence. The judge said at the time that the punishment, initially set at five years, was reduced because of his plea.","Joe Gordon was convicted for translating excerpts of book The King Never Smiles from English into Thai .

The number of people out of work in Britain has fallen slightly to 2.61million, official figures revealed today. But the Government was hit with a mixed bag of data today as it emerged the number if benefit claimants has actually risen. The jobless total dropped 51,000 in the quarter to April, while the number of people claiming jobseeker’s allowance in May rose by 8,100 to 1.6 million, ending two months of declines. Scroll down for video . Falling: The number of people in work rose by 81,000 int he last quarter, according to official figures released today . Those in work soared by 166,000 in the biggest increase since the quarter ending in August 2010. Roughly half of the increase was down to people taking part time jobs. The UK’s unemployment rate now stands at 8.2 per cent of the workforce down 0.2 per cent and significantly below the . European average of 10.3 per cent. In . total, there are now 29.28 million people in work with eight million of . those part-time, according to official figures released today. However, . despite a rise in the number of people in jobs, there are still . long-term problems with the economy which is continuing to flatline. Falling: The unemployment rate has dropped by 0.2 per cent to 8.2 per cent . The number of people forced to work part-time because they cannot find full-time work increased by 25,000 to 1.4million. There are now 886,000 people who have been out of work for more than a year - an increase of 85,000. And 434,000 have been unemployed for two years - up by 29,000. Employment Minister Chris Grayling . said: 'Any fall in unemployment is very welcome but I remain cautious . over the next few months, given the continuing economic challenges we . face. 'There are more jobs available in the . economy with vacancies at 465,000, up 7,000 on this time last year. 'The . number of people employed in the private sector is up 205,000 on the . quarter, more than offsetting a 39,000 fall in public sector employment. The total number of people working full-time has also increased by . 82,000. Unemployment falls: The number of people out of work has fallen slightly nationwide in the last quarter - but 8.2per cent of the workforce are still unemployed nationally . 'These figures show that with the . right support in place, it is possible for the private sector to create . jobs while the public sector employment is falling.' Households face a continuing squeeze on their incomes as pay rises remains below the rate of inflation. Average total pay, including bonuses, rose by 1.4 per cent in the year to April to £467 a week, the Office for National Statistics said, while inflation was running at 3 per cent. But the rate at which incomes are falling after adjustment for inflation has slowed to a near 30-month low. Households were squeezed by high prices and sluggish wage growth throughout 2011 and early 2012, but the Bank of England predicts the pressure should ease as the rate of inflation pulls back towards the Government's 2 per cent target throughout the year. Average total pay in the private sector was up 1.3 per cent at £465 per week, while regular pay was up 2.1 per cent at £431 per week. Today's figures showed that pay is now falling 1 per cent in real terms, which is the slowest rate of decline since November 2009 and compares to a peak rate of a decline of 3.4% seen last September, when inflation was 5.2%. Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial information services firm Markit, said: 'Although pay growth continues to run behind inflation, pointing to a squeeze on real incomes, the squeeze has clearly eased, reflecting the combination of falling inflation and faster pay growth, which should help bolster consumer spending.' Average earnings increased by 1.4 per cent in the year to April, up by 0.5 percentage points on the previous month due to the timing of bonuses. Weekly pay in private firms in April was £5 higher at £465 compared to a year ago. Spain has the highest unemployment rate in the EU at 24.3 per cent, while Austria has the lowest at 3.9 per cent. Youth unemployment has also fallen, down by 29,000 over the latest quarter to 1.01 million. There were 9.23 million economically-inactive people in the three months to April, a fall of 69,000, mainly due to a reduction in the number of students. Unison leader Dave Prentis said: 'While there may be a small reduction in unemployment, we know that the situation for our members working in the public sector - under the cosh of the coalition Government’s relentless austerity agenda - is getting tougher by the day. 'The figures also shine a harsh light on the hard-core of the unemployment crisis in the UK - that of long-term unemployment. The number of people unemployed for more than two years continues to rise. 'We know that the longer someone is out of work, the more difficult it is to get back into it. 'The Government would be wise not to hide behind these small increases, in the vain belief that they show that the economy is improving. 'The reality is that many people are suffering as a result of stagnant growth and the brutal public sector cuts, and the Government needs to wake up to this and take action if we are to see any true signs of recovery.' David Kern, Chief Economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, described the figures as 'encouraging' for the economy. Her said: 'This is encouraging news at a crucial time for the UK economy. Although the level of youth unemployment remains high, overall these figures show a flexible and robust job market. 'This proves that the private sector is willing and able to create new jobs while public sector employment continues to shrink.'","Number of people out of work falls by 51,000 .

Britain's border chaos is getting worse as hundreds of rookie staff with no experience are manning immigration desks at Heathrow Airport in a desperate attempt to cut queues during the Olympics, a watchdog said today. Workers brought in to ease congestion in the arrivals hall are actually increasing waiting times because they lack confidence and are too slow at processing passengers, according to John Vine, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration. With just weeks to go until the Games, Mr Vine added the queues are lengthening even though these amateurs are asking less questions than full time border staff. Chaos: Rookie staff with little or no training are manning immigration desks at Heathrow during the Olympics . The UK Border Force is also rehiring ex-employees who left their jobs as it prepares to deal with more than 100,000 passengers a day during the busiest periods of the Olympics, he revealed. Some staff 'remained concerned about the potential risks of employing staff on the immigration control who had received only basic training and who had no immigration background/experience', Mr Vine said in his report. 'Staff also expressed concerns about similar problems recurring after the Olympics, if resources were not sufficient to meet the increasing passenger flows coming through Heathrow.' Only yesterday huge queues were building up at . Heathrow Airport after half of all the immigration desks . were shut - even though the Olympics are just weeks away. Official figures showed the wait at immigration control for non-EU passengers was 56 minutes despite a 45 minute target. Complaints: Border inspector John Vine says that problems are getting worse not better . Immigration Minister Damian Green has pledged that all immigration desks at the UK's largest airport will be staffed during busy times from Sunday to avoid what Labour MP David Winnick said could be a 'national embarrassment' of long queues. Some 500 extra staff have been drafted in to achieve this, including those who had retired or moved on to other jobs, and all are having a positive impact on queues, the Border Force said. Mr Vine said the Olympics measures will involve 're-employing former immigration staff who had left the business (or who may be working elsewhere within Border Force, the UK Border Agency or the Home Office)'. Training will also be given to other Home Office and UKBA staff to enable them to work on the immigration desks, known as the primary control point, the report said. But the inspection in April found that officers brought in to the immigration desks from the secondary examination area 'appeared less confident when processing passengers'. 'This meant they often took longer to process them and asked fewer probing questions,' the inspectors said. 'We felt this affected how efficiently and effectively Border Force was able to progress passengers through the terminal.' Mr Vine added: 'Moving forward Border Force must ensure any new framework of border security checks, set out in its operating mandate, are resourced appropriately to deliver an efficient and effective service.' He also questioned whether equipment to detect forged documents was being used correctly as detection levels in Terminal 3 were more than a third lower than in Terminal 4. Some 275 forgeries were detected in Terminal 4 between April 2010 and March this year, compared with 177 in Terminal 3. Some staff reported that this was 'partly the result of faulty forgery detection equipment at some of the desks' in Terminal 3. Busy: Heathrow will see an unprecedented number of passengers fly in during the Games but there are fears they won't cope . 'We are aware that some of this variation might be explained by the different types of passenger traffic at each terminal,' Mr Vine said. 'However, we believe that Border Force should commence work to ensure that issues around use of equipment and training are not having an adverse impact on forgery detection.' A Border Force spokeswoman said the report showed there had been 'real improvements at Heathrow'. 'John Vine acknowledges the positive addition of hundreds of extra staff deployed to meet demand, the creation of a central control room to manage resources and on-going recruitment of more border officers,' she said. 'Border Force has already addressed concerns raised during the April inspection including staff being issued with the operating mandate to reinforce clear standards for carrying out border checks. 'We are also working with (airport operator) BAA on improving queue measurement, looking at securing staffing levels for the long-term and continued training and mentoring for contingency staff to ensure they carry out efficient and secure check on passengers.' Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: 'The Olympic countdown has started yet the Home Secretary still hasn't sorted the chaos at our borders caused by her decision to cut so many staff this year. 'Re-employing former immigration staff, having cut nearly 900 people from the Border Force since the general election, is a damning self-admission of failure and a waste of taxpayer's money too. 'The scale of staff cuts and the Home Secretary's failure to sort out the management problems has meant queues of over two hours just weeks before the Olympics start. 'The Government say UKBA had a 'bad April', but the truth is they're having a bad year because of this Government's failure.' She added that the report 'raises serious concerns that as well as long queues, people who should be questioned further are not being properly examined'. Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said: 'I am deeply concerned that the Border Force staff being placed at immigration desks lack the proper training to conduct thorough immigration checks. 'With millions of people set to arrive at Heathrow over the Olympic period this situation is unacceptable. It must be rectified quickly.' Immigration minister Damian Green declined to confirm that all desks would be open at Heathrow at peak times beyond the Olympics. 'What we will do is revert to normal - normal in terms of making sure that the number of desks occupied are appropriate for the number of passengers because the actual flow of passengers does change very rapidly,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Challenged to say whether all desks would be open at peak times after the Olympics, he said: 'At peak times before the Olympics we have made a commitment and what we will do is do our best to ensure that the desks at peak times, there will obviously be more people there than at not peak times. 'We will be much more scientific about when and where people are there to cope with the flows as they come in.'","Chief inspector John Vine says the move is making waiting times longer not shorter .

"Vibrio bacteria can cause gastroenteritis and cholera in humans . Normally found growing in warm and tropical waters, the bacteria now thrives in the Baltic Sea as a result of rising temperatures caused by climate change, scientists say . A temperature rise of one degree resulted in a 200 per cent increase in the number of Vibrio cases . Chances of getting a Vibrio infection still 'relatively low', say experts . By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 04:31 EST, 23 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:32 EST, 23 July 2012 . Thriving: Vibrio bacteria strains will continue to appear in new areas as ocean temperatures rise, experts say . The unexpected outbreak of a group of bacteria in northern Europe that can cause infectious diseases such as gastroenteritis is largely down to man-made climate change, new research shows. A study by a group of international experts has provided some of the first firm evidence that the warming patterns of the Baltic Sea have coincided with the emergence of Vibrio infections in northern Europe. Vibrios - a group of bacteria that is normally found growing in warm and tropical marine environments - can cause an array of infections in humans ranging from cholera to gastroenteritis-like symptoms from eating raw or undercooked shellfish, or from exposure to seawater. Symptoms of gastroenteritis include diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea and stomach cramps. A team of scientists from Britain, Finland, Spain and the U.S. found the number and distribution of Vibrio cases in the Baltic sea area was strongly linked to peaks in sea surface temperatures. Each year the temperature rose one degree, the number of Vibrio cases rose almost 200 per cent. 'The big apparent increases that we've seen during heat wave years...tend to indicate that climate change is indeed driving infections,' Craig Baker-Austin from the UK-based Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science told Reuters. The team of scientists examined sea surface temperature records and satellite data, as well as statistics on Vibrio cases in the Baltic. Climate studies show that rising greenhouse gas emissions made global average surface temperatures increase by about 0.17 degrees Celsius per decade from 1980 to 2010. The scientists focused on the Baltic Sea in particular because it warmed at an unprecedented rate of 0.063 to 0.078 degrees Celsius a year from 1982 to 2010, or 6.3 to 7.8 degrees a century. '(It) represents, to our knowledge, the fastest warming marine ecosystem examined so far anywhere on earth,' said the paper, which was published in the journal Nature Climate Change on Sunday. Many marine bacteria thrive in warm, low-saline sea water. Climate change has also resulted in more frequent and heavier rainfall, which has reduced the salt content of estuaries and coastal wetlands. As ocean temperatures continue to rise and coastal regions in northern areas become less saline, Vibrio bacteria strains will appear in new areas, the scientists said. Rising temperatures: The Baltic Sea represents the 'fastest warming marine eco-system examined so far anywhere on earth' Vibrio outbreaks have also been recorded in temperate and cold regions in Chile, Peru, Israel, the northwest U.S. Pacific and northwest Spain, and these can be linked to warming patterns, according to the research team. 'Very few studies have looked at the risk of these infections at high latitudes,' Mr Baker-Austin said. 'Certainly the chances of getting a Vibrio infection are considered to be relatively low, and more research is focused on areas where these diseases are endemic or at least more common,' he added. Previous Vibrio outbreaks in colder regions have often been put down to a sporadic event or special conditions rather than a response to long-term climate change. This is because the effects of global warming can be more pronounced at higher latitudes and in areas which lack detailed historical climate data, the study said. The scientist said there was a growing awareness that climate and the emergence of some infectious diseases are closely linked, but added that there are 'huge data gaps in that area which need addressing'.","Vibrio bacteria can cause gastroenteritis and cholera in humans .

Argentina has launched a vitriolic attack on the British Government in response to criticism over its provocative Olympic advert filmed on the Falkland Islands. Last week, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond called on Argentina to  apologise for the advert, which was filmed secretly and shows an athlete using a British war memorial in his training. But yesterday, after several days of silence, the Argentine government hit back, accusing Britain of killing and maiming innocent civilians. Spat: Argentine Foreign Secretary Hector Timmerman accused Defence Minister Phillip Hammond of being a 'thug' during his savage attack on Britain over the Falklands . Disagreement: Mr Hammond had recently called on Argentina to apologise for an advert in which it laid claim to the Falklands . Its reply, in a 1,000-word press . release titled ‘Let’s Honour The Dead By Building Peace’, was a bitter . assault on Mr Hammond, the British Government and Britain’s record on . human rights. Argentina’s foreign secretary, Hector . Timerman, claimed Mr Hammond ‘ought to know the world is a safer place . when you use creativity instead of bombing civilians in independent . countries’. He added: ‘Britain’s Defence Minister . [sic] demands, like a mighty knight, that Argentina expresses its regret . for the creativity of an advert which sums up what we feel. He has . still not explained what punishment he will select if we refuse to obey . his demands.’ Argentina’s claim of sovereignty over . the Falkland Islands, which it calls Las Malvinas, have been renewed . recently surrounding the 30th anniversary its invasion of the islands on . April 2, 1982. In his response, Mr Timerman condemned . the British Government’s refusal to enter negotiations over the . islands’ future. He said: ‘Nothing is more disrespectful with the memory . of those who lost their lives on the battlefield than the shameful . decision to block the progress of peace.’ Opening scene: After a caption reading 'Islas Malvinas', the Argentinian name for the Falkand Islands, hockey player Fernando Zylberberg is seen stepping out early in the morning for a run . Passing ALL the sights: As rousing music reaches its eventual peak, the athlete in the Argentinian Falklands ad jogs past the office of the Penguin News, a weekly Falkland Islands newspaper . The advert was shot secretly by an . international ad agency and sold to the Argentine government, which has . screened it dozens of times on national TV. In the advert, Argentine . hockey player Fernando Zylberberg was shown doing step-ups on the . Falklands’ Great War Memorial, which honours British sailors who died . battling the German fleet in 1914. It also shows him running past the . office of Falklands newspaper The Penguin News and doing arm-raises . outside Port Stanley’s Globe Tavern. It ends with the slogan: ‘To . compete on English soil, we are training on Argentine soil.’ Obvious landmarks: As the advert progresses, Olympic hopeful Fernando Zylberberg can be seen limbering up outside the Globe Tavern, a popular pub in Port Stanley . Pointed message: With the rugged countryside in the background: 'To compete on English soil' The advert provoked a furious reaction . from the British Government, Falkland Islands authorities and Falklands . War veterans, including Simon Weston who branded it an ‘insult’. Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of . advertising giant WPP, which part owns the agency which created the . advert, has condemned it as ‘totally unacceptable’. Mr Timerman, who has previously . blasted British 'imperial decadence', claimed Britain’s ‘Defence .

"By . Sean Poulter . PUBLISHED: . 18:14 EST, 20 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:14 EST, 20 May 2012 . Baby boomers trying to ‘downsize’ are driving the housing market, say researchers. Trading down from a large family house is now the single biggest reason given for selling by  homeowners approaching estate agents, says property market expert Rightmove. Some 40 per cent of sellers say they are looking to trade down, compared with 25 per cent who hope to trade up to a larger more expensive property. Downsize: Trading down from a large family house is now the single biggest reason given for selling by homeowners approaching estate agents . Trading down is the biggest reason for moving home in nine out of ten regions in England and Wales. The only area where those trading up outnumbers those trading down is London, where there is a higher concentration of equity-rich buyers. Rightmove said those trading down are generally from the baby boom generation, who have seen a sharp rise in the value of their homes in previous years, but are short of easily available cash. The high cost of living, coupled with rock-bottom interest rates on savings and poor returns on personal pension investments, has left many retired people struggling to pay the bills. Commentary: Miles Shipside, director of Rightmove, said the ability to trade up was a vital component of a healthy housing market . At the same time, many need cash to help their adult children cover debts or pay for the deposit on a property of their own. These people are rich on paper - in terms of property wealth - but they are short of the cash they need to fund their lifestyles and family commitments. Rightmove said the trend in downsizing is putting a cap on house price rises, after it found that there was no increase in the average property asking price in May compared with April. The company puts the average asking price across England and Wales at £243,759. At the same time, the number of new properties coming on to the market was an average of 26,595 in May, which was down by 10per cent on April. This is the first time there has been no increase in the 11 years it has been surveying the market. Recent increases in mortgage interest rates have further dampened market activity, it said. Miles Shipside, director of Rightmove, said: ‘There are more old people at the top of the chain trying to downsize and fewer at the bottom trying or able to trade up. 'The ability to trade up is a vital component of a healthy housing market. ‘Some people may be facing redundancy and looking to reduce their outgoings, and others may be looking to supplement their underperforming pension pots. 'With overall market volumes already in the doldrums, we need a fair and consistent wind of mortgage lending to prompt a speedier housing market recovery.’ The recession and the fact banks and building societies are rationing mortgages also mean it is difficult for people to take out bigger loans in order to move up the property ladder. At the same time, recent increases in mortgage interest rates have further dampened market activity.","Forty per cent of sellers looking to trade down, but only 25 per cent hope to trade up .

The third Georgia victim of a rare flesh-eating bacteria underwent a sixth surgery as doctors begin to rebuild his groin after removing two pound of tissue in an attempt to fight the deadly disease. Bobby Vaughn, 33, says the infection that set in after he received a cut on his side nearly killed him because he didn't take care of it quickly enough. The man from Catersville, Georgia, is recovering at Doctors Hospital in Augusta, the same place where Aimee Copeland, 24, lost her leg, her foot and both hands to the disease after it spread rapidly across her body. Lucky to be alive: Bobby Vaughn watched his infection grow from the size of a peanut to the size of a grapefruit . Two victims: Aimee Copeland, 24, (right) was infected when she was cut after falling from a homemade zipline. Lana Kuykendall (left) came down with the disease after giving birth to twins . Surgeons are beginning to use skin grafts to repair the open wounds that he has after a half-dozen surgeries, he told the Atlanta Journal Constitution. 'They have to rebuild my groin area, he said. 'But I'm feeling much better now.' Mr Vaughn's condition has improved from 'critical' to 'good' after being admitted to Doctors Hospital, spokeswoman Barclay Bishop told Mail Online. However, Mr Vaughn, a landscaper, said his stubbornness almost cost him his life. After he received a small cut on his thigh, near his groin, while cutting weeds, Mr Vaughn said he started to throw up. When the gash swelled, he went to the hospital in Cartersville. Two pounds of flesh: Mr Vaugh had to endure five surgeries, but doctors believe they have removed the infected tissue . Aimee Copeland, pictured, a 24-year-old graduate student at the University of West Georgia, suffered a nasty cut on her thigh when her zipline broke and she plunged into the Little Tallapoosa River, east of Atlanta. Doctors stapled the wound shut, but it became infected with a flesh-eating bacteria on May 4. Surgeons amputated her leg, but by then the disease had spread rapidly. On Saturday, they also amputated her foot and both hands. Now she finally appears to be on the mend, despite being in critical condition. She breathed on her own for 10 hours on Sunday, the first time since being admitted to the hospital. Lana Kuykendall, 36, pictured with her husband, had been home just 13 hours after giving birth to twins at  Emory University Hospital when she noticed a painful spot on her leg last on May 11. Mrs Kuykendall is a paramedic and her husband Darren is a firefighter, so they recognized quickly that something was wrong. Her husband rushed her to Greenville Memorial Hospital in South Carolina. While they waited to be seen, the couple watched in horror as the spot on Mrs Kuykendall's leg grew a quarter of an inch in one hours. She has now undergone seven surgeries to remove the infected tissue and is currently listed in critical condition. Doctors there put him on antibiotics and wanted to keep him for observation. 'Being the man that I am,' Vaughn told the Journal Constitution, he refused and went home. That's when he took a dramatic turn for the worse. The wound swelled from the size of a peanut to the size of a grapefruit, he said. The next day, he went back to the hospital where doctors told him he was close to death. They rushed him into surgery and began cutting out the infected flesh. Despite the public attention on the horrific disease, Ms Bishop said her hospital, which has a nationally-recognized burn and wound clinic, sees about 50 cases of it each year. The nation focused on flesh-eating bacterial infection, called necatoriasis fasciitis, as Ms Copeland's terrifying ordeal. Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat. The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications. Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons. The graduate student caught it after cutting herself on a homemade zip that broke and sent her plunging into Georgia's Little Tallapoosa River at the beginning of this month. Her father announced on Sunday that she was able to breathe for 10 hours without a respirator, a new milestone in her long road to recovery. Lana Kuykendall, 36, contracted the condition May 11 just hours leaving Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, where she gave birth to twins. She is in critical but stable condition after undergoing seven operations to remove dead and infected tissue from her leg. Doctors say that despite the strange surge in cases of the rare disease, the three infections are not related. Mr Vaughn said he realized immediately after he received the cut that something was wrong. 'I just out of the blue wasn't feeling real well, and I went over and sat in my truck for a minute, and I was feeling real hot, and I started vomiting, you know, so we just stopped for the day,' he told CBS Atlanta. Like Miss Copeland and Mrs Kuyrkendal, Mr Vaughn was rushed into emergency surgery, where doctors cut out as much of the infected tissue as they could. Vaughn said he's slowly recovering after doctors managed to stem the spread of the rare infection. 'I was told I was just a day or two from being dead or losing entire parts of my body,' he told NBC 11.","Bobby Vaughn, 32, is recovering at the same hospital as Aimee Copeland, the first victim of necrotitis faciitis .

Three students from a top high school in a wealthy community in Upstate New York have been arrested after they allegedly abducted 15 eighth grade boys, forced them into cars and flogged them with a board at a remote wildlife preserve. Police say the violent attacks were part of an annual 'Freshman Fridays' hazing ritual that has persisted for years. School officials warned parents that their children could be targeted, but were evidently powerless to stop the assaults. One of the boys was beaten so badly on Friday that he had to be hospitalized, according to authorities. Scroll down for video . Hiding: Tristan Scragg. 17, tries to conceal his face from cameras after he was arrested on charges he kidnapped and beat younger students . Accountable: Sean Pinson, 17, and Max Meyerson, 16, also tried to dodge the cameras as they ran to waiting cars after their release from jail . Police in Westchester County say Sean Pinson and Tristan Scragg, both 17, and Max Meyerson, 16, snatched 15 boys from the public library in Rye, New York, and drove them to a secluded nature preserve. The abducted teens were all middle school students who will be freshman at Rye High School next year. According to students, the prestigious public school has a tradition of juniors initiating the new students into high school with pranks and hazing. 'It's been happening for a number of years,' a Rye High School student told WABC. 'They don't usually do anything about it, the cops.' This year, threats to the younger students were so real that a middle school principal sent parents a note warning them to be on the lookout for marauding high school boys. Posh: Rye High School is a wealthy, top-performing public school in an upscale community in Upstate New York . Ongoing problem: School officials say the 'Freshman Friday' hazing is a ritual that has lasted for years. Pictured are Tristan Scragg (left) and Sean Pinson (right), both 17 . Too far: Max Meyerson, 16, is one of the juniors who is accused of participating in the beatings . 'Fear is in the air at Rye Middle School. There is a lot of chatter that June 4 is Freshman Friday, and eighth grade boys are fearful they are going to be attacked by balloons filled with Nair and have their bottoms smacked with paddles. It is hard to tell what is rumor and what is actually going to happen,' Rye Middle School principal Ann Edwards wrote, according to local blog MyRye.com. 'For several years, an odious spring tradition has taken place in Rye: junior boys paddle eighth grade boys off school grounds. In recent years we have heard of fewer instances of paddling, but the practice has not been extinguished.' That fear was apparently warranted. Driving in two cars, Pinson, Scragg ad Meyerson picked up the students and took them to Marshlands Concervancy in Rye. There, police say, they used a 'large piece of lumber' to wallop the younger boys. One of the middle schoolers had to be treated at a hospital after the assault. Despite claims that the behavior has taken place for years, superintendent Edward Shine told WABC that the schools have been working to stop it. 'Some have suggested that these alleged acts are part of an annual ""tradition"" at Rye High School. Let me be clear: just because a small handful of students choose to believe that this is the case, does not make it a fact.

A driver escaped virtually unharmed after his van hurtled into a pair of trees and he found himself trapped within the mangled remains. Delivery driver James Whittaker, 22, was on the A64 near York in the early hours of Saturday morning, when his van left the road and ploughed into a tree on his passenger side, before veering to the right and crashing into another tree. The second tree stopped the vehicle rolling further down an embankment, but the double impact sliced the roof off Mr Whittaker's Vauxhall Vivaro and reduced the van into a twisted heap of metal. The twisted remains of James Whittaker's van after it left the A64 near York and crashed twice into trees . Mr Whittaker, who lives in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, said he did not remember what caused the crash, but recalled finding himself wedged within the battered van. Miraculously, he did not break a single bone in the impact and came away with superficial wounds. He said: 'Apparently, the police, ambulance and firefighters didn’t expect to find me alive. I’m so lucky. I’ve seen pictures of other crashes and the cars don’t look half as bad as mine. 'I can’t believe I made it out without major injuries. 'All I suffered was a cut to my forehead, a few grazes on my legs and a bruised foot, nothing really. 'The worst injury I had was a cut on my hand from windscreen glass, but even that happened after the crash when I was trying to get out of the van.' Mr Whittaker, who started working for his father's Sheffield-based delivery service, Dedicated Couriers Ltd, had begun his shift at midnight. He said: 'The last thing I remember is making a delivery in Beverley earlier in the night. At the time of the crash I was on the A64, apparently driving from Scarborough to York, but I don’t remember being there.' Mr Whittaker came round after the impact to find a Polish truck driver, who had passed by the accident, calling 999. When ambulance and fire services arrived on the scene they removed him from the wrecked vehicle. The roof of the Vauxhall Vivaro was sliced off in the impact, but miraculously driver James Whittaker escaped relatively unharmed . He explained: 'They didn’t even have to cut the roof off as it was already gone. They just cut some of the steering wheel so I could be pulled out.' The lucky driver was taken off to York Hospital with a neck brace, as a precaution, but a CT scan and x-rays revealed that incredibly, James had not suffered any fractures. He has suffered some memory loss, but doctors have told him he may get his full memory back at some point. Police believe the accident happened around 4am, the same time his Tom Tom navigation system stopped working, but it is still unknown what caused it. Lucky: James Whittaker escaped from the crash with a few superficial cuts and bruises . Mr Whittaker added: 'The Tom Tom system records speed and I wasn’t driving over the speed limit. It was very wet and windy so it could have been that I skidded, and the police say I could have fallen asleep. “But I was talking to my friend on my hands free kit at 3.50am, so I would have been quite alert and the doctor thought it was unlikely that I would have dropped off so quickly.' Looking at pictures of the written-off van, which is undergoing tests to determine if there was a fault with it, Mr Whittaker credited wearing his seat belt for his miraculous escape. He said: “I can’t believe how lucky I was. I just keep thinking, if there had been anyone in the passenger seat, they wouldn’t have stood a chance. “My girlfriend Brodie usually comes with me on my Friday night and Saturday morning shift, but luckily this week she came on Wednesday instead. It’s just so lucky she wasn’t with me.” Mr Whittaker added: ""When I look at pictures of the wreckage, I can't believe I wasn't more badly injured or killed. If there had been anyone in the passenger seat, they wouldn't have stood a chance.""","James Whittaker was left wedged within the twisted remains of his van after it left the road and ploughed into two trees .

A group of passengers from a JetBlue flight which was forced to make an emergency landing after the pilot suffered a midair meltdown have filed a lawsuit against both the airline and the pilot, it has emerged. The suit, filed by 10 passengers of JetBlue flight 191, accuses the airline of failing to properly supervise the pilot, Clayton Osbon. Osbon, 49, who lives near Savannah, Georgia, had to be physically restrained after running through the cabin yelling about Jesus and Al-Qaida during a New York to Las Vegas flight on March 27. Legal action: A group of passengers from a JetBlue flight which was forced to make an emergency landing after pilot Clayton Osbon, pictured, suffered a midair meltdown have filed a lawsuit against both the airline and the pilot . He has also been charged by federal authorities with interfering in the operations of a flight crew, which was forced to land in Amarillo, Texas. The court papers said JetBlue 'was grossly negligent in retaining defendant Osbon, whom JetBlue knew or should have known was unfit to be entrusted with the aircraft as pilot.' The suit, which was filed in New York State Supreme Court in the Queens borough of New York City, seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. Plaintiff Michael Bedziner, 48, of Commack, N.Y, who was headed to a conference of security consultants, said that since the September 11 attacks, he has often looked around airplane cabins, suspicious of who may be a terrorist.

Outnumbered: The captain was subdued thanks to the help of passengers on the flight 'packed with burly men' heading to the 2012 International Security Conference in Las Vegas . 'What I got from him was, ""You're not going to make it to Las Vegas."" 'It was extremely frightening, it was extremely unnerving. I still haven't gotten a good night's sleep,' Mr Signoretti said . The FBI says that while he was at the controls of the Airbus A320 about halfway into the five-hour flight, Osbon said, 'Things just don't matter,' and told the flight's first officer, 'We're not going to Vegas.' The pilot suddenly left the cockpit and started running up and down the aisle in a wild rant, banging on a restroom door, and attempted to force his way back into the cockpit, which by then had been locked by the co-pilot, First Officer Jason Dowd. Held: JetBlue captain Clayton Osbon is pictured right being escorted by FBI agents . The lawsuit claims he was 'yelling about September 11th, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Al-Qaida and terrorists.' Other comments, according to the suit, included: 'We're all going down,' 'you better start praying right now,' 'I'm going to show you Iraq and Iran right now,' 'there's a bomb on board,' and 'the plane will never make it to Vegas.' Several passengers restrained Osbon while Mr Dowd safely landed the plane. A flight attendant's ribs were bruised as passengers tried to restrain Osbon, but no one on board was seriously injured. Meltdown: Osbon had to be physically restrained after running through the cabin yelling about Jesus and Al-Qaida during a New York to Las Vegas flight on March 27. This is a file picture of a JetBlue plane . JetBlue has not yet reviewed the suit and has a policy against commenting on pending litigation, company spokeswoman Alison Croyle said. Attorneys Jonathan Reiter and Steve Epstein, who represent the 10 plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said they intend to seek information on whether there were any indications Osbon had shown signs of mental instability before March 27. 'We're going to have to delve into that,' Mr Reiter said. ""That is one of the things this lawsuit is about."" Osbon faces a hearing Friday morning in Amarillo to determine if he is mentally competent to stand trial. He faces federal charges of interfering with a flight crew. If convicted, he could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison.","Ten passengers of .

The military mothers who posed for photographs while breastfeeding in their uniform were out of line, the Washington Air National Guard said on Saturday. Terran Echegoyen-McCabe and Christina Luna are pictured nursing their babies on an Air Force base in an image that they said was intended to raise awareness of the right to breastfeed in public. But the controversial photoshoot was a violation of regulations against using the uniform to promote a civilian cause, according to Guard spokesman Capt. Keith Kosik. Proud: Servicewomen Terran Echegoyen-McCabe, left, breastfeeds her twin daughters while wearing her uniform alongside colleague Christina Luna and her little girl at Fairchild Airforce Base outside Spokane, Washington . He told the New York Daily News the pair were not expected to . face disciplinary action but that the incident warranted a formal . response for educational purposes. The striking image has seen a flurry . of comments, from supporters who say breastfeeding is a 'fundamental . right' to another who compared it to 'defecating in uniform'. The photos were taken for the Mom2Mom Breastfeeding Support Group, set up by a military wife and mother-of-three to raise awareness of all women's rights to breastfeed in public. Mrs Echegoyen-McCabe is pictured . breastfeeding her 10-month-old twin girls on her lunch break during a drill weekend as a member of the Air National Guard. By her side is friend Mrs Luna who feeds her toddler. Crystal Scott, founder of Mom2Mom, asked the women to pose for the support group she founded in January to help those who live and work at the Fairchild  Air Force Base outside Spokane, Washington. Mrs Scott has lived on the base for four years with her husband Kevin, an instructor, and their three children Gavin, ten, Aiden, four and one-year-old Roman. It was her idea to asked photographer Brynja Sigurdardottir to photograph the mothers in their fatigues ahead of National Breastfeeding Awareness Month in August. Following the photoshoot two weeks ago, the image of the military mothers breastfeeding was posted online and became a red-hot issue. Mrs Scott told MailOnline: 'We were not expecting it.

Nurture: Founder of Mom2Mom Crystal Scott also posed with her son Roman to raise awareness of breastfeeding in public . Although there has been a rally of . support, one Facebook comment compared the image of the mothers in . uniform to 'urinating and defecating'. Mrs Scott said: 'No one can agree on everything and everyone is 100 per cent entitled to their opinion. 'But to compare breastfeeding to other bodily functions like defecating and urinating? It's disheartening and saddening.' She added: 'We've done nothing wrong. We're not disgracing the uniform, we are very proud. 'We can only hope that it brings positive changes not only for military but for women across the board to show them they don't have to hide in the closet.' 'We love our military. We don't want to go against them at all.' There are currently no clear regulations as to whether or not a military member in uniform is allowed to breastfeed. We've done nothing wrong. We're not disgracing the uniform, we are very proud. Crystal Scott, founder of Mom2Mom Breastfeeding Support Group . There has been much confusion over this issue with some servicewomen being asked to move to private rooms while at the same time nothing has been said to women feeding their babies from bottles. The Mom2Mom Facebook page has been flooded with comments. Tracy Mueller Schoesler wrote: 'What strong beautiful women who are not just fighting for the freedoms of this country but for themselves and their children! Breastfeeding is a fundamental right in or out of an uniform!' One supporter Anna Krause commented: 'This is great. You are still A mom no matter what.'

Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn once tried to seduce France's new First Lady Valerie Trierweiler when he was an MP in Paris, a new book has claimed. But the economist was snubbed after he attempted his 'chat up line' on French president Francois Hollande's glamorous girlfriend. The latest revelations about 63-year-old Strauss-Kahn's notorious womansing were made in a new biography by French journalists Raphaelle Bacque and Ariane Chemin. Le snub: Dominique Strass-Khan, left, asked First Lady Valerie Trierweiler, right, 'how is the prettiest journalist in Paris?' a decade ago - but she rebuffed his chat-up line, a new book claims . DSK, married to former television presenter Anne Sinclair, approached Ms Trierweiler while she was working as a political reporter in Paris ten years ago, the book claims. He asked her: 'And how is the prettiest journalist in Paris?' But the new First Lady, now 47, hit back swiftly: 'I thought that was Anne Sinclair.' The book also recounts how former President Nicolas Sarkozy 'laughed uncontrollably' when told that Strauss-Kahn had been caught with prostitutes at a woodland orgy in Paris. His security chief Alain Gardere told Mr Sarkozy in 2007 that police had come across Strauss-Kahn cavorting with hookers in Paris's sleazy Bois de Boulogne a year earlier. An officer discovered DSK in a car having a group sex session with several prostitutes and reported the matter to police chiefs. The new book, called Les Strauss-Khan, says: 'When Mr Sarkozy was informed he broke out into an uncontrollable throaty laugh.' First lady: France's new President Francois Hollande and and his partner Valerie Trierweiler - who he has not married leave the Elysee Palace after his inauguration . But he then swore his officials to secrecy because Strauss-Kahn was about to be appointed as the new boss of the International Monetary Fund in Washington DC. Mr Sarkozy is quoted as saying: 'He will no doubt get the IMF job. Let's keep this to ourselves, alright?' But the president later warned Mr Strauss-Kahn about his behaviour once he was working in the US, telling him: 'Over there they don't joke about this sort of thing. 'Your life will be passed under a magnifying glass. Avoid taking the lift alone with interns. France cannot permit a scandal.' Strauss-Kahn - once tipped as the next president of France - then became embroiled in a catalogue of sex scandals after being arrested for trying to rape a New York hotel chambermaid in May last year. Prettiest woman in Paris: Anne Sinclair, left, with economist Dominique Strauss-Kahn .

One hooker has told police that Strauss-Kahn took part in a gang rape at a group sex session, but she has not yet made an official complaint. Another call girl told investigators the orgies she attended with Strauss-Kahn and his cronies were 'like cattle markets'.

"Donna Jones from Mikado, Michigan, said she feels rejected by the store as it launches youth-oriented ad campaigns filled with celebrities and same-sex couples . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:06 EST, 11 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:25 EST, 11 June 2012 . A longtime JCPenney customer is demanding that the store return to its 'frumpy' roots. As the retail giant sets its sights on a younger demographic, Donna Jones, a mother of three from Mikado, Michigan, has expressed disapproval over the store's new range of clothing. Ms Jones believes the store is working hard to 'de-frump' itself without 'considering that many, if not most, of its customers might have shopped there precisely because they like the more conservative look.' Disappointed: Longtime JCPenney customers, such as Donna Jones (right), want the store to quit its attempts to 'de-frump' its clothing range. She thinks its current stock is not suitable for daughter Nicole Walen (left) The 46-year-old added that the clothes are not suitable for her 15-year-old daughter Nicole Walen, due to new revealing hemlines. She . believes the clothing, particularly dresses made for teenagers such as . her daughter, has become more revealing over . the past six months. She told The Huffington Post: 'Having too much skin showing on a pretty teenage girl is too . distracting, especially at church. [JCPenney] seemed to . be better about providing enough fabric than other stores that the . teenage girls tend to like to shop at.' She added: 'Am I frumpy? Probably. Does that bother me? No, not at all.' Ms Jones believed that the shift in target audience is thanks to the arrival of Ron Johnson, who was appointed chief executive officer last November. Under the direction of Mr Johnson, the retailer has adopted new marketing strategies such as placing same-sex couples in multiple ad campaigns as well as supermodel Cindy Crawford in another. New strategy: The store has recently aimed to attract younger shoppers through edgy fashion campaigns such as the above featuring supermodel Cindy Crawford (right), her mother (middle) and her daughter Kaia (left) Controversial: Another recent campaign used a same-sex couple (right) to promote the store's clothing . Contemporary design collaborations . with the likes of Vivienne Tam and Cynthia Rowley have further hinted . that the store hopes to attract younger shoppers rather than older ones. The ultimate indicator came when it . announced its forthcoming collaboration with Cosmopolitan magazine, . which will include bags, jewellery, lingerie and accessories no doubt . targeted at the teen market. Ms Jones admitted that she avoids her local JCPenney store altogether these days. Lynda H, a regular JCPenney customer from Texas, does not welcome the store's new attitude either. 'They are catering to the younger shopper and it isn't the younger shopper that kept them afloat,' she said. The store announced that it will introduce a 'Main Street' section in many of its locations later this year, that will feature almost 100 separate branded stores inside its own store in an attempt to create a marketplace feel. While the initiative will only be introduced at 'major metropolitan area' stores, the move is a combative one against one of its main competitors Target, which launched its similar Shop At Target concept last month.","Donna Jones from Mikado, Michigan, said she feels rejected by the store as it launches youth-oriented ad campaigns filled with celebrities and same-sex couples ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 03:11 EST, 14 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:31 EST, 14 June 2012 . Brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Assad's forces are murdering civilians in organised attacks on towns and villages that amount to crimes against humanity, Amnesty International said today. The rights group has now repeated its call for the United Nations Security Council to refer Syria to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and to impose an arms embargo. Amnesty's findings, detailed in a 70-page report, add to reports of massacres elsewhere in Syria as the 15-month-old uprising against President Bashar Assad was declared a civil war. It comes as a booby-trapped car exploded in a Damascus suburb this morning, wounding at least two people. Blast: A car bomb exploded in Damascus today as Amnesty International accused Syrian dictator Bashar Assad of crimes against humanity . Aftermath: The bomb exploded in a suburb home to a popular Shiite Muslim shrine, wounding at least two . Devastation: Damaged shops at the site of a car bomb in the Sayyida Zeinab suburb of Damascus this morning . Researchers visited 23 towns and villages in the Aleppo and Idlib provinces between April and May. They conducted interviews with more than 200 people, including many whose relatives had been killed or whose homes had been destroyed. Amnesty adviser Donatella Rovera said she had found repeated examples of brutality against civilians during two months of unauthorised visits to northwest Syria. She said: 'Wherever I went, in every town, in every village, there was a very similar pattern. 'Soldiers who went in, in very large numbers, for very short but very brutal incursions where they extra-judicially executed young men, burned down their homes. 'Those who they arrested were then tortured in detention. And that was really repeated in every town and every village that I visited. Fighters: Free Syrian Army members, with covered faces and holding weapons, sit by the side of a street in the Qaboun district of Damascus . Plea: France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius (left) wants the UN to make Kofi Annan's (right) peace plan obligatory . 'The bulk, the overwhelming majority of the violations are being committed by the government security forces and their paramilitary militia against the civilian population.' A peace plan brokered by former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan has failed to end bloodshed that has cost the lives of more than 10,000 people. Syria's government says it is not cracking down on activists, but fighting foreign-backed 'terrorists' it blames for killing hundreds of soldiers and police. Witnesses quoted in the Amnesty report said most of those killed had nothing to do with the resistance to Assad's rule. A resident of Saraqeb in Idlib . province described how soldiers had carried out door-to-door searches, . killing people as they fled or in their homes. Conflict continues: An image grab taken from a video uploaded on YouTube on Monday shows smoke billowing from the flashpoint Syrian city of Homs which activists said was being attacked by regime forces . Demanding change: Demonstrators in Kafranbel, near Idlib hold a placard (left) that reads: 'Are you dumb? Is there any sane person who really believes there could be a peaceful solution?' He said: 'The army seemed to consider all the men in these towns, especially young men but not only, as terrorists. 'Most of those executed in this way . were not fighters, just ordinary people. Some were killed just because . the army could not find their wanted relatives.' Amnesty . said the report provided 'further evidence that deliberate and unlawful . killings are part of a widespread and systematic attack against the . civilian population'. A Labour town councillor who tweeted for the conflict in Syria to end claims his website has been hacked by supporters of dictator Bashar Assad's regime. A group calling itself Syria Storm has taken over the site detailing cllr Ben Hart's work for Lydd Town Council in Kent. Mr Hart, 23, said he was amazed someone thought his views were important enough to merit a personal attack. He said: 'I just don't understand it. I've spoken about Syria on Twitter, but mentioned nothing on my own website. 'I am not intimidated by the attack and it has given me the chance to go back and redesign it as I was intending to do anyway.' The homepage was left with a black background, a picture of the brutal Syrian leader, and the message it had been 'HaCk3d By Syrian Storm'. It was 'carried out in an organised manner and as part of state policy, and therefore amount to crimes against humanity'. Yesterday France called for the UN to enforce envoy Kofi Annan's six-point peace plan for Syria - in a move which could see force used against Assad's regime. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said he was hoping that Russia, a key ally of Syria, would agree to invoking the UN's Chapter 7 to make it happen. It allows the use of military force. The first stage could be to impose a No Fly Zone and allow humanitarian aid into the country. But, as seen in other conflicts, it could escalate to more drastic action if the regime doesn't bend to international demands. And echoing UN peacekeeping chief Herve Ladsous's comments the day before, he said the Syrian conflict was now a 'civil war'. He said: 'We propose making the implementation of the Annan plan compulsory. 'We need to pass to the next speed at the Security Council and place the Annan plan under Chapter 7 - that is to say make it compulsory under pain of very heavy sanctions.' France would propose toughening sanctions on Syria at the next meeting of EU foreign ministers, he added. And the international community would prepare a list of second-ranking military officials who would be pursued by international justice, alongside President Bashar Assad and his immediate entourage. He said: 'They must understand that the only future is in resisting oppression. The time for taking a decision has arrived. They have to jump ship.' International attention: UN observers view bodies at a hospital morgue before the burial of the Houla dead . Outrage: Mourners attend a mass burial in Syria for more than 100 people, half of whom were children, killed in a massacre in the city of Houla last month . The chaos continued today as a car bomb exploded in a Damascus suburb home to a popular Shiite Muslim shrine, wounding at least two people. Activists said regime troops were also continuing to shell rebellious areas in central Homs province. It was not immediately clear what the target of Thursday's blast in Sayyida Zainab was. State news said the car bomb detonated in a parking lot near the Imam Sadr Hospital, causing substantial material damage. Car bombs and suicide bombings have become common in Syria as the 15-month uprising against President Bashar Assad has become increasingly militarised with both sides of the conflict now using more powerful weapons. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three civilians were killed overnight in clashes at the entrances of the Jouret el-Shayyah neighborhood in Homs city. Another died in the rebel-held town of Rastan north of Homs, which has been under constant and intense fire from regime forces for days. Syrian forces yesterday overran a mountain enclave near the Mediterranean coast, seizing the territory back from rebels after battles that raged for eight days. State television said regime forces had 'cleansed' Haffa of 'armed terrorist groups' and the Foreign Ministry urged UN observers to immediately head there 'to check what the terrorist groups have done'. UN observers did not go to Haffa yesterday though and are assessing the situation to determine when they can successfully reach the town, UN peacekeeping spokesman Kieran Dwyer said. On Tuesday, an angry crowd hurled rocks and sticks at the UN mission's vehicles, forcing them to turn back. None of the observers was hurt. Sausan Ghosheh, a spokeswoman for the observers, said they have been trying to reach Haffa since June 7.","Rights group calls for United Nations to impose arms embargo on Syria .

The London Paralympic Games are expected to be the greatest ever celebration of sporting achievement by disabled athletes. But many feel it will also provide a golden opportunity to change attitudes about disability away from the competitive limelight. One of those is Priscilla Sutton, the curator of a pioneering exhibition called Spare Parts that uses prostethic limbs as the focal point of its art. 'We're not bionic machines': Amputee Priscilla Sutton arranges pieces for her exhibition Spare Parts, which turns prostethic limbs into art . Priscilla says she is a 'much more confident woman' since becoming an amputee in 2005 and hopes the Games will challenge people's perceptions about how the human body is supposed to look. 'There is still a taboo around about prosthetics and many people aren't sure if they should talk about them or look at them,' she told HuffPost Lifestyle. 'Amputees are just like everyone else, but just happen to have a part of their body missing. We're not scary and we are not bionic machines.' Breaking a taboo: Priscilla hopes the Paralympics will capture the spirit of her exhibition by changing people's attitudes about body parts . Pushing the boundaries: Priscilla says she felt far sexier after having her leg removed because she finally could wear the clothes she wanted . Priscilla had suffered from a worsening bone condition which meant she wore orthopaedic boots with a build-up on one ankle. As a result, she always wore long trousers or jeans and, in her words, didn't feel 'very sexy at all'. So she took the decision to have her leg removed. 'After I chopped my leg off, I could wear ""normal"" shoes - and it felt so great!' she said. 'I had 26 years of shoe shopping to catch up on!' Positive message: The exhibition which runs until September 9, comprises of over forty limbs donated by owners no longer using them and is being held to coincide with the London 2012 Paralympics . 'Stump pride': Priscilla is keen to emphasise that women need to feel beautiful despite any disability they have . Priscilla, who has also started wearing dresses since losing her limb, has coined the term 'stump pride' as she looks to build a positive image about being an amputee. 'Especially as a woman. You need to feel beautiful and take care of yourself,' she said. The Paralympics, which begins with the opening ceremony on Wednesday, has already sold a record 2.3 million tickets and has been billed by Prime Minister David Cameron as the 'best, the biggest, the most incredible Paralympic Games ever.' Spare Parts will be held at The Rag Factory, London from today until September 9.","Priscilla Sutton is curator of exhibition which turn prosthetic limbs into art .

Violent: Canadian preacher Todd Bentley with a follower at one of his 'healing' shows in which he kicks people in the face, claiming it will cure them of cancer . A Canadian evangelist has been banned from the UK after The Mail on Sunday revealed that he claims he can cure people of cancer by kicking them. The Home Office barred pastor Todd Bentley, 36, who was due to start his UK tour at the Croydon Conference Centre in South London on Thursday, claiming his presence in the UK was ‘not conducive to the public good’. He was also due  to visit Portadown in County Armagh, Liverpool and Cwmbran in South Wales on his tour. Tattooed preacher Bentley,  who as a 15-year-old was convicted of a sex attack on a boy aged seven urges the frail to attend his shows. The former drug user, who is Canadian but based in the United States, even laughs about his ‘healing’  techniques. In one show he treated a man claiming to be suffering from colon cancer by planting his knee hard into the victim’s stomach. The man fell to the floor in agony. On another occasion, a man was pushed over so forcefully that he lost a tooth. Burly Mr Bentley, 36, said in one YouTube clip: ‘And I’m thinking  why is the power of God not moving? And He said, “Because you haven’t kicked that woman in the face.” ‘And there is this older lady worshipping right in front of the platform and the Holy Spirit spoke to me. The gift of faith comes on me. He said, “Kick her in the face with your biker boot.” I inched closer  and I went bam! And just as my boot made contact with her nose, she fell under the power of God.’ Labour MP for Croydon North Malcolm Wicks urged Home Secretary Theresa May to ban Mr Bentley from the UK. He told her: ‘His visit can do nothing but harm and I would be grateful for any measures you can take.’ Dr Michael Nazir-Ali, the former Bishop of Rochester who now runs a church education charity, said: ‘I think the Home Secretary should make enquiries and see if there is any threat to public order. If the police have any indication that violence will be used against people who may be ill or vulnerable, it will be for her to decide if police should attend.’ Peter May, a prominent Christian GP who served for 25 years on the Church of England’s ruling General Synod, and has investigated spurious faith healers for more than 20 years, said: ‘I’m concerned by Todd Bentley’s methods because a physical injury on any sick person could be very serious. 'Nothing, but harm': Labour MP for Croydon North Malcolm Wicks (left) has urged Home Secretary Theresa May (right) to ban Mr Bentley from the UK . 'I’ve looked at the video clips on his forum and it requires significant impact for someone to lose a tooth. There may be people who are Christians who believe their health has been transformed, but I believe Todd Bentley should produce the medical evidence. I would urge people to keep away from him.’ The preacher came to prominence four years ago through his church, Fresh Fire Ministries, which launched a Christian ‘revival’ in Lakeland, Florida. The event, which attracted 400,000 people, was also on international channel God TV. Mr Bentley claims he cured viewers at home. Shanee Lemos, who was organising the UK tour, denied the preacher used violence. He said: ‘I’ve worked with Todd for a long time and I’ve never seen him kick someone.’ He added: ‘Even the terminally ill or people with a few days left to live are encouraged to come along and Todd will attempt to cure them.’ A Croydon Conference Centre  spokesman would not be drawn on Mr Bentley’s methods. Mr Bentley said: ‘Kicking people in the face is not a practice of our ministry and I do not see this happening in the UK.’",Canadian Todd Bentley was due to launch UK tour in Croydon .

Over-joyed: Colour Sergeant Thomas O'Donnell is preparing to return to Afghanistan two years after his leg was shattered by a Taliban bullet . Lying in agony in a hospital bed, his left knee shattered by a Taliban bullet, Colour Sergeant Thomas O’Donnell was confronted by medics with the grim news he had been dreading. His war injuries were so severe he would probably need his leg amputating. Even if he kept the smashed limb, they continued, it was so badly damaged his days as a soldier were over. But after an incredible battle to recuperate, the inspirational 37-year-old has defied the doctors. Next . month, he will complete his miraculous journey by returning to the . Afghan frontline with his comrades in the 1st Battalion Scots Guards (1 . SG) – just two years after being shot. His . determination to recover was spurred on by the desire to walk daughter . Siobhan, 22, down the aisle, unaided by crutches or a wheelchair. Last . October, she married Lance Corporal Neil Clark – a fellow Scots Guard . who is also deploying to Helmand – after entering the church on the arm . of her father. Yesterday, . C/Sgt O’Donnell, from Pollok, Glasgow, told of his pride at being able . to achieve his two ambitions since he was shot. He . said: ‘I have fulfilled the dreams that kept me focused while I was . recovering: walking my daughter down the aisle to get married and . deploying with the battalion again.’ The . soldier, who has served with Catterick-based 1 SG for 16 years, . described his remarkable story as he completed pre-deployment training . on Salisbury Plain. His unit is part of 4 Mechanised Brigade – nicknamed . the Black Rats – which is going to Afghanistan for a six-month tour of . duty. C/Sgt O’Donnell, a father of two, was shot during a massive push to seize the rebel-held town of Saidabad – a ‘hornet’s nest’ in Nad-e Ali, southern Helmand Province, in February 2010. During a mission to flush out a Taliban sniper, he confronted two insurgents laying an improvised explosive device (IED) designed to murder and maim British troops. The enemy fighters were burying the homemade bomb just 150metres from a compound being used by his platoon. C/Sgt O’Donnell said: ‘It was a pretty busy day. I could not believe how close they were. It was cheeky to say the least.’ As he pointed the men’s position out to his commander, ‘all hell broke loose’ with bullets spraying the British troops. Before he had dashed the 10metres to the compound, an AK47 round hit his lower left thigh. 'Horrendous pain': C/Sgt O'Donnell being stretchered away after during a mission in Helmand Province. Medics said he would probably lose his leg . The bullet shattered the bone and split his kneecap in two. He said: ‘Some people who lose limbs in IED strike just sit there chilling out while first aid is carried out but I was crying like a baby. ‘It was one of the most horrendous pains I've ever felt. But that only lasted about five minutes - the medics we had on hand were very, very good. ‘They administered morphine... and calmed me down.’ He was evacuated from the battlefield by a U.S. Blackhawk helicopter and was on an operating table at Camp Bastion within 30 minutes. There he was told that he might lose his left leg. When he was flown back to Britain, medical staff at Selly Oak in Birmingham told C/Sgt O'Donnell they could save his leg, but he was given the devastating news that he would never ‘soldier’ again. He said: ‘I was gutted. I thought about going onto civvy street with no qualifications and it was like having the carpet pulled from underneath me.’ Incredible comeback: As this X-Ray shows, the 37-year-old had a metal plate fitted in his leg and five screws to hold his knee together after undergoing 13 operations . But a visit from his daughter in hospital made him determined to recover. ‘She told me she was getting married. And that's when I said to myself, I will walk her down the aisle.’ Then while watching his colleagues from the Scots Guards during their homecoming parade he asked himself: ‘Why not get back with the boys?’ The road to recovery continued at Headley Court. He undertook a gruelling regime of physiotherapy and fitness work. ‘My main priority was walking Siobhan down the aisle without a walking stick. I achieved it – it was the proudest day of my life.’ He now jokingly describes the medical staff there as ‘physio-terrorists’ - taking no prisoners, but he is full of praise for their efforts to help him walk again. C/Sgt O’Donnell had a metal plate fitted in his leg and five screws to hold his knee together. He has also had 13 operations. His left leg is 2cm shorter than his right, but he is close to regaining full mobility. He said: ‘I cannot fault the medical team. Ten years ago I probably would have lost my leg but thanks to the Scots Guards team medics on the ground and the doctors I am now able to deploy again.’ He will be stationed at Forward Operating Base Oullette in the Gereshk Valley, carrying out the vital task of co-ordinating supply helicopter flights for the troops there. C/Sgt O’Donnell said he was ‘slightly nervous’ about returning to Afghanistan in case he is shot again. ‘I couldn’t cope with another two years being like a baby learning to walk,’ he said. But his injuries have not deterred his 18-year-old son Thomas Jnr from joining the Army. He is following his father into the Scots Guards and could be sent to the frontline early next year.","Colour Sergeant Thomas O'Donnell, 37, injured in Afghanistan two years ago .

Somalian Zakaria Mohamed, 29, was on probation when he killed television recruitment consultant Amina Adan, 32. He had assaulted her twice before during their year-long relationship, but magistrates put off sentencing him so he could take part in a domestic abuse programme. Zakaria Mohamed (left) who was jailed for at least 26 years today for stabbing his girlfriend Amina Adan 57 times . But she took him back and he killed her with three knives and shards of glass from a broken mirror before the counselling sessions were implemented, the Old Bailey heard. Judge Anthony Morris said he did not know why the sessions were not prioritised before Mohamed served an unpaid work element of a community order. Mohamed pleaded guilty to murdering Miss Adan on November 6, last year, at the home they shared in Walworth, south London. After a row, drunken Mohamed went home, dragged her down the stairs by the hair, beat her unconscious, kicked and stamped on her and began to stab her. After police arrived, Mohamed threatened to kill them and had to be subdued with a Taser gun. Miss Adan, who was brought up in Kenya, was described as being hard working and popular at the Al Jazeera news network where she worked in human resources. The Old Bailey heard Mohamed had assaulted Miss Adan twice before during their year-long relationship . Judge Morris told Mohamed: 'You are a controlling and domineering man and Amina was frightened of you and you sought to control her with violence. 'I am satisfied this was a punishment for her standing up to you. 'This was a savage, brutal, sustained and premeditated attack in which you clearly intended to kill. 'It was clearly a totally senseless killing in which you deprived a hardworking young woman of her life.' Mohamed had been in breach of a community order and a deferred sentence at the time. He came to the UK in 2002 on a forged Dutch passport. His request for asylum was turned down but he was given indefinite leave to remain in 2007 under an amnesty. In April 2011, he pleaded guilty to battery on Miss Adan and was placed on a community order which included a domestic abuse programme. In May, 2011, he punched Miss Adan in the stomach and went on the run before being arrested in July. In September, he was convicted of the assault and on October 20, of breaching the order. On October 20, Camberwell Green magistrates deferred a likely prison sentence until January 20 this year, so he could take part in the programme. Judge Morris said he was surprised the programme had not been implemented first. He said: 'It would be more important that they should have prioritised the domestic violence programme. 'This was not something the probation service were not aware of because he committed another offence, and it became even more urgent he should embark on this programme. 'Unfortunately, for reasons I do not fully understand, that programme had not been started fully.' Prosecutor Timothy Carey told the judge the Ministry of Justice would be holding a review into the case because the murder took place while Mohamed was subject to probation. Miss Adan's sister, Hanan, said in a statement: 'We will probably never know why he could possibly act in this way to another human being. It is something we will never forgive or forget.'","Zakaria Mohamed was on probation when he killed Amina Adan in south London .

Suspect: Lonnie Leroy Tate, 52, is accused of bashing in the windows of his neighbor's house and pouring gasoline into the residence before setting it ablaze . A man who is believed to be mentally ill went berserk and smashed up his neighbor's home in Buckley, Washington, before setting it ablaze on Saturday, according to police. The suspect, identified as 52-year-old Lonnie Leroy Tate, turned himself in to police custody about three hours later and was then taken to a local hospital. The incident started at around 5:30pm when Tate marched over to a neighbor's home in the 6800 block of 245th Avenue East and claimed that she owed him money, police said. The victim, however, insisted that she had had no prior dealings with Tate. Following a verbal argument, the 52-year-old man turned violent, grabbed a baseball bat and bashed in the windows in the home, KOMONews.com reported. As the terrified neighbor fled the house through the back door, Tate poured gasoline into the residence and set it on fire, said Detective Lynelle Anderson of the Pierce County Sheriff's Office. The blaze was later extinguished by East Pierce firefighters. Aftermath: Firefighters arrived on the scene to put out the house fire that was allegedly started by Tate . Manhunt: Police used a K-9 dog to scour the woods in search of Tate, but failed to find him . Local residents told KIRO-TV that prior to the incident, they heard Tate arguing with a woman – possibly a girlfriend - in his nearby home. Officers who arrived on the scene after receiving a report about an agitated man who was possibly intoxicated or mentally ill Tasered Tate twice in an attempt to subdue him, but it had no effect on him. The 52-year-old fled on foot into the woods, setting off a manhunt involving a K-9 unit which came up empty. Deputies did, however, find the bat used in the incident. At around 8:15pm, Tate turned himself in and was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital in satisfactory condition to be treated for unspecified injuries. Domestic disturbance: Neighbors heard Tate arguing with a woman - possibly a girlfriend - in his house (pictured) before the incident . On Saturday night, a miscommunication with dispatch led police to believe that Tate had escaped from the hospital, and it was not until Sunday afternoon that authorities discovered that the man was still in his room, The News Tribune reported. Anderson said that Tate has a history of prior arrests for drug possession and vandalism, but now he may face felony charges.","Lonnie Leroy Tate, 52, allegedly poured gasoline into neighbor's home and set it ablaze .

A 66-year-old man was dramatically rescued after his yacht was hit by a whale and started sinking off the coast of Mexico. Max Young of Sacramento, California, was sailing alone 40 miles west of La Playa, Mexico, when his 50-foot sailboat Reflections was struck by the giant mammal. The impact from the collision knocked out the vessel's propeller and rudder and it started flooding with seawater. Scroll down for video . Lucky escape: Max Young (pictured) was described by the US Coast Guard as a 'seasoned sailor' Young, described by the US Coast Guard as a 'seasoned sailor,' activated an emergency signal that was picked up by officials in Alameda, California, and a C-130 Hercules plane was sent to find him. By the time the coast guard made radio contact with the stranded mariner three hours later it was pitch black, his boat was close to being totally flooded and he feared the worst. Lieutenant Amy Kefarl, of the US Coast Guard, told KXTV in Sacramento: 'He thought he was done. 'He was actually pretty frantic. 'He asked me to make sure [we] told his wife that he loved her and that he had something for his grandkids to give them. We reassured him [and] told him that help was on the way.' Video footage shot from the nose of the coast guard's aircraft showed rough waves tossing Mr Young's boat around. Whale of a tale: Max Young of Sacramento, 66, was rescued on Wednesday after his sailboat was hit by a whale . Rescuer: Lieutenant Amy Kefarl, of the US Coast Guard, (pictured) reassured Max Young he would be rescued . Luckily for Mr Young, a container ship was only about 60 miles away and altered course to rescue him. When it arrived at about 4am on Wednesday, Mr Young was able to scramble off his boat by a rope ladder thrown down by the crew and escaped unharmed. 'This case is one of those success stories,' Petty Officer 2nd Class Pamela Boehland, of the US Coast Guard, said. 'A man went out prepared, the worst happened to him and he was able to respond.' Mr Young had safely sailed all around the globe in the yacht, including pirate-infested waters off Yemen, and was on the last two days of his journey back to California. His brother, Joe Ferro, had been due to join him on the final leg of his world trip. Mr Ferro told CBS Sacramento: 'I just can't believe it because he is very careful and that boat has got every warning device there is for anything coming at him except a whale.' He said his brother would have remained calm as the boat began sinking. 'Knowing Max, he doesn't panic - he figures out ""OK, what do I have to do next?"" and he does it.' But Mr Young's wife Debra said she was horrified at just how close her husband had come to drowning. 'He said there was two feet before she [the boat] was completely under,' Mrs Young told CBS. She said Mr Young stuffed mattresses into a hole made by the whale, but had to bail out water for nine hours before the coast guard found him. Mr Young is thought to still be on the freighter, which is heading for Panama, and his family hope he will be home in time for Father's day on Sunday. There was a less happy ending for his yacht, however, which was last seen sinking. Stranded: Max Young was sailing alone 40 miles west of La Playa, Mexico, when his boat was struck by a whale .

Earlier this month, an astronaut noticed a sunrise while the Station rolled over the South Pacific, 240 miles northeast of the Marshall Islands - and pulled out a camera to capture the moment . 'The International Space Station was over the central South Pacific about 240 miles northeast of the Marshall Islands when one of the Expedition 31 crew members positioned on the station's Cupola captured this image of the sun coming up,' says a Nasa spokesperson. Expedition 31 is the current Space Station mission, which began on April 27 this year after the previous crew left for Earth on board a Soyuz TMA-22 re-entry vehicle. The mission is scheduled to continue until July 2013. The Station recently docked with Space X's unmanned Dragon capsule, which was the first commercial space flight to dock with the station. Incredible: Astronaut Don Pettit took these pictures 240 miles above Earth from the International Space Station . Known as ‘star trail’ pictures, they are taken over a period of 10-15 minutes by cameras mounted inside the station. However, Pettit found that using the latest digital cameras meant that he had to combine several images to create the effect. 'My star trail images are made by taking a time exposure of about 10 to 15 minutes,' he said. Star-trail images: Pettit achieved the pictures by taking a time exposure of about 10 to 15 minutes then combining several images on top of one another . 'However, with modern digital cameras, 30 seconds is about the longest exposure possible, due to electronic detector noise effectively snowing out the image. 'To achieve the longer exposures I do what many amateur astronomers do. I take multiple 30-second exposures, then 'stack' them using imaging software, thus producing the longer exposure,' the astronaut explained.

Four men and a woman have been arrested. Officers were called shortly before 11pm last night to Broadmead Fields in Woodford, east London, where they found the body. Police forensics on Broadmead playing fields investigate the murder of an 18-year-old . A police spokesman said: 'At this early stage it is believed an altercation took place that led to the victim’s death.' The men arrested are 26, 19, 20 and 29. The woman is 20. All are being held in custody. A post-mortem is due to take place tomorrow. Police are appealing for anyone who saw anything suspicious, in particular a blue Fiat Punto in Courtland Close or activity near the bridge in Chigwell Road close to the Jet petrol station from Sunday evening through to Monday night.

The White House announced Monday none of its staffers were involved in the Colombian prostitution scandal, as it revealed a 12th military serviceman is being investigated -- bringing the number of government employees entangled in the embarrassing case to 24. Press Secretary Jay . Carney said an investigation had cleared all of Obama's political staff . of wrongdoing. 'There . was no indication that any member of the White House advance team . engaged in any improper conduct or behavior,' Carney said. Scroll down for video... Security breach: The latest agent suspended in the Secret Service scandal reportedly brought a prostitute back to the Hilton Cartagena Hotel where President Obama stayed five days later . Keeping a distance: White House Press Secretary Jay Carney took pains to explain that the newly-revealed staffer under investigation is a US serviceman -- not a member of the Obama White House . The newest man under scrutiny in the scandal is a member of the White House Communications Agency, a military unit that provides secure communication between government officials. Sources said the staffer is an enlisted US Army soldier. The agency works closely with the White House, but is based in the Department of Defense. Earlier in the day, the Secret Service scandal spread to a second hotel as it was revealed that a 12th suspended agent reportedly brought a prostitute back to the Hilton where President Barack Obama stayed in Cartagena, Colombia. The 11 other agents who were sent home to Washington in disgrace were staying at the Hotel Caribe. Some White House staffers and reporters roomed at the luxury resort, but the president never set foot there. But the new allegation brings the potential security breach closer to the president than previously realized. Obama stayed at the Hilton Cartagena Hotel while he attended the Summit of the Americas, just five days after the agent allegedly invited the hooker there. The White House struggled to keep an arm's length from the scandal, which has only built up speed and scope since broke up two weeks ago. Carney took pains to describe how the White House Communications Agency, despite its name, is staffed entirely by personnel hired by the military and that it is not an arm of the Obama administration. First-class accommodations: This is the hotel that housed the president during his visit to Colombia for the Summit of the Americas . Luxury accommodations: The Hilton Cartagena Hotel offers beach-front views and luxury amenitites . 'The Hilton is significant because that's where President Obama was going to stay,' Sen Joseph Lieberman said Sunday on Face the Nation. 'It just gets more troubling,' he added. 'To act as these people did in Cartagena as if they were college kids on spring break, it is reprehensible.' The embarrassment for the agency continues to grow. The Secret Service hasn't said why it suspended the 12th agent, but CBS News reports it was because he brought a prostitute back to his hotel room. Eleven agents were recalled to Washington and suspended after many of them brought Colombian prostitutes back to their hotel rooms April 11. The agents were in Colombia to prepare security in advance of the president's arrival. Second hotel: The original 11 agents were staying at the Hotel Caribe, where the president never set foot . 'Not in danger': The Secret Service claims that despite the scandal, President Obama's security in Colombia was never compromised . The agents' booze-fueled partying was exposed when Dania Suarez caused a commotion the next morning after one of the agents refused to pay her the $800 she says he agreed to. Local police and hotel security guards were called and word got back to Secret Service superiors. Authorities are also investigating whether some of the 20 prostitutes the agents hired are underage girls. Of the 12 agents allegedly involved, including two supervisors, six have left the agency, either fired, resigned or retired. One has been partially cleared with minor disciplinary action. Five remain suspended. 'It just gets more troubling... To act as these people did in Cartagena as if they were college kids . on spring break, it is reprehensible.'Sen Joseph Lieberman, speaking on the Secret Service scandal . The US military is investigating 12 servicemen who were in Colombia helping the agents, as well. The Secret Service's disgrace was due, in part, to the quick response of one of the agency's few female agents. Paula Reid, who is in charge of the Secret Service's Miami office, quickly conducted an investigation at the Hotel Caribe, sent 11 agents home and notified her superiors in Washington when she received news of her colleagues misbehavior. Her praiseworthy performance led some lawmakers to argue that scandals like this one might not happen if the Secret Service had more women in its ranks. The embarrassing scandal has drawn the attention, and ire, of lawmakers, who are demanding answers from the Secret Service. Iowa Sen Chuck Grassley said that more 'heads have to roll' for the . Secret Service to avoid 'mistakes.' 'Troubling': Sen Joseph Lieberman says the new allegations are even worse because they put a potential security breach directly in the president's hotel . Center of the scandal: Sex worker Dania Suarez, 24, claims she made a commotion at the Hotel Caribe after one of the Secret Service agents stiffed her $800 . Rep Peter King, chairman of the powerful Committee Homeland Security, wants the names of the government employees embroiled in the incident. King has also demanded to know whether . federal money was used and if agents had weapons or classified material . in the rooms where they brought the women in Cartagena earlier this . month. He put a deadline on . director Mark Sullivan for the information within five days according to Fox news - and answers . as to whether the scandal reaches as high up as the Executive Office of . the President. Grassley said the Secret Service must enact major reforms in the wake of the scandal. 'If the culture of an organisation is . going to change or mistakes like this  are not going to be repeated, . heads have to roll and that is why I think you are going to find more . heads rolling,’ the he said. Rep King told Fox News: 'I would think you'll see most of the 11 either resign, retire or will be forced to leave. 'I doubt, no matter what happens, you're going to see any of these 11 ever involved in any kind of detail like this again.' The Secret Service, which is tasked . with protecting the president, senior administration officials and other . prominent figures, said last week that a 12th employee had been . implicated in the probe and another had been cleared of 'serious . misconduct' in Cartagena but would face administrative action. King, whose committee was probing the Cartagena incident, said the employee was involved in a separate incident that happened 'five or six days before the president arrived.' The New York Republican said he had four investigators on the case and had spoken several times with Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan about the agency's own investigation. 'We want a full record (of the probe), so at the end we can decide if the Secret Service acted appropriately once they found out about it,' King said. Demands: Homeland Security Committee Chairman Rep Peter King has sent a list of questions to the head of the Secret Service over the prostitution scandal in Colombia . Two of the original 11 Secret Service employees involved in the scandal were supervisors, he added. 'They should have been in control of everything. Instead, they were accessories. They were part of it,' King said. 'Among those eleven, besides what they did, they also are in trouble, if you will, for what they didn't do. And what they didn't do is report it,' King said. A former director of the Secret Service said the Colombian prostitution scandal was an extraordinary incident at the agency. He told CBS today that while agents had been disciplined in the past - none had been taken out of service. W. Ralph Basham, who ran the service between 2003 and 2006, said: 'I don’t believe in the past these types of things have happened. They certainly didn’t happen on my watch.'","Revealed a Secret Service agent 'brought a prostitute back to the Hilton Hotel where President Obama stayed'

The global ban on ivory trading should be lifted to stifle the recent surge in elephant poaching in Africa, the UN was told today. If adopted, the proposals would allow the sale of ivory only from elephants that died naturally, were culled for ecological reasons, killed in a trophy hunt or because they posed a threat. The international black market for ivory has risen rapidly since 2004 largely because of a growing Asian demand for ivory . chopsticks, statues and jewelry. Ruthless, gun-toting gangs patrol the wilds of Africa, butchering elephants for their tusks before selling them on to Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese smugglers who make huge profits in their homelands. Growing market: The recent rise in Ivory poaching has steadily worsened since 2004 thanks to a growing market in Asia . It is the first time such a proposal has been made since a global ban on ivory came into effect in 1989. The proposal was put forward in a report commissioned by the 175-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, a treaty overseen by the U.N. Environment Program in Geneva. 'Given the present rise in illegal killing of elephants in West, Central and East Africa, it is clear that current measures are not containing the present upsurge in the illegal trade in ivory,' the report concludes. 'The tendency to ascribe this increase to the sale of stockpiled ivory in 2008 diverts attention away from the far more serious problems relating to the inability of African countries to invest in protecting their elephants.' Big business: The rise has been driven by Asian demand for ivory . chopsticks, statues and jewelry, right . Southern African countries, where the majority of elephants are, want some form of legal trade to help pay for their conservation efforts and sell off already growing ivory stocks. Central and East African countries have in the past opposed any legal trade, fearing it will undermine conservation efforts and further bolster the illegal trade. Environmentalists, too, have come out against the proposal because they argue that the reasons behind it - that legal trade would help reduce ivory prices, and thus demand - remain unproven. Victims: The rise in rhino poaching will also be on the agenda with several measures to tackle the illegal hunting, mostly in South Africa . Also in the spotlight: In Asia, rhino horn has about the same street value as that of cocaine in the US. It is crushed and consumed by people in Asia who believe it can cure diseases including cancer, fever and even hangovers . The rise in rhino poaching will also be on the agenda with several measures to tackle the illegal hunting, mostly in South Africa. It will address how better to regulate the trophy hunting trade and make greater use of DNA technologies to trace horns that are seized to help convict the poachers and traffickers. A report by the World Wildlife Federation International found that Vietnam was 'the major destination' for rhino horns trafficked from South Africa, where 448 rhinos were poached last year.

Nearly 100 General Services Administration employees, many of them high-ranking, claimed more than $750,000 in travel expenses in a nine-month period, despite the fact that they were assigned to work from home. The government agency, which was recently under scrutiny for an $820,000 conference in Las Vegas, is again being put under the microscope for its operations. According to the Washington Post, which first revealed the wild expenditures, the agency is looking into the matter, but doing nothing to curb the outlandish spending. Luxurious: U.S. General Services Administration regional commissioner Jeffrey Neely is seen soaking in a bathtub and enjoying wine during a 'scouting trip' for a government conference in 2009 . Taking the Fifth: Jeffrey Neely declined to answer questions at a hearing about wasteful spending and access at the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on Monday . Documents turned into the House revealed that 95 high-ranking employees within the GSA who were assigned to work from home spent $750,000 in travel expenses in nine months. In response to the outrageously high travel expenses, executive Jeffrey Neely, who has since resigned amid the Las Vegas scandal, wrote in an email to a college: ‘OMG…Well this is a fine mess we’ve gotten ourselves into.’ The Post reports that the so-called virtual workers were travelling to regional headquarters and to other events. GSA spokesman Adam Elkington said yesterday that the agency is conducting ‘an extensive review’ on staff travel policies and deployment. Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-California), meanwhile, demanded answers. ‘The American people have right to know that federal bureaucrats who enjoy the benefits of virtual work are eligible and responsible stewards of the taxpayer dollars that support the program,’ he wrote. Twelve of the 95 ‘virtual’ workers claimed and received more than $200,000 in travel reimbursements between 2010 and 2011, the Post says. Hearing: Government Services Administration officials were sworn in before testifying to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in April . Last week, embattled Neely left the agency, though Mr Elkington would neither confirm nor deny if he esigned or was fired from the agency that is in charge of federal buildings and supplies. The GSA inspector general previously referred Neely's case to the Justice Department for a possible criminal investigation. Neely's departure would have no effect on the Justice Department's inquiry. Neely had been placed on administrative leave in April as buildings commissioner for the Pacific Rim region. An inspector general's report on waste and abuse at the 2010 Las Vegas conference sparked hearings by several congressional committees. Neely angered lawmakers by refusing to testify and asserting his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. The Las Vegas conference featured a clown, a mind-reader and a rap video by an employee who made fun of the spending. The scandal led to the resignation of GSA Administrator Martha Johnson, the firing of two top aides and the placing of nine others on administrative leave. A GSA official who was not authorized to be quoted by name on personnel matters said four others have left the agency following their participation in the 2010 conference. The GSA has proposed to remove another four. Council: Jeff Neely, the central figure in the GSA spending scandal, left, is seen speaking with his lawyer in April; he left the agency in May . 'GSA is in the process of completing its review of activities associated with the Western Regions Conference and pursuing all available avenues for appropriate disciplinary action against those responsible,' the GSA spokesman said. 'Jeff Neely was placed on administrative leave based on his involvement in the WRC (Western Regions Conference). As of today, he's no longer employed with GSA.' Calls to Neely's attorney were not immediately returned. Former employees like Neely can be prevented from participation in federal contracts and grants. Such action is under consideration in Neely's case, the official said. Photos leaked across the internet last month , showing Neely enjoying wine in a bathtub at a luxury Las .

The maths whiz worked with Mr Whiteley on the Channel 4 programme for 23-years since its inception in 1983. Emotional: Carol Vorderman breaks down while discussing Richard Whiteley on Piers Morgan's Life Stories . He died in 2005 from complications after having heart surgery, aged 61. On Piers Morgan’s Life Stories – to be screened on ITV1 tonight - Miss Vorderman, 51, remembered the much-loved host. She said: ‘It still hurts very much. I loved him, I really loved him. ‘He was more than just nice, he was funny, funny, funny. Every time we were in studio together I would cry laughing. ‘He was just a joy to be with and I loved him. Not in that way, just a genuine, pure thing.’ Close friends: Vorderman recalled her close working relationship with her Countdown colleague . In an emotional interview, the mother-of-two recalled the moment she heard of Mr Whiteley’s death. She said:  ‘He’d gone in for a heart operation and I spoke to Kathy immediately afterwards and it was the first bit of good news we’d had…that the surgeon thought the operation had gone very well and hadn’t taken as long as they’d thought. 'And that was the first time in six weeks that I thought there was anything to feel joyous about. Friends: Vorderman and Whiteley in 2005 . ‘Then the next day I didn’t hear anything.

After she left the presenter said: ‘The way it happened was very hurtful, particularly after having worked on Countdown for 26 years. It was vicious. ‘It was all about the 90 per cent pay cut and there was all this good cop, bad cop stuff going on. Then I gave in and said, ""I’ll go."" ‘It’s new Countdown now. I take no pleasure in it. I’ve been told I’m never welcome in the studio again, so it’s nothing to do with me.’ However, in her latest interview, Miss Vorderman revealed she would consider making a guest appearance on the long-running show – currently hosted by former Apprentice adviser Nick Hewer, 68 - saying: ‘Of course I would.’ Miss Vorderman also spoke about the . breakdown of her second marriage, to management consultant Patrick King, . the father of her children, Katie, 20, and Cameron, 15.

War Horse author Michael Morpurgo has proposed to his wife Clare for the second time - nearly 50 years after their original hurried wedding. Having found both fame and fortune since the ‘miserable’ ceremony in 1963, the 68-year-old now plans to give his wife Clare the stylish white wedding she has always craved. Speaking at the Hay Festival in Powys, Wales, he said: ‘I think it will be rather lovely. When we married before, it was in a register office and I just don’t think they feel quite right. Romance: Michael Morpurgo plans to give his wife Clare the stylish white wedding she always wanted . ‘It is tradition - you are making this promise and it’s a kind of deal, but I don’t think it should be just a civil deal. It should be more than that.’ The devoted pair were forced to marry in secret after Mrs Morpurgo discovered she was pregnant with their first child Sebastian, aged just 20. When he met his future wife on a holiday in Corfu in 1962, Morpurgo was an officer-cadet at Sandhurst military academy. His prospects seemed so dim, her father Sir Allen Lane - the multi-millionaire founder of Penguin books - believed he was a gold-digger. Suspicious of his future son-in-law, Sir Allen sent samples of his handwriting to a graphologist to reveal his true character. However the report stated he was ‘a very intelligent, kind and sympathetic man of high moral principles.’ Nearly half a century later, Morpurgo has made his own fortune, writing more than 80 books for children and selling more than a million copies of his best-loved work, War Horse. Telling the tragic story of a horse and his owner in the First World War, the book has since been turned into a sell-out West End theatre production and a Hollywood blockbuster directed by Steven Spielberg. Unsuitable: Mr Morpurgo's father-in-law thought he was a gold-digger. He has since sold more than a million copies of War Horse, which has been made into a West End play and a Hollywood movie . The Morpurgos went on to have two more children, Horatio and Rosalind, and run a charity from their farm in Devon. They plan to re-marry in a church on their 50th wedding anniversary next June. Remembering their first ‘low-key’ wedding - attended only by their parents - Mrs Morpurgo, 69, said: ‘It was a very small wedding, very low-key and a bit miserable. ‘Ever since then, Michael has always felt he didn’t do the business. So for our 50th anniversary, he’s got this idea. ‘The trouble is that I’m not too religious and Michael is, but the idea is to find a really nice church and vicar and marry properly. ‘We will be saying vows for the first time, I suppose, because we didn’t really have vows in the register office.’ Mrs Morpurgo added she planned to wear a vintage dress for her second ceremony. She said: ‘I have no idea what I’ll wear but it won’t be a huge meringue. ‘I’ll wear something recycled and comfortable. I’ve actually still got the blouse I wore that day in 1963, although the lace has fallen off a bit so I don’t think I could still wear it.’","Michael Morpurgo and his wife were forced to marry in 1963 after discovering that Clare was pregnant .

"By . Christopher Wilson . PUBLISHED: . 20:12 EST, 9 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:36 EST, 10 April 2012 . The happy announcement at the weekend that the Duchess of Cornwall had been awarded the greatest personal honour in the Queen’s gift — Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order — seemed to set the seal on a troubled past and to pave the way for a bright new future. Indeed, there will be many across the country who’ve had a chance to meet Camilla in the seven years since she became a fully paid-up member of the House of Windsor, who will see the honour as fitting and just. Though fearless in the saddle, she was timid and nervy when enduring her first public engagements. Honoured: The Queen has awarded the Duchess of Cornwall the greatest personal honour in her gift, Dame Grand Cross of the Victorian Order . Many will think it is a tribute to her application to the job — and her determination to overcome those fears — that she has earned such an outstanding honour in this, the Queen’s finest year. Her supporters will say that since 2005 Camilla hasn’t put a foot wrong. And if she hasn’t set the world on fire, that is by design. In the run-up to the perfunctory civil ceremony that sealed her long-time love affair with Prince Charles, a strategy was devised that would position her in the nation’s perceptions as a substitute for the recently deceased Queen Mother — rather than the woman whose place she took in the princely bed, Princess Diana. Happy couple: Her supporters say that since her marriage to Prince Charles in 2005 Camilla 'hasn't put a foot wrong' So there were lots of fussy hats, regal waves and a certain formal distance placed between Camilla and the public — whose love and trust she had to gain. Emphasis was placed on age and dignity. The past? Airbrushed away. As a strategy it had its critics but it’s fair to say the passage of seven years has helped reduce hostility. People have slowly forgotten that gloomy day at Windsor Register Office when the couple married, and the way in which police forcibly removed soft-voiced protesters legitimately expressing their fears about the suitability of Mrs Parker Bowles as a future queen consort. No one knows better than Palace courtiers how the British public forgive and forget when it comes to the Royals. And, to an extent, the nation has forgiven and forgotten: the dark times have been buried in the past. Big shoes to fill: Following in the footsteps of the iconic Princess Diana by becoming Prince Charles' second wife was always going to be difficult . And so it might be supposed that last weekend was the right moment for the Queen to recognise and thank her daughter-in-law, and to welcome her into the most intimate fold of royalty — the order of chivalry that is in her gift, and her gift alone. Yet is that what actually happened? Talking to historians and royal observers yesterday, a rather different picture emerged of the reasons for Camilla’s shiny new honour — and there is good reason for believing that Prince Charles was heavily involved, lobbying on his wife’s behalf. Long ago the Queen expressed an adverse view of Camilla, which probably hasn’t fundamentally altered, I was told. ‘Those who know the Queen also know that once she has expressed a view, she very rarely retreats from it. That has been the hallmark of her reign — her consistency and clear-sightedness. ‘But the Queen is also a pragmatist. In her Jubilee year, she would not wish it to be felt there was disaffection among the ranks of her family.’ This is why she has finally listened to urgent pleas by Prince Charles that his wife should be given parity with lesser royals such as the Countess of Wessex and Prince Michael of Kent — high-ups in the Royal Victorian Order. ‘This is personal for him — deeply personal,’ I was told. ‘He sees that his own position is diminished if his wife continues not to be part of the inner-inner circle. It’s also another part of his plan towards making Camilla his Queen.’ Supporter: It is believed that Prince Charles was key in ensuring his wife received the Victorian Order . The back-story here is the resentment caused by the elevation of Mrs Parker Bowles to the status of royal wife seven years ago. Two senior royal women, Princess Anne and the Queen’s cousin Princess Alexandra, suddenly found themselves pushed down the pecking order at Court, and effectively made to curtsey to a woman who just weeks before had been a commoner — and a much reviled one at that. ‘They would not put up with it,’ I was told. ‘The Queen was made aware of their discomfort and was forced to do something about it.’ As a result, a document entitled Precedence Of The Royal Family To Be Observed At Court was produced, and  its purpose was to clarify Camilla’s place in the hierarchy. Perversely, its effect was to downgrade her from the position she might have been expected to hold. As the wife of Prince Charles, she should have taken precedence after the Queen, as Princess Diana did. But instead, she found she’d been moved down a peg or two. ‘Princess Anne and Princess Alexandra, who have given their adult lives to royal service, saw no reason to make obeisance to this, at the time, highly unpopular woman,’ a former courtier explained. Princess Anne, in particular, was extremely chilly towards Camilla and made it clear she had no intention ever of curtseying to her. In fact, nothing had changed — Anne also refused to curtsey to Diana — but the Queen obviously felt uncomfortable with the situation, and so she had the Order of Precedence rewritten. Happy family: Clarence House official handout of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall with their families . All this was not lost on the Prince of Wales, who is as determined as ever to have Camilla as his Queen. He had been snubbed on that occasion. But once the Queen had spoken, nothing more could be done at the time. Now, however, things appear to have changed. ‘It looks as if Charles finally got his way,’ I was told yesterday. ‘He’s managed to persuade the Queen, one way or the  other, that Camilla must be recognised.’ This, however, puts a slightly different gloss on Camilla’s brand-new damehood, which one commentator yesterday gushingly described as ‘illustrating the Queen’s fondness for her daughter-in- law . . . a public endorsement for her role within the family’. What can be said to Camilla’s credit is that in more recent times she has committed herself to official duties and gathering as much acclaim as she can. And if an appearance in The Archers, a visit to the set of the cult Danish detective series The Killing, hamming it up for the cameras with an ice-cream or posing with look-alike Beatles in Liverpool gets her the coverage, she’ll do it. You can't say she isn’t trying (though her progress into the nation’s affections has been hampered by an incapacity to stand the strain of foreign tours. The word ‘lazy’ has been used in the past, though less of late). But some critics argue that for the big events in national life — a calamity or a remembrance — she can never be seen as an appropriate representative of the people. While praise for her integration into the royal machine grows, and her support for the future king gathers appreciation, there’s still a root-and-branch resistance to the idea of her becoming Queen, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with her husband on state occasions. This fundamental fact is acknowledged by courtiers, but not by Prince Charles. And so his campaign for equal status for his wife among the royal womenfolk goes doggedly on. Royal command: The Duchess of Cornwall has been embraced by the Queen and the rest of the Royal family . Some may ask what the fuss is about. After all, the Royal Victorian Order, once spoken of in hallowed tones, has lost its lustre recently. In the midst of the seedy scandal that enveloped the Duke of York last year — after it turned out his friend, the American financier Jeffrey Epstein, was a paedophile and convicted sex offender — the Queen defiantly created her favourite son a Knight Grand Cross of the order. ‘The timing could not have been more deliberate,’ I was told. ‘Andrew was under fire on all sides. This friendship had been exposed, questions about what he was using his roving trade ambassador role for were being asked and his resignation was just around the corner. He was seen as shabby, arrogant and out of touch. ‘But at such times, the Royals circle the wagons and protect their own. So at the very height of the controversy, the Queen very publicly gave her son this shiny new gong.’ Her Majesty’s sure-footed approach — consistent over a 60-year reign — was, just this once, called into question. ‘The funny thing is that in this triumphant Diamond Jubilee year, people feel more and more protective of the Queen,’ a senior historian explained yesterday. ‘No one wants anything to  go wrong for her. No doubt she was persuaded that by bringing Camilla into the shelter of her personal order of chivalry it would be seen as a conciliatory act.’ Certainly it helps heal any rift there may be with her son over Camilla. And maybe that’s the best way of looking at it — a gong for trying hard . . . but not the ultimate seal of approval from the Queen.

"By . James Chapman And Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 09:45 EST, 11 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:44 EST, 12 June 2012 . George Osborne yesterday admitted he played a key part in the ‘risky’ appointment of former News of the World boss Andy Coulson as the Tories’ chief spin doctor. The Chancellor said he had accepted an assurance from Mr Coulson, who had resigned from the newspaper in the wake of the phone hacking allegations, that there were no more revelations to come. In evidence to the Leveson Inquiry, Mr Osborne revealed that around a third of his meetings with media owners and editors since 2005 were with News International – including one meeting with the Murdochs at a ski chalet in Davos, Switzerland, in early 2009. No secret pact: Mr Osborne denied that a meeting with the Murdochs, him and David Cameron to seal election backing never happened . Pals: Mr Osborne said he remained friends with Andy Coulson but 'sadly' had not been able to talk to him for more than a year . Mr Osborne also said he had been at a crucial No 10 meeting where it was decided to remove responsibility for deciding the BSkyB bid from Business Secretary Vince Cable and handing it to Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt. That idea, he said, had come from Sir Jeremy Heywood, then No 10’s Permanent Secretary and now the Cabinet Secretary. The Chancellor said his main concern when Mr Cable was caught boasting he had ‘declared war’ on the Murdoch empire in 2010 was to come up with a solution that would not mean the Business Secretary being sacked or having to resign. Mr Osborne suggested that would have threatened the Coalition. Claims: Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, leaving the Leveson Inquiry and his wife Sarah today said the Tories had done a deal with News Corp, which Mr Osborne said was nonsense . Mr Osborne dismissed the idea that the Tories entered into some sort of deal, either explicit or implied, with Rupert Murdoch to hand him full ownership of BSkyB in return for the support of his papers. In an apparent reference to Gordon Brown, who suggested in evidence to the inquiry that he believed such an arrangement had been made, Mr Osborne said only a ‘real fantastist’ could believe such a ‘vast conspiracy theory’. Controversy: Leveson heard that Mr Osborne had fought to save Vince Cable's job despite his going to war with Murdoch comments . He said the Conservatives would have had to have somehow arranged for Mr Cable to be ‘secretly recorded’ by a newspaper saying he had declared war on the Murdochs so that responsibility could then be handed to Mr Hunt. ‘It is complete nonsense and the facts simply don’t bear it out,’ he said. Mr Osborne insisted he had not had a strong view about the merits of the Murdochs’ £8billion takeover bid for BSkyB, adding: ‘As far as I could see it was just going to cause us trouble one way or the other.’ The Chancellor said it had been clear that if the deal was approved by the Government, it would offend one set of newspapers and broadcasters who were opposing the takeover, while if it was blocked it would offend the Murdoch camp. Pressed on his own attitude to the proposed takeover, the Chancellor replied: ‘As far as I could see, it was about increasing the shareholding in a company that most people would think they ran anyway.’ On Mr Coulson’s appointment, Mr Osborne said the former editor denied knowing anything about phone hacking at the News of the World going beyond one single reporter. As shadow chancellor, he said he briefly asked Mr Coulson about phone hacking in March 2007, when he was attempting to recruit him for the job of director of communications for the Conservative Party. Links: Lobbyist Fred Michel gave evidence to Leveson last month and had sent hundreds of texts and e-mails to the Government about the BSkyB bid . He said he had asked Mr Coulson ‘in a general sense, as you might do in a social encounter, whether there was more in the phone hacking story that was going to come out, that was not already public, that we needed to know about – and he said no’. He said he had been aware of the ‘risks’ and potential controversy that would be generated by hiring Mr Coulson, but recommended to David Cameron that he should get the job. ‘It was not a consideration: let’s hire the ex-News International man. It was: let’s hire this very experienced ex-newspaper editor,’ Mr Osborne added. He said he still regarded Mr Coulson as a ‘personal friend’, but added: ‘Sadly I’ve not been able to speak to him for a year.’ Big Day: The Chancellor pictured arriving at the Royal Courts of Justice to appear after former Prime Minister Gordon Brown . The Chancellor yesterday sent the strongest signal yet that the Government will not adopt plans for regulating the Press that stifle freedom of speech. George Osborne rejected proposals to separate news and comment, the ‘kitemarking’ of newspapers or allowing ‘class action’ complaints by offended groups. He also warned against attempting to draw up a code that defined what was in the national interest. Mr Osborne said that if the Leveson Inquiry came up with proposals that target print media but exclude the internet, everyone involved would have been wasting their time. His remarks echoed those of Education Secretary Michael Gove, who insisted press freedoms must be preserved at all costs and warned Lord Justice Leveson that any cure could prove ‘worse than the disease’. They suggest an emerging consensus among Tory ministers appearing at the inquiry. On Thursday, David Cameron is also expected to ‘put down a marker’ that the Government will not accept over-the-top proposals on press regulation. Lord Leveson said he had heard evidence from groups who felt ‘very disadvantaged’ by how they were portrayed in the Press, mentioning the disabled, migrants and those who change gender. Asked if he agreed there should be some mechanism for such groups to complain about or prevent negative coverage, Mr Osborne replied: ‘There are laws to prevent racial discrimination or sexual orientation discrimination. 'You mention immigrant groups – they are obviously some of the most vulnerable people in our society. Equally there’s a huge concern out there ... about immigration controls. ‘If that’s not allowed to be aired, then I think we stifle public debate.’ He insisted it was vital that the Press could air views that were not fashionable or shared by the Establishment – citing the example of Eurosceptic opinion. He said that a decade ago it was regarded as ‘faintly eccentric’ to be against British membership of the euro, with such views disparaged by the BBC. But newspapers including the Daily Mail, the Daily Telegraph and The Sun had campaigned against euro membership and contributed to what ‘in hindsight was one of the most important economic and political decisions’ ever made by Britain. However, Mr Osborne said the Press Complaints Commission required a ‘complete overhaul’ and that victims of press mistreatment needed ‘better redress’.","Andy Coulson was 'the best man for the job,' he told the Inquiry, discussing why he appointed him as No. 10 spin doctor .

The policeman who shoved Ian Tomlinson to the ground during the G20 protests admitted he could not remember how many people he hit with his baton that day, a court heard today. PC Simon Harwood, 45, struck the newspaper vendor with a baton and then pushed him to the floor on April 1st, 2009, causing his collapse and death just moments later, it is alleged. Even after he watched footage of the incident Harwood maintained 'the use of force was necessary, proportionate and reasonable'. Trial: PC Simon Harwood, pictured leaving court with his wife Helen, denies manslaughter after footage emerged of him hitting Mr Tomlinson with a baton and shoving him to the floor minutes before the newspaper vendor collapsed and died . Harwood had been tasked to stay with a riot van, but had abandoned his post roughly 20 minutes before the incident and became involved in numerous violent exchanges - leading prosecutors to allege that he was riled before he even saw Mr Tomlinson. In his pocket book Harwood wrote that he had had to use 'reasonable force against a crowd of 200 rioting and throwing missiles at me'. He had tried to arrest a demonstrator scrawling 'all cops are bastards' on a police van in blue marker pen, but when he did an angry crowd of 100 turned on him and, as he dragged the man up the road, he managed to wriggle out of his jacket and escape. PC Harwood wrote that he now 'feared for my safety' and eventually managed to find some other cops and struck out 'for my own safety and protection.' His notes, read to the court today, recorded: 'I had drawn my baton and began to strike at protesters who were running up to me and trying to kick and punch me.' The police then tried to clear the Royal Exchange passageway where he hit Mr Tomlinson. Harwood wrote: 'I again used reasonable force in order to clear the police lines, I do not remember how many persons I struck but had done so in order to prevent any other further rioting and in order to protect my safety.' The court was previously shown film footage of the moment Mr Tomlinson journey that day using video from he walked past PC Simon Harwood - who is primed in a strike position behind him . Starting to fall: PC Harwood is accused of hitting Mr Tomlinson with a 'forceful baton strike' from behind . As Mr Tomlinson is helped to his feet, PC Harwood is no longer visible on the CCTV footage . He was interviewed by the IPCC, but refused to answer questions and instead gave a prepared statement. Describing clearing the Royal Exchange Passageway, he said: 'I recall dogs biting protesters and demonstrators and there was a degree of disorder. 'I can remember people kicking out at police dogs and bottles being dropped and thrown. Video footage later showed the street almost empty as 47-year-old Mr Tomlinson moved slowly away from the police line with his hands in his pockets. It was originally claimed he died of a heart attack until footage shot was released of the attack by Harwood. He asked for information on Mr Tomlinson’s lifestyle and movements on that day - including an allegation that the father-of-nine had been at the protests for an hour - be investigated along with eye witnesses and CCTV before he could be 'properly and sensibly' interviewed. In his first statement to the IPCC two weeks after the incident Harwood said he had realised he was the officer when he saw it on TV. He said he told senior officers: 'In the context in which this engagement occurred, if it was me, the use of force was necessary, proportionate and reasonable in the prevailing circumstances. 'It is extremely difficult now to recollect this brief momentary event clearly.' He said his memory of events had been 'hampered and distorted' by the information already in the public domain. Harwood, of Carshalton, Surrey, denies manslaughter. The trial continues.","PC Simon Harwood maintains 'the use of force was necessary, proportionate and reasonable'

Shackled: Valerie Nabors gave birth to her fourth child last October, but within 10 minutes of delivery, she alleges that her ankles were shackled to her hospital bed and she was not allowed to walk . A former prison inmate who says she was shackled at the ankles in an ambulance while in labour prior to the birth of her daughter despite the objections of medical personnel sued the Nevada Department of Corrections on Wednesday. The suit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, cited what it described as shocking indifference to 'wholly obvious, serious medical needs' after the woman's ankles were shackled before and after giving birth in October. The woman, Valerie Nabors, was being held at the Florence McClure Women's Correctional Center in North Las Vegas for trying to steal about $300 in casino chips, a nonviolent crime, when she went into labour. Nabors, 30, has since been released. The lawsuit, which alleges violations of state law and Nabors' constitutional rights, said that after she went into labour, guards ran to the ambulance in which she was transported to the hospital and shackled her ankles together, despite protests by ambulance personnel. Steve Suwe, spokesman for the Nevada State Department of Corrections, would not comment on the case. In chains: The mother alleges that she was chained both in the ambulance and 10 minutes after giving birth (stock photo) The shackles remained on Nabors at the University Medical Center, causing her to stumble when a nurse told her to change into a gown, according to the lawsuit. Prison guards removed the shackles as she changed and then attempted to put them on again, but a delivery room nurse told them it was not necessary and that 'it would make medical history if Ms Nabors attempted to get away,' the lawsuit said. Guards shackled her again 10 minutes after her daughter's birth. During the following days of recuperation, an attending doctor diagnosed a pulled groin muscle and recommended physical therapy, but Nabors remained shackled and could not carry out the treatment, according to the lawsuit. Incarcerated: She was imprisoned at Florence McClure Women's Correctional Center outside of Las Vegas, Nevada (pictured) Mother in chains: She was taken to University Medical Center in Las Vegas, pictured, allegedly in chains . The prison also confiscated a medically prescribed breast pump, causing further hardship, the lawsuit said. Nabors was incarcerated less than a year for attempted grand larceny after attempting to steal the casino chips, said Staci Pratt, legal director at the ACLU of Nevada. 'Anybody who has gone through birth or witnessed it can imagine the challenges and difficulties of giving birth while shackled,' Pratt said. 'It is a far cry from the common standards of decency and what we expect as a civilized society.'","Valerie Nabors was being held for trying to steal $300 in casino chips .

A Labour councillor has said pupils from one of Britain's smallest schools may as well be sent to Eton with the money it costs to run the establishment. Ysgol Rhes y Cae, which has just nine pupils, costs Flintshire County Council more than £14,000 per . pupil, per year or £126,000 per year. It now wants to close the school in north-east Wales to save money. Bernie Attridge, council deputy leader said while no-one wanted to see any school closed, 'with the money that would be saved we may as well send each child to Eton'. However, fees at the prestigious . college, which boasts David Cameron and Boris Johnson as alumni, are almost . £31,000 per pupil, per year, meaning it would cost £279,000 to send all . nine children there. In the past two years the number of children attending the Welsh school, which has room for 45 pupils, has almost halved. Council officers say the annual cost per pupil at Ysgol Rhes y Cae is £14,029 compared to the county average £3,139. Flintshire Council says closing the school would save £119,328 per year. Mr Attridge, said: 'Why should children in one school only have £3,000 spent on them when some in another have £14,000 spent on them?' Pupils will be sent to nearby schools and teachers redeployed although redundancies cannot be ruled out. The school is controlled by the Church in Wales and the Diocese of St Asaph called the decision 'sad news'. Closure was first proposed in 2010 . when pupil numbers dropped to 18 but the plans were put on hold after . objections from parents and teachers. However, the school’s long-term future has been in doubt ever since and pupil numbers have continued to dwindle. Prestigious: Fees at Eton College are almost £31,000 per pupil, per year meaning it would cost around £279,000 to send all nine children there . Cabinet . member for education Colin Bithell said keeping the school open was . 'unrealistic' and any savings would be pumped back into the authority’s . education budget. He said: 'The school is the smallest in the county. The cost per child is four-and-a-half times the county average. 'We have to draw a line somewhere in the sand and in some ways it is quite unrealistic to continue. 'We would be robbing Peter to pay Paul.' Parents, teachers and governors will now be consulted on the planned closure and a final decision is expected in two months. Council leader, Aaron Shotton, said: 'Uncertainty has existed in the local community for some time. Alumni: David Cameron, left, and London Mayor Boris Johnson, right, both went to Eton College . 'It is clearly a very emotive issue but every surplus place that exists is a tax on other children.' Cllr Bithell believes pupils would receive higher quality education by moving to larger schools. He said: 'It is not only about savings, it is also about the quality of education that is being provided for children in schools of this size. 'You can’t even have a football team or a netball team when you have classes of this size. 'There are adequate places to accommodate the children affected close by. We want to get as much money out there for the benefit of every child in our schools.'

Insects are struggling with the UK's wet and cold summer, and are now at very low numbers, according to a wildlife charity. The Buglife conservation charity says that bees, wasps, moths and butterflies have all seen their populations drop in 2012 - and rare species may be at risk of extinction due to the elements. Bees and wasps have struggled to find enough nectar and aphids to feed on, while charity volunteers are reporting less sightings of moths and butterflies. Insects are vulnerable to weather . changes, and this year has seen some of the heaviest rainfall ever - . with April and June the wettest quarter ever reported. Chief executive Matt Shardlow told the BBC: 'They might not recover and could be driven closer to extinction.' Shardlow said damp conditions have reduced the number of aphids for wasps to feed on, and 250 species of bees were struggling without the high temperatures need to ensure a good supply of nectar and pollen. He said: 'We are seeing very low numbers of them now, as well as small bumble bees, which is a sign they haven't had enough nectar and pollen to feed on.' However it is not all bad news in the insect world, with creatures that thrive in damp conditions doing well over the wet months. Wasps feed on aphids, which are also in decline due to the weather, which leads to a knock-on effect in the food chain . It's not all bad news: Glow-worms are having a strong year, thanks to the proliferation of slugs and snails . Shardlow said drone flies and mosquitoes, and snails and slugs, have seen population booms. He said: 'This means that anything which feeds on slugs and snails will also benefit this year. 'We've had reports of large numbers of glow worms, for example, which feed on slugs and snails.' But volunteer counters are reporting a drop in moth and butterfly populations.","Bees struggling to find nectar, while wasps cannot find enough aphids to eat, says Buglife charity .

An elevator will allow her to go wherever she wants - and it's all being built by volunteers touched by her sad story. Her father Andy said: 'Right now our house is not Aimee-friendly because it's very small and compact. We're going to add an Aimee wing.' 'While she's getting better, we need to have this house prepared so she has a good viable home to come to.' Aimee was released from Doctors Hospital in August on Monday, two months after she cut open her calf in the accident. She will undergo rehab at an inpatient facility over the next six weeks, where she will learn to use a wheelchair and her prosthetic limbs. Dr Alberto Esquenazi, chief medical officer of MossRehab in Philadelphia, said of her long road to recovery: 'The first step is to provide patients with self independence.

That is evident by the fact that a local architect volunteered to design the space and several other community members signed on to build it. Casey Moon, a general and renovation contractor, is just one person to offer support for the worthwhile project. He said: 'How can you not want to help? I've always been that way.

'She has to relearn that ability, to get up and get whatever she needs to satisfy her. She needs to be able to have some mobility in her life again but as we speak that process has already started, she is already 30 minutes into her first rehab session.' Aimee was pictured leaving the hospital earlier this week smiling and showing off her amputated limbs as she clutched onto a doll. She seemed happy and comfortable to pose with hospital workers as she left hospital and when she was in the ambulance. Her mother Donna told Today: 'She was very excited when we got in the ambulance but it didn't take long before it was lights out. She fell asleep the whole way but when we got there she couldn't wait to get started, she is so motivated.' Aimee recently revealed to her parents she wants to be able to walk again for her graduation in December.

Earlier this month, Mr Copeland said his daughter had been enduring the worst pain of the ordeal. Her agony was so overwhelming that she began taking morphine after initially refusing medication.

Education Secretary Mr Gove said: ‘The . idea of a national flagship, designed to showcase the best of British . innovation, support scientific exploration and give young people a . wonderful training opportunity is more than inspired – it’s . inspirational. ‘Instead of national hand-wringing and . negativity, we need to remind ourselves that our nation, our engineers, . our scientists and above all our young people are worth boasting about. ‘This ship will embody the spirit of . unapologetic national pride which characterised our Jubilee celebrations . and demonstrate that Britons still have hearts of oak and a lust for . adventure.’ Mr Cable said the UK Flagship would . help fly the flag for British business around the world. The Royal Yacht . Britannia, decommissioned in 1997, was used for many trade deals. For . example contracts worth in excess of £1billion were signed on board . during a visit to India in 1993.

The news is a bitter blow for Samsung, blocking sales of a device that is the closest rival to Apple's iPad. It is the third legal setback to the South Korean firm in just a week, as it braces for a make-or-break patent trial later this month with Apple. Koh also slapped a pre-trial ban on sales of Samsung's Galaxy Nexus phone on Friday. Apple and Samsung, the world's largest consumer electronics corporations, are waging legal war in around 10 countries, accusing each other of patent violations as they vie for supremacy in a fast-growing market for mobile devices. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, rejected Samsung's request to lift her June 26 order to halt sales of the tablet, which runs on Google's Android and goes toe-to-toe with the iPad. ‘Samsung is disappointed with the court's decision that denied our motion to stay. We believe today's ruling will ultimately reduce the availability of superior technological features to consumers in the United States,’ Samsung said in a statement. The district court is not the last chance for Samsung to get the injunction lifted. Samsung has also appealed to a federal appeals court in Washington, DC, which has exclusive jurisdiction over intellectual property disputes. An Apple spokeswoman reiterated the company's previous comment that Samsung's latest products look a lot like the iPhone and iPad. ‘This kind of blatant copying is wrong and, as we've said many times before, we need to protect Apple's intellectual property when companies steal our ideas,’ the spokeswoman said. Samsung's rival to iPad has been banned from sale in America, after a judge handed Apple a victory in the two companies' long-running patent battle . ‘The impact on Samsung is limited as shipment volume of Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Nexus are quite small,’ said Lee Sun-tae, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities.‘Even if Apple wins an injunction request on Galaxy S III, Samsung will have plenty of time to get around it, as it normally takes quite a long time for a court to process such requests.’ The two companies have been locked in a battle over several continents over Samsung's Galaxy tablets and smartphones. Apple has waged an international . patent war since 2010 as it seeks to limit the growth of Google's . Android system, the world's best-selling mobile operating platform. US District Judge Lucy Koh said Apple 'has shown a likelihood of establishing both infringement and validity.' Yesterday . the U.S. District Court of Northern California said that the Galaxy . Nexus smartphone 'likely' infringes four patents held by Apple Inc., . including a patent used in the 'Siri' voice-activated assistance . available in the iPhone 4S. 'Apple . has clearly shown that it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the . absence of preliminary injunctive relief,' Judge Lucy Koh wrote in the . ruling available online. She . ordered Apple to post a $96 million bond - an estimated damage . sustained by Samsung from the temporary sales ban - in case the iPhone . maker loses to Samsung in a later trial, scheduled for 2014. The sales ban in the United States will be effective immediately when Apple posts the bond. The Galaxy Nexus lawsuit is one in a series of legal battles between Apple and Samsung. The . two world's largest makers of smartphones together claimed more than . half of the global smartphone market in the first three months of this . year. Samsung and Apple have been embroiled . in multiple lawsuits in Asia, North America and Europe since April 2011 . when Apple accused Samsung of copying its iPhone and iPad. Samsung shot back with claims that Apple is using its mobile technology without permission. Samsung's Galaxy tablets are the main rival to Apple's iPad - helped by the hit 'mini tablet' Galaxy Note (pictured) The latest order from the Californian . court follows Koh's decision on Tuesday to temporarily block the sales . of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet computer in the United States. But . it is 'the first serious blow' Apple has dealt to Samsung and Google . Inc., said Florian Mueller, a Germany-based patent analyst. The Galaxy Tab 10.1 was released more than a year ago and accounts for a small portion of Samsung's mobile sales. The Galaxy Nexus smartphone was launched in the U.S. market in December 2011. The Nexus is also the first smartphone to be powered by the most recent . Android . operating system called 'Ice Cream Sandwich,' which includes a unified . search feature that lets users search information stored in various . locations with a single input. As . a result of the sales ban, Samsung and Google's 'co-developed flagship . device for the current generation of Android will have to be stripped of . some or all of its Siri-like functionality,' Mueller said in an emailed . response. Samsung said it is disappointed with the court order and will take all legal measures. 'We . are currently working closely with Google to resolve this matter, as . the patent in question concerns Google's unified search function,' said . Nam Ki-yung, a Samsung spokesman. 'Samsung . will continue to take all available measures, including legal action to . ensure the Galaxy Nexus remains available to consumers.' Apple did not return calls seeking comment.","Injunction bars iPad's closest rival from sale in U.S.

An NYPD cop charged with gunning down an unarmed teenager in the Bronx pleaded not guilty in court today, eliciting cheers from his brethren in blue, but tears from the teen’s parents. New York Police Department Officer Richard Haste, 31, surrendered Wednesday morning and  pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges in a courtroom filled with other officers, relatives of 18-year-old victim Ramarley Graham, and their supporters. Graham was killed during a February 2 narcotics raid in the Wakefield neighbourhood of the Bronx. Haste thought Graham had a gun, and shot him in front of his grandmother and little brother as he tried to flush marijuana down the toilet, officials said. Applause: Richard Haste is applauded as he leaves the court in New York on Wednesday . Supporters try to block photographers from taking pictures as New York City Police Dept. officer Richard Haste, center, gets in a car after posting bail in New York . Anguish: Constance Malcolm, left, and Frank Graham, right, parents of 18-year-old Ramarley Graham cry as they attend the arraignment of NYPD officer Richard Haste . Moment of grief: Haste pleaded not guilty to charges of first- and second-degree manslaughter for the February shooting in the death of 18-year-old Graham . Not guilty: NYPD officer Richard Haste (centre, left) flanked by his lawyers Stuart London, (left) and Michael Martinez, (centre, right) plead not guilty . The scene at Bronx Criminal Court was a dramatic one, as Haste, wearing a dark grey suit and tie and on crutches, uttered only two words: ‘Not guilty,’ according to the New York Daily News. 'Ramarley was only 18,' his mother, Constance Malcolm, said outside court. 'We have too much of this going on and it has to stop. We need it to stop. We can't keep killing our kids. It has to stop. Something has to come out of this.' She then pleaded: 'Help me get justice for my son.' As Haste left the courtroom after posting $50,000 bail, dozens of officers applauded him. He was on crutches because of an unrelated accident and walked slowly to a car, while a small group of protesters chanted anti-police slogans behind him. The February shooting stemmed from an NYPD investigation of a persistent drug trade in the Bronx neighbourhood where Graham lived. At the time, police said investigators identified Graham as a potential suspect and radioed to other officers that he appeared to be armed with a pistol. Day in court: Haste, left, was on crutches from an unrelated incident; right, Judge Martin Marcus, who is presiding over the case, set bail at $50,000 . A witness told police that around the same time, two officers wearing NYPD jackets pulled up and yelled at a man - apparently Graham - 'Police! Don't move!' After the man ducked into Graham's three-family home, the officers found a back entrance, climbed some stairs and broke down the door to a second-floor apartment where Graham lived with his grandmother and other relatives, police said. An officer positioned behind Haste reported seeing Graham run toward a bathroom. He also heard Haste yell, 'Show me your hands!' and 'Gun! Gun!' before a shot rang out, police said. Crammed together in the tiny bathroom, Haste yelled for Graham to hold up his hands, and when the teen reached for his waistband, the officer fired, according to his lawyer, Stuart London. 'I thought he was going to shoot me, so I shot him,' Haste said in a court statement read by Mr London. Haste fired one shot at close range from his 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, police said. Graham was struck in the upper chest and collapsed in the bathroom. He was pronounced dead at a hospital. Unarmed: Ramarley Graham, 18, was shot and killed at his Bronx home in February by an NYPD officer . Officials said Graham was trying to flush a small amount of marijuana down the toilet as Haste approached . A search of the apartment didn't turn up any weapons. Police said they found marijuana in the toilet.Officers are allowed to use deadly force when they have a reasonable belief that they are facing an imminent threat of serious injury or death. But in the small Bronx bathroom, it was obvious there was no gun, and Haste should not have fired, District Attorney Robert Johnson said. 'We have too much of this going on and it . has to stop. We need it to stop. We can't keep killing our kids. It has . to stop. Something has to come out of this.' -Constance Malcolm . 'He had to know that he did not see a gun,' he said. However, Mr London said that Haste, who graduated from Lehman High School, had never before fired his gun in the line of duty in four years of service, according to the New York Post. ‘When he woke up that morning, he had no intention of firing his weapon,’ Mr London told the Post.The family has said Graham was shot as his grandmother and his 6-year-old brother looked on. Outside court Wednesday, a large group of supporters said they are holding vigils every Thursday in the Bronx for 18 weeks to celebrate the teen's life. His father, Frank Malcolm, broke down weeping when he said the boy wouldn't be home for Father's Day this weekend. Plea for peace: Outside of court, Constance Malcolm pleaded 'We have too much of this going on and it has to stop. We can't keep killing our kids' Pause: The teen's father Frank takes a moment to close his eyes as Ramarley's mother looks out over the press . 'Haste is going home to his family. When we leave here we're going to the cemetery,' he said. 'I keep asking why. Why did he kill our son? Why, why, did he kill our son? 18 years old. 18. He did nothing to deserve this.' Police Commissioner Ray Kelly ordered a review of whether training and tactics were sufficient in the street narcotics division, where Haste worked. The division differs from full-time narcotics police, who are more specialized. Haste had been on the force for four years and in the unit just weeks before the shooting. He had never before fired his weapon in the line of duty. Kelly said some adjustments were made to the unit after the review. An order was put out codifying requirements officers needed to meet before going into the unit, but he didn't specify what the changes were. Support: The Rev. Al Sharpton, left of centre, puts an arm on the back of Constance Malcolm after the arraignment as she wipes away tears . Outside the courthouse Wednesday, police union president Patrick Lynch said he respected the Graham family's grief but called it a tragedy resulting from a difficult situation. 'Today, we're here to show support for a New York City police officer who was put in a terrible position doing a difficult job,' Lynch said as the protesters chanted, 'NYPD. KKK. How many kids will you kill today?' Supporters of Graham's family said they worry officers were expecting trouble simply because Graham was black. They also say Haste, who is white, used excessive force. 'We're not looking for revenge. We're looking for justice,' the Rev. Al Sharpton, a family supporter, said afterward.","Parents of slain teen Ramarley Graham cried in court today as NYPD officer who shot him pleaded not guilty .

Tragic: Lance Corporal Michael Pritchard, 22, was killed in Sangin, Afghanistan by a single gunshot to the ribcage fired by the sniper from a British patrol base, an inquest heard . Soldiers directing an Army sniper who shot dead a British military policeman did not know other troops were stationed in the area, it was claimed yesterday. Lance Corporal Craig Knight said he 'felt sick' after realising that the marksman had accidentally gunned down a comrade, an inquest heard. The troops mistakenly thought Lance Corporal Michael Pritchard, 22, was a Taliban fighter burying improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Sangin, Afghanistan. Unknown to them, he was on the roof of a new observation post, codenamed N30. L/Cpl Pritchard, from Eastbourne,  Sussex, was killed by a single gunshot to the ribcage fired by the sniper from a patrol base 750 yards away. Coroner Alan Craze said there was something 'systematically wrong' if three troops with the marksman, Lance Corporal Malcolm Graham, of The Royal Scots Borderers, the 1st Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland, were unaware of the existence of the lookout. He also raised concerns that none of the men – L/Cpl Knight, Rifleman Ainsley Nash and Rifleman Nathan Bennett, all of 4th Battalion The Rifles – knew N30 was on the other side of a Restricted Fire Line, meaning they needed to permission to shoot at targets there. Rfl Nash told the inquest that at 7.45pm on the evening of  the shooting, he spotted two figures while using thermal imaging equipment. He said he 'assumed' they were on the road and added: 'I didn’t know about N30. I hadn’t been told it was there.' Radio communications between different parts of the base were 'very difficult' but the men were ordered not to fire warning shots, the inquest heard. Instead, they were told to fire illuminating flares. War zone: Fighting vehicles patrolling in Sangin, Afghanistan where it was claimed yesterday that British soldiers directed an army sniper who shot dead a British military policeman not knowing other troops were stationed in the area . But the inquest heard that the soldiers fired up to five warning shots because they believed the unidentified men were an imminent threat to life. They did not realise they needed permission to do this, Rfl Bennett told the court. Then L/Cpl Graham arrived at the sangar,  a protected position attached to the patrol base, with section commander Corporal Jonathan Dolton. He set up his .338 calibre sniper rifle before firing several shots 30 seconds apart. Shortly afterwards, they heard the words ‘Man down’ transmitted over the radio. Rfl Bennett told the inquest at Eastbourne Town Hall:  'L/Cpl Knight sat down and said he felt sick. 'The sniper then said, ""Don’t tell me we have been shooting at our own blokes"". 'I said we could not have been as there was no one near the road.' Cpl Dolton said the 'previous guys' manning the sangar should have told L/Cpl Knight and his men that a new observation post had been set up during the handover. The hearing continues.","Lance Corporal Craig Knight was on the roof of a new observation post, an inquest heard .

Osama Bin Laden’s family were kicked out of Pakistan in the early hours of today – just days before the first anniversary of the terror mastermind’s death. The slain Al Qaeda leader’s three widows, their eight children and one grandchild were flown to Saudi Arabia. A Pakistani judge ordered earlier this month that the women be deported to their countries of citizenship after serving a six month sentence for illegally entering the country. Scroll down for video . Deported: Amal Ahmed Abdul Fateh, from Yemen (pictured), is one . of Osama Bin Laden's three widows who was flown out of Pakistan shortly after midnight . Protection: Police officers escort a vehicle carrying the family of Osama Bin Laden, in Islamabad, Pakistan in the early hours of the morning as they make their way to the airport for deportation . The widows – Amal Ahmed Abdul Fateh, . Khairiah Sabar and Siham Sabar – have all been in custody with their . children since the pre-dawn May 2 Navy SEAL raid last year on Bin . Laden’s hideaway compound in Abbottabad. Fateh, Bin Laden’s youngest widow, is expected to travel on to her native Yemen with her four children. The . first sign that the family was departing came when a bus arrived at the . home where they were being held under house arrest in Islamabad to take . them to the airport. It was covered with a big cloth to hide them from the media. A special plane was flown in from Saudi Arabia to pick them up under tight security. A statement from the Interior Ministry . said 14 members of the Bin Laden family had been deported to the . 'country of their choice, Saudi Arabia'. All aboard: Pakistani security officials cover the windscreen of the bus as Bin Laden's family get on board and are driven to the airport . Saudi officials relented after initially refusing to take the family. The . widows and two older daughters, aged 17 and 21, pleaded guilty to . impersonation, illegal entry into Pakistan and staying in the country . illegally. Fateh told . Pakistani investigators that Bin Laden spent years on the run in . Pakistan after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, moving from . one safe house to another and fathering four children. The departure of the family closed another chapter in an affair that cemented Pakistan's reputation as a hub of Islamist extremism and cast doubt on its trustworthiness as a Western ally. In February, authorities bulldozed the large compound where Bin Laden had lived in the north-western garrison town of Abbottabad. Going: A vehicle carrying the Bin Laden family leaves for the airport shortly after midnight - almost exactly a year after the terror leader was shot dead by U.S. Navy Seals . Media scrum: The Bin Laden family are driven away from the property with a cloth covering the back of the vehicle to keep them hidden . The U.S. commandos took Bin Laden's body, which they later buried at sea, but left his family behind. It is unclear whether Pakistan gave U.S. intelligence officials any access to the wives, who are likely to have information about how Bin Laden managed to evade capture in Pakistan for nearly a decade following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks in the United States. The Pakistani government has denied knowing the terrorist leader's whereabouts. Saudi officials have given little information about the family and the plan to deport them. At home with the Bin Ladens: The family in their property while they wait for deportation . Makeshift: The beds in the building where they were living were propped up with bricks, and the building appears to be windowless or have the windows barred . Inside the 'home' of Osama's family: One of the widows reads from the Koran as a toddler looks on . The country stripped bin Laden of his citizenship in 1994 because of his verbal attacks against the Saudi royal family, and there have been questions about whether the country would accept the women. Pakistani officials were outraged that the U.S. did not tell them about the operation against Bin Laden until after it happened - a decision American officials explained by saying they were worried the information would be leaked. Relations between the two countries plummeted after the raid, and have yet to recover.

A BBC classical music presenter has been arrested and detained in Zimbabwe, a human rights group has said. Petroc Trelawny is believed to have been compering for free at a Bulawayo music festival when he was arrested for not having a work permit. Zimbabwe Vigil said Mr Trelawny - who presents classical magazine programme Music Matters, Radio 3's evening topical drive-time show In Tune and Radio 3 Live in Concert - was being held in the capital Harare. He was taken into custody on Thursday evening and the British Ambassador Deborah Bronnert is believed to have visited him. Detained: Petroc Trelawny was compering at a Bulawayo music festival when he was arrested . Rose Benton, co-ordinator of Zimbabwe Vigil, said she was told about the arrest by relatives in the former Rhodesia. 'He was apparently the only musician without a work permit and that is why they arrested him,' she said. 'He has been in police custody in Harare, pretty nasty business. 'Yesterday there was a public holiday. Normally it would take a day to get him out but he will be in until Monday probably.' Mr Trelawny, who lives in central London, was raised and educated in Cornwall. He joined Radio 3 in 1998 having begun his career at BBC Radio Devon as a reporter and presenter, and at the age of 19 hosted the station's major news programming. Soon after he became one of the nation's youngest newsreaders, presenting bulletins for BBC Plymouth's Spotlight. Presenter: Petroc Trelawny hosts Radio 3's Music Matters . Having read the news for British Forces Radio during the first Gulf War, he then joined the network as a presenter in Hong Kong and spent a year broadcasting to the military in what was then still a British colony. Mr Trelawny was invited to return to London and join Classic FM after a board member of the station heard him at work in Hong Kong. In 1994 he joined London News Radio, hosting a daily three-hour news-talk magazine where guests included cabinet ministers and senior businessmen alongside Dame Edna and Gore Vidal. In 1997 he co-presented (with Radio 5 Live's Victoria Derbyshire) the BBC GMR Breakfast Show in Manchester, covering the city's recovery from the IRA bombing and its planning for the Commonwealth Games. While in Manchester he started anchoring live broadcasts of concerts for Radio 3, joining the station full time the following year and returning to London.

South Africa's polygamist president Jacob Zuma could lose the £1.2 million he receives from the taxpayer to fund his four wives, it has been reported. Members of the 70-year-old president's own ANC party have suggested the spousal support allowance he currently receives, which is almost double that of his predecessors, should be restricted to one wife. While Mr Zuma's wives are not taking their turn accompaning him on his travels, they stay in individual, luxury thatched huts in his rural homestead or homes in cities. Ladies in waiting: South Africa's polygamist president Jacob Zuma could lose the £1.2 million he receives from the taxpayer to fund his four wives, it has been reported . South Africa's Times newspaper reported that members of Mr Zuma's own ruling party the African National Congress planned to raise the issue next week at a policy meeting. The publication said unnamed ANC officials had told its sister newspaper the Daily Dispatch they felt angry about the apparent waste of public funds. One delegate due to attend the party's policy conference said some activists believed Mr Zuma should pay for his extra spouses himself. He said: 'What was made clear during the discussions was that, as taxpayers, we cannot afford to continue financing so many wives. 'Only wife number one should get benefits from the state. 'Our understanding is that when you decide to have more than one wife, you are able to support the others. Then deal with it.' The Times reported that the possible showdown on Mr Zuma's spouses followed discussions about the president's private life by ANC conference delegates from South Africa's Eastern Cape province. President Zuma poses with three of his four wives (L-R) Sizakele Khumalo, Nompumelo Ntuli and Thobeka Mabhija in 2010 . The group of activists met on Monday to discuss possible policy changes ahead of the ruling party's key conference next week. It was reported that members of the organisation's Eastern Capre provincial economic transformation commission backed a proposal that taxpayers should pay for only one presidential wife. Party sources said the proposed new policy would be discussed again by the provincial members on Friday. If the Eastern Cape delegates agreed to take the issue further, the matter could then be tabled for discussion next week at the ANC's national policy conference in Johannesburg. Mr Zuma, South Africa's first polygamist president is a member of the country's Zulu tribe and permitted to take multiple spouses by law. He has been married a total of six times and has four current wives. The country's first ladies are currently looked after by the office of the Presidency, where they share official first lady duties on a rota. However the use of public funds for the presidential spouses has been a contentious issue since Mr Zuma's election as national leader in 2009. The Presidency stated earlier this year that the department's budget for 'spousal support' was around £1.2m  for the 2010/11 financial year. Local media reported that sum was around double the amount spent by Mr Zuma's presidential predecessors Thabo Mbeki and Kgalema Motlanthe, who both have just one wife. The controversy was heightened last year following reports the government had budgeted around £60,000 to have a fleet of luxury hire cars on standby across the country for Mr Zuma's spouses. Tribesman: President Jacob Zuma at his traditional Zulu wedding to Nompumelelo Ntuli in 2008 and (right) his most recent bride Tobeka Madiba arrives for her wedding in 2010 . And in April the Presidency was forced to make a statement on the spousal budget following fresh negative media reports ahead of Mr Zuma's latest nuptials. A spokesman for the statesman said the taxpayer would not face any extra bills following the president's marriage to Gloria Bongekile Ngema. However it confirmed that was because Ms Ngema, a businesswoman and graduate, had previously already qualified for support as a fiancee of the president. Presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj later said the taxpayer only funded the first ladies when they were on official duty. He said: 'The spouses pay their own living or household expenses, be it food, mortgages, lights, water and so forth. 'Nothing is paid for by the state in the spouses' four households. They live in private homes. 'There are, however, expectations that spouses will provide support to the president in the execution of his duties, and specifically so at state and official functions. 'The Presidency therefore provides reasonable administrative, logistical and other support .' Mr Zuma, who is believed to have fathered more than 20 children, wed his long-standing first wife Sizakele Khumalo, 69, in 1973. He married Nompumelelo Ntuli, 37, in 2008 and wed third current wife Thobeka Madiba, 39, in 2010. His traditional wedding to Ms Ngema in April has left him with four current spouses. The six-times married statesman has previously wed two other women. He divorced from South African cabinet minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma in 1999 and another wife, Kate Mantsho-Zuma, committed suicide in 2000. The president's four wives live in separate quarters at his rural home in the country's KwaZulu-Natal province. They each take turns to support their husband during official engagements and overseas trips. The fresh questions over Mr Zuma's private life comes as the president prepares to seek re-election as party leader. ANC members will consider the leadership in December at the organisation's five-yearly national conference. Local media has buzzed with speculation senior figures could be preparing to challenge Mr Zuma's leadership, although nobody has yet formally declared their intention to do so.",Members of his own ANC party say taxpayer-funded spousal support should be limited to just one wife .

A Florida man was arrested this week after being accused of stealing a woman’s horse and slapping paint over its white markings in a ruse meant to cover his tracks and fool the animal's owner. Bullet the horse found itself in the middle of a heated custody battle between Raphine Pierce, of Lake Helen, Florida, and Thomas Pugliese,, 46, who ended up behind bars over allegations of equine theft. Bullet was given to Pierce in July by Pugliese’s mother, who said she could not longer care for the animal, Orlando Sentinel reported. Custody battle: Thomas Pugliese, right, was arrested for allegedly stealing a horse that his own mother gave Raphine Pierce, left, and dying its markings to cover up the theft . However, about 10 days later, the . horse vanished from Pierce’s pasture. The woman reported the animal . missing and told police that she suspected that Pugliese’s daughter was . behind it. On August 13, . weeks after filing her report, Pierce said she spotted Bullet on . Pugliese’s property. The only problem was that the white, diamond-shaped . marking on the critter’s forehead was gone. According to Pierce, the tell-tale . sign had been dyed brown to match the rest of Bullet’s body, along with . other characteristic markings. Horesplay: Investigators said Pugliese's teen daughter (pictured) rode off on Bullet into the brush while police were waiting for a warrant to search their property . When Lake Helen police approached . Pugliese about the horse and his daughter's suspected involvement in his disappearance, the man blocked his . driveway with a truck and claimed that the horse seen prancing on his property was not . Bullet, according to a police report. Pugliese refused to let officers onto his land, so they sought a search warrant. While . Owen was waiting for the warrant to arrive, Pierce, who was also on the . scene, said she saw Pugliese’s daughter flee on the horse into the . woods. Mystery: Pugliese's daughter was eventually found after fleeing into the woods with the horse, but Bullet is still missing . Authorities said they . later learned that Pugliese told his daughter to ride off and hide the . animal, according to a Volusia County Sheriff’s Office report. After . an hour, Owen became concerned that the teenager may have gotten lost . in the dense brush, but her father would not report her as missing. The . girl was eventually found, but without Bullet. According to police, it is unclear who . legally owns Bullet. Pugliese could not produce any documents proving . that he is Bullet’s owner, while Pierce is in possession of the horse’s . medical records and registration information, Officer Scott Owen said. Equine ruse: Raphine Pierce claimed that Pugliese stole Bullet from her pasture and painted the white star on its forehead and other markings brown to match the rest of the animal . Police said Pugliese told them: ‘You aren’t going to get that horse back even if it means I have to take the ride to Daytona,’ referring to the Volusia County Jail. He was arrested and charged with felony grand theft of a farm animal, tampering with evidence and child neglect without great harm.","Thomas Pugliese, 46, was charged with grant theft of farm animal .

Some areas of the planet may already be so overpopulated as to be beyond hope - and once the planet is more than 50% under tarmac and agriculture, the results could be global disaster. When smaller areas hit levels above 50%, the results are disastrous. If the entire planet hits this 'tipping point', the effects would be impossible for scientists to predict. Rising populations are driving Earth towards a 'tipping point' where species we depend on die out, says a committee of 22 scientists - hitting industries such as fishing, agriculture, forestry and water . The committee calls for 'global leadership' to prevent such a disaster - but warns ome areas of the planet may already be so overpopulated as to be beyond hope. If the entire planet hits a 'tipping point', the results will be impossible for scientists to predict - and the committee calls for 'global leadership' to prevent such a disaster. Professor Anthony Barnosky, the lead . author from the University of California, Berkeley, warns: ‘It really . will be a new world, biologically, at that point. ‘The data suggests that there will be a . reduction in biodiversity and severe impacts on much of what we depend . on to sustain our quality of life, including, for example, fisheries, . agriculture, forest products and clean water. This could happen within . just a few generations.’ Studies of small-scale ecosystems have . shown that once 50-90 percent of an area has been altered, the entire . ecosystem tips irreversibly into a state far different from the . original, in terms of the mix of plant and animal species and their . interactions and usually resulting in species extinctions and a loss of . biodiversity. Currently with 7 billion people about 43 . percent of Earth's land surface has been converted to agricultural or . urban use and with a predicted rise to 9 billion by 2045 it is estimated . that half will be disturbed by 2025. ‘Can it really happen? Looking into the . past tells us unequivocally that, yes, it can really happen. It has . happened. The last glacial/interglacial transition 11,700 years ago was . an example of that,’ Professor Barnosky said. ‘I think that if we want to avoid the most unpleasant surprises, we want to stay away from that 50 percent mark.’ Population density is rising, as seen from this night view of Earth: If the entire planet hits this 'tipping point', the results will be impossible for scientists to predict - and the committee calls for 'global leadership' to prevent such a disaster. The paper, by 22 internationally . renowned scientists, calls for better predictive models based on a . detailed understanding of how the biosphere reacted in the distant past . to rapidly changing conditions - including climate and human population . growth. UC have begun a £2.6 million research . project to develop reliable, detailed biological forecasts, to . understand how plants and animals responded to major shifts. The authors of the review - biologists, . ecologists, complex-systems theoreticians, geologists and . paleontologists from the United States, Canada, South America and Europe . - argue that, although warning signs are emerging, no one knows how . close Earth is to a global tipping point. Professor Barnosky said: ‘We really do . have to be thinking about these global scale tipping points, because . even the parts of Earth we are not messing with directly could be prone . to some very major changes. ‘And the root cause, ultimately, is human population growth and how many resources each one of us uses.’ Co-author Elizabeth Hadly from Stanford . University said: ‘We may already be past these tipping points in . particular regions of the world. I just returned from a trip to the high . Himalayas in Nepal, where I witnessed families fighting each other with . machetes for wood - wood that they would burn to cook their food in one . evening. ‘In places where governments are lacking . basic infrastructure, people fend for themselves, and biodiversity . suffers. We desperately need global leadership for planet Earth.’ They urge global cooperation to reduce . population growth and per-capita resource use, to replace fossil fuels . with sustainable sources, develop more efficient food production and . distribution, and management of land and oceans not already dominated by . humans as reservoirs of biodiversity and ecosystem services. ‘Ideally, we want to be able to predict . what could be detrimental biological change in time to steer the boat to . where we don't get to those points,’ Professor Barnosky said. ‘My underlying philosophy is that we . want to keep Earth, our life support system, at least as healthy as it . is today, in terms of supporting humanity, and forecast when we are . going in directions that would reduce our quality of life so that we can . avoid that.’ ‘My view is that humanity is at a crossroads now, where we have to make an active choice. ‘One choice is to acknowledge these . issues and potential consequences and try to guide the future (in a way . we want to). The other choice is just to throw up our hands and say, . 'Let's just go on as usual and see what happens.' My guess is, if we . take that latter choice, yes, humanity is going to survive, but we are . going to see some effects that will seriously degrade the quality of . life for our children and grandchildren.’ Climate change, population pressure and widespread destruction of natural ecosystems may be driving toward an irreversible change in biosphere with devastating consequences, the prestigious group of researchers say. In just a few generations our food and water supplies could be gravely effected with some plant and animal species being wiped out completely. But we can prepare ourselves by learning lessons from what happened in the past, it is said. The review paper, which will be published tomorrow in the journal Nature, compares the biological impact of past incidences of global change with processes under way today and assess evidence for what the future holds. The results could cause some plant and animal species to disappear, new mixes of remaining species, and major disruptions to crops - leading to global political instability, it is claimed.","If 50% of landscape has been altered by man, Earth may hit 'tipping point'

"By . Chris Parsons . UPDATED: . 11:21 EST, 25 August 2011 . A U.S. population census has named North Dakota as the top American state to live in for a secure and happy marriage. The northern U.S. area ranked among the top states for marriage while also posting lower than average divorce rates, according to the first-of-its kind analysis by the Census Bureau. With marriages at an all-time low, states in the South and West of America ranked among the highest for couples hearing wedding bells. 2009 figures from Census Data show marriage rate per 1,000 men in USA . 2009 figures from Census Data show marriage rate per 1,000 women in USA . The analysis noted, however, that many of these states also have higher rates of divorce. The Census Bureau analysis also found that people are waiting longer before marrying for the first time. Wedding bells: States in South and West America in general had the highest amount of marriages . In particular, the percentage of women who wed as teenagers has dropped since 1970, while many men are postponing marriage past their college-age years. Regionally, the South and West had the most marriages, with rates of roughly 19 per 1,000. But they also led in divorces, each at about 10 per 1,000. Maine, Alaska, Oklahoma, Kentucky and Nevada, ranked at the top for divorces, while Utah, Wyoming and Arkansas - which had the highest marriage rates - were also higher than average in marital breakups. New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York ranked among the lowest in divorces. North Dakota ranked among the top states in marriages while posting lower than average divorce rates. The Census Bureau report attributed the lower rates of divorce in the Northeast in part to delayed marriage in those places, which decreased the likelihood of marital discord down the road. Andrew Cherlin, a professor of sociology and public policy at Johns Hopkins University, said: 'Surprisingly, the South and West, which we think of as more socially conservative, have higher rates of divorce than does the supposedly liberal East. The geographical centre of North America is in Rugby, North Dakota. The state was recently voted the friendliest in the U.S. and has also been ranked the safest state to live in. In . 2006 North Dakota broke the record for the biggest ever french fries . feed, dishing out 4,620 pounds of the salty snacks at its annual French . Fries Frenzy. North Dakota has more wildlife refuges than any other state. It . also has the world's biggest all-sports store, the 196,000 square-ft . Scheels Flagship Store in the state's largest city Fargo (above) which . has its own ferris wheel. 'The reason is that young adults in . the South and West tend to have less education and marry earlier, both . of which lead to a higher risk of divorce.' 'The South and West also have many . migrants from other parts of the region who have left their social . support networks behind. When they have marital problems, they have . fewer people to turn to for help,' he added. As . to the age at first marriage, the Census Bureau found that men and . women were now joining in wedlock later and across a greater range of . ages. For . instance, in 1970, more than half of men, 57 per cent, were between the . ages of 20 and 24 when they first married. By 2009, the age . distribution was much wider, with 24 per cent marrying between the ages . of 20 and 24, 34 percent marrying between the ages of 25 and 29, 20 . percent marrying between the ages of 30 and 34, and 9 percent marrying . between the ages of 35 and 3. Similarly for women, in 1970, 42 percent . of women were teens when they married, and by the age of 24 about 88 . percent of women had a first marriage. By 2009, the shares had dropped . to 7 percent and 38 percent, respectively. 2009 figures from Census Data show divorce rate per 1,000 women in USA . 2009 figures from Census Data show divorce rate per 1,000 men in USA . As a whole, since 1970, the median age at first marriage increased from 22.5 years to 28.4 for men and from 20.6 years to 26.5 for women. Pamela Smock, a sociology professor at the University of Michigan, said the rising median age of first marriage is a reflection in part of the proliferation of new types of family groups, including couples who choose to live together and/or have children outside of marriage. Recently divorced women who lived with their children were found to experience the most financial hardship compared with others. In 2009, roughly 1.1 million . children, or 1.5 per cent of all children, lived in the home of a parent . who divorced in the previous year. Delaware and Wyoming ranked at the . top for states with more widowers (5.4 per 1,000 men), while Hawaii had . the most widows (10.3 per 1,000 women). The census analysis is based on 2009 data from the American Community Survey, which sampled 3 million households. It is the first to describe detailed . information on marriages and divorces from this survey after the . National Center for Health Statistics stopped collecting such data in . 1996. 'People are no longer following some lockstep script about when it is time to get married,' she said. As a whole, marriages are now at a . record low, with just 52 percent of adults 18 and over saying they were . joined in wedlock, compared with 57 percent in 2000, according to census . data released last September. The never-married included 46.3 per . cent of young adults 25-34 - the first time the share of never-married . young adults exceeded those who were married, 44.9 percent, with the . rest being divorced or widowed. Marriages . have been declining for years due to rising divorce, more unmarried . couples living together and increased job prospects for women. But . analysts say younger people also may now be increasingly choosing to . delay marriage as they struggle to find work and resist making long-term . commitments in the recent recession.","South and West states have most marriages .

"By . Ross Slater . PUBLISHED: . 16:05 EST, 19 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:54 EST, 20 May 2012 . Her career as an AIDS expert for the World Health Organisation had taken Hilary Hughes to many exotic locations, but the tiny island of St Lucia captured her heart. Divorced, and with her son James almost grown up, it seemed like the ideal time to make a fresh start and build her dream home – so she decided to sell her house in West Sussex to  pay for a plot of land on a hillside overlooking the Caribbean. Her new life appeared to be complete when she fell in love with and married Cleus Augustin, a Rastafarian 17 years younger than her. He was  the muscular young builder she had employed to construct her house. Tragically, however, Hilary, 50, died in hospital earlier this month  in circumstances that have prompted the local police to open a criminal investigation. Secret wedding: Hilary, her hair in dreadlocks, married Cleus in 2009 - she didn't tell her family she was marrying him . St Lucia police commissioner Vernon Francois said yesterday: 'As far as I know, no arrest has been made. The matter is still under investigation and we are still working with the hospital authorities towards determining an exact cause of death. 'A post-mortem examination has been conducted but further work is required. We are intending to speak  to several people in connection with this matter and one of those will be her husband.' Now her heartbroken parents have revealed the extent to which her dream of happiness on the paradise island turned into a nightmare. In phone calls home, a disturbing picture of Hilary's life emerged that alarmed her elderly parents. She claimed she had been defrauded over the purchase of her land and then blocked by the police from taking any action. She discovered that the person who sold her the land was not the only person who claimed ownership of the plot. And after completing her £120,000 home, she faced voodoo-style intimidation – with dead animals left outside her house. Hilary's married life appeared equally troubling, with stories of domestic violence and hospital treatment emerging within a year of the 2009 wedding and a petition for divorce being filed by her last year. Investigation: Commissioner Vernon Francois said no arrest has been made . Her 80-year-old mother, Pamela Hughes, said: 'She rang me regularly to say what was happening and it worried us terribly. 'I don't know how much money she lost over the sale, but it was a lot. She tried to get the police involved, but they wouldn't let her press charges. 'Then several neighbours – who had been very pleasant when she first moved in, even asking her to read a eulogy at a funeral – claimed to be descendants of the original owner of the land and said they were entitled  to a payment. She spent a fortune in local courts establishing she had the right to sell the house she had built.' The judgment in her favour did not end local resentment in the tiny  village of La Guerre, a poor community of 60 houses mostly built of tin. According to her mother, Hilary's life 'turned very nasty indeed'. St Lucia is predominantly Roman Catholic but as is the case in many former French and Spanish colonies, some of its 166,000 inhabitants also practise a form of voodoo called Obeah and they directed these dark forces against the Englishwoman in the house on the hill. Her mother, who lives with husband Barry in Dorridge, near Solihull in the West Midlands, said: 'Hilary told me  there had been dead dogs and cats left in her garden as a warning. 'She said it was a form of voodoo designed to intimidate her and she was very frightened.' By this stage, her marriage was offering little comfort and neighbours said they regularly heard arguments coming from the marital home. When Hilary wed in June 2009, she kept it a secret from her family. The nuptials were witnessed by the groom's parents and her best friend. Wearing a tight-fitting floral dress, she had her hair dreadlocked Rasta-style and looked a picture of happiness as she pledged herself to her smiling suitor. But within a year, 5ft 1in Hilary was in hospital and filing charges of assault against her new husband. Barry, 79, a retired professor of engineering, said: 'She said she had been in hospital over a week. She had pictures taken of her injuries so she could prove how bad it was. At Christmas that year Cleus brought his five-year-old daughter to visit England when Hilary was spending time here with James but we refused to meet him. 'We took the little girl out but we wanted nothing to do with him after what he was supposed to have done. 'Hilary was an attractive, outgoing woman. We wished she'd ditch him and find somebody normal.' Hilary initially pressed charges against Cleus for grievous bodily harm but these were withdrawn in January 2011 when the matter went before magistrates. Dream home: But Hilary's house on the hill caused legal disputes with locals . In April last year, she filed for divorce on the grounds, acceptable in St Lucia, that the marriage had lasted less than five years and Cleus moved out. But this was not the end of the relationship. According to Hilary's mother, while her daughter was away on one of her frequent foreign trips Cleus would move back into the house. Whether it was the loneliness of a single life in a tiny, hostile community where the only shop is a dilapidated caravan selling cold drinks, or the fear of failing at a second marriage, Hilary's feelings for Cleus remained strong and she kept seeing him. Then, last month, Hilary was readmitted to the island's general hospital. A day later she suffered a stroke and a heart attack. Her son James, 18, and her sister Sarah, 49, flew out to be at her bedside but after two weeks in a coma she suffered respiratory failure and died on May 4. Initially, the death was described by the police as a 'tragic accident' and due to 'natural causes' but last week The Mail on Sunday revealed that officers had changed their minds and had made it a criminal investigation. The news that their daughter's death was being viewed as suspicious by the authorities has caused anguish to her parents. Her father said: 'To think she still wanted to go back to that man is very painful for us to bear. The entire venture had been a nightmare. 'Hilary had always been very successful. She's always been a good provider and earned enough to send her son to boarding school, but in St Lucia she went from a position of being quite well-off to one where she was constantly having to ask for our help. Revealed: How the Mail On Sunday reported Hilary's death last week . It seems that while they welcome foreigners over there as tourists, it is fatal for that tourist to be so attracted to the place that they acquire land.' Her mother added: 'We just want the St Lucia police to investigate it properly. Hilary loved St Lucia – the climate, the countryside and the people – and I think she felt utterly let down. 'She was a friend to the whole world and had dedicated her life to going to poor places and making a difference to their health needs. 'I really want to know why she died, and if anyone is responsible for it then I hope they are hunted down so they don't ever have the chance to do it again.' Hilary's death comes less than five months after another Englishwoman, lawyer Sarah Thomas, 46, who also married an islander, fell 100ft from a cliff to her death. Her family accepted the police verdict that it was an accident. Cleus could not be reached for comment.","Hilary Hughes' calls home painted disturbing picture of her new life in the Caribbean .

Former convicted kidnapper Mohammed Haroon Ali was found guilty of first-degree murder after savagely attacking Tracey Biletnikoff and strangling her using his hands and a t-shirt at a drugs treatment centre in California. The 37-year-old was on probation for the kidnapping and threatening to kill a former fiancé when he met Ms Biletnikoff in 1997. Justice: Mohammed Haroon Ali, 37, (left) was convicted of first-degree murder by a San Mateo County jury and sentenced to 55 years-to life after strangling Tracey Biletnikoff, 20 (right) They were both recovering from drug addictions and were involved in counseling younger addicts at Project Ninety, a treatment programme in San Mateo. Ali relapsed, District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said, and Ms Biletnikoff confronted him about it on February 15. In what his attorney described as a ‘drug-crazed fury’ Ali killed his girlfriend, then dumped her body hear Canada College in Redwood City and fled to Mexico. Authorities caught up with him as he crossed back over the border, driving the dead woman’s car.

Murdered: The Facebook profile picture of Megan-Leigh Peat, 15, who was stabbed to death at a house party . A schoolgirl was stabbed to death at a house party hosted by a boy whose parents were away. Megan-Leigh Peat, 15, was attacked at the home alone gathering in the early hours of Saturday. A 19-year-old who was allegedly seen leaving the house covered in blood and with his finger almost severed was being questioned by police last night. It is believed Megan, who wanted to train as a midwife, knew the boy. Megan's father David, 39, laid a floral tribute to his daughter at the scene of the murder in Ampthill, Bedfordshire, yesterday. A card attached to it said: 'Megan Moosay, miss you more than words can say. You will always be in my thoughts and forever in my heart. Love you forever, Dad.' Some of the teenagers who attended the party had been seen smoking cannabis in the cellar bar of a nearby pub in the hours before the attack. It is believed Megan had gone to the house with at least one friend and may have been joined by others later. Paramedics went to the house at 1.30am after calls saying a girl had been fatally injured. Despite attempts to revive her, she died at the scene. A few minutes earlier, police had come across a 19-year-old in a street nearby who had a severe injury to one of his fingers. A trail of blood ran from the house and a neighbour's Vauxhall Astra had blood spattered on the tyres. One resident said a woman in her 40s and her teenage son had moved into the rented semi-detached house around three months ago. She said the boy had celebrated his 18th birthday about a month ago, adding: 'They seem like a nice family. I don't see much of them but when they moved in they did the front garden up so they are obviously house-proud.

"By . Snejana Farberov . PUBLISHED: . 22:17 EST, 25 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 22:17 EST, 25 August 2012 . In hot water: Activists are calling on RNC leader Pat Rogers to step down following the release of an email he sent making incendiary comments about American Indians . Republican National Committee leader Pat Rogers has found himself in hot water after sending an email lambasting New Mexico Government Susana Martinez for dishonoring the memory of infamous Civil War General George Armstrong Custer by meeting with Native-Americans. Custer is notorious for taking part in the muddled Indian Wars of the 1860s-1870s that took the lives of scores of members of the Cheyenne, Lakota and other tribes. He was killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876. ‘The state is going to hell,’ Rogers, a GOP lobbyist and recent member of the RNC Executive Committee, wrote in a June 8 email to Martinez's staff. ‘Col. [Allen] Weh would not have dishonored Col. Custer in this manner,’ he went on to say, referring to the Republican candidate for governor who was defeated by Martinez in the 2010 election. The email was obtained by Independent Source PAC and released by ProgressNow New Mexico, a liberal advocacy organization, which has called on Rogers to step down over his incendiary comments, Indian Country Today reported. ‘Such a blatantly racist statement against our native people is offensive from anyone, but to come from a national GOP leader and lobbyist for some of our country’s largest corporations is indefensible,’ Progress Now New Mexico’s executive director Pat Davis said in a statement. Rogers is currently in Tampa, Florida, preparing for the Republican National Convection that is set to get under way on Tuesday after being delayed by a day due to Tropical Storm Isaac. Martinez is expected to take the stage at the convention on Wednesday, delivering a prime time address after former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and before the vice presidential nominee, Congressman Paul Ryan. Historical connection: Rogers attacked Governor Martinez right, for dishonoring General George Armstrong Custer, left, notorious for his involvement in the Indian Wars, by meeting with Native-Americans . The email was sent to senior members of Martinez’s administration after the governor met with New Mexico’s Native-Americans in June. Martinez, who is widely considered to be the rising star in the GOP, is required by law to attend the annual state-tribal leaders summit, according to Progress Now New Mexico. ‘These e-mails show the contempt and disrespect New Mexico’s Republican leadership has for our Native people,’ Davis added, saying that unless the organizations Rogers speaks for, including the RNC, dismiss him, the public should assume that they feel the same way. ProgressNow New Mexico has posted an online tool that allows people to email RNC leaders and the corporate CEOs of Rogers’ law firm, Modrall Sperling, and lobbying clients to call for his ouster. This is not the first time Rogers has found himself in trouble over emails. Controversial: Former RNC Chairman Michael Steele was criticized in 2010 for using the racially incentive term 'honest injun' In July, he was forced to step down from the board of the New Mexico Foundation for Open Government after he was criticized for using personal email accounts to contact state government officials. Rogers was appointed to the GOP executive committee by former RNC Chairman Michael Steele, who faced a similar backlash in 2010 after he publicly used the term ‘honest injun,’ which Native-Americans find racially offensive. The RNC and Rogers have not responded to requests for comment.","RNC leader Pat Rogers sent the email to Governor Susana Martinez's staff on June 8 .

"By . Leon Watson . UPDATED: . 05:40 EST, 24 July 2012 . BP focused too much on small safety . details instead of the big systemic hazards . that led to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, a U.S. government safety panel has concluded. The report also found the oil giant was not as strict on . overall safety when drilling rigs involved other companies that they . hired. Eleven workers were killed in the . April 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig and around 200 million . gallons of oil flowed into the gulf from the . blown-out Macondo well. The company had the lease on the well, . but the drilling rig was owned and operated by another company and BP . has faulted drilling contractor Transocean. Settlement reached: BP's Deepwater Horizon oil spill released between 4 and 5 million barrels of crude into the Gulf of Mexico and claimed the lives of 11 oilmen in April 2010 . That contractor-owner split made a . difference in major accident prevention with the oil disaster, the U.S. Chemical Safety Board concluded in a presentation to be made at a . hearing in Houston today. 'BP applied lesser process safety . standards' to rigs contracted out than it does to its own facilities, . safety board managing director Daniel Horowitz said. 'In reality, both Transocean and BP dropped the ball on major . accident hazards in this case.' The oil company 'did not conduct an . effective comprehensive hazard evaluation of the major accident risks . for the activities of the Deepwater Horizon rig or for the Macondo well' because BP's large risk evaluation programme 'looked only at BP assets, . not drilling rigs that it contracted' to other firms for operation, . investigators said. A BP spokesman said the company 'stepped up' and developed more rigorous safety indicators following the accident. Smoke from a controlled burn of spilled oil off the Louisiana coast in the Gulf of Mexico coast line . Disaster: Thick crude oil from the spill being collected near Port Sulphur, Louisiana in 2010 . The safety board said when BP looked . at offshore endeavours it 'focused on financial risks, not process . safety risks'. And after the Deepwater Horizon explosion, the company's . own accident investigation report 'recommended requiring hazard reviews . of BP-owned and contracted rigs', the safety board's presentation says. 'That's very disturbing because the . Gulf of Mexico belongs to the American people,' said former senator Bob . Graham of Florida, who co-chaired a different government oil spill . investigation, one appointed by President Barack Obama. A fire aboard the Deepwater Horizon oil rig raged for days before sinking . An oil soaked bird struggles against the side of the HOS Iron Horse supply vessel, at the site of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill . A team of federal regulators concluded that BP has to bear the ultimate responsibility for the spill . A series of government investigations have spread blame for the disaster. In January 2011, a presidential commission found that the spill was caused by time-saving and money-saving decisions by BP, Halliburton and Transocean that created unacceptable risk. But the panel also concluded that the mistakes were the result of systemic problems, not necessarily the fault of any one individual. In September 2011, however, a team of Coast Guard officials and federal regulators issued a report that concluded BP bears ultimate responsibility for the spill. The report found BP violated federal regulations, ignored crucial warnings and made errors during the cementing of the well a mile beneath the Gulf of Mexico. BP has repeatedly said it accepts part responsibility for the spill and will pay accordingly, but has urged other companies to pay their share. BP has established a $20 billion fund to resolve many of the claims out of court. By mid January this year the Gulf Coast Claims Facility has paid out nearly $6 billion from the fund to more than 569,000 individuals and businesses. BP waived a $75 million cap on its liability for certain economic damage claims under the 1990 Oil Pollution Act, though it denied any gross negligence. The Chemical Safety Board's findings, . which mostly mirror the report from Mr Graham's panel and another, . pointed at a second standard for what BP owned and operated and what it . did not. Mr Graham said he did not know that. 'If that's true, it's reprehensible,' Mr Graham said. Congressional Democrats requested the . safety board investigation. The panel usually investigates deadly . industrial accidents and makes recommendations but has no power to . regulate, much like the National Transportation Safety Board. The panel has been criticised for its . role in investigating the disaster. Transocean resisted complying with a . subpoena arguing that the spill fell outside the board's jurisdiction . that involves industrial accidents onshore. An offshore rig is an . ocean-going vessel that is motionless when drilling. The board also had to push to gain . access to the examination of the blowout preventer, and at one point . demanded that the analysis stop, saying representatives of the companies . that made and maintained the 300-ton device have been getting . preferential and sometimes hands-on access to it. The board's presentation said there is . a difference between worker safety and making sure the entire rig and . well are safe, and that's where owner BP and rig operator Transocean . were 'inadequate'. And that same lack of focus on the . bigger picture of safety bore an 'eerie resemblance' to what the safety . board found in its investigation of a 2005 explosion at BP's Texas City . refinery that killed 15 people, safety board investigator Cheryl . MacKenzie said. That federal oil spill commission . report, co-chaired by Mr Graham and former EPA chief William Reilly, and . a National Academy of Engineering found similar problems.","U.S. government report finds BP focused too much on little safety details .

A woman who arranged  for her 13-year-old daughter’s boyfriend to be killed after he posted topless  pictures of her online wept yesterday as she was jailed for seven years. Gedu Bibi, 47, was furious after discovering that Sumon Miah, 21, had brought shame on her family. She lured him to their home, where he was hit over the head with a table leg ‘to teach him a lesson’, the Old Bailey heard. Jailed: Gedu Bibi, 47, left, was jailed for . seven years yesterday for luring her 13-year-old daughter's boyfriend Sumon . Miah, right, to her home in Walthamstow where he was killed . Bibi then tried to frame her daughter, Shuhina Khanam, for the murder by wiping the table leg clean and thrusting it into the girl’s hands. She ordered Shuhina to tell police she had hit Miah in self-defence after he lunged at her with a knife. Her 12-year-old son, Fhalak, was also made to back up the story. Although the killer has never been found, Bibi’s lawyer yesterday suggested that it was her estranged husband, Angur Miah, to whom the victim was not related. The court heard that Angur –  who was arrested but never charged – fled to Bangladesh, leaving his wife and five children. He has since taken a ‘very young’ girl as his second wife and is ‘enjoying life’. Bibi, who was cleared of murder but found guilty of manslaughter  and perverting the course of  justice, sobbed as she was told she would serve at least three and a half years. Judge Gerald Gordon said her actions meant that ‘the person striking the blow has never been brought to justice’. The court  heard Shuhina first met Miah at  the hospital where he worked  as a porter. Behind bars: Lilu Miah, 48, was given two years behind bars for perverting the course of justice but he is already serving ten years for rape . They had a ‘fairly brief’ relationship, which Shuhina ended some time before the killing. Four days before the attack, Bibi was shown four lewd photos of her daughter that Miah had  apparently posted on the internet. The photographs showed the girl naked from the waist up. In her fury, Bibi is said to have told ‘someone else’ to bludgeon Miah to death on her behalf. After the attack on October 8, 2006, Miah fell into a coma and died nine days later from brain damage. The photographs of Shuhina were still on his phone when it was examined by police. Shuhina later told police that Miah had threatened her with a knife and she had hit him with the table leg in self defence. However, police found only her fingerprints on the knife and there was no blood or hairs on the table leg. Prosecutors say Bibi managed to ‘hoodwink’ the police for years  with her story, and the case was closed two years later. But fresh information emerged in 2010 which led to Bibi and her friend, 49-year-old cafe owner Lilu Miah, being charged with murder. He was arrested after a former friend, Monor Uddin, contacted police to say the cafe owner had confessed his involvement to him. Although Lilu, of Forest Gate, East London, was cleared of  murder and manslaughter, he was jailed for two years for perverting the cause of justice by conspiring with his nephew to construct a false alibi. The defence said Bibi, of Walthamstow, North East London, was of ‘good character’ and ‘full of remorse’.","Sumon Miah, 21, died from brain damage after being hit with a chair leg .

"By . Jack Doyle, Home Affairs Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 18:15 EST, 7 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:41 EST, 8 May 2012 . FAILING to kick radical cleric Abu Qatada out of the country has cost taxpayers at least £3million, figures have revealed. The huge bill, which has been run up over more than a decade since he was first arrested, is more than twice earlier estimates. The revelation comes ahead of tomorrow’s ruling by European judges on whether Qatada’s appeal against deportation should be allowed to go ahead. Laughing at British 'justice': Qatada smirks as he is arrested earlier this month . If his case is accepted by the European Court of Human Rights, it is likely to prompt a fresh bid for him to be released on bail. The issue for the panel of five judges meeting in Strasbourg tomorrow is whether Qatada’s appeal was lodged in time and should now be heard by the court’s Grand Chamber. Last week the Home Office confirmed the running total of its legal bill for trying to deport Qatada, a Jordanian, is £825,000. It is thought the hate preacher – who has been given full access to legal aid – has run up a similar bill thwarting efforts to kick him out. Taxpayers have also had to cover the cost of keeping Qatada in a maximum security prison for more than eight years, at a cost of some £850,000. Since 2005, he has spent nearly a year on bail, leading to huge costs for the police and security services to make sure he does not flee. In addition, Qatada and his family have been in receipt of state benefits since they arrived in Britain in September 1993. He was also given £2,500 in compensation by the European Court of Human Rights in 2009 for ‘unlawful detention’. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be angry and dismayed by this latest estimate of the cost. ‘By blocking Qatada’s deportation, the European Court of Human Rights is forcing taxpayers to continue coughing up for this vile hate preacher. The Government should be taking urgent action to bring this case to a swift and satisfactory conclusion. Quite simply, he is not entitled to be here and we should be free to deport him.’ The Mail can also reveal the extent of Government efforts to recover some of the cost of Qatada’s legal aid bill. When he was arrested, officials discovered more than £200,000 in his bank account. The money was frozen by the Treasury and since 2009 some £217,286.57 has been seized. Grim affair: Home Secretary Theresa May ordered Qatada's rearrest on April 17 . But that is eclipsed by the amount he has cost taxpayers. Last week immigration minister Damian Green said that since 2002 Home Office legal costs totalled £825,000. He added: ‘The case is ongoing and so further costs are likely to be incurred.’ Qatada, 51, is represented by Gareth Peirce, of Birnberg Peirce & Partners, and Edward Fitzgerald QC. It is thought his defence costs are likely to total a similar amount. The cost of locking up one prisoner in a maximum security unit is estimated at £100,000 a year. Qatada has been held in both Belmarsh and Long Lartin prisons. Qatada was detained by Home Office officials last month after ministers gained assurances from Jordan which they say will allow him to be sent back for trial. In January the European Court of Human Rights said Qatada could not be deported as he may be tried on the basis of evidence gained under torture. Home Secretary Theresa May ordered his re-arrest on April 17 after she was told the deadline for him to appeal to the Grand Chamber of the Strasbourg court had passed at midnight on the 16th. Playing the system: Qatada has run up a huge legal bill over a decade . But Qatada’s lawyers filed appeal papers with the court just before midnight on the 17th, claiming the Home Office got its dates wrong. A panel of judges will now make a decision on whether to accept the appeal, but will not publish its reasons or indicate what the real deadline was. A successful appeal could mean further delays of up to two years. And that is likely to prompt a fresh bail appeal. The immigration judge who last month ruled Qatada should stay behind bars has said he will reconsider freeing him if he thinks deportation ‘is not imminent’. Qatada was first arrested after the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001. In total he has spent more than eight years in jail. A spokesman for the Legal Services Commission said: ‘The Commission has done everything in its power to ensure Abu Qatada contributes to his legal costs. 'Aid for Special Immigration Appeals Commission cases is only available if the applicant passes strict financial means and legal merits tests.’","Family have been claiming benefits since they arrived in Britain in 1993 .

Christopher Jameson, Director of theTakamanda Mone Landscape Project, added: 'The video represents the best images to date of Cross River gorillas, normally shy animals that flee at the slightest hint of human presence. 'The footage provides us with our first tantalizing glimpses of Cross River gorillas behaving normally in their environment. A person can study these animals for years and never even catch a glimpse of the gorillas, much less see anything like this.'At one point, a male silverback appears, surveying the area (and perhaps aware of the camera) before running past the camera lens giving a classic 'chest-beating' display. Another gorilla (appearing in the footage at around 1:18 in the sequence) appears to be missing a hand, a healed injury but a disquieting indicator of the presence of snares within the family group's range in the past before increased patrolling in the now-protected area. 'Cross River gorillas occur in very low densities across their entire range, so the appearance of a possible snare injury is a reminder that continued law enforcement efforts are needed to prevent further injuries to gorillas in the sanctuary,' said Dr. Liz Macfie, Gorilla Coordinator for WCS's Species Program. At one point, a male turns towards camera and is clearly visible . The Kagwene Gorilla Sanctuary was established by the government of Cameroon in 2008 for the sole purpose of protecting the Cross River gorilla. The sanctuary is now managed by a conservator (chief warden) assisted by two ecoguards, all appointed by the Ministry of Forests and Wildlife (MINFOF), and a strong team of local staff from the eight villages near the protected area. Kagwene is the only site where daily monitoring of Cross River gorilla movements takes place.'Spectacular footage such as this, which we've never had before for Cross River gorillas, is absolutely vital to inspire local people, the governments of Nigeria and Cameroon, and the global community to care about and to save this unique subspecies,' said Dr. James Deutsch, Executive Director for WCS's Africa Program. 'Continued research of this kind will help fine-tune management plans to protect this rarest of apes.'The Cross River gorilla is the rarest of the four subspecies of gorilla, with fewer than 250 individuals remaining across its entire range, limited to the remote forested mountainous terrain on the border region of Nigeria and Cameroon. The subspecies is listed as 'Critically Endangered' and is threatened by both habitat destruction and hunting, as the entire population lives in a region of high human population density and heavy natural resource exploitation. Local community residents in the area surrounding Kagwene do not directly hunt Cross River gorillas due to traditional beliefs, but they do set snares for other forest animals, and these could occasionally injure gorillas.","Fewer than 250 Cross River gorillas survive .

A black ice hockey player racially abused on Twitter by fans after scoring a stunning series-winning overtime goal has said the comments were 'shocking to see, but didn't ruin my day'. Washington Capitals forward Joel Ward, 31, was called a n***** and f***** on the site after his sensational shot eliminated the Boston Bruins in the dying moments of yesterday's game. But he has refused to let the slurs, dubbed 'ignorant and unacceptable' by the NHL and the Bruins, to mar his moment of glory. Scroll down for footage of the goal... Winner: Washington Capitals' Joel Ward (centre) celebrating as he scored the game-winning goal, but he was later subjected to racist tweets . Ecstatic: But Joel Ward shrugged off the racist remarks by saying the posters were 'just kids' Disgusting: Ward was abused on Twitter by fans after scoring a stunning series-winning overtime goal has said the comments were 'shocking to see, but didn't ruin my day' 'It doesn't faze me at all. We won, and we are moving on. People are going to say what they want to say,' he told USA TODAY Sports. Angry Boston fans also told Ward, who has played in the NHL for four years, to 'go play basketball, hockey is a white sport'. They also typed '4th line black trash' and 'white power', while another said the fact a black player scored 'makes this loss hurt a lot more'. Anson Carter, a black winger who played for four seasons for the Bruins during a 10-year NHL career, said he was 'very surprised' by the reaction. Shutting them up: Ward scored just six goals all year before he slammed home a rebound at 2:57 of overtime to give the Capitals a 2-1 victory . He said: 'I thought we were beyond that. But then again, nothing surprises me. I know racism exists but if people think all NHL fans are racist, that's the furthest thing from the truth.' He called Ward's goal, which propelled the Capitals into the second round, one of the biggest NHL moments ever for a black player, rivalled only by Jarome Iginla's exploits for the Calgary Flames. Ward scored just six goals all year before he slammed home a rebound at 2:57 of overtime to give the Capitals a 2-1 victory. The reaction to Ward's goal 'sets the league back in terms of perception,' Carter said. He added: 'The league has come a long way. To the casual fan, people may have in the back of their minds that it's a racist sport, and this validates that idea.' Ward called the tweets 'shocking' but brushed them off, saying that he wasn't even aware of them until a teammate brought them to his attention on the plane ride back to Washington. 'It doesn't faze me at all,' he said, adding he had never experienced any racism in the NHL, only a few remarks at youth tournaments when he was growing up in Canada. Idiotic: There have been a few racial incidents over the years, including a banana thrown at the Philadelphia Flyers' Wayne Simmonds in a preseason game last autumn . Momentous: The goal has been billed as one of the biggest NHL moments ever for a black player, rivalled only by Jarome Iginla's exploits for the Calgary Flames . He added: 'I think it is just kids. It has no effect on me whatsoever. I've been playing this game long enough and I've not had any encounters of that nature.' He said he has always felt comfortable in an NHL dressing room and on the ice: 'There is no lying about it. …I'm definitely the one black guy in a room with 20 white guys. 'There are definitely some cultural differences, such as taste in music, but I've never heard anything derogatory.' And he says he has no concern about his safety moving forward in the playoffs: 'I'm pretty laid-back and I get along with a lot of people. 'I don't fear anything like that, and I have a good group of guys to protect me.' Willie O'Ree was the league's first black player, breaking into the Bruins' lineup in 1958, and there are now 28 blacks and a total of 68 non-whites in a league of 876 players.

It's not something you want to happen, but it's sad in this day and age that it continues to happen.' The NHL said in a statement that the tweets were, 'ignorant and unacceptable. The people responsible for these comments have no place associating themselves with our game'.

'Too often the policy debates on immigration fixates on just one part - illegal immigration,' said Karthick Ramakrishnan, a political science professor at the University of California-Riverside and a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. 'U.S. immigration is more diverse and broader than that, with policy that needs to focus also on high-skilled workers.' He added: 'With net migration from Mexico now at zero, the role of Asian-Americans has become more important.' Around 430,000 Asians, or 36 per cent of all new immigrants, arrived in the U.S. in 2010, according to the latest census data. That's compared to about 370,000, or 31 per cent, who were Hispanic. Across the nation: Regional dispersal of Asian-Americans, according to the latest census data . The Pew analysis, . released today, said the tipping point for Asian immigrants likely . occurred during 2009 as illegal immigrants crossing the border from . Mexico sharply declined due to increased immigration enforcement and a . dwindling supply of low-wage work in the weak U.S. economy. Many Mexicans already in the U.S. have also been heading back to their country, putting recent net migration at a standstill. As recently as 2007, about 390,000 of new immigrants to the U.S. were Asian, compared to 540,000 who were Hispanic. The shift to increased Asian . immigration, particularly of people from India, China and South Korea, . coincides with changes in U.S. immigration policy dating to the 1990s . that began to favor wealthy and educated workers. The policy, still in place but subject to caps that have created waiting lists, fast-tracks visas for foreigners willing to invest at least half a million dollars in U.S. businesses or for workers in high-tech and other specialized fields who have at least a bachelor's degree. The study revealed variations among Asian subgroups which belied their typecast as a 'model minority' POVERTY: As a whole, Asian-Americans had a . poverty rate in 2010 of 11.9 per cent, lower than the 12.8 per cent for . the general U.S. population. By country of origin, however, Koreans, . Vietnamese and Chinese were more likely than the average American to . live in poverty, at rates of 14 per cent or more. EDUCATION: The share of . Asian-Americans who hold at least a bachelor's degree surpasses the . national average, 49 per cent to 28 per cent. Vietnamese, however, fell . below the national average at 26 per cent. People from India were most . likely to have a college degree, at 70 per cent. UNEMPLOYMENT: Asian-Americans ages 25 and older were somewhat less likely to be . unemployed than the national average for the first quarter of 2012 - 6 . per cent compared to 7.4 per cent for all U.S. workers. But in terms of . long-term unemployment, Asian-Americans fared much worse, with median . duration of unemployment at 28 weeks, second only to African-Americans . (31 weeks). The national average was 22 weeks. ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION: While immigrants from Asia often obtain visas and arrive . legally, many also sneak across the U.S. border or become undocumented . residents after overstaying their visas. Up to 15 per cent of Asian . immigrants in the U.S. are here illegally, compared to 45 per cent of . Hispanic immigrants. International students studying at U.S. colleges and universities are now most likely to come from Asian countries - around six in ten - and some of them are able to live and work in the U.S. after graduation. Asian students, both foreign born and U.S. born, earned 45 per cent of all engineering Ph.D.s in 2010, as well as 38 per cent of doctorates in math and computer sciences and 33 per cent of doctorates in the physical sciences. Several bills pending in Congress that are backed by U.S. businesses seek to address some of the visa backlogs, through measures such as eliminating per-country limits on employment-based visas or encouraging investment in the sluggish U.S. real estate market. They have stalled amid broader public debate over immigration reform that has focused largely on lower-skilled, undocumented workers. In recent years, more than 60 per cent of Asian immigrants, aged 25 to 64, have graduated from college, double the share for new arrivals from other continents. As a whole, the share of higher-skilled immigrants in the U.S. holding at least a bachelor's degree now outpaces those lacking a high-school diploma, 30 per cent to 28 per cent. 'Like immigrants throughout American history, the new arrivals from Asia are strivers,' said Paul Taylor, executive vice president of the Pew Research Center and co-author of the report. 'What's distinctive about them is their educational credentials. These aren't the tired, poor, huddled masses of Emma Lazarus's famous inscription on the Statue of Liberty. They are the highly skilled workforce of the 21st century.' The findings are part of Pew's broad portrait of Asian-Americans, immigrants or U.S.-born children of immigrants who come mostly from China, the Philippines, India, Vietnam, Korea and Japan. Now tied with Hispanics as the fastest-growing U.S. group, the nation's 14.5 million Asian-Americans are slowly becoming visible as founders of startups in Silicon Valley, owners of ethnic eateries, grocery stores and other small businesses in cities across the U.S., as well as candidates for political office and a key bloc of voters in states such as California, Nevada and Virginia, according to experts. Deterrent: Illegal immigration to the U.S. from Mexico has dropped following moves like the fences along with Arizona-Mexico border . Projected to make up one in ten residents by mid-century, Asian-Americans as a whole tend to be more satisfied than the general public with their lives and the direction of the country. They lean Democratic, prefer a big government that provides more services, and place more value on marriage, parenthood, hard work and career success. The Pew survey is based on an analysis of census data as well as interviews with 3,511 Asian adults living in the U.S., conducted by phone from January 3 to March 27. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points for all respondents, higher for subgroups.","Demographic change caused by increase in visas granted to specialized workers and wealthy investors .

"Actress' lawyer Mark Baute insists: 'We will go for re-trial' By . Amelia Proud . PUBLISHED: . 14:57 EST, 19 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:49 EST, 19 March 2012 . It's been four years since fans watched Edie Britt, the vamp of the Desperate Housewives' original five, die from electrocution in the aftermath of a dramatic car crash. And today, Nicollette Sheridan - the actress who played the pneumatic blonde - stormed out of court in an equally compelling fashion after discovering she was just a juror away from vindication in her wrongful termination suit brought against her former bosses... and a $6 million payout. Judge Elizabeth Allen White declared a mistrial following days of a solidly hung jury, this means that the case will have to be brought to trial again if Nicollette Sheridan wants to pursue a verdict. Scroll down for video... Stony-faced: Nicollette Sheridan after she stormed out of court following the mistrial verdict which cost her roughly $6 million . Dramatic exit: Nicollette was up and away after the verdict was delivered but her lawyer Mark Baute stayed behind to confirm that they will continue to fight at a re-trial . And well, she might, considering the position of the jury at mistrial. They were hung 8-4 in favour of her version of events: that Edie was killed because Sheridan complained about series creator Marc Cherry's behaviour towards her. Nicollette needed just one more juror to be convinced that this is what happened for a victory verdict, and those damages of just under $6 million. Well heeled: Nicollette has donned a couture suit with matching pumps for each day of testimony and deliberation . She claimed that he'd given her a 'wallop' on the head during a rehearsal for a scene in 2008, he contended it was a 'tap' for direction as they worked on her character's responses. It had seemed this argument was terminally wounded when this charge of battery against Cherry was dismissed early last week. He was released as a defendant in the case but the issue of whether ABC and Cherry killed Edie off because of the complaint, regardless of the severity of the incident, still remained. And the jury almost conclusively agreed with Sheridan's claims, despite Cherry and ABC bosses taking the stand over the past two weeks to insist this exit was months in the planning BEFORE this incident and subsequent complaint. Much of the testimony focused on the . timing of Cherry's decision to kill off Edie. Ten witnesses said he made . it months before the on-set incident, but two writers for the show said . her fate was not sealed until after. 48-year-old Sheridan wanted at least $5.7 million from creator Marc Cherry and Touchstone Television Production. The two-week trial offered jurors a behind-the-scenes look at the soap, which is to bow out this spring after eight seasons. The testimony of more than a dozen writers, executives and producers was often unflattering. There were tales of salary disputes and arguments over forgotten lines. Sheridan said Cherry talked down to her, and he recalled her as rude, unpunctual and unprepared for rehearsals. He also . recounted her fighting with co-star Teri Hatcher over forgotten lines . and said two other stars, Felicity Huffman and Eva Longoria, were . 'relieved' when they learned she was leaving the show. Vindicated... almost: Sheridan, who was smiling hopefully as she arrived at court in LA today with lawyer Mark Baute, had eight jurors behind her when a mistrial was recorded, she need one more to win . Battled it out: Nicollette said Cherry (right) 'walloped' her but this battery charge was dismissed meaning he was not at court for the last few days . The Desperate Houswives cast: Brenda Strong, Felicity Huffman, Marcia Cross, Eva Longoria, Teri Hatcher and Nicollette .

Scientists say they have found one of the world's oldest living organisms and man's remotest relative - after spending two decades examining a microscopic algae-eater that lives in a lake in Norway. They have even had to invent a new category of organism for it called Collodictyon because it is not an animal, plant, parasite, fungus or alga, they said. They said the elusive, single-cell creature evolved about a billion years ago. Spot the family resemblance? The newly identified collodictyon is closer to human beings than to bacteria, according to the Norwegian scientists . ""We have found an unknown branch of the tree of life that lives in this lake. It is unique!"" University of Oslo researcher Kamran Shalchian-Tabrizi said. ""So far we know of no other group of organisms that descends from closer to the roots of the tree of life than this species."" Scientists believe the discovery may provide insight into what life looked like on earth hundreds of millions of years ago. Collodictyon lives in the sludge of a small lake called Ås, 30 kilometres south of Oslo. Glorious mud: the find that scientists said was 'unique' was made in the sludge of a lake south of Oslo . It has four tail-like propellers it uses to move around called flagella, and at 30 to 50 micrometres (millionths of a metre) long it can only be seen with a microscope. Collodictyon possess cell nuclei enclosed by membranes, which makes them less like bacteria and more like eukaryotes, that is, plants, fungi, algae and animals, including humans. Using the characteristics of collodictyon, Dr Tabrizi said scientists inferred that prehistoric eukaryotes were probably a single-cell organism with finger-like structures that it used to catch microscopic prey. ""They are not sociable creatures,"" added co-researcher Dag Klaveness, who bred millions of the tiny organisms for the study. ""They flourish best alone. Once they have eaten the food, cannibalism is the order of the day."" They have not been found anywhere but in Lake Ås. ""It is quite fascinating that we can still find these kinds of organisms after so many years,"" Tabrizi told AFP. ""It has been outside our living rooms for millions of years and we haven't seen it."" Collodictyon was first found in the lake about 20 years ago by University of Oslo scientists who recognised it was unusual but ""didn't know how important it was"", he added.","Creature is 'new category' of organism .

John Travolta's lawyers say the actor was in New York City on the date a male masseur is accusing him of sexual assault in Los Angeles. And they believe that new evidence of a restaurant receipt and a photograph of the actor proves it. A receipt from a meal the Pulp Fiction actor ate at Mr. Chow restaurant in New York on January 16, 2012, has now emerged, the same day he is alleged to have sexually harassed an anonymous masseur in a Beverly Hills hotel. Photographic evidence: Lawyers for John Travolta claim that this photo taken of the actor on the 16th of January this year in New York clears him of sexual assault allegations . The receipt, obtained by TMZ.com, allegedly shows that the actor dined at the famous eatery and was presented with a check late in the evening. He paid a bill of $382.69 for the . meal, as well as a $100 tip. However, Okorie Okorocha, the lawyer . representing both alleged victims - who are each seeking $2million in . damages - states that the receipt does not prove much. He said: 'The credit card receipt that Mr. Travolta says proves he was in New York City has a time stamp of 11:38p.m., our complaint clearly says the assault occurred in the morning of January 16. 'This credit card receipt proves absolutely nothing, and it doesn't account for the day of January 16. My client was sexually assaulted at 10 a.m. Travolta could make it to New York on horseback in that time.' The . Pulp Fiction actor, who has described the sexual assault claims as 'baseless', was also  photographed in New York on January 16th. New York dining: A receipt from a meal the Pulp Fiction actor ate at Mr. Chow restaurant in New York on the same day has also emerged . It is claimed by TMZ.com that two photos show him first at 4:30p.m. and then again at 5:21p.m., at a fitting for his upcoming movie Killing Season. Yesterday a second man filed a lawsuit claiming the actor tried to grab his penis during a massage session on January 28 in Atlanta,  Georgia but John's attorney Marty Singer has denied both claims, and states he can prove not only that his client was in New York on January 16 but that he was there the day before as well. Okorocha claims there are over 100 other men prepared to come forward . with similar stories about the 'Hairspray' star. He . told RadarOnline.com: 'By the time this case is over Marty Singer will . have to accuse more than 100 men of lying because I have been contacted . by people, mostly men, that have first hand information about similar behaviour on John Travolta's part to that contained in the lawsuits I . have already filed against him. 'I have witnesses and the potential for more accusers in virtually every state of the union who have called me. 'I'm . currently in the process of investigating their claims and verifying . the information before possible further action is taken. 'In . response to Mr. Singer who said he will take legal action - not only . against the claimant, but also the claimant's lawyer - for malicious . prosecution, Okorie said: 'If . Marty Singer thinks he can sue me on the validity of Mr. Travolta's . denials, and if he wants to file the lawsuit now, I will give him a . waiver allowing him to proceed with it at this stage of the case, even . though under California law he has to wait until he wins the case, and . that absolutely won't be happening. It will never happen, he won't win, . so we might as well get it over with now. Bring it on.'. Lawsuit: Travolta, pictured with wife Kelly Preston, is facing accusations of inappropriate sexual behaviour towards two male massage therapists . Yesterday in a statement, a spokesman for the actor, who fully denies the initial sexual battery lawsuit, said: 'This lawsuit is a complete fiction . and fabrication. None of the events claimed in the suit ever occurred. 'The plaintiff, who refuses to give their name, knows that the suit is a . baseless lie. It is for that reason that the plaintiff hasn't been . identified with a name, even though it is required to do so. 'On . the date when plaintiff claims John met him, John was not in . California, and it can be proved that he was on the East Coast. Plaintiff's attorney has filed this suit to try and get his 15 minutes . of fame. John intends to get this case thrown out, and then he will sue . the attorney and Plaintiff for malicious prosecution.' Happily married: Travolta with wife Kelly on . April 25th as they left Barbra Streisand's 70th birthday party and two . days before the first alleged incident on January 16th, they appeared at the . G'Day LA event . According to RadarOnline, . the second accuser claims to have 'substantial documentation and . numerous witnesses regarding the substance of Travolta's actions.' Travolta's lawyer Singer has branded the accusation just 'as absurd and ridiculous as the first one'. Singer also revealed he will take legal action - not only . against the claimant, but also the claimant's lawyer - for malicious . prosecution. Denial: Travolta, on the set of his latest film Savages in LA last year, will fight the case, according to his lawyer . He told The . Hollywood Reporter: 'There is a heightened standard for a lawyer suing a . celebrity and knowing the media will pick it up. The lawyer can't just . rely on the client. He needs to do an investigation and has an . obligation to do due diligence.' Whispers about John Travolta’s sexuality have plagued his movie career almost from the outset. Various camp roles in films – most notably as a drag queen in the musical Hairspray – have helped fuel rumours he is secretly gay. But there have also been strongly denied accusations he has been living a double life strikingly at odds with his family man image. They include rumours that his 1991 marriage to Kelly Preston was arranged by the shadowy cult-like religion of Scientology, of which he is a leading disciple. Seven years later, the father-of-two Travolta was named as a homosexual in court papers by a former member of the Church. The case never got a hearing, however. And in 2001, Travolta faced unsubstantiated claims that he had tried to pick up a business executive in a health club. However, the rumour mill reached a crescendo in 2006, when the actor was seen apparently kissing a male friend as he prepared to board his own Boeing 707 jet in Canada. Travolta has always maintained he is not worried by rumours surrounding his sexuality, insisting 'I don't think anyone can hurt me.' According to the the second accuser's lawsuit, which was . filed on Tuesday morning in Federal Court in Los Angeles, the victim . alleges that while working at an unspecified resort in Atlanta, Georgia . on January 28, 2012, he did an in-room massage on Travolta. According . to the documents, Travolta was staying on the 15th floor of the high-end resort, and he was referred to as Mr. White. The documents claim that the plaintiff 'doesn't . normally do in-room massages and asked a co-worker to take the . assignment, but he declined because Travolta has been banned from a spa . that the coworker used to work at in Los Angeles.' On the morning of the massage . Travolta is said to have had 'a strange demeanour, bloodshot eyes and climbed onto the . already setup massage table'. The lawsuit continues: 'Travolta removed the entire sheet from his . body, and he claimed the sheets were sticky and could not tolerate the . heat. Travolta further indicated that he likes a lot of ""Glutes"" work . meaning a massage on his buttocks.' The plaintiff also alleges that . Travolta began masturbating after attempting to get him to touch his . 'scrotum, upper thighs and buttocks'. In the first incident, Travolta allegedly claimed that he got his . first big movie break due to the sexual favours he performed while . starring in the 1975 TV series Welcome Back Kotter. The plaintiff, or accuser - who refuses to be named because his . lawyer claims he is frightened of the Hollywood powerhouse - alleges . that Mr Travolta picked him up in his black Lexus SUV after a anonymous phone . appointment was made instructing the masseur to wait in a specific spot . in a nearby street. Second accuser: Court papers have been amended since another masseur has claimed sexual battery by the star . Pseudonym: The second masseur stated that Travolta booked an appointment under the name 'Mr White' Same month: The second accuser claims the incident took place during an in-room massage in Atlanta, Georgia on January 28 . During the journey, the man noticed condoms alongside chocolate cake wrappers littering the console of the vehicle, . After pulling up outside the Beverley . Hills Hotel, they are then said to have entered one of the business's . annexes opposite the main building, which are known as bungalows. They were then greeted by an . 'overweight' black man who was grilling hamburgers. This chef is then . said to have disappeared when Mr Travolta allegedly tried to have sex . with the male masseur. The masseur is seeking more than $2million in damages. 'Fiction' A spokesperson for Travolta has hit out at the claims, even claiming that Travolta was not in LA at the time - though he was pictured at a G'Day LA event with his wife two days earlier . Witness:The plaintiff recalls a chef cooking burgers present for the first half of the massage, which passed without incident . Serious allegations: Travolta is absolutely refuting that he was even in LA at the time of the alleged incident . Okorcha, who is also representing the first masseur told RadarOnline.com: 'My client is afraid of John Travolta. He added: 'Mr. Travolta made very explicit threats against my client, which are contained in the lawsuit. 'Specifically, John Travolta told my client that Hollywood is controlled by homosexual Jewish men who expect favours in return for sexual activity. 'Let's face it, John Travolta is an extremely powerful man, and my client absolutely felt threatened by Mr. Travolta. My client was sexually assaulted by Mr. Travolta and he needs to be held accountable for his actions.'","Travolta pictured in New York on the same day first incident is alleged to have taken place .

Brayden Grusman-Buckmaster died last year from injuries sustained when he was two months old and living with his mother, Monique Bork, and her then boyfriend, Edward M. Thompson, Jr. He was taken to Sunrise Trauma Center in Las Vegas, Nevada in August 2006 and doctors found he had injuries consistent with Shaken Baby Syndrome - and did not think he would survive. Arrested: Monique Bork, left, and her ex-boyfriend Edward M. Thompson Jr., right, allegedly shook Bork's son when he was just two months old. The boy suffered severe injuries and later died, aged five . Bork, now 26, told police after her son was hospitalised that he had not been acting himself. She said that he had been hit in the head by a falling toy a few weeks prior. But Thompson, now 32, told police that Bork was not telling the truth and that he had dropped a telephone on the boy's face, the Las Vegas Sun reported. Brayden was taken off life-support a week later and placed in hospice care. He lived with his grandparents for two years and was eventually . put into foster care and adopted. He suffered numerous problems as a . result of the alleged abuse. He was blind, had cerebral palsy and relied on a gastronomy tube to feed him. Victim: Brayden died in July 2011 from his injuries. After the alleged abuse, he was placed in foster care and later adopted. Right, he is pictured with his adoptive mother Gayle Grusman . Injuries: The youngster was left with cerebral palsy and was brain damaged. He was also legally blind . When Brayden died last July, news channels ran segments about his story and a witness stepped forward to say she had taken the boy to the hospital with Bork when he was a baby. She told police that Bork and Thompson had married and bragged how 'now we can't testify against each other'. But when their relationship began to crumble, Bork told the woman that Thompson had shaken the baby, causing his injuries. 'I know he did it,' she had said. 'I know he did it from day one.' The former couple has now been charged . with murder and child abuse and neglect with substantial bodily harm in . the death of the boy. 'Abuse': A friend of Bork's saw news coverage of the boy's death on TV last year and stepped forward to tell police Bork had told her Thompson had shaken the baby . Struggles: Brayden relied on a gastronomy tube to feed him until his death . Remembered: Grusman and her partner Tish Buckmaster have marked one year since his death . Thompson was arrested on Monday and Bork was arrested on Tuesday. Both are being held in the Clark County Detention Center without bail. It comes after outcry following Brayden's death that no charges had been brought against his abusers. Investigators had originally said they were unable to pinpoint who had carried out the alleged abuse as there had been four people in the house: Bork, Thompson and Thompson's mother and brother. 'The DA won't re-open the case because . there's no new evidence as to which adult it was in the household,' one . of the boy's adopted mothers, Gayle Grusman had told KLAS-TV. Adoptive parents: Tish Buckmaster, left, and Gayle Grusman, right, called for justice following their son's death . 'Somebody needs to pay for it, somebody killed him,' his other mother, Tish Buckmaster, said. Despite his extensive injuries, the women remembered their son as perfect. 'He was just a very happy child,' Buckmaster said. 'When he declined do fast it was a shock to us.' Grusman added: 'I loved his half-crooked Elvis smile. He was our world.'","Monique Bork and Edward Thompson claimed a toy fell on boy's head .

But the three employees covering the town and the rest of Ceredigion county were laid off at the end of May 2011 due to budget cuts, before the council started to draw up plans for its own attendants. Aberystwyth’s last parking ticket was given to pub landlord Darren Huxtable, who was caught using a disabled space on May 31. In a surreal scene, he clutched his penalty notice and posed for a smiling photograph with now-redundant warden Juliet Morgan. Car park operator NCP said it was the . worst place in the country to find a parking space and a 2006 study . found 30 per cent of its traffic were drivers looking for a space. The local newspaper, Cambrian News, has . run a regular Street of Shame feature, picturing some of the . worst-offending cars, complete with unobscured number plates. The residents outrage grew when it emerged that some of the offending drivers were police officers. Drivers have been able to park where they like provided that nobody complained that they were causing an obstruction. Some motorists have been parking on double yellow lines, single yellows, on street corners, on zig-zag lines, on pavements and in disabled bays without fear of recriminations. Cyril Baker, who owns a jewellery store in the town, said: ‘It’s making life difficult for businesses, it’s bad for road safety, and the fear is it could delay an ambulance or a fire engine.’ The council has already warned . motorists that they now face a greater risk of being penalised if they break . parking restrictions. But with the new enforcement system coming into . force on a bank holiday, there is bound to be a flood of penalty notices . with motorists becoming used to ignoring restrictions. A . council spokesperson said the new Civil Parking Enforcement Team will . be working seven days a week including evenings and bank holidays.

He accepted a police caution . A major Conservative Party donor and friend of the Prime Minister has received a police caution for harassing his ex-wife. William Ives, 68, who has a £266million fortune, is alleged to have bombarded Pearl Adams, 56, with telephone calls for years after their divorce. The steel tycoon was arrested at his Essex mansion and was released after he agreed to accept a caution. The donor has given more than £560,000 to the Conservative Party and has attended lunches and Downing Street garden parties with the Prime Minister. He gives more than £50,000 per year to the party and as a member of the 'Leaders Group' of donors has regular meetings with Mr Cameron and George Osborne. His ex-wife Pearl, a Marks and Spencer shop assistant, was allegedly abused and threatened during a string phone calls. However, Ives, who is chairman of Rainham Steel which he founded in 1973, says he only called his ex-wife a few times. He told police he was only trying to win her back. Pearl attended lunch in Mr Cameron's Commons office after Prime Minister's Questions and a private dinner for donors in London while she was with Ives. She was diagnosed with cancer last year and was forced to undergo gruelling chemotherapy sessions. Ives was arrested at his mansion on April 2 and taken to the nearby Basildon police station for questioning after police refused his offer to come in for questioning voluntarily the following day. Tycoon: Bill Ives, founder and chairman of Rainham Steel, has an estimated £266million fortune . Officers suggested he had been bombarding his ex-wife, from Southend, Essex, with 30 calls per week for two years - but Ives dismissed the claims as rubbish. The Tory donor met his future wife through a dating agency in October 2004 and wooed her by picking her up in a chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce with champagne on their second date. He also tried to give her a gold bracelet but she refused to take it. He also took her on a series of lavish foreign holidays. They stayed in the Ritz Carlton in New York together after flying to the U.S. in First Class. Pearl, resigned as an account manager at an IT company in 2006, to marry the steel tycoon. Donor: David Cameron, pictured in Japan today, is a friend of William Ives who he has met on a number of occasions . Pearl, who has two adult children from her previous marriage, had a row with the tycoon on a Caribbean cruise and they split a few months later. Ives admitted phoning his ex-wife on a number of occasions but denied he had harassed her. He told the Daily Mirror: 'I accepted a caution on the advice of my solicitor but my gut reaction was not to accept it because I hadn't harassed her in my opinion. 'She's been sending me Valentine's cards for the last few years and, I believe, calling the house up late at night but withholding her number. I've done nothing wrong whatsoever. 'I accept I have made a few calls but nothing like on the scale I have been accused of and I've never left a threatening message.' He admitted he would still like to be with her - but accepted their relationship was over. Ives regularly dines with Communities and Local Government Minister Eric Pickles and has given over £10,000 to support his Brentwood constituency party. The steel tycoon, who left school at 16, has ploughed money into Scunthorpe United football club as their main sponsor. A spokesman for Essex Police said today: 'Police were contacted on Monday March 19 by a 56-year-old woman from Southend who was reporting that she was being harassed. 'An investigation was launched and a 68-year-old man was arrested at his home in the Brentwood area on April 2. 'He subsequently accepted a police caution after admitting to harassing a woman through a series of telephone calls since July 2009.' A spokesman for the Conservative Party said they did not comment on private matters.","William Ives, 68, has given the Conservatives £560,000 since David Cameron has been leader .

According to the latest Office for . National Statistic figures, the unemployment rate 2.63 million people . were unemployed people - down 45,000 on the quarter. That equates to 8.2 per cent of the economically active population - down 0.2 on the quarter. The latest economic forecasts proves yet more gloomy reading for those out of work.

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 06:44 EST, 16 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:45 EST, 16 July 2012 . North Korea's top military official - a key mentor to young new leader Kim Jong Un who served under his father - has been removed from all posts because of illness, state media said on Monday in a surprise announcement that shakes the core of the authoritarian country's power structure. Ri Yong Ho had looked healthy in recent appearances, and his departure fed speculation among analysts that Kim purged him in an effort to put his own mark on the nation he inherited seven months ago when his father Kim Jong Il died. At the same time, there was no sign of discord at Ri's last public appearance at a high-level event, barely a week ago. Prominent position: Top military official Ri Yong Ho, right, who has been removed from his posts, led the funeral procession for North Korea's Kim Jong Il along with the former leader's son Kim Jong Un, left . The decision to dismiss the 69-year-old from top military and political posts was made at a Workers' Party meeting on Sunday, according to the official Korean Central News Agency. It was not immediately clear who would take Ri's place, and the dispatch did not elaborate on his condition or future. Daniel Pinkston, a North Korea analyst at the International Crisis Group, was sceptical of the illness claim, in part because of Ri's recent apparent health. He also said Ri won his major promotions at a September 2010 party conference but received none in April, which stirred speculation about the general's future. 'There's a very high probability that it wasn't health issues, but that he was purged,' said Mr Pinkston, who said the move could be interpreted as a strong signal to anyone seeking to challenge Kim Jong Un - even if Ri never directly defied the new leader. The dismissal comes as Kim makes waves in other ways. State television showed him appearing at a music concert and visiting a kindergarten recently in the company of a mysterious woman who carried herself much like a first lady. Mentor: Ousted army chief Ri Yong Ho, left, pictured alongside Kim Jong Un, right, at a mourning service for North Korea's former leader Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang in 2011 . Her identity has not been revealed but her public presence was a notable change from Kim Jong Il's era, when his companions were kept out of state media. The state of North Korea's million-man army, one of the world's largest, is studied closely in South Korea, which stations many of its more than 600,000 troops along the world's most heavily armed border, and in Washington, U.S., which keeps more than 28,000 troops in South Korea as a deterrent. North Korea has repeatedly threatened in recent months to attack South Korea's president and Seoul's conservative media, angry over perceived insults to its leadership and U.S.-South Korean military drills that Pyongyang says are a prelude to an invasion. A North Korean artillery attack in 2010 killed four South Koreans and raised fears of war. Ri was vice marshal and chief of the . General Staff of the Korean People's Army. In 2010, he was promoted to . key political posts in the Workers' Party, including top spots on the . Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party and the Presidium of . the party's influential Political Bureau. That . boosted him to the highest political circles - along with Kim Jong Un, . Kim's uncle Jang Song Thaek and other trusted members of Kim Jong Il's . circle of advisers. North Korea's top military official Ri Yong Ho, left, was regarded as a mentor figure to Kim Jong Un, who took over as leader of North Korea following the death of his father in 2011 . Ri had been at Kim's side since the young man emerged publicly as Kim Jong Il's successor in 2010, often standing between father and son at major events. He was among the small group of men who accompanied Kim Jong Il's hearse through snowy Pyongyang during the funeral procession. In the months after Kim Jong Un took power, he accompanied the new ruler on his first trips to visit military units in a pointed show of continuity and military support as Kim sought to shore up the backing of the nation's troops. Ri's departure could be the result of him losing a power struggle with rising star Choe Ryong Hae, the military's top political officer tasked with supervising the army, said Koh Yu-hwan, a professor at Seoul's Dongguk University. Choe, originally a Workers' Party official, was handed several top jobs and was named a vice marshal in April. Ri had been anointed as Kim's patron during the young man's rise to power, Koh said . 'But after Kim formally took power, Choe has emerged as No. 2,' the professor added. The dismissal of the top army official is an especially significant move in North Korea. Kim Jong Il elevated the army's role when he became leader after the 1994 death of Kim Il Sung, his father and the nation's founder. Kim Jong Un has upheld his father's 'songun' military-first policy, but in April he also promoted younger officials with economic backgrounds to key party positions in line with his push to build up the nation's economy. North Korea's late former leader Kim Jong Il, pictured, counted Ri Yong Ho among his most trusted advisers . In Seoul, Hong Hyun-ik, an analyst at the private South Korean think tank Sejong Institute, said he expected more ageing officials to be dismissed in coming weeks, calling the move part of a 'generational change'. Political and military shuffles in North Korea are often mysterious, and officials sometimes drop out of sight without explanation. Many top North Korean officials, however, appear to stay in their posts until they fall ill or die. Vice marshal Jo Myong Rok, who held the No. 2 post at the powerful National Defense Commission, died of heart disease in 2010 at the age of 82. The robust Ri, who had served as chief of the General Staff since 2009, showed no sign of illness when he spoke in late April at a meeting of top officials marking the 80th anniversary of the army's founding. The North's state television and main Rodong Sinmun newspaper also reported Ri's dismissal. In a photo posted by state media on July 6, a healthy-seeming Ri was shown talking to people who had just moved into new housing in Pyongyang. He was also cited in state media as accompanying Kim to public events as recently as last week. 'Whether because of a physical malady or political sin, Ri Yong Ho is out, and Pyongyang is letting the world know to not expect to hear about him anymore,' said John Delury, an assistant professor at Yonsei University's Graduate School of International Studies in South Korea. It's too early, Delury said, to determine 'whether Ri's stepping down is a manifestation of civil-military tensions, or Kim Jong Un's attempt to consolidate control' over the army. Ri, though a powerful figure, arrived on the national scene fairly late, during Kim Jong Il's final years, Delury said. 'Perhaps he was always meant to be a transitional regent figure, and his function is played.' The Korean Peninsula has remained locked in a state of war and divided since a truce in 1953 ended three years of fighting. Animosity has deepened since a North Korean rocket launch in April that the U.N. called a cover for a test of banned long-range missile technology. North Korea said the launch, which failed shortly after lift off, was meant to put a satellite into orbit.","Ri Yong Ho was a member of North Korea's late former leader Kim Jong Il's trusted inner circle .

A man who was convicted for tweeting a joke about blowing up an airport received celebrity backing as he challenged his fine today. Paul Chambers was flanked by Stephen Fry and Al Murray as three judges, headed by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, started a review of his case at the High Court. The post in question read: 'C**p! Robin Hood Airport is . closed. You've got a week and a bit to get your s*** together, otherwise . I'm blowing the airport sky high!' The accountant said he sent the tweet to his 600 followers in a moment of frustration after the airport in South Yorkshire was closed by snow in January 2010. He claimed it was sent in jest and he never thought anyone would take his 'silly joke' seriously. Twitter martyr: Paul Chambers (centre) arrives at the High Court in London with celebrity supporters Stephen Fry and Al Murray . But he was fined £385 and ordered to . pay £600 costs at Doncaster Magistrates' Court in May 2010 after being . convicted of sending 'a message of a menacing character', contrary to . provisions of the 2003 Communications Act. In November 2010, Crown Court judge . Jacqueline Davies, sitting with two magistrates, dismissed his appeal, . saying that the electronic communication was 'clearly menacing' and that . airport staff were sufficiently concerned to report it. But opening a new bid to overturn his . conviction and sentence today, John Cooper QC told Lord Judge, Mr . Justice Owen and Mr Justice Griffith Williams that the wrong legal tests . had been applied. He said that the message was sent on a timeline on the Twitter facility to Mr Chambers' followers and not as a randomly searched-for communication, and the relevant section of the Act was never intended by Parliament to deal with messages to the 'world at large'. Paul Chambers speaking on Twitter today about his court case and the support he has received . Not all threats were menaces, counsel said. To constitute a menace, he added, the threat must be of such a nature that the mind of an 'ordinary person of normal stability and courage' might be influenced. Also, the person sending the message must intend to threaten the person to whom the message was sent - in other words, it was a crime of specific intent. Mr Chambers' right to freedom of speech under the European Convention was engaged, he told the court. TV star Al Murray, pictured here on his Compete For The Meat with Al Murray show, is a supporter of Mr Chambers . Turning from the law to technology, he said that the 2003 Act did not 'bite' as the social media platform involved was 'a content service' and therefore outside the definition of both public electronic communication service and public electronic network. Comedian Murray was one of Mr Chambers' supporters who was at the High Court today. He said he was there because he found the conviction 'monstrously unjust'. He said: 'He (Mr Chambers) made a passing remark to his followers, to his friends, to people who joined in with his way of looking at the world. 'It was found randomly by someone else and the law has, like one of those Python 10-tonne weights, dropped on top of him.' 'The funniest thing is hearing it [the tweet] read out in court by a QC in his wig. Even when it's said deadpan by a QC it's funny, it's obviously a joke,' he added. Mr Chambers, 28, listened as Mr Cooper said it was obvious the tweet was a joke - not intended to be taken seriously by anyone and sent by someone who did not hide his identity. It was certainly not sent in the context of terrorism and it was wrong for the Crown Court to make such an association. He said: 'If that be the case, and I don't mean to be flippant, John Betjeman would be concerned when he said ‘Come, friendly bombs, and fall on Slough', or Shakespeare when he said ‘Let's kill all the lawyers'.' Lord Judge commented: 'That was a good joke in 1600 and it is still a good joke now.' Mr Cooper: 'And it was a joke, my Lord.' Turning back to the case, he added: 'This was no ultimatum of a serious kind to the airport. The last thing this particular tweeter wanted was for the airport to be closed.' He told the judges that Twitter was invented in 2006 so was not known to Parliament at the time of the 2003 Act. Robert Smith QC, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said that, on any view, Mr Chambers, a man of previous good character, was 'very foolish' to do what he did. The question was, by whose standards and by what members of society would such a message be viewed as a joke, given that those who had access to it would probably not have any knowledge of the circumstances which led to it being sent. He said the Crown Court was right to refer to terrorism, not because it perceived the message as indicating a possible threat, but because it was concerned that after the tweet was sent, Mr Chambers sent messages to his girlfriend referring to terrorism. 'These were not posted on the timeline and the court relied on them to demonstrate the accuracy of their finding that Mr Chambers was aware, and must have been aware, of the possible impact of his message on any member of the public of reasonable fortitude who might have seen it.' Judgement was reserved until a later date.","Paul Chambers sent the tweet to his 600 followers in a moment of frustration .

A six-year-old boy has been left terrified of putting on weight because his school nurse told him he was too fat. Tayler Gunn refuses to eat cheese, ham and spaghetti after being sent a letter from his school, Millhouse Infants in Laindon, Essex saying he was close to being clinically obese. When he was sent the letter, Tayler weighed three stone 5lbs and was 3ft 6ins tall. Since then he has grown two inches but has actually lost one pound in weight. His mother Leanne Kane, 25, of . Devonshire Gardens, Laindon, Essex, says: 'It is something he worries . about. It's ridiculous, I just keep telling him he's strong, he's not . fat, he's strong. 'It definitely affected him, and he is . really worried about his weight. 'I was so angry because I was given a . letter basically saying that I'm not looking after him properly, but I . do. He thinks he is too fat and he's six. It's just awful.' To try to help youngsters worried about their weight, MPs have made recommendations that all school children receive compulsory body image and self-esteem classes. It follows a report by the All Party Parliamentary Group on body image, which said more than half of the public has a negative body image and girls as young as five now worry about how they look. The parliamentary group report also said cosmetic surgery rates have increased by nearly 20 per cent since 2008 and blames media images of super skinny celebrities. As part of the same recommendation there was a call for a review into the Equality Act, suggesting it be amended to include appearance-related discrimination. Another recommendation was a review into whether the Equality Act 2010 should be amended to include appearance-related discrimination, which would be classed the same as race and sexual discrimination. Leanne, welcomed anything that could be done to help children, but says government involvement was one of the reasons Tayler was so self conscious about his weight. Lisa-Marie Jobson, principal of the San-Marie Stage School, both in Billericay, Essex believes classes to help children with self-esteem and body image issues would be a positive step. She said: 'I see things from two sides - I think in some ways it is important that children are aware of their bodies for health and medical reasons. Children should be aware of the importance of exercise and not getting over-weight. 'But I also think the Government could do more in teaching children that everyone is different. We all have different body shapes and we are all good at many different things. These realities should be appreciated. 'I would say that the ad agencies for TV . commercials have made big changes since I first came into the industry.

Anger: Tayler's mother Leanne Gunn with the letter sent by the school nurse. When it arrived, Tayler weighed three stone 5lbs and was 3ft 6ins tall. Since then he has grown two inches but has actually lost one pound in weight . 'As for the mags and brochures, they are specifically looking for perfect children. I don't think this is such a good thing as it puts a hell of a strain on young children. 'I find a lot of children are very self aware of their bodies and the children who come to us for dance classes are particularly aware. Many come for fun and exercise which is great - they are aware of body health. ' Clinical psychologist Zach de Beer said: 'Body image is a major issue and can lead onto other problems; commercial and cultural pressures are real.

The masses of long lenses and a hoard of photographers could suggest a famous face had just arrived in Hartlepool. But these snappers were on the look-out for a much rarer specimen which had just flown into town - the Orphean Warbler. Yesterday’s sighting of the rare grey and white bird on the bowling green in Hartlepool's Headland was the first in Britain for over 20 years. All a flutter: Birdwatchers set up long lens cameras to capture images of the Orphean Warbler which had landed in Hartlepool . Rare sight: The bird, which is grey with a black head and white throat, winters in Africa and migrates to Turkey and around the Mediterranean. It has only been spotted six times in Britain . It is rarely seen in Northern Europe and has only been spotted six times in Britain. Ornithologist Chris Brown, of Hartlepool, said the bird had overshot and ended up in the town. He said: 'It’s more common to see them in France or Spain, but it’s very rare to see them in Britain. 'The warbler was seen on the bowling green in Hartlepool and an alert went out instantaneously and people came from all over England and Scotland to see it, there were thousands of people. 'They were all around the bowling green trying to catch a glimpse of it in the bushes. 'It was quite hard to spot but eventually the bird found it’s way into the mist net that was set up and it was ringed, and I got some photos of it then in hand.' Who's a pretty bird: Ornithologist Chris Brown said 'It was quite hard to spot but eventually the bird found it's way into the mist net that was set up and it was ringed, and I got some photos of it then in hand' He said that there are still some bird-watchers looking out for the bird and were heading out further to track it down. The bird winters in Africa and migrates to Turkey and around the Mediterranean. The first sighting was recorded in Portland in 1955 and the most recent was in Cornwall in 1991. In June last year another rare visitor appeared on the Headland at Hartlepool, a white-throated robin, which had not been seen in Britain for 11 years. In November last year, birdwatchers got more than they bargained for when they stumbled across a glamour shoot taking place at South Gare, Redcar.

A father of four hit the road in Britain's first sports car after spending 12 years and £50,000 on lovingly restoring it to its former glory. Alisdaire Lockhart, 67, painstakingly tracked down some of the last surviving original parts to rebuild the 100-year-old Vauxhall Prince Henry. Mr Lockhart, from Selkirk in Scotland, then took an epic 620-mile trip through Sweden in the historic vehicle, following  the route of Vauxhall founder Percy Kidner’s Great Swedish Winter Reliability Trial of 1912. Mean green machine: Alisdaire Lockhart invested £50,000 in lovingly restoring the 100-year-old Vauxhall Prince Henry to its former glory . One of a kind: The 67-year-old car enthusiast has just completed a four-day drive across Sweden in the vintage vehicle . The retired university administrator spent four days driving from Gothenburg to Stockholm and back home in the gleaming vintage car. He said: ‘It was fantastic driving the car in . Sweden, especially because I have spent so long renovating every single . detail of it using original parts which are extremely rare. ‘It drives superbly so I am very pleased. It was a once in a lifetime journey.’ Mr Lockhart bought the car as a rusting shell in 1998 and began restoring in in his garage, hunting down spare parts made in 1911 and 1912 to make his prized possession look like new. ‘In total we covered 620 miles in 22 . hours of driving time spread over four days,’ said Mr Lockhart. History buff: Mr Lockhart followed the route travelled by Vauxhall founder Percy Kidner during the Great Swedish Winter Reliability Trial of 1912. Pictured, Mr Kidner at the Standard Hotel in Norrkoping . ‘With . the open roads and low  volume of traffic in Sweden, it was easy to . cruise at 60mph without any mechanical trouble. ‘I love putting things to together and making them work. I have restored a few old Vauxhalls but this one was special because there are only five left in the world including mine – though mine is the only one with original parts.’ With a 21 horsepower, three-litre engine, the Vauxhall Prince Henry is thought to have been the first British-made car capable of reaching 100mph. Mr Lockhart meticulously fixed every detail of the car to make it the only roadworthy model left in Britain. He began work at his then home in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, before transporting his labour of love on the back of a trailer to his new home in Selkirk with his Scottish wife Patricia, 60, five years ago.

He finally finished the car earlier this year before taking it on its maiden marathon on May 21. He completed the route and posed with the car in the exact same spot as Percy Kidner outside the former Standard Hotel in Norrkvping, Sweden. He said: 'We drove along the southern route of the original event, through Jonkoping and Linkoping, arriving in Stockholm on the Tuesday or a reception where the car was photographed with the original trophies for the event.

Anti-capitalism protesters from the Occupy movement have begun a new protest in the City of London. It is part of a global day of action seeing thousands of people rallying in cities including Moscow, New York, Athens and Madrid, organisers said. Several hundred people have gathered outside St Paul's Cathedral for a rally before 'visiting the 1%' at the offices of some of the largest firms in the financial heart of the capital. There were some minor skirmishes between protesters and police as they marched through the City.Officers had briefly encircled the protest after it moved down Fleet Street and into Fetter Lane, causing some protesters to break through the police line. Hundreds of people have gathered outside St Paul's Cathedral just weeks after others were evicted from the site . Skirmish: Protesters try to break past City of London police officers near the Bank of England during the protest today . It comes more than six months after members of campaign group Occupy London were prevented from occupying the square in heart of the City of London. Instead, activists set up camp outside St Paul's Cathedral just yards away from the Stock Exchange and remained there for four and a half months. At the start of May police arrested five people after between 50 and 100 anti-capitalist protesters set up a temporary camp outside the London Stock Exchange following May Day demonstrations. They moved into Paternoster Square with tents and supplies on May 1, but were forced to leave by officers several hours later. Occupy protesters were joined by members of Spanish protest group Indignados and Take the Square.

'That is enough for themselves alone to pay off the entire budget deficit and still leave them with £30bn to spare. '""We're all in this together"" never rang so hollow. Whilst the rest of the country is being crippled by austerity, the very same people who caused the crisis are now sitting on wealth even greater than what they had before the crash?' City of London Police said it had a 'proportionate' operation in place around the peaceful demonstration. St Paul's Cathedral remains open to tourists. Protesters from the Occupy London movement have returned to St Paul's Cathedral to mark the first anniversary of the Global Occupy movement . Demonstration: Anti-capitalist Occupy protesters gather at the entrance to the Royal Exchange next to the Bank of England as they call for an end to predatory capitalism . Occupy protesters have started protests in cities across the world . In February anti-capitalist demonstrators outside St Paul's Cathedral were finally evicted after a court ruled that the human rights of the public outweighed those of the protesters. The 'Occupy' campers were refused permission by the Court of Appeal to challenge orders forcing them to go. Three judges, headed by Master of the Rolls Lord Neuberger, rejected arguments the protesters should stay because human rights law protects their right of free expression and to free assembly. The Occupy camp was set up in October and rapidly transformed itself into a tent city causing chaos on the steps of the cathedral. Protesters prevent the public using the streets, harm local businesses, have strained the drainage system, abused cathedral staff and created noise and graffiti, the court heard. As a result, Lord Neuberger, the senior civil law judge, said the human rights of the public and landowners superseded those of the protesters. He said the decision to end their campaign against corporate greed was 'entirely lawful and justified'.

The amazing recovery of flesh-eating victim Aimee Copeland shows no signs of slowing down after her father revealed she can now feed herself and brush her teeth after just four days of rehab. Andy Copeland announced the news on his Facebook page on Saturday along with his recent blog posting entitled 59 Days. 'Just a quick note: Aimee fed herself today for the first time. She can also now brush her own teeth,' he wrote. 'How's that for only 4 full days of rehab? Yeah, I'm beaming from ear-to-ear right now.' Happy: After nearly two months of battling the rare infection, called necrotizing fasciitis, Copeland was all smiles as she finally left the hospital after having four limbs amputated . Interview: Andy and Donna Copeland spoke to the Today show about their daughter's progress and her hope to walk again by her graduation . In his blog posting about the 24-year-old's progress, he revealed how much the family will need for Aimee's prosthetic limbs and their battle with the insurance company to extend the coverage of their current medical plan. 'We have come to realize that $150,000 for prosthetics may have been a conservative estimate. Aimee will require a set of body-powered limbs and a set of myo-electric limbs. 'She will also require ongoing fittings for the ever-changing condition of her amputated limbs, which is required for continued comfort. 'I have pleaded with our insurance company to extend the coverage of prosthetics beyond the stingy annual sum of $50,000 that is allowed under our medical plan. 'Surely they realize that there are not a plethora of quad-amputees in existence and that Aimee's extraordinary condition requires extraordinary care and coverage.' The city of Snellville, where the family is from, presented the Copelands with a cheque for $16,500 last week after a 5K fundraiser was held in her honor. Aimee was released from an Augusta hospital last week after six weeks of recovery, at the beginning of which the doctors warned her family that she would likely die.

Brave: Aimee Copeland waves with one of her amputated limbs as she leaves a hospital in Augusta headed for an inpatient rehabilitation clinic almost two months after contracting a flesh-eating bacteria . The student fell from a zip line on May 1 and the flesh-eating bacteria necrotizing fasciitis entered her blood stream through an open wound, which was not detected until she was rushed to hospital days later. She has since had her left leg, right foot and hands amputated and will have to spend the next two months in a rehabilitation center to adjust. The family are making preparations for her return from rehab by adding an 'Amy wing' to their home. The 1,800 sq ft two-storey addition . will have a bedroom, fitness room, sunroom and study, where she can work . on her master's degree. An elevator will allow her to go wherever she wants - and it's all being built by volunteers touched by her sad story. Her . father Andy said: 'Right now our house is not Aimee-friendly because . it's very small and compact. We're going to add an Aimee wing.' 'While she's getting better, we need to have this house prepared so she has a good viable home to come to.' He also revealed last week it is her dream to be able to walk in time for her graduation in December. Proud dad: Andy Copeland takes a photo of his daughter, Aimee, as she leaves hospital two months after doctors said she would probably not make it . Recovery: Aimee's mother said her daughter was motivated to go and get her rehab started as soon as possible and they hopes the clinic could also do something about the pain she is in . Her said: 'It's amazing the things we take for granted, like the ability to get up and go fix a cup of coffee and sit back down again. 'She has to relearn that ability, to get up and get whatever she needs to satisfy her. She needs to be able to have some mobility in her life again but as we speak that process has already started, she is already 30 minutes into her first rehab session.' Aimee was pictured leaving the hospital earlier this week smiling and showing off her amputated limbs as she clutched onto a doll. She seemed happy and comfortable to pose with hospital workers as she left hospital and when she was in the ambulance. Her mother Donna told Today: 'She was very excited when we got in the ambulance but it didn't take long before it was lights out. She fell asleep the whole way but when we got there she couldn't wait to get started, she is so motivated.'

Her father says they at first gave her just a . slim chance of surviving. She spent weeks sedated and using a . respirator while undergoing amputations and skin grafts to replace . infected skin . Her father Andy spoke to msnbc about how momentous an occasion it was for Aimee to leave hospital.

New life: Aimee (right, with her sister) will return home in six to eight weeks . Proud: Her father, Andy Copeland, holds up the photo during an interview with Good Morning America . 'I would consider it a rite of passage for her as it is the opportunity that she has to actually venture out and relearn her life skills and be able to resume as normal a life as she can have. 'I believe her life can be extremely normal, whatever that word actually means. I think physically she's actually progressed rapidly, certainly far ahead of the doctor's schedule, what they thought she would do. 'I would say spiritually, mentally, psychologically she is so strong right now and for her, to actually be able to grasp the concept that she's lost her hands and feels blessed over that is an amazing thing.' Speaking to GMA, her father spoke of her determination to walk at her Master's graduation ceremony this December. 'You heard the word right,' he said. 'Walk. That's what she intends to do.'

Vicious Sinead Walker, 40, grabbed hold of Vincent Rennoldson’s manhood and tried to 'pull it off' when he angrily ordered her out of his flat. The drunken mum-of-one who had downed an entire bottle of wine before going round to apologise for a previous bust-up - then sunk her teeth into his private parts. Scroll down for video . When Vincent Rennoldson's ex-partner attacked him, he called the police - who heard his screams as his jilted lover tried to bite his penis off . Mr Rennoldson was assaulted by his ex-girlfriend, Sinead Walker, 40 (right). The mother . of one had drunk an entire bottle of wine before visiting him at his . flat to apologise for a previous row but she then turned violent . Mr Rennoldson's chilling screams were overheard by an emergency operator after he dialled 999 during the attack. Recalling the attack, he said:' She was on her knees, got it in her hands and just started biting. I just screamed - the pain was excruciating.'There was a lot of blood and it was painful for weeks afterwards. I now have a three-inch scar on the bottom of my willy. 'It has affected me - I was watching Jaws the other night but had to turn over. If you hit or kick someone that’s one thing - but biting them down there is another thing. 'It could have been worse - she could have bitten it off. At least it still works.' Rennoldson's former partner has been handed a restraining order . Walker was given a community sentence and handed a restraining order today at Bath Magistrates Court. Chairman of the bench, Peter Taylor, said: 'Miss Walker this offence is serious enough for a community order. 'This community order will be 12 months and within the order there are two requirements. 'The first will be a 12 month supervision order and the second will be a . curfew for 12 weeks from 7pm until 7am seven days a week. 'We believe compensation should be put to victim referring to bruises and the bitten penis and the on going effects he has. 'You will pay £250 to Mr Rennoldson. You will also pay £100 in court costs. 'The last thing we are going to impose is a two-year restraining order for the purposes of protecting Mr Rennoldson. 'It means you cannot contact him in any way.” Bath . Magistrates' Court was told that trouble between the pair, who had been . dating for ten months, first flared on December 14 last year. Jill . MacNamara, prosecuting, said Walker had downed several pints of cider . before flying into a rage and snarling: 'What’s your f***ing problem?'. Walker then punched and kicked her partner after he refused to let her leave his flat until police arrived. Mr Rennoldson could be heard saying 'she’s giving me a kicking' on a frantic 999 call played to the court. Two . weeks later, on December 28, Walker - on bail accused of the first . assault - returned to his flat with friends to apologise over drinks. But the jobless mother, who was drunk, again began directing abuse at her former partner, at around 5pm. She then lashed out with her fists when he asked her and a friend to get out. Mr . Rennoldson, choking back the tears, described how she then pulled down . his boxer shorts and bit his penis while he was on the phone to the . police. He told the court: 'She pushed me against the wall in the hallway and pulled my boxer shorts down. 'She grabbed my penis and tried to pull it off. She was on the floor - then she bit it. 'I have now got a scar on it - I will show anybody. She tried to bite my penis off.' Walker left the flat shortly afterwards, but was later arrested. Pictures of bruises and scratches to his upper arms, neck and elbow from the attack - as well as the genital injury - were shown to magistrates. The former shop fitter’s screams - as Walker bit down on him - were also played to the court from his 999 call. Ms MacNamara said: 'You can hear him . under attack. That is the best version of events he can give to what . happened - what he was saying at the time.' Walker, from Bath, denied two counts of common assault over the December 14 and December 28 attacks. She claimed she caused some of the injuries to Mr Rennoldson in self-defence, while trying to fight her way out of the flat. But she insisted she had not bitten his penis. Erinna Foley-Fisher, defending, said: 'The defendant has done her best to account for his injuries - saying they could have happened during sexual intercourse.' Gail Bragg, chair of the bench, said: 'We find Mr Rennoldson’s injuries are consistent with the 999 calls and the photographs.

Google chiefs Larry Page and Eric Schmidt and filmmaker James Cameron are bankrolling a venture to extract precious metals such as platinum from asteroids that orbit near Earth. Planetary Resources, based in Bellevue, Washington, initially will focus on developing and selling extremely low-cost robotic spacecraft for surveying missions, the company announced today. A demonstration mission in orbit around Earth is expected to be launched within two years, said company co-founders Peter Diamandis and Eric Anderson. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Cosmic quarry: A team of scientists have unveiled plans to mine asteroids for their raw materials . Mars Rover Curiosity - currently on its way to the Red Planet: The new company aims to reduce the cost of hardware for space exploration by a factor of 100 . Within five to 10 years, however, the company expects to progress from selling observation platforms in orbit around Earth to prospecting services. It plans to tap some of the thousands of asteroids that pass relatively close to Earth and extract their raw materials. A 98-foot asteroid can hold as much as  $50 billion worth of platinum (£31 billion) at today's prices, said a company spokesperson. Not all missions would return precious metals and minerals to Earth. In addition to mining for platinum and other precious metals, the company plans to tap asteroids' water to supply orbiting fuel depots, which could be used by NASA and others for robotic and human space missions. 'We have a long view. We're not expecting this company to be an overnight financial home run. This is going to take time,' Anderson said in an interview with Reuters. The real payoff, which is decades away, will come from mining asteroids for platinum group metals and rare minerals. Nasa has already successsfully landed a probe on an asteroid, Eros, 196 million miles from Earth . 'If you look back historically at what has caused humanity to make its largest investments in exploration and in transportation, it has been going after resources, whether it's the Europeans going after the spice routes or the American settlers looking toward the west for gold, oil, timber or land,;     Diamandis said. 'Those precious resources caused people to make huge investments in ships and railroads and pipelines. Looking to space, everything we hold of value on Earth - metals, minerals, energy, real estate, water - is in near-infinite quantities in space. 'The opportunity exists to create a company whose mission is to be able to go and basically identify and access some of     those resources and ultimately figure out how to make them available where they are needed,' he said. Diamandis and Anderson declined to discuss how much money has been raised for their venture so far. In addition to Google billionaires Page and Schmidt and filmmaker Cameron, Planetary Resources investors include former Microsoft chief software architect Charles Simonyi, a two-time visitor to the International Space Station, Google founding director K. Ram Shriram and Ross Perot Jr. Planetary Resources also declined to discuss specifics about how and when asteroid mining would begin. NASA's infrared sky-scans track space objects such as asteroids. A recent scan with the NeoWISE instruments found that there were 19,000 'mid-sized' asteroids within 120 million miles of Earth . Backing: Film maker and explorer James Cameron (left) is supporting the project, as is billionaire Charles Simonyi (right) Untapped resource: NASA scientists say the high concentration of raw materials found in asteroids could supply Earth with vital stockpiles of natural resources . Space man: Entrepreneur Peter Diamandis . The shortage of sources for raw . materials on the planet has caused global inflation to spike in recent . years causing tensions to rise between nations, experts have said. The company's first step is to develop . technologies to cut the cost of deep-space robotic probes to one-tenth . to one-hundredth the cost of current space missions, which run hundreds . of millions of dollars, Diamandis said. Among the targeted technologies is optical laser communications, which . would eliminate the need for large radio antennas aboard spacecraft. Space . entrepreneurs Peter Diamandis and Eric Anderson are just two of the . names behind Planetary Resource. In a press release, the company . announced its intentions to create 'a new industry in space and a new . definition . of natural resources'. Diamandis . and Anderson - both known for their aspirations for commercial space . exploration - will host the launch event along with two former NASA . officials. A driving force behind the Ansari . X-Prize competition to spur on non-goverment space flight, Diamandis has . made no secret of his goal to one day become an asteroid miner. In an interview earlier this year with Forbes magazine, he said: 'The earth is a crumb in a supermarket of resources. 'Now we finally have the technology to . extract resources outside earth for the benefit of humanity without . having to rape and pillage our planet.'

Just . last month the director of Titanic and Avatar became the first solo . diver to  reach the bottom of the Challenger Deep - the deepest point on . Earth. Radical concept, but old idea: Experts believe it is only now that we have the ability to discover and characterise a sufficient number of small near-Earth asteroids . Straight out of a sci-fi film: A scene from the movie Armageddon, where Bruce Willis's character is sent into space to mine an asteroid before it hits the Earth . It might seem like a radical concept, but scientists have been toying with the idea of mining asteroids for their natural resources for longer than the space program has been running. Experts . believe it is only now that we have the technology and ability to . discover and characterise a sufficient number of small near-Earth . asteroids (NEA). The . mining could yield a large amount of water - frozen inside the asteroids . - oxygen and metals which could not only be brought back to Earth but . could help further space exploration by allowing humans to fuel . spacecraft and build space stations. Nasa believes capturing placing an NEA . in lunar orbit could provide a unique, meaningful and easy-to-reach . destination for exploration by astronaut crews in the next decade. It is only now that the . sufficiently-powerful electric propulsion systems necessary to transport . a captured NEA are becoming available. Mining asteroids could take several forms. This includes sending humans in a . spacecraft to an asteroid to explore and mine it. Another possible scenario could involve launching a robotic spacecraft to either to mine an . asteroid directly or transport it closer to Earth so it could be reached by humans more easily. Extracting raw materials, such as iron and nickel, from the space rocks is a possibility that has been discussed for decades. However, the obstacles for such a mission has always been the cost, sufficient scientific expertise and technical prowess.

If a picture is worth a thousand words, then how much is a camera worth that produces descriptions along with images? Rather than looking at an image and deciding what you see, a new prototype camera will actually describe to you the scene in several words, printing it out on a small piece of paper. The Descriptive Camera, created by Matt Richardson, has all of the features of a normal camera and will capture any image in front of it - with the textual description as an added bonus. What you get is what you see: The descriptions are outsourced by Amazon . Mechanical Turk, and take around six minutes to come back with a . description . Snapshot: The Descriptive Camera, a prototype, produces short descriptions of every image captured . The camera will then produce a textual account of the scene, often in a dozen words or less, via low-cost outsourcing. Mr Richardson, a self-proclaimed techie, describes on his blog how the fascinating technology works. Like any other camera, the Descriptive Camera captures metadata after the shutter is pressed, including when the photo was taken, the time, and the camera’s settings. Mr Richardson’s design goes one step further. By using Amazon Mechanical Turk, an outsourcing system where users can pay others to process data types for a nominal fee, the camera uses old-fashioned man power to describe the scene. The descriptions allow better cataloguing of digital images, and can range from highly descriptive, to fairly minimal. One Instigram picture of a city building reads: ‘This is a faded picture of a dilapidated building. It seems to be run down and in need of repairs.’ In so many words: The Instigram picture of a city building reads: 'This is a faded picture of a dilapidated building. It seems to be run down and in need of repairs' How it works: The camera has a USB webcam and a thermal printer inside, and is hooked via Ethernet and a five-volt plug . The concept stemmed from the overwhelming amount of digital images without automatic forms of captioning. Mr Richardson writes: ‘Imagine if descriptive metadata about each photo could be appended to the image on the fly.’ He noted that as it stands, it is difficult to individually caption or search hundreds upon hundreds of family photos and that the Descriptive Camera, though a prototype, shows promise that this technology may one day become reality. The camera uses a USB webcam and also has a thermal printer embedded in it, sending its data to Amazon Mechanical Turk via Ethernet. The standing cost of any one given description is $1.25, with an average response time of six minutes – but Mr Richardson notes that the fastest responses come in as little as three minutes. However, the prototype is not portable, and runs off of an external five-volt source. Mr Richardson's past inventions include a hacked TV remote that can be programed to mute the television whenever a selected word is spoken, as well as creating a Google Reader pedal.","Camera uses Amazon system to 'describe' what it 'sees'

Devastated: Walter Morris (pictured) was holding a tin containing £26,000 of his life savings in banknotes when it was swiped by thieves . It was the day that Blackpool’s Golden Mile fully lived up to its name. A stolen tin of Quality Street containing a pensioner’s £26,000 life savings fell open and piles of banknotes fluttered off in the wind. Cue pandemonium on the prom, as tourists ran along gathering up the unexpected windfall. The 76-year-old victim, Walter Morris, had taken the tin to the resort to fulfil his dream of buying a seaside caravan for his mentally handicapped son, also called Walter. The two men were sitting at a table in the Coral Island amusement arcade watching people playing slot machines when the thieves struck. The tin was in a carrier bag under the table. The thieves, Liam Davis, 23, and 17-year-old Aaron Scott were both drunk and when they grabbed the bag they thought they were stealing chocolates. Initially they tried to sell the tin for £5 to passers-by, but they couldn’t find any takers so made off along the promenade, a court heard yesterday. Davis then ran into a brick wall and the tin fell open, with notes spilling on to the pavement. At that moment a gust of wind blew and lifted thousands of pounds into the air and along the seafront. Holidaymakers began chasing after the notes while the thieves laughed hysterically as they shoved bundles of cash into their jackets, Lancaster Crown Court was told. Yesterday Davis, of Marton, Blackpool, was jailed for four months. The case against Scott, who is also from Blackpool, was adjourned until June 11 for a pre-sentence report. Both pleaded guilty to theft. Pandemonium on the prom: Mr Morris had taken his cash to the Golden Mile in Blackpool (pictured) when the thieves struck, only for the tin to fall open and the money scatter everywhere . The court heard that Davis took £11,750, but £8,010 was left behind at the spot where the notes had fallen out of the tin. It was recovered by passers-by Louise Lane and Emily Herringe, and off-duty police officer Meghann Ferryhough, who handed it to the police. Davis buried the cash he had taken in a nearby park, but when he was arrested later he handed it back apart from £15 which he had spent on cigarettes and drink. Sweet and sour: The 76-year-old victim had kept the cash in a tin of Quality Street . No money has been recovered from Scott. Mr Morris has been given back just under £20,000 of the cash, but another £6,240 remains unaccounted for. Kirsten McAteer, prosecuting, said Mr Morris had been unaware of the events that unfolded after his bag and tin were taken in April last year. He searched the area outside the arcade before returning home to Blackburn and alerting the police. After the case, Mr Morris said that he had been saving the money for most of his life to buy a seafront static caravan for his disabled son, but now he would be unable to do so. The former millworker, who is a full-time carer for 46-year-old Walter, said: ‘Even though I got some of the money back I don’t think I’ll ever get over it really and for weeks afterwards I couldn’t sleep because I just kept thinking about all the money that I had lost. ‘It was just a mistake on my part that I took the money with me but now I’ll never be able to buy Walter his caravan. I just feel very sad about the whole matter.’","Walter Morris, 76, had banknotes in Quality Street tin .

The next PlayStation will be released at the end of 2013 - and will be capable of super-HD resolutions far beyond most televisions today. The machine is known within Sony as 'Orbis'. Gaming blog Kotaku's unnamed source also reported, more controversially, that the new 'Orbis' console would refuse to play second-hand games. PlayStation 3: The timing is right for Sony to unveil a successor to the six-year-old console . The leak, from an unnamed source . speaking to the gaming blog Kotaku, is at least partially credible - . with Nintendo set to unveil its next-generation Wii U console this year, . the timing is right. The new machine will be capable of playing games at extremely high resolutions up to 4096x2160, Kotaku reports - far above the capabilities of most televisions today. That announcement also makes sense, as Toshiba has recently unveiled a television capable of the same 'Ultra HD' resolution, and other manufacturers are set to follow suit. It's not clear whether the name Orbis is a nickname, a codename, or the final name of the console. Microsoft was expected to show of a . next-generation console at this year's E3 gaming conference in Los . Angeles, until the company annnounced it would not be unveiling . next-generation hardware. Nintendo will show off its 'next-generation' Wii U at the same conference. The new Wii U console is said to be twice as . powerful as Xbox 360, and Nintendo has already shown off ia . tablet-style controller with a built-in screen. Nintendo's Wii U console builds on the motion-controls of its predecessor, but adds a secondary controller with a screen . Nintendo's big franchises such as The Legend of Zelda remain exclusive to its consoles . The report about the console refusing to play second-hand games is already controversial. Several game companies, including the 'Call of Duty' giant Activision, have spoken out against the trade in second-hand console games - hoping instead for a PC-style system where gamers buy a 'code' which allows them to install and use the software once. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter says that the rumour of a 'block' on second-hand games is highly unlikely - and that the move would lead to a backlash not just from gamers, but from retailers. 'The anti-piracy rumors started in 2005, when Ken Kutaragi patented a technology for it prior to the PS3 launch,' said Pachter in an interview with NowGamer. 'Today’s rumor is just a re-hash of that old rumor and the recent one about the Xbox 720. It isn’t really in Sony’s or Microsoft’s best interests to block used games.' 'If Sony unilaterally did this, I could see GameStop refusing to carry their console, and sales of the PS4 would thereby suffer. On balance, it’s a dumb idea, making it a dumb rumor. Of course, you never know.' Pachter said that he considered Kotaku's source to be 'a monkey'.","Capable of 'super-HD' resolution beyond most TVs .

The boss of Britain’s biggest insurance company will continue to receive his salary of £80,000 a month for the next year despite his humiliating resignation yesterday. Andrew Moss, who has quit as chief executive of Aviva after a shareholder revolt, will receive a golden goodbye worth around £1.75million in total. Last Thursday, 59 per cent of shareholder votes failed to back his gold-plated pay package worth up to £5.2million last year. It was the latest chapter in the growing backlash against boardroom greed, nicknamed the Shareholder Spring. Yesterday the 54-year-old chief executive said he ‘felt it was in the best interests of the company that he step aside to make way for new leadership’. But Mr Moss, who has also sparked public criticism for leaving his wife of 25 years and their four children for a junior married colleague, Deidre Galvin, in 2009, will not be leaving empty-handed. Walked: Aviva Group chief executive Andrew Moss, who is to step down with immediate effect . He will be paid his £960,000 ‘basic’ annual salary for the next year, equal to £80,000 a month, unless he finds another job. Mr Moss will also get a £300,000 bonus payment, a cash injection of £209,000 into his pension pot in five years’ time, deferred shares from a 2009 bonus, currently worth around £236,000, and a maximum of £45,000 in legal and other expenses. He has two pensions from Aviva: one worth around £530,000 and one worth around £2.75million, including the £209,000 payment. Mr Moss’s departure was announced on the eve of today’s Queen’s Speech, which is expected to fire the starting gun on a crackdown on boardroom excess and empower shareholders to veto any examples of corporate excess. Bounce: Shares in the UK's largest insurer jumped five per cent following the announcement, suggesting investors approve of Mr Moss's departure . Investor backing: The announcement was immediately followed by a spike in Aviva's shares . At present, shareholders can vote . against pay deals, but their votes are not binding on the company and . directors can still receive the controversial pay and bonuses. The main . role of such votes is to embarrass bosses and damage the firm’s . reputation. The mood of investors has turned ugly recently, triggering . the departure of bosses at drugs company AstraZeneca and newspaper group . Trinity Mirror. Turmoil: Aviva's St Helen's skyscraper looms in the City, where three CEOs have quit amid recent shareholder anger . Yesterday, . the chief executive of William Hill, Ralph Topping, was the latest . victim, with nearly 50 per cent of the betting firm’s shareholders . voting against a £1.2million bonus and a 8.3 per cent pay rise. At its . annual meeting, one angry shareholder said: ‘Chief executives are dining . in the last chance saloon trying to take as much as they can as soon as . possible.’ Business . Secretary Vince Cable, who has heavily criticised boardroom excess, said . bosses are finally being ‘brought back to reality’. He welcomed the . ‘uprising’ by shareholders as ‘a healthy development’, and said he is . determined to stamp out ‘rewards for failure’. Since . Mr Moss became chief executive in July 2007, Aviva’s share price has . more than halved, decimating the nest eggs of thousands of its smaller . shareholders. Liberal Democrat . Lord Oakeshott said: ‘Shareholder votes must be binding, otherwise it . just like a jury who acquit a man of a murder charge but the judge still . gives him 20 years. What’s the point?’ Deborah . Hargreaves, of the High Pay Centre campaign group, said: ‘The irony is . that Aviva was behind some of the recent pay revolts but, at the same . time, they were not looking after their own backyard. ‘This . is what makes Mr Moss’s payoff so intolerable. Aviva’s corporate . governance arm was lecturing others about pay and yet the company was . ignoring its own advice.’ Mr . Moss ceased to be chief executive ‘with immediate effect’ yesterday, but . he will not officially leave until the end of the month. Meanwhile, the average pay of bosses at Britain’s biggest public companies rose by 11 per cent last year to £3.65million, according to research published yesterday. The study, compiled for the BBC by Manifest, the adviser to shareholders, looked at the annual reports of 60 of the companies in the FTSE 100 index. On average, a chief executive gets a basic annual salary of £840,000, a long-term incentive plan of £1.14million, a cash bonus of £689,000 plus several other lucrative perks, according to the research. But the average worker in the private sector is losing ground, according to a report from the pay experts Incomes Data Services. The average pay rise handed out by bosses to their cash-strapped workers between January and March was 3 per cent, it says. It comes at a time when inflation is 3.5 per cent. The report found that 8 per cent of workers, who typically are employed in manufacturing, construction or the not-for-profit sector, had their pay frozen.","Andrew Moss is third victim of recent discontent after departures at Trinity Mirror and AstraZeneca .

Comolli was told by owner John W Henry that he was no longer wanted alongside manager Dalglish. On his way: Liverpool boss Kenny Dalglish said he was sad to see director of football Comolli leave . But chairman Tom Werner insists they are happy with Dalglish despite the club's difficult season. The position of the Reds boss has . come under scrutiny in recent weeks after a woeful run in the league in . which they lost five of six matches, ending their hopes of qualifying . for the Champions League. Werner said: 'We've got great confidence in Kenny. We feel the team is going to make strides in the future and he enjoys our full support.' Dalglish will also be handed money to spend this summer as they attempt to catch the likes of the Manchester giants United and City. Werner said: 'We've had a strategy that we have agreed on. There was some disconnect on the implementation of that. That strategy is a strong one and it will continue. 'We need to build a strong system under the first team. We're hard at work identifying transfer targets and we will be better next year.' Werner also admitted they have decided to ring the changes as they attempt to improve for next season. He said: 'I think it's fair to say no supporter would be delighted with the results we've achieved this year. We feel we are a club that needs to be perceived as the strongest club in football and we want to get there. 'Frankly, we make these decisions with a great deal of care because it's our track record in Boston to give people authority and we've had great success with our manager, who was there for eight years, and our general manager, so we prefer stability. Moving on: Liverpool owner John Henry (L) and chairman Tom Werner (C) thanked Comolli after the Frenchman dramatically departed Anfield . 'But when it's time to act, we need to act. We're coming close to the end of the season and the transfer window for the summer, and we felt it was important to make this change expeditiously.' Liverpool have spent £105million under Kenny Dalglish and Comolli's watch and Werner admitted the return on the pitch wasn't good enough. He said: 'I would say we certainly have the resources to compete with anybody in football. I wouldn't want to get specific about any particular decision that's been made. 'We feel there is enough talent on the pitch to win and, as I said, we've been dissatisfied, as most supporters have been, with the results so far. But we're also talking about the future - we have a strategy we need implemented and we felt Damien was probably not the right person to implement that strategy.' Asked whether the would appoint another director of football, he added: 'We're still confident the structure we've discussed is the right structure. That doesn't mean we won't look at tweaking it, but we feel a collective group of people making football decisions is healthy. 'The debate is healthy. Part of the reason we made this decision now is because we want to start the process of finding an excellent replacement. 'We don't have any specific candidates in mind. Part of the reason we made this decision yesterday was to be in the best possible position to move forward as quickly as possible.' Axed: Comolli, pictured at Ewood Park on Monday alongside ex-Arsenal chief David Dein, has left Liverpool by mutual consent . Jan 2011Andy Carroll - £35mLuis Suarez - £22.8m . June 2011Jordan Henderson - £16m . July 2011Charlie Adam - £9mStewart Downing - £20mDoni - free . August 2011Jose Enrique - £6mSebastian Coates - £7mCraig Bellamy – free . Jan 2012Danny Ward £100,000Jordan Ibe – £500,000+ . The Frenchman, who cited family reasons for his departure, was responsible for finding new players for the club - including the £105million they spent last year. In a statement on the club's official website, Comolli said: 'I am grateful to have been given the . opportunity to work at Liverpool and am happy to move on from the Club . and back to France for family reasons. 'I wish the Club all the best for . the future.' Owner Henry said: 'We are grateful for all of Damien's efforts on behalf of Liverpool and wish him all the best for the future.' The club's chairman Tom Werner added: 'The Club needs to move forward and we now have a huge game on Saturday. Under-fire: Carroll and Downing were two of Comolli's two high-profile signings . 'It is important that everyone joins us in supporting the manager and gets behind Kenny and the team and focuses on a strong finish to the season.' Initially brought in by new owners American Fenway Sports Group in November 2010 to help ease their first move into football, Comolli's appointment preceded Dalglish's by nearly two months but, once the Scot replaced Roy Hodgson, there was no doubt who was in charge. Even Comolli`s promotion from director of football strategy to a wider role the following March failed to alter the balance of power that club icon Dalglish controlled. And while Comolli has been criticised for his role in Liverpool's recent - and so far unsuccessful - transfer policy, the Reds boss stressed he had the final word on signings. When FSG took over in October 2010 much was made of their intention to employ the moneyball theory, which had been so successful at their other high-profile acquisition of the Boston Red Sox baseball franchise, to transfers. That essentially meant finding players who were potentially underachieving at other clubs but who could be signed relatively cheaply, made into a success and therefore have a much higher re-sale value. However, in the three transfer . windows Dalglish has overseen, the owners have forked out the best part . of £125million, with a net spend of about £70million. Out you go: Peter Brukner (right) quickly followed Comolli out of the door . Those deals included an eye-watering . £35million for Andy Carroll, £20million for Stewart Downing, £16million . for Jordan Henderson. Dalglish's best deals have been for Craig Bellamy, who came in on a free . but has no re-sale value because of his age, and Jose Enrique . (£6million from Newcastle), with only Luis Suarez, at £22.8million, . coming close to justifying his price tag. With the owners' pre-season ambitions . of regaining a place in the top-four ended by a run of woeful league . results it appears the director of football experiment has been ditched. The responsibility now lies solely . with Dalglish, who has come in for his fair share of criticism recently, . and while that may not actually have changed much behind the scenes it . is now more transparent and there can be no hiding behind anyone else. Dalglish insisted Comolli was at Anfield with his blessing and was sad to see him exit. He said: 'He's been really helpful in every transfer target we've gone for. Big money: Adam and Jose Enrique (R) were signed by Comolli last summer . 'Everyone who has come into the club since Damien has been here was of my choice. Once I made the choice who I wanted. 'Damien . went away and did a fantastic job of bringing them in. It's sad to see . anyone leave the club and he goes with my best wishes.' As . well as playing a part in the signing of Carroll, Comolli also . contributed to one of the most dramatic days in the history of the . Premier League by helping along the deal that took Fernando Torres to . Chelsea for £50million late on the same day. Earlier in his career, the 39-year-old Comolli had held a similar post at Tottenham. He was heralded for securing deals for players such as Gareth Bale, Luka Modric and Dimitar Berbatov but, much like his time at Liverpool, not all his dealings were well thought of. The likes of David Bentley and Adel Taarabt were never able to make their mark at White Hart Lane and former manager Martin Jol was outspoken about his uneasy relationship with Comolli. Meanwhile, managing director Ian Ayre and Dalglish thanked Brukner for his work at the club as he packed up his things. Staying on: Dalglish thanked Comolli and Brukner for their work . 'We are grateful to Peter who has been the catalyst for the transformation of our Sports Medicine and Sports Science capability at the Club since he joined two years ago,' said Ayre. 'He has been instrumental in re-defining our requirements and bringing first class people into the team, providing us with a great platform to move forward. We wish him all the best for the future.' Dalglish added: 'The framework Peter has established has allowed us to see some very real results in relation to our overall levels of fitness and a reduction in injury levels. Peter acted as the key advisor to the club in this regard, and we wish him well in the future.' Brukner insisted he was not bitter at the departure, and claimed his work at the club had been done. 'It has been an honour to work at Liverpool Football Club. I am very proud of what we have achieved over the past two years, as can be seen by the reduced injury rate and improved fitness levels.' he said. 'With a world class staff now in place, I feel I have accomplished what I was asked to do by Liverpool in 2010 and the club is in good hands. I wish the Club every success in the future.'","King Kenny survives on dramatic day at Anfield .

Behold the bonobo, our ape cousin that's kinder and gentler than the chimpanzee or, well, us. Now scientists have mapped the primate's DNA, and some researchers believe that may eventually reveal secrets about how the darker side of our nature evolved. Scientists have found that we are as close genetically to the peace-loving but little-known bonobo as we are to the more violent and better understood chimpanzee. It's as if they are siblings and we are cousins, related to them both equally, sharing some traits with just bonobos and other characteristics with only chimps. Mates: Human beings were believed to have a similar genetic blueprint to bonobos, an endangered species which can only be found in the Congo region of Africa . Bonobos and humans share 98.7 per cent of the same genetic blueprint, the same percentage shared with chimps, according to a study released today by the journal Nature. The two apes are much more closely related to each other - sharing 99.6 per cent of their genomes - said study lead author Kay Prufer, a geneticist at the Max Planck Institute in Germany. He said: 'Humans are a little like a mosaic of bonobo and chimpanzee genomes.' Bonobos and chimps have distinctly different behaviors that can be seen in humans, with bonobos displaying what might be thought of as our better angels, said Duke University researcher Brian Hare. Bonobos make love, not war. Chimps have been documented to kill and make war. Bonobos share food with total strangers, but chimps do not. Bonobos stay close to their mothers - who even pick out their sons' mates - long after infancy like humans. But chimps tend to use tools better and have bigger brains, like humans. 'Is the bonobo genome the secret to the biology of peace?' asked Hare, who was not involved in the new research. 'They have done something in their evolution that even humans can't do. They don't have the dark side we do. 'If we only studied chimps, we'd get a skewed view of human evolution,' he said. Gentle and wild: A mother tends to a baby bonobo in their natural habitat of the Democratic Republic of Congo . Bonobos, chimps and humans shared a single common ancestor from about six million years ago, Prufer said. Chimps and bonobos shared the same common ancestor until about a million years ago, when the Congo River formed. Then the bonobos developed on one side of the river, the chimps the other. They became different species, even though scientists didn't realize that until about 90 years ago. Bonobo heads are slightly smaller and their teeth are arranged differently. In behavior, bonobos are far more tolerant and social. They are inordinately sexual. Instead of releasing tension by fighting, they couple repeatedly, Hare said. Bonobos are ruled by alpha females, chimps by males. In some ways - especially when looking at the physiology of the brain - it's as if a bonobo is a juvenile chimp that doesn't develop, Hare said. Chimps get more violent as they age; bonobos don't. The scientific name for bonobos is Pan paniscus. Brian Hare said: 'They never grow up and we have lots of data to support this idea. Much of their psychology seems to be frozen.' Some researchers say Hare has romanticized the bonobo too much. Emory University researcher Bill Hopkins says he has more bonobo scars than chimp scars on his body. Sure, bonobos will bite, but they won't kill, Hare said. Bonobos are endangered and only live around the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo. 'Ironically,' Hare said, 'Bonobos are from the place where people are at their worst.'","Humans are a 'mosaic' of bonobo and chimpanzee genomes .

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . PUBLISHED: . 13:17 EST, 22 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:17 EST, 22 August 2012 . A spurned teenager plunged a knife into his ex-girlfriend's back to make her 'feel the same pain he was going through', a court has heard. Thomas Dalton, went to the house of Samantha Laney, 19, 'angry and frustrated' and stabbed her to death. However, the 19-year-old claimed he was struggling to cope following the breakdown of his relationship with Miss Laney when he attacked her in February this year. Murder charge: Thomas Dalton, 19, (left) is accused of stabbing Samantha Laney, 19, after lying in wait outside her home before launching a vicious attack on her and her father . Giving evidence at his murder trial, Dalton described how he went to Samantha’s home in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire armed with the six inch blade feeling but claimed he did not intend to kill her, telling a jury: 'I just wanted to hurt her, because she’d hurt me. 'I wanted to hurt her, just to make her feel how I felt.' He decided to confront his ex during a telephone conversation with her, the court was told. After rolling 'two or three' cannabis joints, Dalton then borrowed a friend's bike and cycled to Miss Laney's house, waiting more than an hour for her to return, he told the court. He burst into her home before launching his vicious attack. He added: 'It was while I was talking to her on the phone. That’s when I picked up the knife. I borrowed a bike from a friend and cycled to Clayton. Dalton is also accused of the attempted murder of Miss Laney's father Steven (pictured), during the attack at their home in Newcastle-under-Lyme . 'I wrapped the knife in a bag and rolled two or three spliffs. I was angry. I went to kick the back door open. Sam’s friend was there. 'That’s when I pulled the knife out. I shouted, ""Where’s Sam?"" I turned a corner and saw her. I couldn’t see anyone else. I was totally focused on Sam. 'As soon as I stabbed her I looked at the knife and it was like I’d just woken up. I thought, ""What have I done?"" I turned around and walked out.' The single stab wound to the back punctured Miss Laney's lung and severed an artery. She bled to death. Despite Dalton admitting he had previously threatened to kill his ex-girlfriend, he insisted that at the time of the stabbing his intentions were only to hurt her. He also denies attempting to murder Miss Laney's father Steven, who he fought with immediately after the attack. Scene: Dalton is accused of waiting for outside Miss Laney's home in Newcastle-under-Lyme before launching a vicious attack on her and her father . The court heard how Dalton was diagnoses with a condition called adjustment disorder (AD) at the time of the stabbing. Consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Stewart Vaggers said: 'Adjustment disorder is a reaction to a stressful life event, such as a bereavement or a separation. 'It fits in between more severe mental illness and a normal reaction. Patients are capable of quite dramatic behaviour, and also violent behaviour.' People suffering from AD would have impaired judgement, it would not necessarily hamper their ability to plan ahead, Dr Vaggers added. Earlier in the trial, the court heard from another forensic psychiatrist, Dr Tom Clarke, who did not believe Dalton was suffering from AD. At the opening of the trial Philip Bennetts QC, prosecuting, said Dalton had told Samantha he was going to 'slice her open' after she ended their relationship in January. The court also heard shortly after the killing, Dalton updated his Facebook profile, saying: 'Some things got to be done in life.' Dalton, of Kidsgrove, Staffordshire, denies murder and attempted murder. The trial continues.","Thomas Dalton claimed he did not intend to kill his ex-girlfriend .

"By . Lydia Warren . UPDATED: . 09:36 EST, 12 July 2012 . The father of the three young girls who perished in a horrific fire at their mother's Connecticut mansion on Christmas Day has filed a lawsuit against his ex-wife's boyfriend over the deadly blaze. Matthew Badger formally served a wrongful death and negligence lawsuit on Wednesday against Michael Borcina, the contractor boyfriend of Madonna Badger, who also lost her parents in the fire. In the papers, filed in Stamford, the bereaved father claims the house had become a 'firetrap' due to 'substandard construction'. Borcina had been the contractor for the $1.7 million home. Grief: Matthew Badger, left, is suing Michael Borcina, right, over the blaze that killed his three daughters. They are pictured at the girls' funerals with the children's mother and Borcina's girlfriend Madonna Badger . 'No smoke detectors or fire alarms . alerted them to the fire,' the lawsuit claims. 'The girls died before they could escape the home, which . had become a firetrap as a result of months of substandard construction . leading up to the fire.' Borcina was supposed to oversee the installation of a . smoke detector system after beginning renovations at the . three-story home in 2011, the suit claims, the Stamford Advocate reported. In an interview since the tragedy, Madonna Badger . told the Today show that she had thought the home had fire alarms - but . awoke in the early hours of Christmas Day to smoke and silence. Victims: The deadly fire on Christmas Day killed nine-year-old Lily and seven-year-old twins Grace and Sarah . Devastation: The lawsuit claims that Borcina failed to oversee the implementation of fire alarms at the Connecticut mansion, and that he did not have the correct work permits . The lawsuit adds that Borcina failed to complete the renovations by April 2011, as planned, as he ignored . standard contracting practices. 'The complaint speaks for itself,' Mr Badger's lawyer, Richard Emery, told the Advocate. 'We're moving forward on this, and we're going to go aggressively.' Emery previously told the New York Post: 'Borcina was the contractor on the job. He was aware . of the dangers, or should have been aware of dangers, that a civilian . would have been unaware of. 'The fact that kids . were living in this house was unbelievable. I don’t hold Madonna . Badger responsible for that at all because I can’t imagine she would . have understood the immediacy of the dangers.' Missed: (Left to right) Lily, Sarah and Grace all died of smoke inhalation in the fire . Victims: . Lomer and Pauline Johnson, seen standing, also died in the fire. Mr . Johnson died trying to save their grandchildren, left. Another grandchild Morgan (right) was not in the . house . The suit also names the city of Stamford and the home's architect, electrician and general contractor as defendants. It claims that city officials should . have known the contractors did not have the correct work permits and . that Borcina did not have a home improvement contractor's license for . the state. Borcina and Mrs Badger were the only . survivors of the blaze that claimed her nine-year-old daughter Lily and . seven-year-old twins, Sarah and Grace. Her parents, Pauline and Lomer . Johnson, also died. The deadly blaze started after . Borcina placed ashes from the fireplace in a paper bag in a plastic . container in a mudroom of the house. Within hours, smouldering embers . ignited. The girls and their grandmother died . from smoke inhalation, while Lomer Johnson suffered a fatal a head injury when . he fell from a second-floor window onto the home's roof. Broken: Matthew Badger, holding a picture of Sarah, has set up a school art fund in memory of his daughters . Dispute: Officials ruled that smouldering embers taken from the fireplace had started the fire. But Mrs Badger, left, said Borcina, right, had checked to see if they were still hot . Last month, prosecutors decided that . criminal charges will not be filed in the tragedy, as some precautions . were taken at the time and although they proved insufficient, they . could not be considered criminal negligence. Mrs Badger has argued against the . official account of the fire, saying that she saw her boyfriend run his . fingers through the ashes to check they were not alight. As she went to bed in the early hours of Christmas Day, the box of ashes caught her eye, she told the Today Show. He then placed them on top of a plastic bin in a mudroom, which caught . her eye as she walked up the stairs in the early hours of Christmas . morning. 'I remember thinking to myself, ""I should put that outside. I should put . that outside"",' Mrs Badger said. 'Then I remembered . thinking, ""No, but I watched him put his hands through it"".' Remembered: Hundreds gathered for the funeral held at St. Thomas Church in New York City on . January 5 . Matthew Badger, who said he still . cries daily over his daughters' lost lives, has sought to come to terms . with their deaths by creating something positive in their memories. He has set up the Lily Sarah Grace . Fund to raise money for teachers in public schools to incorporate art . into their teaching - a hobby his daughters, who were all dyslexic, . loved. 'It's really hard,' he told Good . Morning America. 'People treat their grief in different ways. Either . they head straight into the wind [or] some people hide behind a rock. 'I had a very hard time making sense . of what life was. The instinct of a father for me was that I needed to . love my children and that love I channelled into the creation of the .

The UK government has a £2 million emergency action plan to help tackle a cholera epidemic sweeping through Sierra Leone. So far around 200 people have died and more than 12,000 have been infected by the water-borne disease, which causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea and can kill within hours if left untreated. The Department for International . Development (DfID) is using a network that includes private . businesses and specialist aid organisations to deliver emergency . medical, water and sanitation assistance to affected people in the west . African state. Staff assist a cholera patient in a treatment centre run by Medecins Sans Frontieres in Sierra Leone's capital Freetown . It is the first time the UK has used the network, called the Rapid Response Facility, since it was established in March. Save the Children, International Rescue Committee, Oxfam, Concern, Care International and the British Red Cross have been mobilised as part of the emergency response. The DfID plans to help provide clean water and sanitation to nearly two million people as well as direct treatment for to up to 4,500 people affected by the disease. Anti-cholera drugs and water purification kits will also be shipped to Sierra Leone. A cholera patient lies in a treatment centre in Sierra Leone's capital Freetown. Sierra Leone's government has described the current cholera outbreak as a ""national emergency."" A cholera patient is given urgent medical attention. Some 170 deaths have been reported since the start of the year . The outbreak has been described as the worst epidemic in the country for two decades. DfID Secretary Andrew Mitchell said: 'The cholera epidemic in Sierra Leone is fast becoming a crisis, with millions potentially at risk. 'The UK is - for the first time - activating the Rapid Response Facility, its network of private sector and aid experts to make sure we get aid to where it is needed, fast. 'Not only will our response be rapid, it will be efficient. 'We will monitor closely to make sure every penny of British aid achieves results and supports those in dire need.

Cholera has spread quickly across West Africa, getting significantly worse in the last few weeks, with almost half those infected in Sierra Leone - the worst epidemic in the country for two decades. The outbreak has been most severe in the capital, Freetown, which has a dangerous mix of poor sanitation, high population density and limited health services. Hundreds more children could die during the cholera outbreak unless it is brought under control quickly, a charity warned today. Save the Children said aid agencies face a race against time to get preventative measures in place before the crisis reaches its expected peak in three weeks' time. It said ten of Sierra Leone's 13 districts are affected by the disease and it is responding by assisting government treatment units, providing clean water to families and increasing the number of trained community health workers on the ground. Heather Kerr, Save the Children's country director for Sierra Leone, said: 'If we can't get this outbreak under control quickly and comprehensively, it has the potential to kill many more children. 'Children die very quickly from cholera if they don't receive immediate medical help. 'The sheer volume of people who are contracting the disease means that aid agencies need more funding now to respond more efficiently to this devastating.'","200 people have died and more than 12,000 have been infected .

The man who was Tory Treasurer when the party accepted almost £500,000 from corrupt Polly Peck tycoon Asil Nadir, said last night that David Cameron was under a ‘moral duty’ to give the money back. As Nadir began a ten-year jail term for looting almost £29million from the collapsed company, Lord McAlpine, a scion of the construction dynasty, said the cash should be paid to Nadir’s creditors, some of whom lost their life savings. ‘It is tainted money and it shames the Conservatives if they hang on to it. They have a moral duty to give it back,’ he said. 'Moral duty': Former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine (left) has called on David Cameron to give back the £500,000 donated by jailed Polly Peck tycoon Asil Nadir (right) The money was paid to the Tory Party between 1985 and 1990 when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party. Senior figures from Lady Thatcher’s administration last night insisted that she would repay the money if she was still leader of the party. Nadir, 71, was one of Britain’s most prominent businessmen in the 1980s, only to become one of the most notorious fugitives from justice when he fled Britain for northern Cyprus in 1993 while awaiting trial. His conviction at the Old Bailey on Wednesday prompted immediate calls for the Tories to return the estimated £440,000 they received from Nadir’s collapsed Polly Peck company. Going down: An artist's impression of the moment Nadir is sentenced to ten years in jail for stealing £29million from his Polly Peck empire . Touche Ross, the Polly Peck administrator, has written a letter to Tory HQ claiming at least £365,000 can be identified as money stolen from the company by Nadir. The Tories last night indicated that they would hold on to the cash – worth £860,000 in today’s figures – even though the then party chairman Norman Fowler told the Commons in 1993: ‘Obviously if it is proved that the money was stolen it will be returned.’ The intervention of Lord McAlpine, speaking to the Daily Mail from his home in Venice, will ratchet up the pressure on the party to surrender the cash. He said: ‘When Asil Nadir gave the first donation to me, his Polly Peck company had just won a Queen’s Award for Industry. ‘He was a dashing figure who was admired across Europe for his business flair. No one thought for a second that he was bleeding his company dry through illicit means. But frankly the moment he fled the country in 1993, to avoid criminal charges, it was obvious to me he was a complete conman. Frankly, the Tories should have given the money back in 1993. ‘But today the case is even clearer. There is a moral imperative for the money to be returned. The money was not Asil Nadir’s to give although we thought it was at the time. ‘Therefore the Tory Party has a duty to return it. It will speak volumes about the character of the modern Tory Party if they don’t do the right thing. I trust that David Cameron is an honourable man.’ Tainted: Nadir, pictured here while on the run in Cyprus, donated the money to the Tory Party between 1985 and 1990 when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister . Lord McAlpine, who was Tory Treasurer from 1975 when Lady Thatcher became leader until her fall in 1990, said: ‘I can tell you this: If Margaret Thatcher was still leader of the party I am absolutely certain she would have ordered the party to repay the lot. I can hear her barking down the phone: “Alistair, we can’t keep that man’s money”.’ The same view was echoed by Lord Powell, who was Lady Thatcher’s private secretary at Downing Street, at the time of the dealings with Nadir. Lord Powell said: ‘My gut instinct tells me that Mrs Thatcher would have wanted that money repaid.’ However, former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said too much time had passed and that it would not be possible to show that the donated money had been stolen from Polly Peck. Lord Powell . Sir Malcolm, who was in the Cabinet under Lady Thatcher  and is still an MP, said: ‘It is very difficult to pick and choose when you are talking about money that was so many years ago. Asil Nadir was a rich man and had a great deal of personal wealth. ‘One would need to know a lot more about where the money came from before one could think about whether it should be handed back.’ From other Tory grandees there was a conspicuous silence. Former Cabinet members such as Lord (Cecil) Parkinson and Lady (Gillian) Shephard declined to comment. When Nadir fled to Cyprus, the then prime minister Sir John Major said: ‘If it proves to have been dishonestly obtained and dishonestly remitted to us, then of course we will return it.’ Sir John was overseas and not available for comment. Meanwhile, a Labour MP has written to Conservative co-chairman Baroness Warsi to demand the party hands the Asil Nadir cash back. Simon Danczuk, MP for Rochdale, wrote: ‘The conviction of Asil Nadir raises the matter of his donations to the Conservative Party. ‘Sadly... the initial response of the Conservative Party, very soon after the conviction of Asil Nadir, was to say that the money would not be repaid.’","Lord McAlpine said the £440,000 should be paid to Asil Nadir's creditors .

On a 'cliff edge': Tony Melville, Chief Constable of Gloucestershire Police has warned that further cuts to the force would affect front-line policing . Police officer numbers have fallen by more than 6,000 in a year, figures revealed last night. Sharp cuts have taken police strength . to its lowest level for a decade, sparking claims that David Cameron is . ‘letting down communities’ and endangering public safety. But ministers insisted forces could . cut overall numbers while protecting the front line, and pointed to the . 25,000 officers doing ‘backroom jobs’. The figures emerged as a senior officer warned that the threat of further cuts had left his force on a ‘cliff edge’. Tony Melville, Chief Constable of .

By cutting bureaucracy and working more efficiently, . police visibility on the streets can be improved.’ There is now a total of 136,261 officers in England and Wales, a fall of 6,012 – or 4 per cent – on 12 months ago.

In a modern world increasingly dominated by email and social networks, they may be considered by a luxury purchase irrelevant to the younger generation. But it seems the appeal of the humble fountain pen is timeless, as retailers have reported that sales of the 'luxury' writing tool have more than doubled in the past year. Online retailer Amazon say fountain pen sales have doubled since January compared with the same period last year, while Parker say there has been a 'resurgence' in the product. On the up: Experts say the increase in fountain pen sales is due to people wanting traditional items in more difficult times . Other pen makers have reported increased sales in the past 12 months, and stationary store Ryman said there had been a 10 per cent rise in the past six weeks. High street retailers have also hailed the traditional ink pen as one which gives the 'personal touch' in correspondence, and is one which people have returned to in more difficult times. Sharon Hughes, a buyer for John Lewis, told the BBC: 'They are an old-fashioned thing but people like the personal touch. 'It is nice for things to be handwritten and not having everything via email.' Despite the increased sales, it seems fountain pens are not popular across all generations. In 2010, a head banned fountain pens in his school for fear pupils who use them will be marked down in exams. Jack Williams said modern computerised marking systems used for GCSEs often miss the penstrokes at £8,250-a-year Hillcrest Grammar and Preparatory School in Stockport .

Seattle detective Pamela St John, who specializes in cases of elderly abuse, said that other family members became suspicious the couple might be exploiting the 82-year-old. The octogenarian, who was described as sprightly but unable to manage her finances, currently lives in a Bellevue care home for those with dementia.

Garret Doherty might be a world champion runner but you won’t see him at this summer’s Olympics because he only runs backwards. Mr Doherty, 33, from Dublin, is the world’s fastest backwards runner and incredibly, is able to cover a mile in just over seven minutes. And after being crowned world champion for three years on the trot, he is returning to the UK backwards running championships, held in Manchester tomorrow, to defend his title. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Backwards is the new forwards: Garret Doherty, 33, from Dublin, is the world's fastest backwards runner and incredibly, is able to cover a mile in just over seven minutes . Mr Doherty got hooked on the bizarre sport three years ago when he turned around to avoid the sun’s glare while out on a jog. And despite constant stares from baffled passers-by, he discovered he could run nearly as fast backwards as he could forwards - and claims his life has been transformed by the craze. Mr Doherty said: 'Backwards running is like a drug, once you start, you’ll never want to run forwards again. 'It’s truly liberating, and there are enormous health benefits. It’s much better for your body than running forwards, as it’s lower impact. Talented: Mr Doherty competed in his first backwards running race at the UK championships in Manchester in 2009 and now competes all the time . 'People usually have to do a double take when they see me whizzing past when I’m training. 'I’m always getting passers-by shouting at me, telling me I’m going the wrong way. 'But who says I’m going the wrong way and everyone else is going the right way?' Mr Doherty competed in his first backwards running race at the UK championships in Manchester in 2009. He regularly trains across the UK, and has been training in Birmingham and London on the run up to this weekend’s big race. Speedy: Mr Doherty claims to have only fallen three times since he started running backwards but he does admit to taking a forwards-running friend with him to act as his eyes . Despite the obvious trip hazards, Mr Doherty claims to have only fallen three times since he started running backwards. However, he does admit to taking a forwards-running friend with him to act as his eyes when he trains on unfamiliar or busy terrain. Mr Doherty, who gave up his job as a bicycle rickshaw operator and now tours schools in a bid to convert children to backwards running, had always been a keen jogger. But it was only when he was forced to turn away from the glaring sun on an evening jog that he ever thought about going backwards. He explained: 'The sun was so bright I had to turn away, but I didn’t want to turn round and go home. 'I just thought I’d try facing the other direction and running backwards for a while and it was great. 'My body felt much better after running backwards as well, and I went and researched backwards running properly. Wrong way round: Mr Doherty regularly trains across the UK, and has been training in Birmingham and London on the run up to this weekend's big race in Manchester . 'I couldn’t believe how many people around the world were into it and there were so many competitions to enter.' Mr Doherty has travelled the world entering backwards running competitions and has been crowned champion in cities across the UK and Ireland, as well as in international games held in Austria. He completed the mile-long UK championship in 2010 in an impressive time of seven minutes 30 seconds. And last month, he finished the Wexford half marathon in an astonishing time of just one hour 40 minutes after running all of it backwards. Mr Doherty is now dedicating his life to converting people to backwards running and claims the health benefits alone are enough to convince people to give it a go. He said: 'You burn three times as many calories running backwards as running forwards, as it uses a lot more muscles. 'You land on the correct part of your feet, which helps your ligaments and ankle bones. Champion: Mr Doherty is now dedicating his life to converting people to backwards running and claims the health benefits alone are enough to convince people to give it a go . 'In forwards running, your feet land heel to toe but when you run backwards it’s the other way round, which is how you’re supposed to run, the same way as you would barefoot. 'And instead of the muscles in your lower back getting the workout, it’s the muscles in your lower abdomen that are worked the hardest. 'Backwards running also improves your posture and encourages you to stand and run with your shoulders back. 'If it wasn’t for people being too embarrassed to run backwards, it would be a lot better for everyone to do it.' The organiser of the UK championships, held in Heaton Park, Manchester tomorrow, James Bamber said: 'Most of the people who enter our races do it for a bit of fun, but there are a handful of dedicated backwards runner out there who train all year round and never miss a race. 'I can tell you from personal experience that unless you have trained for months beforehand, your legs will know they’ve been through a stiff workout and to even manage the whole race without resorting to a slow shuffle would be a massive achievement. “It’s a little-known fact that backward running is not only a great workout, but can actually prevent injury and is a very valuable exercise for athletes rehabilitating from knee injuries.'","Garret Doherty is able to cover a mile in just over seven minutes .

"Pair visited a scrap dealer as friend lay undiscovered . By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 12:01 EST, 22 July 2011 . Two brothers who left their friend to die when he was electrocuted as they stole copper cable from beside a railway were behind bars tonight. John and Jason Tusting, 26 and 23, sold the metal for just £340 within hours of father-of-two James Smith suffering a fatal shock inside an electricity substation. The 28-year-old's body lay undiscovered for more than two hours while the emergency services carried out a search of the area. Jason Tusting, left, and his brother, John, left their friend to die when he was electrocuted as they stole copper from a railway track . Jason Tusting had anonymously called 999 but lied about the exact location of the incident. The break-in caused £110,000 worth of damage, but the copper was sold for just £342 at scrap dealer GH Metals in Peckham, south-east London, Blackfriars Crown Court heard. The brothers made the sale shortly after railway staff finally came across Smith's body in the substation near Sydenham station at around 7am on December 4 last year. Electrocuted: James Payne died on railway tracks . Mr Smith had suffered horrific burns and was discovered lying near a pile of bricks, naked from the waist up with his mobile phone and car keys taken from his pockets. John Tusting had to be taken to hospital by ambulance at around 7.23am suffering from 'severe' burns on his left arm and shoulder sustained in the burglary. He told paramedics he had been attacked overnight by three men, who had doused him with petrol and set him on fire. But he later told doctors he had been drunk and simply woke up with the injuries. Jason Tusting, of Honor Oak, south London; and John Tusting, of Lee, also south London, pleaded guilty to burglary and criminal damage recklessly endangering life. Jason Tusting has also admitted perverting the course of justice. The brothers were due to be sentenced this afternoon, however, Judge John Hillen adjourned sentenced until August 12, and ordered the Probation Service to produce reports to address whether they represented a 'danger' to the public and should face indefinite jail terms. Remanding the men in custody, he said: 'Custody is the only option, and it is really a question of what form the custody takes - one may be looking at a longer term for the protection of the public.' The court heard Jason, giving the false name 'Josh Tusting', rang 999 at 5.32am to say he had been waiting for a train at Sydenham station and seen a 'flash of light' and a man fall to the trackside. But the location he described was 'some distance' from the substation, the court heard. The substation's power supply had been tripped two minutes earlier at 5.30am when the cables were cut. Jason Tusting admitted his real identity after being tracked down by a suspicious officer, who then asked to check his hand for a distinctive scar recorded on Jason's police file. Simon Taylor, prosecuting, said the brothers had 'tried to conceal their activities and in effect created a false crime scene, thereby delaying the discovery of the body.' Jason's DNA was later found on Smith's lips - suggesting he had tried mouth-to-mouth resuscitation before fleeing from the scene. The court heard Network Rail had 'experienced a 300 per cent increase in the theft of copper and other metals' since 2004, at a total cost of £15m. Mr Taylor said: 'It is quite clear that the damage caused during the course of the commission of these economic crimes has the effect of endangering the lives of others. 'This is a feature of these crimes that was starkly and tragically demonstrated in this particular case, where one of the gang of thieves died as a consequence of being electrocuted. 'The defendants appear on the indictment not because they are directly to blame for the death but because they created a hazard that left the lives of others in danger - a risk that is only too sadly evidenced by the death of their colleague.' The damage resulted in the closure of the main commuter line between London and Kent coast for almost an hour. James Rouse, defending, insisted John Tusting had made attempts to save Smith, and had suffered as a result. 'He grabbed him in an effort to pull him away, thereby causing extremely serious injuries to himself,' he said. 'He was in hospital for five days straight after the incident and, when the ambulance technician arrived at his home, when asked how painful his injuries were, he said ""10 out of 10"".' The illiterate thief, whose criminal record includes convictions for burgling a primary school, stealing a car and possessing a knife in public, was arrested on December 16 in the burns unit of Lewisham Hospital. Jason Tusting's record includes criminal damage, affray, theft and drink-driving. His barrister Nick Robinson said he had also made attempts to seek help after the break-in, calling for an ambulance and trying to administer CPR. But Judge John Hillen said the 999 call was misleading 'causing operatives looking for the body to put themselves a risk'.",Pair visited a scrap dealer as friend lay undiscovered .

Mitt Romney has attempted to shift attention away from the controversy over when he truly left Bain Capital by accusing Barack Obama of favouring political donors with government contracts in a form of cronyism that ‘stinks to high heaven’. Appearing on Fox News, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said: ‘This is a tough time for the people of America. But if you’re a campaign contractor to Barack Obama, your business may stand to get millions or hundreds of millions in cash from the government.' In a conference call with reporters, Romney advisers said they were gathering examples of Mr Obama's ‘Chicago-style politics’ to prove to voters there was an insidious ‘pattern’ of contracts being awarded to donors. Crony capitalism? President Obama has been accused of giving government contracts to campaign donors . Under fire: Mitt Romney has found himself under attack for his record at private equity firm Bain Capital . The Romney campaign also released a new internet ad using a clip of Mr Obama singing Al Green's Let's Stay Together to insinuate suggest ties between donors and the Obama administration. It was also a retort to an Obama television commercial featuring Mr Romney's off-key rendition of America the Beautiful. Ed Gillespie, a senior Romney aide, said: ‘There are countless examples of this over the past three and a half years, whether it’s the Department of Energy or the stimulus bill, or the Department of Health and Human services and the Obamacare bill, and over the course of the next few days we're going to be highlighting some of these examples of how the Obama economy works.’ The Romney campaign has highlighted Solyndra, a California solar energy company that went bankrupt, and Westly Group, a venture capital firm whose affiliated companies have received federal loans and grants. Steve Westly, the company's founder, is a major Obama campaign fundraiser. But the Romney campaign said it would not release details of its campaign ‘bundlers’, as Mr Obama has done. The decision provides further ammunition to Democrats, who have accused Mr Romney of a lack of transparency. Mr Romney has said he will not release any tax returns beyond those for 2010, which have already been made public, and 2011, which are still being finalised, despite pressure from Democrats and some Republicans to do so. Accusations: The Romney campaign is keen to highlight Mr Obama's support of failed company Solyndra . Protest: Democrats and campaigners are pushing Mr Romney to release more details of his tax returns . Mr Gillespie told Laura Ingraham, a conservative talk radio host, that the Obama focus on Bain was designed to distract from the President’s poor economic record. ‘What we’re seeing here is what Barack Obama warned about in 2008 in his acceptance speech in Denver, when he said, you know, when you don’t have anything to run on, you try to make big elections about small things.’ Pressed on the issue of tax returns, Mr Gillespie said that Mr Romney wasn’t budging. ‘He’s releasing 2010 and 2011 and we’re happy to talk about those. ‘But the fact is what we really want to talk about are the Romney plans for creating jobs in our economy, for turning this economy around, getting it moving again, stopping the excessive regulation, the mandates and the onslaught of taxes and debt. That’s what the American people want to talk about and the constant effort to hold up shiny objects and distractions – we’re going to keep focused on what the voters care about and what matters to them. ‘It’s not Mitt Romney’s tax returns. It’s their tax returns and are they able to have income to file a tax return? Do they have a job? We have over half a million people – fewer Americans working today than when Barack Obama took office.’ Swing state campaign: Mr Obama travelled on Air Force One to an airport near Cincinnati, Ohio . Mr Romney has found himself on the defensive over federal documents filed by Bain Capital that conflicted with his statements about when he left Bain Capital. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 2001, Bain Capital listed Mr Romney as the company's ‘sole shareholder, sole director, chief executive officer and president’. It said Mr Romney's ‘principal occupation’ was as Bain's managing director. Mr Romney's campaign, backed up by a number of independent fact checkers, has repeatedly said Mr Romney had almost nothing to do with the company's operations after February 1999, when he began work on the imperilled 2002 Winter Olympic Games. The significance of the period from 1999 to 2001 is that it covers the time when Bain oversaw investments that either sent jobs abroad or filed for bankruptcy. It is also when Mr Romney stated in federal disclosure forms that he was not active in Bain Capital. Mr Romney has said that neither Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee, nor Senator John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic nominee, released more than a years' worth of tax returns as candidates. But the Obama campaign has been successful in making Mr Romney’s estimated wealth of at least $250million a key focus of the campaign, for the time being at least. Mr Romney also faces difficulties explaining his secrecy over his tax returns because his father Governor George Romney of Michigan released 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in 1968.","Romney campaign accuses Obama of giving government funds to donors .

NATO warplanes bombed a Libyan warship docked in Tripoli harbour after observing that weapons were being take from it that were expected to be used to conduct attacks, the alliance said today. The Soviet-built Koni-class frigate was hit and badly damaged on the military side of the port of Tripoli, NATO military spokesman Colonel Roland Lavoie told a news briefing. 'It became evident regime forces were removing weaponry and munitions from the warship with the intent of using them from other platforms,' he said. Blast: The Fernej area of Tripoli is rocked by a powerful explosion in the early hours of the morning . Blitzed: A building used by Gaddafi troops is seen after a Nato air strike on the town of Bir al-Ghanam . NATO was concerned the arms could have been used against civilians, NATO forces, or ships delivering humanitarian aid. 'The strikes were successful and they are expected to reduce the regime's ability to conduct hostile action,' Lavoie said. 'The state of the frigate is not good. As of this morning, photos showed that it was quite damaged. 'I would conclude that it is very unlikely to present any threat in the future to the civilian population or to NATO forces. NATO's air campaign and a sea blockade launched in March have kept Gaddafi's naval forces confined to harbour except for a few minor harassment missions. However, two NATO warships did come under ineffective rocket fire from the coast last week. Colonel Gaddafi has ordered three days of mourning following the alleged death of many civilians . NATO said it destroyed several Libyan naval vessels in air strikes in May. Warships hit at that time included a Koni-class frigate and a Combattante class fast-attack ship. The strike came on the same day that Libyan accused Nato of bombing civilians. According to local reports the attack, which took place 150km - or 90 miles - east of the capital, led to at least three children dying. The international agency have been trying to help the anti-regime rebels, who have been battling with Colonel Gaddafi's forces for five months, and have said they will investigate the claims. Libyan state television showed footage of the charred bodies of at least three young children who, it alleged, were killed by a Nato strike last night on the village of Majar. In addition, there were also video clips in which women and children - supposedly badly injured in the bombing - being treated in a hospital. State television did not provide a figure for the total number of people who had died or had been wounded. However, the official Jana news agency insisted that '20 families' had been killed, though a precise figure was not forthcoming. Exercise: Libyan rebel fighters with the Tripoli Revolutionary Brigade after carrying out a drill . The state television said that the government of Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi have announced three days of mourning for the victims. Majar is situated near Zlitan, on Libya's Mediterranean coast, where Nato forces have been mounting attacks on government troops. An official from the organisation said the alliance hit a target in Zlitan last night but he could not say if it was in the same location where Libyan television reported casualties. 'We have been chasing this (report) up,' the official said. 'We cannot confirm reports of civilian casualties but we would regret any loss of civilian life. 'Nato goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties, unlike the Gaddafi regime, which is deliberately targeting civilians.'",Attack on same day Nato are accused of killing 'dozens' of civilians including children in bomb attack .

The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency has sold sensitive personal details of more than 7,000 drivers to a convicted criminal and his company. Today’s revelation comes despite the quango’s promises to clean up its act  in the wake of a similar scandal seven years ago. Yet The Mail on Sunday can disclose that the DVLA sold motorists’ names  and addresses to a parking enforcement company just seven weeks after it admitted dozens of criminal offences. 'Reckless': Douglas Harris, left, admitted 36 offences. Right, Dale Key has 'no idea' what happened to the details of 85,000 drivers . Agency chiefs knew that Observices Parking Solutions and boss Douglas  Harris had been fined £29,850 after a court ruled it had been ‘recklessly unfair’ to drivers last year – but they still sold on the personal details. The Mail on Sunday can also disclose the DVLA has sold 4.85 million drivers’ names and addresses to parking enforcement firms in the past six years at £2.50 a time – without checking if the companies’ use for the private information was legitimate. This includes details of nearly one million drivers being passed to 12 firms that were subsequently suspended from accessing the register due to wrongdoing or bankruptcy. As well as these records, which were sold and accessed electronically, companies pursuing parking fines can make individual postal applications to the DVLA, boosting its income from the sale of personal data to £20.8 million over the past five years. Last night, Labour MP Anne McGuire said: ‘It is unacceptable that the DVLA is still handing out this confidential information on drivers without doing due diligence on either the companies or the individuals at the head of those firms.’ In 2005, we revealed the agency had sold personal data to two convicted criminals who ran a wheel-clamping firm, prompting Ministers to announce a crackdown and to the DVLA making a string of reforms. The Mail on Sunday can also disclose the DVLA has sold 4.85million drivers names and addresses to parking enforcement firms in the past six years at £2.50 a time . At the time, the DVLA said it would start checking the criminal records of applicants for its data – although it refused to say that a conviction would be a bar in the future. Our new investigation has found: . Currently, 23 companies have  been approved to receive the data electronically from DVLA vehicle records within 24 hours of applying. The agency makes no checks on the legitimacy of the applications. Other parking companies can receive the data only by submitting postal applications, which are individually vetted by the DVLA. Leading the way: How the Mail on Sunday has reported the DVLA scandal . The DVLA says firms are allowed electronic access only after a six-month probationary period, during which their applications are closely monitored. However the new string of cases raises fresh concerns over the misuse of the data obtained through the electronic system. Harris’s firm OPC has bought 23,663 motorists’ names and addresses from the DVLA since 2006. Last year, Wolverhampton Trading Standards investigated  a number of claims that OPC was breaching the code of practice imposed by industry trade body, the British Parking Association (BPA). These included sending parking tickets to car owners up to five months after they parked, erecting misleading signs, dismissing legitimate appeals and unnecessarily involving debt collection agencies. In March 2011, Harris and OPC admitted 36 offences at Wolverhampton Magistrates’ Court, which said the firm had been ‘unreasonable, unfair, intransigent, and had deliberately misled motorists’ as it  imposed the substantial fine. Harris, as the company’s director, admitted ‘recklessly engaging in unfair commercial practice which contravenes the requirements of professional diligence’. This is a criminal offence under The Consumer Protection from Unfair  Trading Regulations 2008. Harris admitted taking more than the required 28 days to request details of the owners of vehicles from the DVLA.  He also pleaded guilty to displaying 15 misleading signs and sending letters from a debt recovery firm without revealing it was owned by OPC itself. The DVLA suspended OPC from accessing drivers’ details electronically, as the BPA carried out an investigation into the firm. But just 44 days later, the trade body gave OPC a clean bill of health and the DVLA lifted the suspension. This allowed OPC to immediately obtain the drivers’ details of 1,120 vehicles it claimed to have caught parking illegally during its suspension. In the past 12 months OPC has bought details of 6,000 more drivers. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency has sold sensitive personal details of more than 7,000 drivers to a convicted criminal and his company . The Mail on Sunday visited the company’s offices, but Harris was unavailable for comment. A BPA spokesman said: ‘Our compliance team carried out an inspection of the services provided by OPC and were satisfied that significant efforts had been made to rectify their practices.’ In 2005, The Mail on Sunday revealed the DVLA had sold drivers’ details to the bosses of a Portsmouth wheel-clamping firm. The company’s directors were jailed for blackmail and extorting money from motorists. Several reforms were made, but campaigners say the process is still open to abuse. Last week we revealed how the boss of parking enforcement firm Wilsea Services, which was struck off by the BPA last month, was sold the names and addresses of 43,000 motorists by the DVLA in just 20 months. The firm, owned by Stephen Warburton, has now been accused of breaking DVLA rules by profiting from selling on personal details. A director of parking firm Debt Recovery Plus said he paid Wilsea £3 each for thousands of names. Gary Brierley said: ‘We paid them  a fee to use their link. We paid  them 50p per detail on top of the £2.50.’ Mr Warburton who is believed to be working in America, was  unavailable for comment.

"Ban on system is aimed at grabbing market share, claim industry insiders . The ban is only affecting low-price rivals' own-brand sun creams . By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 02:07 EST, 1 July 2011 . Star rating: Boot's Soltan brand of sun cream displaying five stars . After seven years of letting competitors use their UVA star rating system, Boots has now banned low-price rivals from putting the universally recognised protection markings on their own-brand sun creams. But in the shock move, Britain’s biggest chemist chain is still allowing pricier makes like Nivea and Ambre Solaire to use the protection rating system on their bottles. The chain is now being blasted for risking the health of holidaymakers by banning the cut-price rivals from using the system. Boots, which owns the rights to the easily-understood and widely used star system has barred own-brand rivals including Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Superdrug from printing it on their products. And cancer experts have hit out at the Boots' decision saying that the confusion could lead to customers failing to protect themselves from the dangers of skin dancer. Dr Russell Emerson of Hove Skin Clinic said: ‘Protecting our skin from UVA rays is equally, if not more important than protecting it from UVB rays. ‘The removal of star rating from own- brand packs could result in confusion for shoppers and could mean that they end up spending more than is necessary on expensive branded sun care. ‘It is not necessary to spend a fortune to get the right protection. ‘At a time when skin cancer rates are on the rise, it's even more important for consumers to have more, rather than less information on how to stay safe in the sun.’ Boots has barred own-brand rivals including Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Superdrug from printing the rating system on their products . Industry insiders say the ban on using the seven-year-old star system is aimed at grabbing market share back from the lower-priced competitors - on the basis families will only buy products that have the star rating which shows sun lotion protection levels from cancer-causing UVA rays. But there are fears it will confuse shoppers who may end up paying more because it will be harder to compare rival creams. An Asda spokesman said: ‘What is . telling is that Boots has only banned rival stores who undercut their . prices from using the star rating. ‘Brands . such as Nivea, Ambre Solaire, Piz Buin and so on - who presumably Boots . do not see as a threat on price - are still able to use it. ‘The . only conclusion is that Boots are scared about the threat from the . cheaper rivals. But the people who suffer are ordinary families. The . supermarkets have fought hard in recent years to introduce cheap . own-brand sun creams that undercut big names such as Nivea and also . Boots' own Soltan range. This . star rating is as important as the sun protection factor (SPF) score . used to measure how a cream blocks out UVB rays, according to experts. And it has been vital in battling skin cancer. Not banned: Pricier sun creams such as Ambre Solaire and Nivea have not been banned from using the rating system . The star ratings system was developed by an academic at Newcastle University for Boots. It became the standard method used by sun cream makers in the UK and Ireland in 2004. The move by Boots comes as Cancer Research UK reveals skin cancer levels have tripled since the 1970s. Boots made the shock decision last year but rivals hoped for a u-turn. Retailers were able to use up stock already tested and bottled but new batches without the star rating are hitting stores now. This system consists of five different ratings, with one star indicating low levels of protection against UVA radiation, and five stars indicating a high level. Retailers and brands have traditionally paid Boots a token fee for use of the star logo and for testing. Superdrug are calling for an independent standard, not one regulated by a retailer and in this case a competitor . Health bosses in the USA are so impressed by its effectiveness in raising awareness about UVA rays among consumers they have been considering implementing it there. The Asda spokesman added: ‘Sun cream is a necessity - not a luxury - and everybody should be entitled to the best sun protection available no matter what their budget. ‘It is especially important when it comes to children and their health. It's unfortunate there is a burning ambition by some to make huge profits on what is essential skin care. ‘Our customers can have the confidence they won't get burned by the cost of cream, because they can buy Asda Protect sun cream from as little as £1.50.’ Andrew Groom, Superdrug's Own Brand Director, said: ‘With an issue as important as skin cancer, retailers and own brand manufacturers should be working together to help customers make an informed choice. ‘We are at a loss to understand why Boots has chosen to withdraw our license for the star rating system. ‘Our own brand suncare, Solait continues to conform to the 5 star standard, yet we can't reassure our customers by using the rating system. We are calling for an independent standard, not one regulated by a retailer and in this case a competitor.’ A spokesperson for Boots told the Mail Online today: 'Boots introduced the UVA star rating system in 1992. 'We have updated it a number of times in line with technological developments because we know how important UVA protection and the star rating system is to all consumers. 'Following a review of the star rating system and conversations with leading experts, including Cancer Research UK, we have established more robust controls to deal with past issues of non-compliance to the star rating system, so that customers can be sure that any brand using this system is doing so correctly. 'Following these conversations in May 2011, revisions have been made enabling us to make new licences available to all sun care brands shortly.'","Ban on system is aimed at grabbing market share, claim industry insiders .

A cruel vet kept sick pets in squalor, botched operations and even held one dog ransom until their owner agreed to pay for more treatment - a court has heard. Aquah Ohene-Gyan was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to animals after he allowed desperate creatures to escape from his surgery and frequently carried out bogus tests to bump up his fees. The 53-year-old from Clapham, in South London, failed to show up to his court case on Thursday and magistrates heard a shocking catalogue of abuses in his absence. Justices were told that two dogs had to be put down after police raided Woosehill Vets, in Wokingham, after responding to a protest held outside the surgery by angry customers. They found one dog - who had lost her hind legs to cancer - dragging herself through a pool of her own faeces and urine with her front paws. Horrified officers took the dog and other pets to another vet in nearby Reading, but she had to be put down due to a tumour that had gone undiscovered by Ohene-Gyan. Sgt Stefan Kristiaan said: 'It was a painful sight; the animal appeared wasted away, it was very . thin and its bones appeared to be protruding.' Reading Magistrates' Court heard how another dog also had to be put to sleep because she was suffering chronic . renal failure due to being kept in a squalid cage that was much too small for . her. And how officers seized one dog, a Lurcher named . Red, who had been kept ransom by Ohene-Gyan after her owner refused to pay the bill of . an X-ray carried out without his permission. Staff claimed the animal, who was still suffering from a ruptured Achilles tendon, was only being treated with mild painkillers and was sometimes kept in a cage for up to 23 hours a day. Ohene-Gyan also failed to operate on an injured cat correctly, after it had been hit by a car and dislocated its ankle. He did pin the dislocated bones . together, but did nothing to prevent the bone from rotating - causing . the creature excruciating pain. The court was told that Ohene-Gyan refused to refer any of his animal patients to specialists because to do so . would be bad for business. In one incident two cats escaped from the surgery after . being taken in for neutering by their owners, who were only informed when they went to collect their animals. Another cat died during a minor operation and a puppy almost lost his leg due to bandages being applied too tightly. Giving evidence as the trial, veterinary nurse Shirley Schreiber said she had worked for Ohene-Gyan, but quit at . the end of her three month probation period in October 2010. Mrs Schreiber said the defendant, . originally from Ghana, had shown her around his new practice Ashlyn . House Vets in Binfield, Berks., and she had been impressed with its . cleanliness. However, she was appalled when she commenced work at Woosehill Vets, which she described as 'the complete opposite'. 'It was a shambles and the kennels were a . mess,' confirming to Paul Taylor, prosecuting, that she she would often . find medicine and syringes lying about. Abuse: Woosehill Vets surgery in Wokingham, Berks; where animals were kept in squalid conditions and given unnecessary treatments . Mrs Schreiber said she would clean the . cages as they became dirty, and always at the end of her working day, . but that when Ohene-Gyan was there alone at night he would simply move . the animals to another cage. She said that often he would leave the . patient notes on the original cage, which could lead to mix ups, as had . happened with two female Staffordshire Bull Terriers. 'The two dogs were the same colour, they . were similar dogs and we did not know which one was which or who they . belonged to,' she said. 'We had to wait for the owner to come in to tell us which was their’s.' Mrs Schreiber said that this confusion . meant that some animals would go without treatment because the type of . medication they needed would be unknown. And that Ohene-Gyan would . refuse to carry out simple surgical procedures such as spaying and once . ordered her to tell an owner that their dog needed further treatment to . delay the procedure until another vet arrived the following day. She said: 'He instructed me to tell the owner the dog had a high temperature and required fluids overnight. 'He never even checked the dog’s temperature and he didn’t put the dog on a drip.' She added: 'He said ""I can do bitch spays and cat spays but I’d rather not,"" he said ""they’re really messy"".' Mrs Schreiber said that when she had seen him . perform a castration operation on an animal he had taken around an hour, . when another vet would take just 10 to 20 minutes. And on another occasion she said she had to . tell her boss that he had mistakenly read an X-ray which led him to believe that cartilage was broken ribs. He also refused to diagnose a visibly flea-ridden cat until it had a blood test. Once he told her that a rabbit which had . been in the surgery for several weeks had come in to be euthanised, but . he could not be sure so just left the animal, which was suffering from . an abscess on its chin. Another vet later treated the rabbit and Mrs Schreiber found it a new home, where it has lived healthily ever since. The court was told that Ohene-Gyan would . advertise his cheap services, including spaying, but would then bump up . the price by charging for unnecessary treatments such as putting the . animals on a drip. The defendant had denied the charges but was found guilty on four counts of causing . unnecessary suffering to an animal and four of failing in his duty to . ensure animal welfare. The case was adjourned for sentencing on June 20.","Reading Magistrates' Court heard how Aquah Ohene-Gyan: .

"By . Peter Allen . UPDATED: . 09:23 EST, 18 October 2011 . L'Oreal cosmetics heiress Liliane Bettencourt, pictured earlier this year, has threatened to emigrate France, where she is the country's richest woman . France's richest woman threatened to emigrate today after a judge ruled that she was 'mentally unfit' to manage her £15 billion fortune. Liliane Bettencourt, who inherited the L'Oreal cosmetics fortune, was told that she had dementia and Alzheimer's and is no longer well enough to run her business affairs. In turn, the 88-year-old said she was fine, and accused her daughter of plotting against her to try and wrestle control of one of the most successful companies in the world. Mrs Bettencourt, who turns 89 on Friday, is also suspicious of France's judicial authorities who are investigating her for allegedly giving brown envelopes full of cash to leading politicians in return for tax breaks. These include President Nicolas Sarkozy, who was once a regular visitor to the Bettencourt household in Neuilly, the upmarket Paris suburb. Sitting in a court in Courbevoie, in north west Paris, Judge Stephanie Kass-Danno granted the controversial ruling following a petition by Mrs Bettencourt's daughter, Francoise Bettencourt- Meyers, 58. Mrs Bettencourt- Meyers had argued that her mother was being negatively influenced by members of her 'entourage' to whom she kept handing out money. But, speaking just before the judge's decision, Mrs Bettencourt said: 'If my daughter wins I will go abroad.' She said that having her money put under the control of a daughter to whom she seldom speaks would be a 'nightmare'. Mrs Bettencourt also objected to another part of the ruling that states that she herself will be under the 'guardianship' of her grandson, Jean-Victor Meyers. Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers, 58, argued that her mother was being negatively influenced by members of her 'entourage' The family feud stared in 2007 when Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers accused a photographer called Francois-Marie Banier of taking advantage of her mother's condition by persuading her to give him around £1 billion worth of artworks, insurance policies and cash. It then turned into a political scandal after it was alleged that Mrs Bettencourt had effectively 'bought' tax breaks from politicians like Mr Sarkozy. A judicial enquiry has been opened into the so-called Bettencourt Affair, but it is unlikely to conclude before next year's presidential elections. Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Jean-Rene Farthouat, said today's ruling was 'contrary to good sense' and there would be an appeal. Mrs Bettencourt is the daughter of the founder of L'Oreal, Eugene Schueller, and sits on its board. The family owns a 31 per cent stake in the company, worth about £14 billion. After the ruling, Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers reassured investors that the decision to put her mother under guardianship would not affect the company in any way.","88-year-old L'Oreal heiress accuses daughter of plot .

A woman befriended a paralysed Gulf War veteran and fleeced him out of £250,000 so she could buy her new boyfriend a new house and car. Cruel mother-of-two Deborah Bowcock, plundered the accounts of wheelchair-bound Gavin Jones, 45, who had been awarded a record compensation payout. Mr Jones, a former RAF Gunner, received £2million following an unprovoked attack by three thugs which left him brain damaged and paralysed down one side of his body in 1995. Bowcock, 40, who knew Mr Jones through her ex-husband, persuaded him to hand over power of attorney and stole £250,000 from his account. Stoke Crown Court heard Bowcock used the cash to buy a motorbike, a car and put a deposit on a house with her partner Andrew Mellor, 35. On Thursday she was jailed for three years while Mellor was sentenced to 18 months in prison after they both admitted theft. Sentencing Bowcock, Judge Granville Styler told her she was guilty of a 'gross breach of trust'. She said: 'I accept you, Deborah Bowcock, did not initially befriend the man for financial reasons, and that he also willingly lent you money, but you knew this was a gross breach of trust. 'You stole in the region of £250,000 from this man and that money was dissipated over a period of two years for your own purposes. 'It has left him in a parlous financial situation.' Judge Styler told Mellor: 'I accept you, Andrew Mellor, played the lesser role and had no knowledge of who Jones was. 'But you spent the money on a motor vehicle, motorbike and a large deposit on a house which has since been repossessed, and there is no money left for Mr Jones.' The court heard how Mr Jones was on leave from the RAF at Christmas 1995 when he was attacked in a pub in Crewe, Cheshire, by three thugs who approached him and asked for a cigarette. When he refused, one of them struck him on the back of the head. Vulnerable: Gavin Jones, a former gunner in the RAF, was left partially paralysed after an unprovoked attack . He was knocked to the ground and although he later went to his parents’ house, his mother found him unconscious in the middle of the night and he was rushed to hospital. He was left wheelchair-bound and in need of round-the-clock care following the attack. In 1999 Mr Jones, who was 28 at the time of the assault, was awarded £2million - the highest amount ever paid out by the Criminal Injuries Board. He moved into a specially-designed bungalow and relied on family and friends for support. Bowcock met him through her ex-husband who trained with him in the RAF cadets. She befriended Mr Jones again in 2005 and convinced him she was a financial advisor before persuading him to hand over power of attorney to her. Between 2005 and 2007 Bowcock used her new power to transfer £332,677 to a separate bank account set up in her name. Bowcock, from Leek, Staffordshire, told Mr Jones she was investing his cash but instead transferred £70,000 to Mellor, of County Durham. Mellor, who knew the money came from Mr Jones, used the money to buy a new car, motorbike and a 'substantial' deposit on a house. She also convinced Mr Jones to lend her £60,000 to set up a tanning salon which has subsequently shut down. Paul Spratt, prosecuting, told the court Bowcock gave £24,000 back to Mr Jones to give him the impression his investments were paying off. But none of the money was ever invested in any financial schemes and the bank account is now empty. He said: 'Mr Jones was left with a net figure of £1.5million after his payout but by the time he met Bowcock, he had a very substantial figure left than he originally had. Sentenced: Both Bowcock and her boyfriend Mellor admitted theft and were jailed at Stoke Crown Court (pictured) 'He now has an outstanding mortgage on his property which he can’t pay off and one investment left, which has a policy of around £6,000.' Maria Masselis, defending Bowcock, who had no previous convictions, said she was 'deeply ashamed' of her actions. She said: 'She did not set out to steal from Mr Jones and he willingly lent her money to help start up her own business. 'She had a genuine friendship and sense of affection for Mr Jones and what she did was not premeditated. 'When she realised she could not repay the money she should have stopped and done something about it, but she continued to try and dissipate the funds, hoping it would go away. 'She is an educated woman and it begs belief why she acted so stupidly.'Anis Ali, defending Mellor, said: 'He accepts his culpability and is prepared for a custodial sentence. 'He did not know Jones but is ashamed of his conduct.' Mr Jones has previously released a book about his ordeal called ‘Fighting Back - a Soldier Story’.","Former RAF Gunner Gavin Jones awarded £2m compensation payout after thug attack left him paralysed and brain damaged .

Predator: Judge John Milford QC, left, told Stephen Crawford, right, that he 'enjoys the act of rape' before imposing a life sentence which could be as short as four and a half years at Newcastle Crown Court . And it emerged after the latest trail . at Newcastle Crown Court, that Crawford had previously been cleared on . five separate occasions of raping women over two decades. He was found not guilty of rape during . the 1980s and 90s – managing to convince the jury in each trial the . alleged victim had consented to sex – but picked up a string of . convictions for unlawful sex with teenage victims and sexual assault. But despite his horrific past, Judge . John Milford imposed a life sentence which has a four-and-a-half year . minimum tariff, meaning he will be eligible for release as early as . 2016. Judge Milford told him: ‘I am satisfied you are dangerous, you are a man who enjoys the act of rape. ‘Nobody knows when you will cease to be a danger to woman so the only sentence I can pass upon you is life. You will only be released when the parole board is satisfied you are safe to release.’ Crawford was working as a mobile disc jockey when he targeted the young girl as she walked home alone in the early 1980s. The now 49-year-old, from Washington, . Tyne and Wear, had once again denied his guilt but jurors convicted him . of rape after just 90 minutes deliberation. The victim had told the court of the look of ‘sheer power’ on Crawford’s face when he attacked her all those years ago. It was only when the woman could not . cope with keeping her ordeal secret, after three painful decades, she . reported what had happened to her. Horrific past: Jurors heard some details of Crawford's long history of brutal and predatory attacks on young girls and women over several decade during his trial at Newcastle Crown Court . Judge Milford added: ‘She was so . frightened by the experience she did not think anyone would believe her . over your inevitable denials and she kept the matter to herself for all . those years. ‘It is clear to me that this offence has had an immense impact upon her, that it has lived with her throughout her adult years. ‘One only had to see her demeanour in the witness box to appreciate that.’ Five separate women in the 1980s and 1990s found the rape accusations they made against Crawford come to nothing. In 1985, Crawford was accused of . raping a 15-year-old girl in Washington. He admitted unlawful sex and . the rape charge was dropped. In June 1992 he was found not guilty . by a jury of raping an 18-year-old girl he had offered a lift in his . caravette after insisting she consented. At the same time another charge of rape against a different woman was dropped after prosecutors offered no evidence. In September 1992 he was cleared by a jury of raping a woman in his car after offering her a lift home. Again, he claimed the 18-year-old consented. And in March 1993 a rape charge made . by an off-duty special constable was dropped when she backed out of . giving evidence against him. The jury in the 2007 case were never . told of Crawford’s chilling background which included; a conviction for . sex with a girl under 16, 21 months in jail for unlawful sex with a . 13-year-old. Or that in April 1999 he got a . suspended sentence after he attacked a 15-year-old girl in the cab of . his car transporter after driving her to a secluded lane in Gateshead. Attacks: The jury were told how Crawford would pretend to be a taxi and target lone women including one victim who became separated from friends after a night out in Durham . Or that he has been convicted of failing to comply with the requirements of the sex offenders register twice. During the 2007 trial three victims – none of whom knew each other - gave evidence one after another before the same jury. The court heard how Crawford stalked . the streets posing at a taxi driver looking for lone females to pick up . and attack in Durham and Sunderland. He offered lifts to the three women . who had become separated from friends during nights out. One of his . victims was subjected to a five hour ordeal. Another victim, a 17-year-old, told . jurors she had resorted to showing Crawford pictures of her family on . her mobile phone and begging him to look at their faces to imagine how . they would suffer if he killed her. One of the victims, who faced Crawford while . giving evidence from the witness box, told jurors: ‘I’ve never, ever in . my life hated anyone as much as I hate that bloke. ‘It has got to the stage where I’ve had nightmares about it, I can’t stop thinking about it. ‘For someone to have such an impact on somebody else’s life like this, even after this many years, its just wrong.’ Crawford admitted he offered lifts to the women but said they consented to any sexual activity which took place. He claimed to the jurors that the women seemed to ‘enjoy’ what happened and insisted they consented to sex. But after hearing evidence from his sobbing victims, jurors found him guilty. During his defence, Crawford claimed the victim was a ‘total stranger’ to him and denied having any sexual contact with her. Crawford told jurors: ‘They were total . strangers to me yesterday, both people who stood in this dock, I have . never seen them before in my life.’ When asked if the victim’s name meant . anything to him, Crawford replied: ‘It didn’t then, it doesn’t now, it . means nothing, no idea.’ Andrew Walker, defending, said . Crawford has now admitted the past offending he was convicted of, . despite his denials at the time. He maintains his denials in relation . to his conviction this week. Mr Walker said Crawford is co-operating . with officials and undergoing programmes in jail. Mr Walker added; ‘He is in extremely poor health, he informs me he has had 16 heart attacks since his remand in custody in 2007. ‘His cardiologist is extremely pessimistic about his life expectancy.’","Stephen Crawford was branded a .

The Venezuelan teenager directs an orchestra of between 70 and 80 musicians, half of whom are older than him. He was recently appointed to the role at the Youth Orchestra of Nueva Esparta, and is the latest success story to come out of his country's orchestra system El Sistema. Natural gift: The brilliant Jose Angel Salazar joined El Sistema aged eight, after being raised by a family who had had little exposure to classical music, let alone formal training . He modestly dismisses the assumption he is the youngest conductor of all time, pointing out that there may be another 'in some small town somewhere' in an interview with The Guardian. El Sistema previously produced famous conductors Gustavo Dudamel and Edicson Ruiz. Los Angeles Philharmonic conductor  Dudamel was named one of Time Magazine's top 100 most influential people in the world in 2008-09, while Edicson Ruiz became the youngest musician to join the Berlin Philharmonic at 17. Amazing talent: Jose Angel Salazar was recently appointed conductor at the Youth Orchestra of Nueva Esparta, where half of the musicians are older than him . Jose joined El Sistema aged eight, and came from a family who had had very little exposure to classical music, let alone formal music training. He lived with his schoolteacher parents and his grandparents, who he has taken with him on his musical journey. 'My father now talks to me about symphonies and variations, something he knew nothing about four years ago,' he said. The young man has been in his new post for just a week, but is too young to earn a wage under Venezuelan law and may need a scholarship or grant. He plans to study music at university, but also intends to learn German to help him with understanding the classical canon. 'I went to a brass concert with my dad and grandfather and I cried three times,' said Jose, but he admits that leading his peers is more challenging than working with adults. 'It's hard because I have to find the way to communicate, or sometimes tell off kids who are much older than me, he said. 'Conducting is a wordless language. I have to convey confidence to the musicians in order to get a confident performance back from them.' Musical greats: Los Angeles Philharmonic conductor Dudamel was named one of Time Magazine's top 100 most influential people in the world in 2008-09 . El Sistema was founded 37 years ago by Jose Antonio Abreu, a retired economist and politician who was also a conductor and pianist. He is now known as Maestro - and has triggered the beginning of another 285 child and youth orchestras in the country and an ambitious programme where more than 400 children are studying to become conductors. 'Music has to be recognised as an agent of social development in the highest sense because it transmits the highest values of solidarity, harmony and mutual compassion,' says Abreu. 'I've sought to take music, which is usually a luxury item, and turn it into cultural patrimony accessible to all'.","Jose Angel Salazar joined the orchestra network aged eight .

A large bang heard by hundreds across the country last night was a sonic boom caused by two Typhoon aircraft responding to an emergency, the Ministry of Defence said. The RAF jets were despatched to a small civilian helicopter that had emitted an emergency signal on a frequency it should not have been using, but the error was realised too late. An MoD spokesman said the fighter planes, scrambled from RAF Conningsby, in Lincolnshire, had been authorised to go supersonic and were already on their way to the helicopter. Confusion: A large bang heard by hundreds across the country last night was a sonic boom caused by two Typhoon aircraft, like this one pictured, responding to an emergency, the Ministry of Defence said . Drama: A member of the public captured this image as a fighter jet responded to a distress signal sent from a helicopter over Shoscombe, Bath, Somerset . Unexplained: The two jets, bottom, with the 'mysterious' silver object that was spotted above Bath at the same time . He said: 'We can confirm that a small . civilian aircraft was transmitting inadvertently on an emergency . frequency at approximately 6.10pm. 'Two . typhoons from the Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) responded accordingly and . authorisation was given from them to go supersonic, which resulted in . the sonic boom. 'There was no actual threat to the civilian aircraft and they soon rectified their mistake.' The £125m jets triggered a string of 999 calls across 150 miles of English countryside as they caused a huge sonic boom while smashing the sound barrier. But the incident turned out to be a false alarm when it emerged the red-faced helicopter pilot, flying near Bath, Somerset, had broadcast the emergency signal by mistake. Sound alert: The jets broke the speed of sound - causing a large boom to be heard for hundreds of miles across the country - and raced to the aid of the helicopter, flying near Bath, Somerset . The bang resulted in a deluge of . calls to police forces across the West Midlands, Warwickshire, . Oxfordshire, Somerset and Wiltshire were inundated with calls following . the massive boom on Thursday. Buildings and houses were reportedly shaken, stunning residents and baffling emergency services from across the three counties. A number of concerned locals witnessed the dramatic scene as one of the Typhoon jets tailed the helicopter. Donna . Bunton, from Shoscombe, near Bath, saw one of the Typhoon jets tailing . the helicopter - before snapping the dramatic scene on her camera. She . said: 'I first heard a massive sonic boom. We get Hercules aircraft . flying over here quite a bit - but this was louder than that. 'I then saw this helicopter, with the jet tailing it. It was so low you could see its triangle shape. 'The Typhoon was swaying behind it from side to side - I have never seen anything like it before. 'I went inside to grab my camera, then took a quick picture as it was flying off.' The jets broke the speed of sound - causing a large boom to be heard for hundreds of miles across the country - and raced to the aid of the helicopter, flying near Bath, Somerset. Concern: The loud bang was heard in Swindon, Bath, Coventry and Oxford (above), leading to fears it may have been an explosion or underground tremor . But they were called back to their base after it emerged the aircraft had only broadcast the emergency signal in error. A sonic boom is the sound associated with the shockwaves created when an object travels through the air and breaks the sound barrier. The noise contains large amounts of sound energy, meaning sonic booms are often mistaken for explosions. Speculation about what could have caused the noise ranged from a large explosion to an underground tremor. It is the second time this year that a sonic boom has been created by a Typhoon aircraft. In January, the MoD confirmed that a loud noise heard by people across the North of England was caused by an RAF fighter jet breaking the sound barrier. Warplane: A Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4 in full weapons configuration . Dan Cross, bar and restaurant supervisor at Millsy's in Earlsdon, Coventry, said the noise was so forceful it shook the walls of the restaurant. 'It sounded like it was coming from the kitchen,' he said. 'I thought somebody had dropped one of the big ovens in there. 'It was a really loud bang and the room shook and all the wine glasses on the rack shook. 'When it wasn't coming from the kitchen I thought maybe it was the cellar, but then wondered if it could be something else. 'It was weird, but didn't last long.' Jennifer Lawlor, a supervisor at the Spar shop in Daventry Road, said she did not experience anything, but her boyfriend, Martin Ward, rang her and told her the walls of his house were shaking. 'He said there were two very loud bangs and he felt the room was shaking,' she said. 'He lives up in Stoke and is off work sick at the moment so wasn't sure what it was - he thought he might be hallucinating. 'He was actually quite freaked out by it and I had to tell him he wasn't going mad and lots of people were talking about it.' The jets were scrambled because the frequency the helicopter pilot mistakenly transmitted on is only used when an aircraft is in particular trouble. Such a signal could indicate the aircraft had been hijacked or had 'gone rogue'.","Large bang initially thought to be explosion or tremor .

A repeat sex offender was sentenced to nearly 27 years in prison after a federal jury convicted him of luring a 14-year-old girl to send him a nude photo. Judge Monti Belot sent 26-year-old Shane McClelland to federal prison for 320 months in Wichita, Kansas on Monday. The judge said the conduct was clearly inappropriate as the defendant was seeking out young girls. He also imposed ten years of supervised release and forfeiture of McClelland's cellphone. Menace: Shane McClelland, 26, was jailed for 27 years in Kansas after he sexted a teenager wanting nude photos. He is seen in an earlier mugshot (right) after serving time in jail in 2004 for assaulting a 13-year-old . The judge said a long sentence was necessary to deter him from further crimes and to protect the public. In . May, McClelland was found guilty of one count of obtaining a . picture of the exposed genitals of a 14-year-old girl from upstate New . York via Yahoo! messaging. He was acquitted of a similar count involving another teen. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Hart argued for enhanced penalties in the 15-30 year range due to McClelland's criminal history. He served five years in prison for a 2004 conviction for aggravated indecent liberties with a 13-year-old girl, and had been paroled from prison just seven months when he began trolling teen websites to aggressively pursue young girls. Punished: McClelland was found guilty of having sex with a 13-year-old before sexting other girls (stock image) Hart introduced as evidence a transcript of the 2004 case in which McClelland admitted having sex with the teen. At his sentencing, McClelland said: 'I don't have anything to say at this point.' His defense attorney, Timothy Henry, argued the enhanced penalties requiring between 20 to 30 years imprisonment because of a previous conviction amounted to 'cruel and unusual punishment'. He said that the latest crime for which his client was convicted amounted to one picture. Mr Henry said: 'We are dealing with a large segment of the population who are sexting. 'It doesn't make it right, but we are talking about a sentence that is extremely harsh for this individual.' He also questioned why the federal government was charging McClelland as if he was producing child pornography. The lawyer argued: 'She was old enough to know better.' But the judge said he didn't know of any statute setting a 'know-better standard' for sentencing. McClelland . showed no respect for the law by having sex with a 13-year-old girl, . escaping from custody and enticing two 14-year-old girls to send him . nude photos, Judge Belot said.

Defeat: Carina Trimingham described stories referring to her sexuality published after her secret affair with the former Energy Secretary became public as 'highly unpleasant and hurtful' Chris Huhne’s lover had only herself to blame for a series of newspaper  articles she claimed provoked a ‘cataclysmic interference’ with her private life, a High Court judge ruled yesterday. Carina Trimingham described stories referring to her sexuality published after her secret affair with the former Energy Secretary became public as ‘highly unpleasant and hurtful’. But Mr Justice Tugendhat threw out her claim for damages against the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, leaving her with estimated legal costs of £410,000, and in a damning judgment accused her of seriously exaggerating some of her evidence. Describing her as not a ‘good or reliable witness’, he added: ‘One reason for my reluctance to accept Ms Trimingham’s evidence is the poor view I have formed of her candour, given all the circumstances of this case.’ Miss Trimingham, 44, went to court over what she said were ‘crude and demeaning stereotypes’ about her bisexuality and sued Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Mail newspapers, for alleged misuse of private information and harassment in 65 articles. But the judge said she was ‘not the purely private figure she claims to be’ because of her involvement with Mr Huhne ‘both professionally, as his press agent, and personally, as his secret mistress, in circumstances where he campaigned with a leaflet to the electorate of Eastleigh (his Hampshire constituency) about how much he valued his family’. Ordering her to pay Associated’s legal costs and refusing her leave to appeal, he added: ‘Ms Trimingham has shown little sign of recognising how what she herself has done has given rise to the publicity she finds so unwelcome. ‘The difficult situation she found herself in was of her own making.’Rejecting all her claims, he said: ‘I do not accept the first premise of Ms Trimingham’s case, namely that she is a private individual. ‘There are two reasons. First, in her professional capacity , she undertook to work for one of the leading politicians in the country in the capacity of press officer. ‘Secondly, in her private capacity, she conducted a sexual relationship with Mr Huhne which he told her would lead to him leaving his wife. ‘She did this in conditions of secrecy which she knew were likely to give rise to publicity, or in other words, to a political scandal. ‘The scandal may or may not be bigger than she (or Mr Huhne) had foreseen, but there was always likely to be a scandal. ‘The public has an interest in knowing how the personal life of a leading politician, especially a Cabinet Minister, is likely to affect, or has affected, the business of government. So Ms Trimingham in her private capacity chose to take the risk of being mixed up in a political scandal, which her own conduct precipitated.’ The judge also warned: ‘Where the Press report the break-up through adultery of the marriage of a Cabinet Minister, a court should be slow to decide that information about the other woman which is included in the articles is irrelevant.’ Mr Huhne left his wife of 26 years, Vicky Pryce, for Miss Trimingham soon after she became his press officer during the 2010 General Election. It followed a two-year affair, which he kept secret from Miss Pryce and Miss Trimingham kept secret from her civil partner, Julie Bennett. The judge heard that because her husband’s press aide was in a  same-sex relationship, Miss Trimingham was the last woman Miss Pryce might have suspected he would run off with. During a five-day hearing last month Miss Trimingham, a former political journalist, admitted giving newspapers tips about the sex lives of Hollywood stars and senior politicians, selling a diary item to the Mail on Sunday about the current Deputy Prime Minister, which she described as ‘Nick Clegg 18 shags story’. Mr Justice Tugendhat, in a withering 136-page judgment, totally rejected her case. He said he was not persuaded Miss Trimingham ‘was being candid’ when she initially said she had sold stories only to the Guardian and claimed to have forgotten the other newspapers and what the stories were about. Dismissed: MP Chris Huhne's partner Carina Trimingham has lost her privacy and harassment claim against Associated Newspapers, which publishes the Daily Mail . A High Court judge told Ms Trimingham, pictured left today and right at the Lib Dem Annual Conference last September, that she was in a situation 'of her own making' He said her words, the ‘Nick Clegg 18 shags story’, on her invoice supported the view that she was ‘a journalist with a robust personality . . . a person who saw nothing wrong in disclosing to the world at large what she considered to be newsworthy information about the sexual activities of others. ‘That was so even if (or especially if) that information had previously been known only to a small number of people. ‘Likewise, she saw nothing wrong in disclosing to the newspapers information conveyed to her in or from a private conversation.’ The judge singled out evidence given by Mail columnist Andrew Pierce, whom Miss Trimingham accused of inaccurate reporting. He said: ‘I found Mr Pierce to be a candid and reliable witness. ‘Given the assessment that I have made of the evidence of Ms Trimingham, I have no hesitation in preferring the evidence of Mr Pierce  where it conflicts with that of Ms Trimingham.’ Columnist Amanda Platell and other Mail journalists gave evidence during the hearing and the judge said: ‘I have no reason to doubt that all of the defendant’s witnesses were giving their evidence truthfully. ‘It follows from this and from the view that I formed of Ms Trimingham’s evidence . . . that where her evidence conflicts with theirs, as it does in the case of Mr Pierce in particular, I reject Ms Trimingham’s evidence.’ He was also critical of Miss Trimingham’s unfounded allegations that a journalist had stolen a photograph of her civil partnership ceremony. ‘This is a regrettable part of her evidence,’ said the judge. Mr Justice Tugendhat said what the Mail wrote was insulting and offensive in so far as it referred to her personal clothing and appearance. But the words ‘bisexual’ and ‘lesbian’ are factual words which are not normally to be understood as pejorative by a reasonable person. ‘What the defendant has expressed hostility to is not her sexuality but her conduct. ‘It would be a serious interference with freedom of expression if those wishing to express their own views could be silenced by, or threatened with, claims for harassment based on subjective claims by individuals that they feel offended or insulted.’ Rejecting her claims that the 65 articles amounted to harassment, the judge pointed out: ‘Each time the defendant has named Ms Trimingham it has done so in a story in which the main character is Mr Huhne. ‘And each publication has been prompted by a particular event in Mr Huhne’s public career or life, or some other newsworthy event, such as a party conference. ‘The main target of the articles complained of is Mr Huhne. ‘Ms Trimingham is named in them only because of the very important secondary role she played in events relating to Mr Huhne.’ On her claim for misuse of private information regarding Miss Trimingham’s sexuality, he said: ‘It is her own evidence, as well as the evidence of  the journalists, that even before the  revelation of her affair with Mr Huhne in June 2010 she had had relationships with other men, and those who knew her knew of her sexuality. She did not attempt to keep it private. ‘The submission that in these circumstances Ms Trimingham had a reasonable expectation of privacy as to her being bisexual seems to me to be unarguable.’ The judge added: ‘It is important that I stress that I have not reached any conclusion about the conduct of Mr Huhne in relation to any of the matters referred to in this judgment. ‘He is not a party to this action, and he has not given evidence. ‘It would be wrong for the court, or for any reader of this judgment, to draw any inference adverse to Mr Huhne in a case where he has not given evidence and not been represented.’ A spokesman for Associated Newspapers said: ‘This was an important example of the Press exercising its right to free speech in relation to matters of significant public interest. ‘We are pleased that the court agreed with us and has today dismissed all of Miss Trimingham’s complaints. ‘The references to Miss Trimingham’s sexuality in our coverage were never  pejorative, private or in any way homophobic. ‘Miss Trimingham chose to level some very serious charges against our  journalists in this case. This judgment vindicates both our journalists and  their journalism.’ Outside court Miss Trimingham  said she thought the ruling was ‘confused and wrong,’ adding: ‘I am extremely  disappointed by this judgment. I intend to appeal.’","Carina Trimingham described stories referring to her sexuality published after her secret affair became public as ‘highly unpleasant and hurtful’

Stopping off at a motorway services station is usually an unpleasant experience of greasy burgers, long toilet queues and toxic coffee. Unless, that is, you happen to be at Tebay Services in Westmorland, Cumbria. With its dark wood beams, cafe that looks out over a picturesque duck pond and stock of quails' eggs and organic beer in the adjacent farm shop, it's fair to say Tebay is not your average stop-off. Now it has become the first service station in Britain to be awarded five stars following a survey by the Highways Agency and VisitEngland. Not your average stop-off: Tebay Services on the M6 in Cumbria is the first to be awarded a five star rating from Visit England . Proud moment: Services chief executive Sarah Dunning her staff show off their award . The services opened for business 40 years ago after growing out of the Dunning family's farm by the northbound M6. It now employs 500 staff. Its restaurant, open daily from 7.15am to 9pm, serves homemade food and even has an outdoor BBQ where staff flip burgers and sausages made from locally sourced meat to the delight of the weary motorist. In the adjacent farm shop, shelves groan with organic veg, locally sources jams, cheese and locally grown wines. There's also a butcher's counter that stocks Galloway Beef from nearby farms. The Highways Agency has strict rules about motorway service stations: they must not become destinations in their own rights. Grand: Tebay Services grew out of the family farm and opened for buisness 40 years ago . Beautiful setting: Ms Dunning said the services was a popular stopping point for traffic travelling between England and Scotland . Tebay chief executive Sarah Dunning told The Guardian: 'We are a stopping point for traffic travelling between England and Scotland. It is really cool being the only service station out of the 100 odd motorway services areas on the network to get five stars.' Over the past year a team of six assessors from VisitEngland have conducted three mystery visits to all 107 service stations on the motorway network. During the two-hour visit they looked at cleanliness, car parking, security and safety, lighting, facilities for children, dogs and disabled people and for coaches, caravans and lorries. Spot of shopping: The service station also boasts a farm shop and butcher's counter . Artisan: The shop sells locally sourced jams and locally grown wines as well as a range of organic vegetables . They also assessed the toilets, food and overall experience and asked staff questions such as: 'Cottage pie - is that made from lamb or beef?' Seventy service stations were awarded three stars, 11 got two stars and 25 received four stars. In 2006, Tebay was voted best motorway services in Britain by Which? Magazine. In 2009 it won the Grand Prix of gastronomy from Egon Ronay. Those living further south are in luck as the Dunning family are planning another service station near Gloucester.",Tebay Services awarded five stars following survey by Highways Agency and VisitEngland .

She promptly put up a notice warning punters not to dispose of their cigarette butts in the tray. And last Thursday, the eggs hatched, revealing three tiny chicks. Miss Andrews, who has worked at the pub for four years, said: “When I opened it, a bird flew out which made me jump. 'I then saw these little eggs. It was quite exciting. It’s quite unusual really. 'I’ve been listening and trying to look in and I’ve seen the mother bird flying in and out to see them.' Pub landlady Lisa Cobbold, 52, said: 'We thought Tricia was winding us up at first. 'We don’t know what to do for the best. We don’t want to interfere too much with the chicks in case the mother abandons them.' A spokesman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds says birds will nest wherever there is an opportunity.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond will go to the opening of the Bomber Command Memorial despite his department's refusal to pay for the ceremony . Philip Hammond has been branded a hypocrite for his decision to attend the unveiling of a new memorial to Bomber Command despite refusing to pay for the event. The Defence Secretary will go to the opening ceremony even though the Government said it would not stump up £700,000 for the event. Instead, war veterans are footing the bill to unveil it and will be personally liable for the cost of staging the event if they fail to raise the money through donations. The opening of the memorial is a long-awaited event and there is a waiting list for veterans who want to be there on the special day. Mr Hammond's attendance at the event means that one seat will be denied to them. The Bomber Command Association has spent five years raising £6.5million to build the new memorial. They . still have to find £700,000 to provide seating and security for the . event on Thursday, which will be attended by ten members of the Royal . Family including the Queen. Fundraising . director of the memorial, Jim Dooley, told the Daily Express: 'Anyone . with a measure of empathy will understand how the very elderly are . anxious when faced with financial worries. 'We are the organisers of what has become all but a state occasion in the glare of international publicity.' He . added: 'I find it hypocritical that a Secretary of State for Defence . can turn up on Thursday representing the Prime Minister knowing a . veteran trustee has his house on the line to pay for his seat.' The monument, in London's Green Park, will commemorate the 55,573 Bomber Command airmen who died in the Second World War. It . has already proved controversial after it emerged that more than 100 . veterans could miss out on the unveiling because of a lack of space. Extraordinary: Workmen put the finishing touches to the Bomber Command Memorial on Hyde Park Corner, which will be unveiled tomorrow . Tribute: At the heart of the memorial will be the statues of a seven-man bomber crew cast in bronze . Earlier . this month, David Cameron gave the trustees hope when he told MPs the . Government had 'the ability to intervene' if funds were not raised in . time. But now the trustees, who include four Bomber Command veterans, have been told the Ministry of Defence will not help. Mr Hammond said: 'The MoD recognises the unique contribution and sacrifice that the men of Bomber Command made to protect Britain.' Only as recently as last week, Mr Dooley said the veterans were still £500,000 short. 'The . MoD response to this has been disgusting,' he said. 'The unveiling has . become a state occasion, yet we are getting no help from the state.' Trustee . and veteran Harry Irons, 88, from Romford, Essex, said: 'If we can't . get the £500,000 I will probably lose my house. I haven't got much . else.' Sculptor Philip Jackson puts the finishing touches to the statue 'Bomb Aimer' before a mould is made of it . A mould was taken of the figures before they were cast in bronze and put on Portland stone plinths at Green Park . The memorial was . built with private donations, but the bill for its unveiling has risen . because the 6,500 widows and veterans face security checks before they . can enter Green Park. Sculptor Philip Jackson created the . 9ft statues that will form the centrepiece of the memorial in Green . Park, close to Buckingham Palace. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport said it would 'make a contribution' but would not say how much. The . MoD said it was not allowed to give to charities, despite records . showing it has donated to 28 charitable bodies in the past five years. A Government spokesman said: 'The Government does not usually support opening ceremonies for public memorials. 'However, given the unique circumstances of the Bomber Command Memorial, an exception has been made in this case. Sacrifice: 53,573 members of Bomber Command were killed during the Second World War . Fundraiser Jim Dooley branded Mr Hammond a hypocrite saying trustees had put their houses on the line to pay for their seat . 'The . Government will make a contribution towards the opening ceremony to . help cover the additional costs of seating and security for the many . veterans wishing to see the unveiling of this important memorial. 'This . is in addition to £1million that the Government has already contributed . towards the VAT costs of the construction of the memorial.' Andrew . Robathan, Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans, said: . 'The MoD has worked very closely with the excellent people of the Bomber . Command Association to ensure a successful unveiling of the memorial. 'We . are delighted that a significant number of RAF personnel will be . involved in the event, providing a flypast by five Tornado aircraft and a .

The astronomical fee eclipses the $88million forked out by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev on a penthouse for his daughter last winter at 15 Central Park West.

In exchange for the astronomical price the mystery buyer will get a 10,923-square-foot space opposite Carnegie Hall with incredible views over the city. While Extell Development Company has not revealed exactly how much the plush living space has fetched they have said the figure is between $90 - $100million. The high sum is thought to be due to uncertainty abroad, which has led foreign investors taking a greater interest in New York real estate. Situated on 157 West 57th street the tower will become the tallest residential building in the city when it is finished next year. The New York Post has reported that some potential buyers have claimed there are 'design flaws' with the construction - namely that builders failed to provide a sufficient number of elevators. But new owner of the high-rise apartment who according to Extell chairman Gary Barnett is from a 'nice family' clearly didn't share the same concerns. The new 1,000ft building will offer stunning vistas but the enormous structure will block the view from other nearby luxury buildings, which are expected to see their prices fall. Foreign buyers, including Brazilians, Chinese and Russians, have been on keeping New York and Miami real estate sellers busy in recent months, developers and brokers say. Russian and Ukrainian buyers have shown a particular willingness to pay large sums for 'trophy' properties. However, Mr Barnett insisted the person who had purchased the penthouse apartment was not from Russia or the Ukraine. The $100million mark for an apartment in New York has yet to be surpassed but earlier this year Mr Barnett said a foreign investor was 'very seriously looking' at the Winter Garden unit - a duplex featuring a solarium totaling 13,500ft. The buyer was looking at buying  that apartment and another floor to create a 20,000 square feet space for a price of between $100 and $150 million, Mr. Barnett said.

A killer who murdered a woman by dousing her in white spirit and setting her alight has been told he must serve at least 27 years behind bars. Terrence Armer, 61, was sentenced for the killing of Stacey Mackie, who suffered 95 per cent burns in the attack at her flat in Kendal, Cumbria. A jury took less than two hours to convict Armer of murder after rejecting his claims that he loved Miss Mackie 'like a daughter' and had done nothing to hurt her. Scroll down for video . 'Great suffering': Stacey Mackie, right, was doused in white spirit and set alight by Terrence Armer, left . The trial at Carlisle Crown Court heard that Armer decided to kill Miss Mackie after she spurned his advances and ended their friendship. CCTV footage showed Armer using an axe and a screwdriver to break into Miss Mackie's flat shortly after midnight on January 27, the court was told. Once inside, he covered in the flammable liquid and set her alight. The jury heard that she told a police officer who found her: 'I know I am going to die.' Miss Mackie was taken to the Royal Lancaster Infirmary and later transferred to Wythenshawe Hospital, Manchester, where she died. The trial judge, Mr Justice Irwin, said Armer had been convicted on ‘overwhelming evidence’ of a ‘truly terrible act’. He said it was clear that Armer felt he had ‘rights’ over his victim and that he had ‘wanted more than friendship’ from her. Planned killing: CCTV footage issued by Cumbria Police shows Armer sneaking into the corridor outside his victim's flat . Breaking in: Armer set Miss Mackie alight after using an axe and a screwdriver to get into her flat . After she ended their friendship Armer, of Kendal, Cumbria, had formed ‘the dreadful intention’ to kill her in a way that he knew would cause her great suffering, the judge added. The trial heard that the pair had met last winter while they were both being treated in hospital for mental health issues. When he was interviewed by police, Armer denied attacking Miss Mackie. He said she had been rolling a cigarette while he left her to go to the toilet and was already alight when he came out. The judge praised the dignity of Miss Mackie’s family, who were present at court throughout the trial. He said he hoped they would eventually realise that Armer was ‘rare in his wickedness’ and that ‘not all people’ are like him. The police officer who led the investigation, Detective Chief Inspector Mike Forrester, said after the sentencing hearing: 'Armer inflicted an horrific attack on an innocent young woman and, today, we have seen justice served. 'Stacey’s family have been left devastated and our thoughts continue to be with them. Murder scene: Stacey Mackie was set alight in her flat in Kendal, Cumbria, on January 27. She died in hospital . 'Armer has shown no remorse and has consistently lied throughout his police interviews and his trial in court - despite the compelling evidence against him. 'His decision to plead not guilty meant that Stacey’s family had to go through the ordeal of a full trial where they had to relive the cruelty that led to her death. 'I hope that today’s result will help them as they try to rebuild their lives. 'I know that this case will also have a lasting effect on the police officers who went to the scene that night. 'I want to thank each and every one of them for the compassion and comfort they showed Stacey, and the commitment they have shown since to help secure this conviction. 'Fortunately, murders are exceptionally rare in Cumbria but this case demonstrates how dedicated Cumbria Constabulary and the Crown Prosecution Service are to getting justice and putting dangerous offenders behind bars.' Peter Kelly, of the Crown Prosecution . Service, said: 'This was a terrible, shocking murder which has left . Stacey’s family and friends devastated. 'We . may never know exactly what prompted him to go round to Stacey’s flat . that night or exactly what happened in the flat in those few minutes . after he arrived. 'Dreadful': The trial at Carlisle Crown Court (pictured) heard that Miss Mackie suffered 95 per cent burns . 'What we do know is that he carried out a premeditated murder by deliberately pouring white spirit over her and setting fire to her. 'Through piecing together all the strands of evidence gathered by the police we have been able to prove to the jury that this is the only explanation for what happened and that he is therefore guilty of murder. 'It is difficult to imagine a more calculating and distressing crime and during the trial Stacey’s family have had to relive the harrowing circumstances of what happened. 'Despite all the overwhelming evidence against him Terrence Armer claimed the fire had nothing to do with him and protested his innocence throughout this trial. 'He made no attempt to call the emergency services on that night and has shown no remorse since. 'However, the jury have seen through his lies and brought him to justice today. 'I hope his conviction for murder will bring Stacey’s family some measure of justice and I extend my sincerest sympathies to them.' The judge ruled Armer should serve at least 27 years in prison before being considered for parole - something the court heard was likely to be ‘academic’ in view of his age and poor state of health.

The young Prince of Wales gave the beautiful token of his affection to Freda Dudley Ward some years after he had a passionate affair with the married socialite in 1918. The pair had romantically met in a doorway in London’s Mayfair as they sheltered from a Zeppelin raid during the First World War. Intricate: This watch hidden inside a gold coin which King Edward VIII gave to his first mistress Freda Dudley is expected to fetch at least £15,000 when it is auctioned in London next week . Artistic: The beautiful front and back of the coin watch. Edward had met Freda Dudley-Ward in doorway as they sheltered from a bombing raid . Beautiful: Prince Edward was presented with the wafer-thin watch created inside the 1902 £5 gold coin when he opened the Scottish Motor Exhibition in 1927 . The Prince of Wales broke off the relationship in 1934 when Wallis Simpson came into his life - the relationship which sparked the dramatic abdication crisis. Prince Edward was presented with the wafer-thin watch, created inside the 1902 £5 gold coin, when he opened the Scottish Motor Exhibition in 1927 and had it engraved with the initials ‘F’ and ‘D’, for his pet name David, and presented it to his secret lover. Auctioneer James Grinter said: 'This watch is a unique piece of Royal history linked to the man who became the Duke of Windsor and we are expecting a lot of interest from collectors around the world.' Lovers: King Edward VIII, left, with his mistress Freda and her husband Liberal MP William Dudley-Ward . The watch is due to go under the . hammer a week tomorrow at Colchester auctioneers Reeman Dansie’s sale of . Royal memorabilia which includes items from the Queen, Princess Diana, . the Queen Mother, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and other monarchs. It is estimated to reach between £10,000 and £15,000. Mr . Grinter said: 'The watch has a beautifully-made, extremely thin . 18-jewel movement by Stablis of Switzerland so it can actually be closed . on a hinge inside the £5 coin. 'The . Prince was obviously impressed by the concept because he later bought a . very similar £5 gold coin watch from Cartier for Wallis Simpson and . that sold two years ago at Sotheby’s for £27,500.'

She had already been married for five years and had two daughters by a husband 16 years her senior, but that didn’t stop the Prince bombarding her with extravagant gifts - including the watch. Next week’s Royal sale also includes a rare dinner menu from the Canadian steamship RMS Lady Somers signed by the Duke of Windsor and Wallis Simpson as they sailed to the Bahamas in August 1940, where the Duke was due to take up his post as Governor.

A Powerball ticket sold at a Cedar Rapids grocery store this week is worth $241 million, but whoever bought it has yet to claim the jackpot, Iowa officials said today. The ticket, the state's biggest lottery winner to date, was sold at a Hy-Vee on Edgewood Road in Cedar Rapids. Store Director Jamie Franck was presented Thursday with the $10,000 bonus check the store receives for selling the winning ticket. 'I'm just hoping it was one of those customers that come in every single day or every single week making their purchases just thinking maybe today's the day,' Franck said at a lottery news conference. Location: The ticket, the state's biggest lottery winner to date, was sold at a Hy-Vee on Edgewood Road in Cedar Rapids, Iowa . 'And this might be their lucky day that they get to find out that they're a multimillionaire.' Franck said the store's bonus will go toward its bottom line and, because Hy-Vee is an employee-owned company, employees also will see some of it in their own bonus checks. The lottery terminal that printed the winning ticket had sold 692 plays for Wednesday night's drawing, said lottery spokeswoman Mary Neubauer. The winning ticket - matching the numbers of 7, 10, 14, 33 and 57, plus the Powerball number of 18 - beats the odds of 175 million to one to win, she said. It is the seventh ticket sold in Iowa to win the Powerball jackpot. Until this week, the most recent was a Fort Dodge couple who claimed a $200.8 million jackpot in October 2006. Iowa Lottery Chief Executive Officer Terry Rich said lottery officials encourage jackpot winners to consult financial or legal advisers before claiming such a big prize, and he pointed out that the identity of winners is public information. Is it you?: The Iowa Lottery website puts out an appeal for the winner to come forward . 'This truly is a life-changing amount of money and we want our winners to have the information they'll need as they make their decisions,' he said in the statement. 'Whoever has the winning ticket should sign it immediately if they haven't already done so for safe keeping.' Rich also said the winner should keep the ticket in a secure place until presenting it to claim the jackpot. If the ticket holder chooses to take a lump sum payout, the total will be $160.3 million before taxes. After taxes, a little more than $112 million. If the winner chooses an annuity option, payments over 30 years will total $241 million before taxes.

The wife of George Zimmerman, who is currently imprisoned for murder charges relating to the death of Trayvon Martin in February, is now on the wrong side of the law herself. Shellie Zimmerman was arrested today in Seminole County, Florida, on charges that she committed perjury during her husband's bond hearing. An order issued Tuesday by assistant state attorney John Guy charged her with knowingly making false statements during the April hearing. Husband and wife: Shellie Zimmerman, left, was charged with lying during the bond hearing of her husband George, right . George Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder in the shooting. He was granted $150,000 bond at that hearing and released. The Orlando Sentinel reported . that prosecutors alerted Judge Kenneth Lester that Mrs Zimmerman had . lied about contributions to her husband's legal defence to hide about . $135,000. Lester, in a strongly worded ruling, said the Zimmermans lied about how much money they had. An arrest affidavit for Shellie Zimmerman obtained by the Associated Press said that records show in April she transferred more than $85,500 from her bank account into her husband's account. Revoked: George Zimmerman testifies from the stand during a bond hearing on second degree murder charges at the Seminole County Courthouse in Sanford, Florida in this file photo taken April 20, 2012 . The affidavit also indicated that records of Zimmerman's calls from jail showed that George Zimmerman instructed his wife to 'pay off all the bills,' including a Sam's Club card and American Express. A state attorney investigator met with credit union officials and learned that she had transfer control of his account. Zimmerman's attorney Mark O'Mara has said the Zimmermans were confused and fearful when they misled court officials about how much money they had. Shellie Zimmerman, a nursing student, was ordered held on $1,000 bond. Sources told the Sentinel that she was working to post her bond. In Florida, perjury is punishable by up to five years in jail. Victim: Trayvon Martin, 17, was unarmed when he was shot by Zimmerman, who claims he acted in self-defence . George Zimmerman, of Sanford, has been behind bars since Judge Lester revoked his bond earlier this month. He came out of hiding when he returned to the John E. Polk Correctional Facility on June 3. To pass the time, it appears he's also writing postcards to loved ones, having requested several different varieties. He also requested a writing pad, pens, pencils and four erasers. He purchased two 'Missing You,' two 'Thinking of You,' and two 'With Love,' cards from the jail. Surrender: George Zimmerman was ordered back to the John E. Polk Correctional Facility after his bond was revoked by a Florida judge in Sanford, Florida, on June 3 . Political statement: Hoodies have become symbols of racial profiling and discrimination, protestors say, after Trayvon Martin was shot and killed while wearing one . The former neighbourhood watch captain claims he was acting in self-defence when he shot Trayvon Martin on February 26. On that night, Zimmerman spotted Martin, and called 911 to report that the hoodie-clad teen 'looked suspicious.' The 911 operator urged Zimmerman not to follow Martin and to stay in his truck, but Zimmerman, for unknown reasons, got out. He claimed that he lost track of Martin and was returning to his car when he was 'sucker-punched' by the teen. Zimmerman said he shot him, fearing that he was armed. But Martin, 17, was not armed. He was returning to his . father's girlfriend's house with an iced tea for himself and Skittles . for his little brother. Activism: Lawyer Benjamin Crump, centre, addresses the media with Tracy Martin, right, and Sabrina Fulton, left, the parents of Trayvon Martin, after they addressed lawmakers at a meeting on the 'Stand Your Ground' law in Longwood, Florida .

A mother has told of her utter disbelief at . hearing how her son’s drunk friend left him to drown in a sinking . car and telling police there was no-one inside. The family of John Quinnin listened . in horror as they heard for the first time in court how Anthony Grant . callously allowed his friend to die. Grant had got drunk and then driven at speeds of over 80mph with John in the passenger seat. He lost control and crashed, the car tumbling into a marsh. Tragic: 22-year-old John Quinnin, pictured, died after his drunk friend Anthony Grant lost control of his car at speeds exceeding 80mph . Rescuers pulled screaming Grant from the sinking vehicle. But when asked if there was anyone else in the car, he calmly told police he was on his own. At Edinburgh's High Court, Grant today admitted causing death by dangerous driving and being over the drink drive limit. He was remanded into custody until he is sentenced next month. As Grant faces jail, John’s mum Tracey revealed her agony . and fury after learning how the killer motorist abandoned her son. She said: 'We were lost for words. You can’t describe how we felt at that moment. We feel anger and every . other emotion you can imagine' It was almost 12 months ago . that 22-year-old John, of Annitsford, North Tyneside, had gone to . Scotland on holiday with two friends - including Grant, 21, of Newcastle . upon Tyne. All three were staying at a caravan . park in Gatehouse of Fleet and went to the bar on the evening of June 8. John had just received the good news that he had landed a dream job at the Nissan factory in nearby Sunderland. The boys bought five bottles of wine and drank four before taking the . last back to the caravan. Then John joined Grant in his Vauxhall Vectra - a vehicle Grant owned despite having no driving licence. Grant was speeding along the A75 . Gretna to Stranraer road at over 80mph when he clipped the kerb on a . tight bend near Kirkcowan in Wigtownshire. Careering out of control, the car hit . a hazard marker post and trees before smashing into a telegraph pole . and rolling down an embankment, eventually landing on its roof in a . marsh. Rescuers pulled Grant free and it was . then he told them he was alone in the vehicle, even though John had . been sat beside him, and was in a much worse condition having suffered a . serious chest injury. John’s parents Patrick, 51, and . Tracey, 42, travelled to Edinburgh for the case in the High Court and . listened in horror as the grim details of their son’s death emerged. Tracey said: 'I got so choked up. We only found out in court. It’s just beyond belief. Rescuers saved Grant, pictured outside court, from his sinking vehicle, he then told them he was alone in the car even though John had been sat beside him . 'We couldn’t do anything. We were in . court and weren’t allowed to say anything. We knew he hadn’t shown any . remorse or tried to make any contact with Patrick and me, or send us . anything, but what kind of a friend is that? 'He was supposed to be John’s friend - . he wasn’t one we knew or had met but we thought they were friends. So . how could he have said that he was the only one in the car? We don’t . understand it. 'We actually felt quite sorry for him . for a while - that’s the worst part. We also wonder what might have . happened if rescuers had got to John earlier. 'I think the damage was too great, so I don’t think he could have survived, but it’s something we’ll question.' The court heard how the first . witnesses on the scene heard Grant screaming and shouting he was . drowning, so one man contacted the emergency services and another made . his way down the embankment. When the emergency services arrived at the scene they believed there was only one person in the vehicle. Advocate depute Iain McSporran told . the court: 'Police officers saw a bare arm submerged in water which they . believed to be the accused’s arm. The accused was struggling to keep . his head above water.' A paramedic smashed the driver’s window with a torch and cut the seatbelt to free Grant from the wreckage. It was only once he had been released . that rescuers realised there was someone else in the car as they could . still see an arm of the person who was submerged. When they finally pulled John free he had no pulse and he died as a result of the chest injury. The court head that Grant has previous convictions . for drink driving, driving without a licence and insurance and taking a . vehicle without consent that stretch back to a juvenile court appearance . in 2004. Tracey said: 'Obviously it’s given us . peace of mind knowing he’s been remanded - I don’t know what I would . have done if they’d bailed him. 'Now we’ve just got to wait to see what he gets. Hopefully we will get some justice. 'It’s a slight relief for us that . he’s admitted it, and now we can try to get our life back. But his death . has affected every part of both of us. 'You can’t imagine what it’s like . . . we’re taking each day at a time but we can’t enjoy ourselves. It’s all too raw.' The pain of dealing with her grief . became all too much and the distraught mum, 42, attempted to take her . own life just three months ago. Both she and Patrick have been unable to work since their son’s death. Tracey was forced to give up her job as a senior carer, and she doesn’t know when she will be able to return. She said: 'I went back to work but I . couldn’t cope,' she said. 'I took an overdose and was in intensive care . for three days. I’m not proud of it but it’s all part and parcel of . life. 'But I’m still here and I’m pleased I’m here. It all got too much. 'I’m aware of what I’ve put my family . through but I just don’t want to care about anybody - I don’t want to . care for people. I just think why has all this happened?' John’s close friend Stephen Carter, 22, of North Shields, condemned Grant’s actions as 'disgraceful'. The Greggs bakery operative said: . 'He’s got to live with this for the rest of his life. No one will trust . him. No one wants to be his friend, it’s disgraceful. 'He must have known that John was in a . worse condition than him but he just thought about himself and got the . people to help him first.

Rubbish conman: Bert Mooney, 65, who drove round the country in a Jaguar collecting benefits in false names, arrives at Manchester Crown Court yesterday looking like a binman . He would then get behind the wheel of his Jaguar and drive between the locations collecting his giros before cashing them at the nearest post office. Mooney was eventually caught after a suspicious traffic warden noticed he had a London parking permit registered to a house in North Wales. The case was then passed to the Department for Work and pensions to investigate. He was due to be sentenced at Manchester Crown Court after admitting benefit fraud charges but his case was adjourned until Friday after a request from his defence to delay the case for medical reports. Defence council Mr Andrew Higginson had asked for an adjournment so the defendant's GP could send an up-to-date medical letter. But Judge Martin Rudland said that the case had gone on long enough and refused a long adjournment, saying he would sentence Mooney on Friday - with or without the report. He said: 'This is taking on facile proportions I have read his reports, what do we need a GP to say?' Bailed: Conman Bert Mooney leaves court in a taxi.

Mr Higginson replied: 'This case has a long and chequered history and a considerable number of adjournments, longer than usual adjournments. 'Mr Mooney has suffered from quite a considerable number of debilitating medical conditions, physical and mental.' He added that would like the court to pass sentence once a detailed and up-to-date medical report was received from his GP. Judge Rudland said: 'She can sit down with his notes today or tomorrow and write a one page letter for no later than Friday. 'This takes priority otherwise I sentence without. This has been a long and protracted affair.' He added to Mr Mooney: 'You are also a fraudster of considerable accomplishment. The case has been going on for over a year and it is vital that it is dealt with because it is in the public interest and in your interest.'

A Christian doctor yesterday claimed he was a victim of religious discrimination after being disciplined for discussing his faith with a suicidal patient. Richard Scott, 51, a former medical missionary, was reprimanded despite the 24-year-old complainant not even having to turn up to give evidence. Instead, he was allowed to give his version of events over the telephone and behind closed doors against the Cambridge-educated GP. Dr Richard Scott said he was 'disgusted' with the ruling and . said that if this was a matter regarding a Muslim or person living by spiritual practice Reiki, they would not be in his position . Dr Scott told a disciplinary panel he offered the troubled patient spiritual guidance after first checking that he did not mind. But the man’s mother complained ten days later about the consultation at his practice in Margate, Kent. She said her son was told he would . ‘suffer’ and be ‘haunted by the devil’ if he did not turn ‘towards . Jesus’ from his faith, which has not been revealed. Yesterday, the General Medical Council ruled against the married father-of-three in favour of the man known as Patient A. It imposed an official warning and . told the GP that any repetition could lead to tougher action, . potentially resulting in being struck off. The hearing was stayed last year . after Patient A refused to attend a disciplinary panel in Manchester. It . went ahead this week when he was allowed to testify by phone and in . secret. This was described by Dr Scott, who is . currently unable to work as he fights cancer, as an ‘outrageous’ denial . of a fair trial. He was supported by Andrea Williams, of the Christian . Legal Centre, which had backed his case. ‘Our society seems to be becoming more . repressive, with ordinary, decent people being disciplined just for . expressing their Christian beliefs,’ she said. Bethesda Medical Centre in Margate. Their website states that all six partners are Christians and believe in discussing faith as part of their work . Dr Scott added: ‘I’m yet another Christian being slammed for approaching their faith at work. ‘The panel has chosen to believe a . patient with massive and multiple problems against a doctor of 28 years’ standing.’ He declared: ‘I will continue to raise the issue of faith . where relevant because it’s for the patient’s benefit.’ Dr Scott pictured outside the GMC hearing in Manchester last year . The case started in August 2010 when . Patient A saw Dr Scott at Bethesda Medical Practice, which states that . all its doctors are practising Christians. The GP claimed he made a ‘gentle offer’ to broach the subject of faith and the man replied: ‘Go for it’. But the GP said the patient quickly ‘cut up rough’ and told him it was ‘a load of b******s’. Last night, the former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey said: ‘I’m extremely saddened by this ruling. ‘Many Christians will be asking whether they any longer have the freedom to express their faith. ‘I urge them to continue to do so in the manner of Dr Scott, with respect for others and compassion for all.’ Dr Peter Saunders, chief executive of the Christian Medical Fellowship, accused the GMC of succumbing to ‘militant secularism’. He added: ‘Good doctors do not treat . their patients solely as biological or biochemical machines but practise . “whole person” medicine.’ Last night, GMC chief executive Niall . Dickson said: ‘This is not about religion. It is about respecting . patients and making sure doctors do not use the incredibly privileged . position they hold to push their own beliefs.’ Other Christian medical staff have . also lost cases over their faith, including a nurse in a row over . wearing her crucifix on duty and a doctor stopped from advising on . adoption as she refused to endorse gay couples.",Dr Scott remains defiant saying GMC is discriminating against Christians.
"By . Nigel Lawson . PUBLISHED: . 19:19 EST, 19 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:20 EST, 19 May 2012 . Former Tory Chancellor: Lord Nigel Lawson . David Cameron has been calling on those of our European partners who have the misfortune to have the euro  to do what it takes to establish a ‘stable, successful eurozone’ – warning that otherwise ‘we are in uncharted territory which carries huge risks for everybody’. I fully understand why he felt obliged to say that. Even though, fortunately, the United Kingdom is not part of the eurozone, the issue is of such importance that he could scarcely remain silent. And had he spoken and not expressed the desire to see the eurozone ‘succeed’ he would have been held at least partially responsible for its failure. But it is, of course, complete nonsense. A successful eurozone is an impossibility. European Monetary Union, to give it its full name, was doomed from the start. The disaster which we see unfolding today, most acutely in Greece but increasingly elsewhere in the eurozone, too, was not only predictable but predicted. I first explained why it should not be embarked upon, and why it would be doomed to fail, when I was Chancellor in January 1989, and the proposal was about to be formally launched. I concluded in these terms: ‘It is clear that Economic and Monetary Union implies nothing less than European Government – albeit a federal one – and political union: the United States of Europe. That is not on the agenda now, nor will it be for the foreseeable future.’ And I elaborated on this before the misbegotten project became a reality in 1999. A monetary union, for its very existence, requires there to be automatic, not occasional and discretionary, transfers from the more successful to the less successful parts of the union, which in turn requires there to be, at the very least, a single system of taxation and benefits. There also needs to be a high degree of central control of budget deficits. In other words, a single finance minister at the head of a single finance ministry within a single government. 'Doomed': The European Central Bank in Frankfurt, Germany. Mr Lawson first spoke out against European Monetary Union in 1989 . Even then, it would not be economically beneficial within an area as large and diverse as the European Union. For political union needs to be buttressed by a high degree of labour mobility (and also wage flexibility, which the so-called European social model regards as barbaric). There is a high degree of labour mobility in the political and monetary union that is the United States – as there is, too, between England and Scotland within the United Kingdom. But linguistic and cultural differences mean that labour mobility within the eurozone is severely limited. So we have 25 per cent unemployment today in Spain (and an even more horrific 50 per cent youth unemployment), while unemployment in Germany is little more than five per cent. But of course it was never an economic venture in the first place. It was always entirely political. The architects of European monetary union knew full well that it could not work without full-blooded political union, and that was their objective from the start. It is hard to imagine anything more arrogant and irresponsible. It was arrogant, since, in a democracy, political union requires the consent of the people, which plainly does not exist. I live half the time in France, and the people of France are no more inclined to surrender self-government than are the people of Britain. And it was grossly irresponsible, since it was always clear that, should their gamble fail and political union prove unachievable, the consequences of monetary union alone would be as disastrous as we see unfolding today. Desperation: People queue up at a job centre in Madrid, Spain, where unemployment is at 25 per cent and 50 per cent for young people . So where do we go from here? The only rational course of action is for the member countries to recognise reality and embark on the dismantling of the eurozone, in as orderly way as possible, returning to separate national currencies. The exit of Greece from the eurozone, which is merely a matter of time, needs to be only the first step. In the short term, this will be unpleasant and costly. But the short-term cost will be as nothing compared with the continuing cost of an under-performing European economy, lurching from crisis to crisis until monetary union can be sustained no longer. The break-up of the European monetary union will not be the first time this has happened. For the most part, the ending of monetary union has followed the break-up of political union. Most recently this occurred with the split of Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and the break-up of the Soviet Union, when the newly independent republics changed from the rouble to currencies of their own. The greatest problem this time is likely to be the threat of a European banking meltdown. The banks are already in an enfeebled condition following the excesses that led to the crash of 2008; and the near-80 per cent write-down of Greek government debt is likely to be followed by further sovereign debt defaults. But this can be managed. Responsibility: David Cameron has found himself obliged to support measures to save the eurozone . The various Governments of Europe will have to stand behind some of their banks (although the terms on which they do so should be much tougher than has been the case hitherto), and the IMF will need to provide back-up where that is needed. But the cost of extrication from the economic doomsday machine that is the European monetary union, will be infinitely less than the cost of keeping the machine going and delaying the inevitable. Europe can prosper again, but only by throwing off the misbegotten shackles of the eurozone. Meanwhile, even if David Cameron had to say what he did say, there is one sensible and important thing that he can do. He can make it clear that there is no way in which he will ask  the British taxpayer to participate in the construction of firewalls, bail-outs, or any other devices designed to shore up a doomed monetary union. We cannot afford to do it. We are not members of it – although, as the Governor of the Bank of  England pointed out last week, we suffer significantly from the collateral damage it is causing. But above all, it is in no one’s interest – not ours, not Europe’s, not the world’s – to seek to sustain the unsustainable and prolong the great damage it is causing.",Former Tory Chancellor's astonishing attack .

He formed the British rock group Paris in 1976, and had hits including Sentimental Lady in 1977 and Ebony Eyes in 1978. Fleetwood Mac's Christine McVie and Lindsey Buckingham did backing vocals on Sentimental Lady. Fleetwood Mac's career took off in the mid-1970s after Welch left the band. Dreams was a No1 hit in 1977, and Don't Stop hit the top of the charts the same year. It later became the anthem for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign. Hold Me was a hit in 1982 and Little Lies in 1987. Welch, a native of Los Angeles, scored his biggest hit with Sentimental Lady, which reached No8 on the Billboard chart. His other singles included Precious Love in 1979 and Hot Love, Cold World in 1978. Welch fell out with his former bandmates after suing the group in 1994 for unpaid royalties, which led to his exclusion from the group's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 1998. 'It basically comes down to the fact that they don't like me anymore,' he told The Plain Dealer of Cleveland at the time. 'I guess they can do what they want. I could understand it if I had been a sideman for a year. But I was an integral part of that band... I put more of myself into that band than anything I've ever done.'

I am so very sorry for . his family and for the family of Fleetwood Mac - so, so sad.' As a songwriter, Welch had tracks recorded by Kenny Rogers, Sammy Hagar and the Pointer Sisters. In 1999 he released a CD, Bob Welch Looks at Bop, a salute to bebop music in the 1940s. Heyday: Welch, centre, was in the band between 1971 and 1974, and was a . guitarist and vocalist.

Dominique Strauss-Kahn faces gang rape charges following a prostitute's claims she was held down by the wrists and forced to have sex, it emerged today. The highly-paid vice girl said she was assaulted at Washington's W Hotel in December 2010, while Strauss-Kahn was still director of the International Monetary Fund. Marie Anne S. and another young escort working for a prostitute ring in France were apparently flown to the U.S. with three Frenchmen to take part in ‘sex parties’ with them and Strauss-Kahn. The Belgian prostitute claimed Strauss-Kahn tried to sodomise her, . adding: ‘I refused and told him no, I don’t want to. I made it clear . that I did not want to, several times out loud.’ Of another man in the group, the 25-year-old said: ‘He used force. He was holding my hand, he pulled my hair, he hurt me. I weigh 50 kilos, he’s heavier than me.’ The alleged ‘gang rape’ is set to form vital evidence in the 'Carlton Affair' - an investigation into a prostitute ring working out of the Carlton Hotel in Lille, eastern France. The judges working on the 'Carlton . Affair' were looking at claims of pimping, the misuse of corporate . assets, fraud and money-laundering, but have now asked prosecutors to widen their inquiry to gang rape, according to Liberation newspaper. The prosecutors delayed their decision ‘so as . not to disrupt the presidential election, Liberation reported. The paper said the four men under investigation for the . rape include Strauss-Kahn, who has already been charged with aggravated . pimping in relation to the Carlton Affair. Also under investigation are: Jean-Christophe Lagarde, a former police chief from Lille; David Roquet, head of a subsidiary of the Eiffage building giant;  and a businessman called Fabrice Paszkowski, who is said to have regularly exchanged SMS text messages with Strauss-Kahn. Another vice girl involved, identified as Aurelie D. confirmed that sexual acts took place at the party, saying of Marie-Anne S.: ‘I saw she did not like it. But I did not hear her say no. If she had shouted I would have heard her, and would have intervened.’ Both women were said to be posing as ‘secretaries for Eiffage’ and were paid 2,500 euros (£2,000) to go on the three-day trip. 'Pleading for help': The prostitute said she was held down and forced to have sex at Washington's W Hotel in December 2010 . Disgraced: The unemployed 63-year-old is living in Paris with his third wife, the journalist and art heiress Anne Sinclair . On December 16, the four men and two prostitutes retired to a suite at the W Hotel in Washington. Roquet is said to have held the . prostitute down by the wrists, while the other men are said to have . ignored Marie-Anne’s pleas for help. Aurelie D., 26, admits that Marie-Anne may have ‘said no’, but she [Aurelie D.] was ‘too busy’ having sex to hear. Strauss-Kahn, in turn, has told police that there was ‘no brutality’ involved in the orgy under investigation. Earlier this week, the 63-year-old was denied diplomatic immunity from being sued over an alleged attempted rape of a New York chamber maid in May 2011. Arrest: Dominique Strauss-Kahn was one of eight men, including a former Lille police commissioner, under investigation in connection with the illegal vice ring . Trial: Strauss-Kahn was this week denied diplomatic immunity from being sued over allegedly attempting to rape maid Nafissatou Diallo, 33, at Manhattan's Sofitel Hotel . In a ruling handed down in Bronx Supreme Court, Justice Douglas McKeon threw out a motion to have the civil case dismissed, raising the prospect of a New York trial. Strauss-Kahn is accused of attempting to rape hotel employee Nafissatou Diallo, 33, at Manhattan’s Sofitel Hotel. She claims that the married Frenchman ran at her naked, molested her and forced her to perform oral sex on him after she entered his suite to clean it. The claims led to a criminal investigation against Strauss-Kahn and his house arrest in New York, but charges were dropped after prosecutors said there were 'substantial credibility issues' with the alleged victim. At one stage, Strauss-Kahn was expected to be the Socialist candidate for the presidency of France this week, but the criminal allegations meant he had to give up his political ambitions. He is currently unemployed and living in Paris with his third wife, the journalist and art heiress Anne Sinclair.","The vice girl said she was held down by the wrists and forced to have sex .

Ex-soldier: Brian Witty, a former captain in the parachute regiment, was jailed for raping three women and sexually assaulting another . A former Army captain who poses ‘a very real danger to women’ was jailed indefinitely today for carrying out a string of horrific sex attacks. Sex fiend Brian Witty, 41, told one of his victims: ‘I don’t believe this, I’m a good-looking bloke.’ Witty, previously a Captain in the Territorial Army Parachute Regiment, who carried out the attacks over a 15 year period between 1996 and 2011, even met two of his victims through an internet dating website and the others in bars. He was found guilty of three rapes and one sexual assault after jurors were told Witty - now working as a City banker - thought he was ‘untouchable’. Judge Nicholas Price QC passed an indeterminate sentence for public protection and ordered the former officer spend at least eight years behind bars. He will only be released when the parole board considers he no longer poses a risk. Sentencing Witty at Kingston Crown Court, Judge Price told him he was a ‘demanding, frightening and determined rapist’ who hid behind his military background to lure women into a ‘false sense of security.’ Witty was arrested after each of the first three attacks, but it was not until the final attack - in which he raped a 42-year-old woman after meeting her through the website DatingDirect.com - that he was finally charged. Judge Price said: ‘There is no doubt in my mind that you pose a very real danger to women and the only appropriate sentence is one of imprisonment for public protection. ‘It is clear to me that you set out and prayed on vulnerable women. You hid your base intent behind the veneer of charm and lulled each victim into a false sense of security. ‘Each of them was beguiled into believing that with your military background and apparent social attributes that you were a gentleman and would behave as one. Smile of a predator: This photo was used by Brian Witty on his dating website profile . Shame of a disgraced rapist: Another picture Witty used online to attract women . ‘Each of them described, in chilling evidence, your change from plausible and caring into a bullying, self-obsessed, arrogant sexual predator who was determined to indulge in fulfilling your sexual desires irrespective and dismissive of their pleas that you should desist.’ The fact that no action was taken after the first three complaints, he said, led him to feel as though he was ‘untouchable’ by the authorities. He went on: ‘With the benefit of hindsight, it is perhaps too easy to say that had you been successfully prosecuted in 1995, you may well not have been free to commit these other, later, serious offences.’ ‘It is to the benefits of justice’, he said, ‘that each of your three earlier victims did have the courage to not only make their original complaints but to come before the court so many years later and tell the jury what you had done to them and to relive the traumatic experience.’ The victim impact statements, he said, ‘speaks in harrowing terms of the long-term consequences of your actions on them...it is clear that what you did to each of them has changed their lives immeasurably. ‘It has resulted in distrust, if not fear, of other relationships. It has had adverse consequences on their work and social lives. ‘If anyone ever doubted the devastating long-term consequences of rape or sexual assault, these statements provide eloquent testimony against such doubts. You actions changed forever their lives and the lives of their close family and friends.’ The fact that no initial action was taken ‘led inevitably to feelings of loss of self-worth and despair that they had not been believed’, he said, adding: ‘Justice has been for too long delayed.’ Witty met his first victim, a nanny, in a pub in Fulham in 1995, and when she tried to fight him off at his Kensington flat he told her: ‘I don’t believe this, I’m a good-looking bloke’, before raping her. A second victim, a 25-year-old recruitment consultant who Witty contacted through DatingDirect.com in May 2006, met him for drinks in Covent Garden. At the end of the evening he ‘forcefully dragged’ her into a doorway and sexually assaulted her, telling her afterwards: ‘You’re lucky, I don’t usually do that.’ City watering hole: Abacus, a bar on Cornhill, next to the Royal Exchange in the Square Mile, where Witty claimed to have made eye contact with an alleged victim as she ate chicken 'suggestively' He met the third woman in a City bar in October 2008 where he claimed she was ‘suggestively’ eating a chicken skewer. They met up for drinks three days later in Richmond before heading back to his riverside flat where he raped her. Witty’s fourth victim also met him through DatingDirect.com and went back to his flat after a few drinks in Teddington, where he raped her. Father-of-two Witty, of Twickenham, was given a sentence of six years for the first rape in 1995 to run concurrently with three indeterminate sentence for the two other rapes and sexual assault.

"By . Graham Smith and Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 08:34 EST, 5 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:29 EST, 5 July 2012 . Economic output has barely grown for a year and a half, credit conditions are tight and the eurozone crisis remains a major problem, the Bank of England said yesterday. In a bleak analysis, the Bank’s governor, Sir Mervyn King, said Britain is not even ‘halfway through’ its economic crisis – suggesting it will not end until at least 2017. The warning came as the Bank hit the panic button, kicking off another round of money printing in an attempt to revive the economy. It increased its controversial quantitative easing (QE) programme by £50billion, raising the total to £375billion as it warned that the economy’s problems are likely to be ‘greater and more persistent’. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee has voted to increase the quantitative easing programme - effectively printing more cash - from £325bn to £375bn . The amount printed is £14,000 for every family in Britain, or more than half the Government’s spending, but experts say further quantitative easing is possible. Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ‘It won’t be the end of the story. We could see another £50billion within a few months.’ Yesterday the Federation of Small Businesses raised its concerns about whether the policy is actually working. Chairman John Walker said: ‘The point is to get more money to businesses so they can invest and grow. But it is clear this money is not getting through.’ The Bank said it will keep the base interest rate frozen at 0.5 per cent. It has been at this historic low since March 2009. The QE boost comes amid signs the economy deteriorated in June as industry surveys showed that the construction sector went into reverse and the powerhouse services sector suffered its worst performance for eight months. Most economists think gross domestic product - a broad measure for the total economy - fell slightly in the second quarter of 2012, following declines of 0.4 per cent and 0.3 per cent in the previous two quarters, as the eurozone debt crisis gathers pace. The move has drawn criticism from pensioners’ groups, who have blamed the adverse effect of money-printing for a 'meltdown' in annuity rates in recent years. Saga . director-general Ros Altmann criticised the policy for keeping . inflation higher than it would have otherwise been, making it even . harder for people to find any accounts to give them a real return on . their savings. On top of this, QE has made more than a million pensioners worse . off, which has damaged growth rather than encouraged it as people have . less money to spend, she said. Q: What is quantitative easing? A: Simply put, quantitative easing, or QE, is an emergency measure used by policymakers to boost economic growth. This is something the Bank of England would usually try to achieve by slashing interest rates to encourage people to spend rather than save. But when rates cannot go any lower - as is nearly the case in Britain, where they are at a record low of 0.5 per cent - the Bank will pump cash directly into the economy to encourage lending and activity. This is QE. Q: Hasn’t the Bank done this before? A: Yes, the Bank started to inject more money into the economy in March 2009 followed by further bouts in October 2011 and February. Before this latest decision, the level of QE issued by the Bank stood at £325billion. Q: So why has the Bank increased QE again? A: Banks are worried about the strength of their finances and since the onset of the credit crunch have tightened up lending dramatically.The escalating eurozone debt crisis has also raised fears over banks’ exposure to sovereign debt and the impact on British exports. In addition, the UK’s economy is struggling to pull out of a double dip recession. As rates have been held at 0.5% for more than three years, the Bank is left with few options. Q: Isn’t QE just printing money? A: In effect it is, although the Bank does not literally turn on the printing presses to send a huge flurry of new notes into the economy. What will happen is that the Bank will create the money to buy the assets and credit the reserves of various banks and financial institutions with the new money. Economists call this 'high-powered' money because the increase in their reserves should - in theory - allow the banks to go out and lend much more under the 'money multiplier' principle. Q: What else can QE do? A: All things being equal, as well as creating more money, the Bank’s actions should create more liquidity in commercial paper, helping to get capital markets moving more easily again. On a technical level, if the Bank buys up Government bonds from banks, the cost of the bonds will go up and their yield - or return - will go down. This fall in the yield will help lower long-term interest rates. Q: So now banks should go out and lend more money? A: This is the $64,000 question. In principle, QE should boost the money supply, but fears of debt contagion from Europe and major changes to regulation in the UK still mean banks are being cautious with their balance sheets. She . questioned whether the 'experiment' is actually having the desired . effect, in the light of a double dip recession, falling bank lending, . rising borrowing costs and a tough employment market. Dr . Altmann said: 'Following fresh banking scandals this week, it is . especially difficult to understand why we are doing more easing, which . benefits the banks more than any other area of the economy. 'QE . may well have shored up bank balance sheets, as well as helping some . borrowers, but this does not boost the economy when banks are failing to . lend on reasonable terms. 'QE relies on banks to recycle new money to the rest of the economy but the banks are not doing their bit. 'Lending . to small and medium-sized firms who have been crying out for credit has . not come through on reasonable terms, while banks have boosted their . margins and balance sheets instead.' But business leaders said further stimulus would support confidence and welcomed the decision. Dr Neil Bentley, CBI deputy director-general, said: 'This extension of QE should provide a fillip to confidence.' The Bank’s action also hit the value of the pound against the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen as the market will be effectively be flooded with extra sterling. The Bank said the decision to pump more money into the economy came as UK output had barely grown for a year and a half amid signs its main export markets are slowing. It said: 'Business indicators point to a continuation of that weakness in the near term, both at home and abroad.' The bank added: 'Concerns remain about the indebtedness and competitiveness of several euro-area economies, and that is weighing on confidence here.' However, it said inflation, which fell to 2.8 per cent in May, should continue to ease in the medium-term and its stimulus measures should help sustain a gradual strengthening in output. James Knightley, economist at ING Bank, said: 'We continue to have doubts over how successful extra QE will be, but seeing as the BoE has few other options we expect them to stick with it.' The increase in QE will come as a blow for pensioners whose annuity rates are hit by the money printing, while the continued low interest rates will hurt savers. Recent research from accountancy network UHY Hacker and Young found that record low interest rates combined with the Bank’s emergency support measures are causing savers to lose nearly £18billion a year. Bank governor Sir Mervyn King recently said he was shocked at the pace at which economic conditions had worsened as he unveiled the biannual Financial Stability report. The gloomy industry figures for June revealed a further loss of momentum, leading most economists to predict a slight decline in GDP in the second quarter. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee had already come close to pushing the button on more QE. Minutes of the June rates meeting showed four of the nine-strong committee - including Sir Mervyn - were narrowly out-voted. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said there might still be more money printing to come, even though he thinks the economy will return to growth in the third quarter of this year. He said: 'We certainly would not rule out further QE in the fourth quarter. 'The economy is likely to remain fragile and prone to relapses, especially if there is not any sustained marked easing in the eurozone’s problems. 'So it is very possible that the Bank of England will decide that more support is warranted for the economy, particularly if inflation heads down further.' Some economists think the Bank’s QE programme could eventually be expanded to £500billion.","Bank votes to increase quantitative easing programme - effectively printing more cash - from £325bn to £375bn .

Concerns have been raised that Egypt could descend into an Algerian-style civil war after thousands of people took to the . streets to protest at the delayed result of the country's first . free presidential election. Officials were supposed to declare a winner in Egypt's disputed election today. However, the President Election Commission said it needed more time to review complaints by the candidates. But critics of the ruling military fear the Muslim Brotherhood - who most independent observers believe won the election - is being targeted by Egypt's generals to keep it out of the presidency. Anger: Thousands of people have taken to Tahrir Square in Cairo to protest at the delayed result of the country's first free presidential election which has sparked fears of an army coup . Fury: Critics of the ruling military say the Muslim Brotherhood - who most independent observers believe won the election - is being targeted by Egypt's generals to keep it out of the presidency . The delay has sent political tensions soaring as the country awaits its first new president in three decades and sparked fears of a military coup. Some observers have noted the similarity with Algeria 20 years ago when a . military-backed government blocked another Islamist group's ascent to . power through the ballot box. It led to the deaths of more than 150,000 Algerians during the 1990s. But Saad al-Katatni, speaker of the short-lived democratic parliament dissolved by the ruling military council last week, said: 'What happened in Algeria cannot be repeated in Egypt. 'The Egyptian people are different and not armed,' the . 61-year-old microbiologist said. 'We are fighting a legal struggle via the establishment and a popular . struggle in the streets. Protest: Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood supporters chant slogans and one carries a poster with a picture of presidential candidate, Mohammed Morsi and Arabic that reads 'Mohammed Morsi, president for Egypt, revival is the will of the people' 'This is the ceiling. I see the . continuation of the struggle in this way.' He demanded the army recognize democracy but also offered conciliatory . words: 'Everyone must submit to popular will.' Last weekend's runoff election was long touted as a landmark moment - the choice of Egypt's first civilian president to take over from the generals who have ruled since Hosni Mubarak's removal on February 11, 2011. The Algerian Civil War was a bloody conflict throughout the 1990's which is estimated to have cost more than 150,000 lives. Many observers believe its beginnings were similar to the current . situation in Egypt between the Muslim Brotherhood and the military . rulers. It began in 1991 when the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) party became popular among the people of Algeria. This resulted in the National Liberation Front cancelling elections after the first round because it feared the FIS would win. The president Chadli Bendjedid was forced from office and Algeria's military took control of the government. This led to the FIS being banned and thousands of its members were arrested. As a result Islamist guerrillas started an armed campaign against the government. The conflict ended with the surrender of the Islamist Salvation Army and the defeat in 2002 of the Armed Islamic Group. In total more than 70 journalists were assassinated during the conflict. Instead, it has turned into a confrontation between the Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood and the entrenched elements of Mubarak's old regime - including the military. Thousands of Muslim Brotherhood supporters camped out last night in Cairo's Tahrir Square - the birthplace of last year's uprising. They were protesting against the . delayed election result and also  denouncing new amendments to the . constitution which gave The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) new powers last week. The . Election Commission did not say when it would announce the winner of . the runoff between the Muslim Brotherhood's candidate, Mohammed Morsi, . and Mubarak's former prime minister, Ahmed Shafiq. Both candidates claim they won, and the commission was supposed to declare the top vote-getter today. But . its secretary-general, Hatem Begato, told the state newspaper Al-Ahram . that the winner would be announced on Saturday or Sunday. Adding to the confusion and . uncertainty were reports about the health of Hosni Mubarak, who is . serving a life sentence for failing to stop the killing of protesters in . the uprising that ousted him last year. At . one point on Tuesday, he was said to be near death, while some believed . the report was a pretext by sympathetic allies of Mubarak to transfer . him out of prison to a more comfortable facility. The . commission said the announcement was postponed because a panel of . judges must look into about 400 complaints of voting fraud submitted by . both campaigns. The Brotherhood says it is being targeted by an organised campaign to keep it out of the presidency, and that even if Morsi is declared the victor, he will face deep resistance that will make it impossible for him to govern. After two days of voting that ended on Sunday, the group declared Morsi won 52 per cent of the vote. Shafiq's camp on Monday announced he had won 51.5 per cent of the vote. Not happy: People were protesting against the delayed election result and also denouncing new amendments to the constitution which gave The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) new powers last week . A group of independent jurists known as the Judges For Egypt said Morsi was the winner along with most newspapers. Foreign and local election monitors say the runoff was not marked by enough serious or large-scale irregularities to question its validity. In a series of swift moves last week, the generals cornered for themselves sweeping powers that effectively subordinate the next president and severely limit his capability for independent action. A court order dissolved parliament, which was led by the Brotherhood, and the military issued a constitutional declaration that makes the generals the nation's legislators and gives them control of the budget. They will dominate the security system after reshaping a key National Defense Council to keep it under their control. The generals will also oversee the process of writing Egypt's new constitution. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the U.S. expects the military to 'support the democratic transition, to recede by turning over authority.' Protesters are pictured sleeping during a sit-in at Tahrir Square last night . 'The military has to assume an appropriate role, which is not to try to interfere with, dominate or subvert the constitutional authority,' she said. Privately, U.S. officials have expressed concern that a Shafiq victory could have dangerous fallout, with protests and ensuing instability that could lead the military to take even stronger measures. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. While the Brotherhood and secular revolutionary groups have denounced the military's moves, some Egyptian liberals see the steps as a way to prevent an Islamist takeover by the 82-year-old Muslim Brotherhood, or ensure that its hold on power is difficult and temporary. 'I see the military council at this point as a protector of the identity of the state against the Brotherhood, who are not a purely Egyptian party, but an international one,' said Emad Gad, a member of the liberal Free Egyptians party. He cited celebrations in Gaza Strip ruled by the Palestinian Islamic Hamas, an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, when news broke of Morsi's victory claims. Anti-Islamist figures and others seen as backers of the military were escalating rhetoric against the Brotherhood on TV talk shows, accusing the group of seeking to set up a 'parallel state' or of forming armed militias. Others defended the military, saying the generals had to protect Egypt from destabilizing changes. Further raising the tone and sense of confusion, rumors circulated on social media sites and even some state-run media of tanks moving on the outskirts of Cairo, although the reports could not be confirmed. 'It is clear that there is sharp polarization between the army and the Muslim Brotherhood,' said Islamist Montasser el-Zayat, a prominent rights lawyer and activist. 'It suggests that the next few days will probably be difficult for Egypt and the Egyptians.' Uncertainty: Adding to the confusion were reports about the health of former Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak. At one point on Tuesday he was said to be near death . The Brotherhood has warned that a win by Shafiq, widely seen as an extension of the Mubarak regime, could only be the result of fraud and that it would send its supporters out onto the streets. Still, the deputy head of the Muslim Brotherhood, Khairat el-Shater, sought to defuse fears that the group would resort to violence if Shafiq is declared the winner, saying the Brotherhood will use peaceful means, 'not through violence or terrorism.' Shafiq's campaign sought to appeal to the international community, holding a news conference in English for foreign correspondents to send a message that it will accept 'whatever the outcome.' Basil el-Baz, an adviser to Shafiq, said the campaign was confident he was the winner. But he added, 'At the end of the day, candidate Shafiq is willing to accept the results regardless of the outcomes.' 'In the event that candidate Morsi is indeed successful and victorious in the elections, the first phone he will receive will be from candidate Shafiq,' el-Baz said. Adding to the electoral limbo has been the murkiness over the state of Mubarak's health. The 84-year-old former leader has been said to be in poor health since his ouster, even appearing at his trial in a hospital bed. On Tuesday, state media reported he had suffered a stroke and was put on life support. Security officials said Wednesday that he was in a coma but off life support and that his heart and other vital organs were functioning. Security officials said he had been moved from his prison where he has been kept since his June 2 conviction to a military hospital overlooking the Nile in Cairo - a transfer that could stir up anger among opponents of the regime. Mubarak's wife, Suzanne, was at his bedside in the hospital. The security officials said a team of 15 doctors, including heart, blood and brain specialists, was supervising his care. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. The conflicting reports raised suspicions among some of Mubarak's opponents that the rumors were intended to justify the move to hospital - something his lawyers have sought. 'There are attempts to spoil the political scene,' the Brotherhood's el-Shater said, citing 'a fierce campaign of black rumors all across the country.'","Officials were supposed to declare a winner in Egypt's disputed election today but election commission said it needs more time to review complaints .

"By . Amy Oliver . UPDATED: . 10:00 EST, 6 June 2012 . A 'sexually obsessed' stalker whose explicit texts and phone calls caused a mother six months of torment was the very police officer sent to help her, it has emerged. Dunstable-based Maria Snow, 49, waived her anonymity to speak of her horror at finding out PC Mark Wilkie was behind the daily calls to her mobile. Mrs Snow recalled how former Bedfordshire Police PC would breathe heavily into the phone and tell her how attractive she was to him. The terrifying calls started in August 2009 when Mrs Snow  was going through a difficult divorce from her husband. Six months of hell: Maria Snow, 49, was shocked to discover her phone stalker had been the very policeman called out to help her following an argument with her husband . The couple had been arguing so violently one day that Mrs Snow's son had called the police. PC Wilkie arrived soon after and as Mrs Snow  recalls, seemed very laid back about the ordeal. She told the Daily Mirror: 'He was making jokes, reassuring me that there was nothing to be embarrassed about. 'Once it was confirmed no one had been hurt or was in danger, he seemed very casual. 'At the time I didn’t think much of it, but after he left I thought it was a little bit odd,' she added. Six months later another row resulted in a second call out to police and PC Wilkie arrived once again. Abuse of power: Mark Wilkie, 51, a former officer with Bedfordshire Police had stalked Mrs Snow for six months after being called out over a domestic incident between her and her husband . As Mrs Snow's husband was taken to the police station her mobile displayed the first in a long line of explicit texts. It read: 'You look so gorgeous and sexy'. Thinking it was a mistake Mrs Snow  replied saying the caller must have the wrong number but, chillingly, they replied: 'No I haven't, Maria'. Ironically she called police who discovered the offending text had come from a pay-as-you-go number which the owner always topped up with cash making it impossible to trace. The calls and texts continued. 'It turned in to six months of texts and phone calls, every night and day. It was mental cruelty,' Mrs Snow said. Her suspicion fell on every man she knew, she said, from 'friends' husbands, to someone at the gym, to people I worked with'. And the stress and anxiety even caused her hair to break off and fall out. She . continued: 'I didn't want to change my phone number because I had had . it for 20 years and used it for my work, and my phone wouldn't let me . block the calls. 'He started with one call a day and within a month it had gone up to once an hour. It was like a drip, drip torture. 'Two months in I texted back and said, ""I'm in the middle of a horrible divorce, could you please stalk me in six months' time?"" 'My friends would phone him and threaten him, but it didn't make any difference. 'There . was one time that I answered the phone as I was worried it might have . been one of the children trying to contact me, and it was him. 'He said, ""Hi, it's me,"" and I almost threw up on the spot. 'You just go into a whole world of doubt and suspicion, and it makes you realise how vulnerable you are.' Then at the beginning of August 2010, the . contact stopped abruptly and at . the end of December she had a phone call from the police. An officer had been arrested with a pay-as-you-go phone he'd used to harass several other women. Mrs Snow told the Mirror: 'I was floored. I couldn’t believe they’d managed to catch anyone, especially when it went on for so long and he hadn’t slipped up.' She was even more surprised to find her stalker was 51-year-old Mark Wilkie. He had been caught when his work locker was searched following an arrest for as similar offence. Wilkie, an . award-winning policeman commended for bravery, was jailed for three . years and four months last year at Cambridge Crown Court after . admitting to 12 counts of misconduct in public office over a period of . two years. Between 2008 and . 2010 he would target women who he had met while investigating crimes, . and would search out their numbers and details using the police's . database. Ordeal: Mrs Snow received daily explicit text messages and phone calls from Wilkie who even breathed heavily down the phone on occasion . Wilkie, of Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, would then . pester them using a pay-as-you-go mobile phone. Detectives . said there may have been as many as 50 targets. The people he stalked included victims of domestic abuse and missing teenagers. Mrs Snow, who used to be confident and outgoing, said the harassment caused her to become 'a nervous wreck'. In mitigation, defence counsel Hector . Maclean-Watt told the court his client's long-term relationship had . broken down shortly before the offences started and his marriage had . ended four years earlier. The . judge described him as 'sexually obsessed'. He said the offences were . 'an appalling breach of trust' which undermined public confidence in the . police. Judge Gareth . Hawkesworth told Wilkie at the time: 'You abused the very people you were there to . protect. This was effectively terrorising vulnerable people in breach of . trust.' A Bedfordshire Police spokesman added: 'Wilkie's behaviour is absolutely abhorrent.' The jailing of her tormentor, who she describes as 'a pervert', has brought little relief or joy for Mrs Snow. 'I can't be pleased at the sentence. I just feel numb and I wish I didn't have to be involved,' she said. 'I actually don't believe I trust anyone any more. 'But . I hope this will make the police take this kind of situation seriously, . and I hope it stands as a lesson to other people out there.' Mrs Snow now wants to highlight the lasting effects stalking has on the victims. She said: 'It still affects me - I don't know when that's going to stop.'","PC Mark Wilkie had been called out to Maria Snow's house following a row with her husband .

Alex Salmond's bank account was accessed by a reporter working for the Observer newspaper, he told the Leveson Inquiry. Scotland's First Minister claims a former journalist from the paper told him they were intrigued by a payment made in 1999 to a shop called 'Fun and Games'. He inferred that journalists at the Sunday paper had hoped that the purchase was of an adult nature and would reveal something salacious about his private life. But in reality he had gone to a toy shop to buy a gift for his young nieces, he told Lord Justice Leveson's Inquiry into media standards. Scroll down for video . 'Account accessed': Mr Salmond claimed The Observer accessed his bank records in 1999, a claim the newspaper have denied . Mr Salmond claimed the paper accessed his account in the run-up to the 1999 Scottish election. However, the Observer have denied Mr Salmond's claims. He said: 'My bank account was accessed by the . Observer newspaper some time ago, in 1999, and my reason for believing . that is I was informed by a former Observer journalist.' The revelation has 'coloured his view' of press standards, he said. Mr Salmond said the journalist gave him details of what was in his account. He added: 'I had . bought some toys for my then at that time young nieces in a toy shop which was called Fun and Games. 'The person . who informed me told me that this caused great anticipation and hope in . the Observer investigation unit because they believed that perhaps Fun . and Games was more than a conventional toy shop.. He continued: 'The point I'm making is the person . concerned had detail which could only have been known by somebody who . had full access to my bank account at that stage.' Courting Murdoch: Alex Salmond told the Leveson Inquiry today that he has met Rupert Murdoch five times in the last five years . Separately, the First Minister said there was no evidence that he had been a victim of phone-hacking. This afternoon the Guardian Media Group denied Mr Salmond's claims and said they had investigated them fully. A spokesman said: 'Mr Salmond first raised the matter of an alleged unauthorised access of his bank account with the Observer's Editor last year. 'The allegation was that a journalist working for the Observer had accessed his bank details in 1999. 'As we explained to him last year, on the basis of the information he had given us, we have been unable to find any evidence to substantiate his allegation. 'As our response to him at the time made clear, we take this allegation very seriously and if he is able to provide us with any more information we will investigate further.' Bank claims: The Observer, the sister paper of the Guardian who are based in Kings Place, London, said there was no evidence they had accessed Mr Salmond's account . Mr Salmond has repeatedly refused to . answer questions at the Scottish Parliament on whether he had been the . victim of phone hacking, leading to accusations he has treated Holyrood . with contempt. The First Minister always insisted the Leveson Inquiry was the correct place to air the issues. On wider Scottish press behaviour, he said: 'More recently I think we'd have to accept, given the information which has now been into the hands of the police in Scotland, there are a significant, perhaps proportionally less but significant Scottish examples of possible criminality.' A number of Scots have been informed by police over the past year that people may have been victims of 'illegality'. He criticised the Metropolitan Police for not handing over information quickly about possible criminal acts to Scottish police. 'It's only in the last few months that Strathclyde Police have examined all of that information and informed the potential victims of the possibility of criminal acts against them,' he said. 'That seems to me a highly undesirable situation and something similar applies to possible breaches of data protection as well.' Porbe: Lord Justice Leveson today heard allegations that the Observer accessed Alex Salmond's bank account . The Scottish National Party leader has also faced pressure from his opponents about his relationship with media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, whose News of the World tabloid was closed amid the phone hacking scandal. Mr Salmond told the inquiry he had been in favour of the Murdoch's BSkyB bid. 'I was in favour of what benefited the Scottish economy,' he said. 'Remember I have no responsibility for broadcasting policy, I have no responsibility for plurality in the press but I do have a responsibility for jobs and investment in Scotland.' He added: 'I would tend to put an emphasis on the jobs and investment aspects of this. It was for others to consider other matters.' Mr Salmond said he was prepared to argue the case for jobs and investment with Vince Cable, then Jeremy Hunt, but never got the chance. He said the issue of the BSkyB bid was never brought up in discussions about newspaper support. 'If for example I'd believed that the merger of the consolidation of ownership of BSkyB would have resulted in the diminution of Scottish jobs then I would have been perfectly prepared to argue against it,' he said. Also, he said he never got a direct answer on potential support from Mr Murdoch for the SNP. Mr Salmond said: 'I wouldn't explicitly raise it at meetings necessarily because they'd always say ""go to the editors"". 'That certainly was Rupert Murdoch's practice, and I can't even remember, it may have cropped up in a James Murdoch meeting, but if so, he would say 'go to the editors. and go to the editors I did, as I say, sometimes successfully, sometimes not.' The Sun newspaper famously depicted Scotland in a noose in a warning against voting SNP in the 2007 Scottish election. The paper changed its position to back Mr Salmond for a second term as First Minister in 2011. Mr Salmond said he had five meetings with Mr Murdoch over five years.'It's perfectly reasonable,' he argued. 'It's not in the same league, if I may say, as Mr Blair or Mr Brown or Mr Cameron, but nonetheless, that's five times in five years. 'I saw Murdoch's evidence. I don't demur from that at all. He said he didn't know me well, and that's fair. 'Often we were discussing Scotland and his Scottish ancestry. The fact that his grandfather was the Church of Scotland minister in my old constituency of Banff and Buchan in Cruden Bay, for example, so there were a range of things for discussion.'","Alex Salmond claims Observer accessed his bank account in the run-up to elections in 1999 .

A young ballerina from Bulgaria has been killed by a hit-and-run driver after flying to the U.S. to attend a prestigious dance school. Polina Kadiyska, 22, had been attending the Rock School for Dance in South Philadelphia, on a scholarship. She had been walking home after having dinner at a Chinese restaurant when she was hit by a car as she crossed the street in the early hours of Sunday morning. Tragic: Polina Kadiyska, a talented ballerina, was taken off life support Tuesday after getting critically injured in a hit-and-run over the weekend . Police say she was crossing Broad Street, in a marked crosswalk, with a green light, at approximately 4am and had the right-of-way when she was struck. The student was taken to  Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, where she was placed on life support. Her family, after arriving from Bulgaria, made the heart-wrenching decision to turn the machine off earlier today, as there was no hope of her making a recovery. A post on the dance school's blog this evening reads in part: 'The Directors and Polina’s loved ones stayed at the . hospital until her parents arrived from Bulgaria around 1:30 this . morning.  Polina passed on a few hours later. Promising: She had come to the Rock School of Dance on scholarship from Bulgaria about three years ago . 'Our hearts and love go out to Polina and her family.

He was tracked down after a tip-off from waitresses when he and a friend returned to his Audi to retrieve his personal effects. Barnes only turned 19 . on Saturday. He now faces a litany of charges, including aggravated assault . while driving under the influence, criminal mischief, driving while . intoxicated, and recklessly endangering another person. His bail is set at $1million, and he is scheduled to be arraigned April 3. His passenger was not charged, reports Philly.com. According to the website, Barnes was previously scheduled to appear in court on April 2 for an alleged assault that occurred last August. Court records show he is accused of threatening and attacking a female acquaintance. His attorney Emmett Madden, has denied guilt in both cases. Mr Madden told Philly.com Ms Kadiyska crossed the street mid-block when she ran into Mr Barnes' lane. After speaking to his client and other witnesses, Mr Madden assessed the hit-and-run: '[Barnes] might have gotten scared initially (and left), but he came back to make sure the girl was OK.' Mr Madden said he had not yet read the police report; he suggested in the first case the alleged assault was fabricated by the accuser.

Behind bars: David Simpson could face the death penalty if convicted of murder after finding 18 mutilated bodies in the Central African Republic . A British man imprisoned in Africa after discovering 13 murdered bodies in a jungle was told he would be freed from prison if he made an £800,000 payment to local officials. David Simpson, 24, was working for a safari firm in the Central African Republic when he found the site of the suspected massacre. He reported it to the country’s military but just days later he was arrested on suspicion of murder – an accusation he vehemently denies. It is widely believed supporters of the notorious warlord Joseph Kony perpetrated the killings. Mr Simpson’s Swedish boss at the Cawa safari company, Erik Mararv, is also being held. It is alleged the authorities are forcing him to pay money to fund the murder investigation. If he refuses to pay, he has been told they will all stay in prison longer. It is also understood the relatives of the dead have been told by officials they will receive compensation payouts from Mr Simpson and Mr Mararv, 26, if they testify against the European men and claim they were the killers. The father of one of the deceased has now come forward with a story claiming Mr Simpson employed a ‘magic man’ to place a curse on the victims’ food which drained the men’s strength – allowing the Briton and his colleagues to overpower them. The relative has told a local newspaper he saw Mr Simpson standing over the bodies brandishing a blood-soaked machete. Mr Simpson faces up to six months in jail as a judge carries out a review of the case following two ‘inconclusive’ investigations. Eleven local Cawa employees have also been imprisoned over the same crime. Framed?: Mr Simpson worked for a big game hunting company and may have been set up by locals . The request for the £800,000 payment was made just days after Mr Simpson was arrested seven weeks ago. A source said: ‘The official leading the investigation told Mr Simpson and Mr Mararv that if a “bail payment” of €1million [£800,000] was paid, their case would be resolved more quickly. 'But neither man’s family has anything close to that sort of wealth.’ The source added: ‘Mr Mararv has been asked to pay tens of thousands of pounds to cover the costs of the investigations since he was arrested.’ Mr Simpson, from Gillamoor, near Pickering, North Yorkshire, is the manager and pilot for the firm, which charges hunters upwards of £40,000 to shoot big game such as leopard, lion and buffalo. Wanted: It is widely believed supporters of the notorious warlord Joseph Kony carried out the killings . Mr Simpson says he discovered the mutilated bodies on March 22 when clearing a route through dense bush on the border of the company’s hunting reserve. The corpses had been hacked at with machetes. The region has suffered a number of raids by Kony’s militia, the Lord’s Resistance Army, in the past year. The guerrilla leader is on the International Criminal Court’s ‘most wanted’ list for crimes against humanity. The massacre victims are believed to have been gold-diggers who were employed by local officials from the nearby village  of Bakuma. The source described how the bereaved relatives sought compensation from the local bureaucrats at a meeting held in the village last week. ‘The relatives wanted compensation because the officials had sent the victims to work in such a dangerous area,’ the source said. ‘But they were told they would not receive any payouts unless Mr Mararv and his colleagues were found guilty. 'This led to the relatives voting on whether to pin the murder on Mr Simpson and Mr Mararv. The majority voted to frame the men.’ The Simpson family is due to meet Foreign Office officials to discuss the case tomorrow. Central African Republic’s authorities were not available for comment.","David Simpson, 24, was working for a safari firm in the Central African Republic when he found the suspected massacre site .

'Murdered': The sister of Shafilea Ahmed (pictured) broke down in tears as she described the moment she witnessed her parents allegedly killing her sister . The sister of Shafilea Ahmed told a jury yesterday that she had been ‘haunted’ by the memory of the 17-year-old’s murder at the hands of their strict Muslim parents. Alesha Ahmed, who was 15 at the time, kept quiet about what she claims to have witnessed for seven years before she finally ‘snapped’, she said. Facing the prospect of an arranged marriage and being sent to Pakistan – the same destiny which allegedly provoked Shafilea’s ill-fated rebellion – she said she too defied their parents, going to university and drinking alcohol. ‘I was living between two cultures and trying to please everyone,’ she told Chester Crown Court. ‘It had haunted me for a long time, what happened to my sister. ‘I felt like I was going down the same path as my sister had gone down in terms of going to Pakistan, in terms of being 21 years old and supposed to be married. It was just a lot of pressure.’ Her father Iftikhar Ahmed, 52, and mother Farzana, 49, deny Shafilea’s murder. The trial has been told that Alesha’s ‘bombshell’ description of the couple allegedly suffocating Shafilea came after she organised a robbery at her parents’ home in Warrington. Alesha told the court she had moved back to the town and was struggling for money, but her parents refused to help out. On trial: Shafilea's son Junyad, mother Farzana, sister Mevish and father Iftikhar arrive at Chester Crown Court . Accused of murder: Shafilea's mother Farzana Ahmed, left, and Iftikhar Ahmed, right, deny murder . ‘I think I just absolutely snapped,’ she told the court. ‘It was either living the way they wanted me to or living on my own, and both were a struggle.’ However, she said, the gang ‘turned’ on her, and after hearing them saying her name, her mother and brother became suspicious and told police. It was following the raid that she finally gave an account of how she says her parents killed Shafilea seven years earlier. ‘It all got too much and it was a relief to be able to tell someone finally,’ she said. Family home: The Ahmeds lived in this house in Warrington, Cheshire . The trial has heard that Shafilea wanted to lead a ‘westernised’ lifestyle, wearing the same clothes as other girls her age and having boyfriends. This brought her into conflict with her parents’ traditional Pakistani culture and their ‘concept of shame and honour’. A row which began over a T-shirt she had worn to work, plus money found in her bags, escalated into both parents suffocating her with a plastic bag in front of all  her siblings, Alesha has claimed. Shafilea was reported missing a week after the alleged attack in September 2003 after a former teacher heard rumours that Alesha had told schoolfriends their father had killed her. But Alesha denied it when police spoke to her at the time. On trial: Iftikhar Ahmed, left, and Farzana Ahmed, right, are said to have killed their 17-year-old daughter because she refused to obey them . Tragic: Shafilea had been a keen student at her school in Warrington, Cheshire, and enjoyed trips to shopping centres and wearing Western clothes . She now says she was fearful of suffering the same fate as her sister if she told of what she had seen. Five months later Shafilea’s body was found dumped beside a river  in Cumbria. Giving evidence for a third day hidden by a screen from her  parents and the public, Alesha, now 23, said it was only when she went away to university that her effort to live with a terrible secret began to unravel. ‘When you get used to something, it becomes  normal,’ she said. ‘But that is when I saw that it is not normal and what happened to my sister was wrong. ‘When it’s your own parents you don’t see things like that because you still love them.’ She added that her parents had been trying to set up an arranged marriage for her, with one suitor coming to the family home. ‘I did not want to get married – I didn’t even know the person,’ she said. ‘I was told I would have to go to Pakistan but I absolutely didn’t want to. I was told constantly.’ Alesha said she later moved back to live in Warrington, but not with her parents, and the pressure of making ends meet led to her organising the robbery. She refused to name the three or four men involved in the robbery but admitted: ‘I contacted them, it was my responsibility.’ Shortly afterwards she came  forward with her account of Shafilea’s murder at the hands of their parents. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC  has told the jury they will have  to decide whether or not Alesha’s account of her sister’s death is  true or if it is ‘a wicked lie made up to help herself’. The trial was adjourned. A desperate Shafilea swallowed bleach during a trip to Pakistan after her mother told her she was to stay there permanently, her sister said. Alesha said Shafilea – then 16 – went straight to the bathroom, then moments later 'everyone just heard her screaming and she was holding her stomach'. Next to her was an industrial-sized bottle of bleach with the lid off. The incident, in March 2003 during a power cut at her grandparents' house in rural Pakistan, badly damaged Shafilea's throat. Their grandmother said she needed to go to hospital, but the girls' mother reacted differently, Alesha told the jury. 'I'm sure she said she was okay when it was very clear she wasn't,' she said. In hospital, Alesha said, her mother told Shafilea to say it was a mistake and she was 'supposed to drink mouthwash but because it was dark she drank bleach instead'. The prosecution say Shafilea had been drugged and put on a one-way flight to Pakistan after trying to cut her ties with her parents. While she was in the village where both her parents were born, several local families proposed that Shafilea should marry their sons, said Alesha, giving her photographs of men with moustaches and oiled hair. 'She was just not interested at all.' After the bleach incident, Shafilea returned to England for hospital treatment. She lost more than two stone because she could not swallow food. One side effect was that she needed saliva to be wiped from her face regularly when her family visited her, said Alesha. 'Mum just made a face about not wanting to wipe it up', so one of the sisters or their father did it instead.","Alesha Ahmed broke down to police in 2010, seven years after Shafilea died ."
"By . Rob Preece . PUBLISHED: . 20:00 EST, 22 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:46 EST, 23 June 2012 . A violent criminal who broke into a woman's home while high on cocaine and raped her in front of her young son has been jailed for 11 years. Dwaine Bryer, 26, was on bail for other crimes when he climbed through the flat's kitchen window and attacked his victim in the boy's bedroom. The woman only managed to get away afterwards by jumping 20 feet from the Bristol flat's balcony, injuring her back. Justice: Dwaine Bryer was found guilty of rape by a jury at Bristol Crown Court . Bristol Crown Court heard that the boy, now aged seven, had pleaded with Bryer to stop attacking his mother and even blamed himself for what happened. The woman was left so traumatised by the rape that she has been prescribed medication by her GP. Prosecutor Martin Lanchester told the court: 'It has left the victim feeling like she is constantly under threat and feels she is very worried about her future. 'Her son's education has been very seriously affected and he blames himself for what happened.' The court heard that Bryer, of Bury Hill View, Downend, Bristol, had eight previous convictions for 12 offences stretching back to when he was a juvenile. His record included convictions for GBH, assaulting a police officer and attempted burglary, as well as a caution for sexual assault. When he raped the woman on July 11 last year, he was on bail and subject to a curfew. A jury found him guilty of rape but cleared him of committing grievous bodily harm against the same woman. Rupert Lowe, defending, said that since his conviction, Bryer had come clean to probation officers and admitted the rape. 'His admission shows some courage,' Mr Lowe said. 'In his words, he was very sorry and very ashamed about what he had done. Sentence: Judge Susan Evans QC, who jailed Bryer for 11 years, told him he had 'terrified' his victim and caused 'incalculable' damage to her son . 'Mr Bryer has been in prison for almost a year and that is in itself salutary in that he really hates being where he is but he understands why he is there. 'He is truly sorry and when he is released he will not trouble the courts again. 'In his words ""I will not so much as steal from a shop, which would put me in any risk of returning to where I am"".' Judge Susan Evans QC, sentencing, told Bryer he had 'terrified' the victim and caused 'incalculable' damage to her son. 'It is clear on July 11 you were a violent, selfish bully,"" the judge told the defendant. 'She didn't want you there. She and her son tried stopping you getting in but you forced your way in. 'You became violent to her. You took her into her son's bedroom and you raped her. 'It is in my view a sustained attack.' The judge also ordered Bryer to remain on the sex offenders' register for life. She told him: 'The fact you placed her in such extreme terror is also an aggravating feature. 'That young child witnessed you raping his mother. The damage you have done to that child is incalculable - no child should have to witness that.' Emotions ran so high in court that seven police officers sat next to Bryer's friends in the public gallery.","Dwaine Bryer, 26, was on bail when he broke into his victim's Bristol flat and attacked her .

Fear: Peter Flanagan feared he was going to be beheaded like Ken Bigley when he was confronted by John Bennell, Bolton Coroners Court heard . A householder who stabbed a machete-wielding burglar to death told yesterday how he feared he was about to be beheaded like Iraq hostage Ken Bigley. Grandfather Peter Flanagan, 59, who is partially deaf, grabbed a carving knife in self-defence after being confronted by intruder John Bennell, 27, in his hallway. During a violent struggle the HGV driver, who was dressed only in his underpants, stabbed and killed Bennell, who was high on cocaine – and on bail for an earlier burglary. Mr Flanagan was arrested on suspicion of murder and spent three days in police custody, but the Crown Prosecution Service ruled he should face no charges because he had acted reasonably to defend himself. The decision followed a pledge by David Cameron that homeowners who defend themselves against intruders should not be prosecuted provided they use ‘reasonable force’. Yesterday, during an inquest into Bennell’s death, Mr Flanagan relived his ordeal, which happened when four men burst into his home in Salford shortly before midnight on June 22 last year. In a statement read to the inquest, he said he had only been in bed for a few minutes when he heard a thud and went downstairs to investigate. ‘I was only wearing underwear and had nothing on my feet,’ he said. ‘I could see a big lad stood in front of me waving a machete. ‘I was absolutely terrified. The big lad had the machete at arm’s-length waving it up and down and poking it towards my face. I thought of the video of the man in Iraq who had his head chopped off.’ Bolton Coroner’s Court was told that the offender with the machete went outside and Mr Flanagan took the opportunity to arm himself. Vicious: Martin Jamieson, left, Wesley Gibbons, right, and Christopher Troy, centre, were part of the armed gang which broke into Peter Flanagan's home in Salford . A struggle ensued. One of the . burglars, former soldier Wesley Gibbons, swung the 12in machete at Mr . Flanagan, who countered the blow in what he described as a ‘fencing . match’. The machete flew into the air and was . grabbed by Bennell. Mr Flanagan said that, after grappling with Bennell, . he inflicted a couple of quick, short jabs, which he thought were to . his hand or stomach. Weapon: Mr Flanagan picked up a carving knife to defend himself when he found himself face to face with a machete-wielding burglar . Questions: Bennell's father, Gary, asked if a statement issued by the Prime Minister regarding self-defence had changed the way police dealt with his son's killing . Bennell dived through the back door . window and ran, but collapsed after 300 yards. The three others left him . in the street and he died later in hospital. Mr Flanagan said he is . haunted by the incident. Bennell’s father, Gary, asked . Detective Superintendent Dominic Scally if a statement made by the Prime . Minister about self-defence in the home two weeks before the incident . had coloured the police investigation. The officer replied: ‘No, it made . us all the more thorough.’ In a statement, Bennell’s mother, . Diane, said her son started getting into trouble after he began smoking . cannabis aged around 13. Recording a narrative verdict, coroner . Jennifer Leeming said: ‘John Bennell died as a consequence of injuries . inflicted by a householder acting in lawful self-defence.’ In January, Gibbons and Christopher . Troy, both 23, and Martin Jamieson, 27, were jailed for a total of 21 . years for aggravated burglary. Civil engineer Mr Bigley, 62, from Liverpool, was seized in Baghdad in September 2004. He was later beheaded and a video of his murder posted online. Evidence: Police guarded the scene near Mr Flanagan's home in Salford where Bennell's body was found . Ruling: A coroner returned a narative verdict that John Bennell was stabbed to death by Peter Flanagan in self defence as Bennell was a member of an armed gang who were robbing his house in Salford .","Prosecutors ruled he should not face charges because he had acted reasonably to defend himself .

Young Jess Hawley can glide through the water like a graceful water baby - but may never be able to say her own name or even walk. The brave 20-month-old suffers from a condition which doctors do not know the cause of and have struggled to find a cure for. Jess, from Stafford, has SWAN - Syndrome Without A Name - meaning medics have told her devastated parents she may never walk or be able to hold a conversation. Water baby: Jess was born with an under-developed brain, but does not let that stop her from making a splash in the pool . Making waves: Jess may never be able to walk or hold a conversation, but still likes to paddle through the water with the help of mum Emma . Sibling love: Jess's sister Natalie, five, has a . quiet moment with her sibling, while right, the Hawley family are . pictured together . The debilitating genetic condition means children often require round-the-clock care from their parents, and sees those who suffer from it miss developmental milestones as they grow up. But while little Jess may never walk or talk, her mother Emma says she is as confident as any other child her age once takes to the water. The youngster happily swims about under the watchful eye of her parents, despite the hardships she faces in every other aspect of her life. Emma and her 34-year-old husband Ben noticed their second daughter wasn't developing at the same rate as their other girl, Natalie, now five, when she was just four-months-old. Emma, an admin manager, told The Sun: 'We’ve been told by doctors she may never walk or talk. 'It’s so heartbreaking to see friends’ children reaching their milestones and thinking, sadly, ‘She may never be able to do that.’ Emma and Ben, right, admit they are sometimes 'terrified' about what the future holds for their daughter . Happy: Emma said her youngest daughter still smiles and is affectionate despite her condition . 'Yet in the water, there’s no difference between Jess and any other child. In fact, she’s much more confident and happy swimming about. 'Swimming has been our saviour – to see her so serene and happy when otherwise life is so hard.' Emma said she struggled to get Jess to eat or drink, and was initially told it could be a reflux - where babies are sick automatically after eating. But when the symptoms continued and Emma was unable to breastfeed her daughter, doctors were at a loss to explain what was wrong with the youngster. Eventual MRI scans and further tests showed Jess had been born with an under-developed brain, leading doctors to diagnose her with SWAN - Syndrome Without A Name. The devastation diagnosis often leaves parents feeling as they have no idea what to expect from their child. There are thought to be around 6,000 disabled British children born every year who are born as 'SWAN babies'. Often symptoms are similar. Babies have problems with feeding and gaining weight. They may have significant learning difficulties, facial features such as low-set ears, heart conditions, vision problems and epilepsy. Fearless swimmer: Emma says her daughter is 'serene and happy' in the water despite her condition . Problems vary enormously from child to child, and SWAN is not an illness in its own right. Experts believe these conditions are genetic. But each case is thought to be the only one of its kind, which makes a proper diagnosis – and prognosis – incredibly difficult. Each parent will have been given the same utterly frustrating news by doctors: there is no way of knowing what the future may hold for their child. Treatment is a matter of fire-fighting, tackling problems as they arise. It is impossible to pre-empt difficulties because there are no previous cases to reference. To Emma's delight, Jess began to crawl a few weeks ago, although both parents realise she does not talk, may not be able to hear, and does not respond to her own name. Emma said both her and husband Ben have at times been 'upset' by the condition, admitting they are 'terrified about the future' and whether Jess will survive. The brave little girl struggles with many things in life, but her mother has taken heart from the manner in which she dosn't appear daunted by water. Emma told The Sun: 'The future is such a big unknown, yet swimming is the one thing Jess can do better than any other child in her Water Babies class. 'I love to see her — and it gives us all so much hope.' While the search for a definitive diagnosis may sound irrelevant as SWAN children clearly have disabilities, the lack of a medical label makes their situations more difficult. Not only are the families looking after children with extreme needs, they are also dealing with complicated bureaucracy to get help. ‘Having a clear diagnosis assists patients to get access to help,’ explains Lizzie Chambers, deputy director of the charity Together For Short Lives. ‘Ideally there would be a key worker for each family who assessed all their needs. In reality everything is disjointed. Families have to repeat their stories over again to different doctors. 'They need health, education and social care – which are represented by different departments of social services – as well as medical care.’","Youngster born with condition which doctors cannot cure and do not know cause of .
