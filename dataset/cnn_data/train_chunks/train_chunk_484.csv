With a little help . from Barbara Walters, one of Syrian President Bashar al-Assads close . aides was admitted into Columbia University's prestigious international . affairs program. In a string of leaked emails between Sheherazad Jafaari . and the celebrated broadcaster, Ms Walters, 82, promised to her help . the 22-year-old secure a job on Piers Morgan's CNN show and win a place . at Columbia University. Apparently only Columbia took the bait. 'Ms. Jaafari was admitted based . solely on the submitted application materials,' associate Columbia dean . Jesse Gale said in response to the controversy surrounding her . acceptance. Ms Jafaari, whose father is Syria's . U.N. ambassador, was one of Assad's closest advisers and one one of . three women revealed in an earlier leak to have sent lovestruck emails . to the dictator. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Walters grew close to President Assad's aide Sheherazad Jaafari while organizing the interview, and later emailed contacts at CNN and Columbia University to help her comely new friend . Making headlines: Barbara Walters was the first and only American journalist to interview Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December in the midst of violent uprisings in his country that have left thousands dead . In one email, Ms Walters told 'Sherry' how she had written to CNN host Piers Morgan and his top producer to . 'say how terrific you are' in hopes of helping her get a job at Piers . Morgan Tonight. The young woman responded, writing 'You can never be a better mom to your adopted child (me).' Messages leaked by Syrian rebels in March show her asking another of Mr Assad's advisers to tell him: 'I love him so so so much and that I miss him.' The leak revealed flirtatious and suggestive emails from three admirers, including a provocative photograph of an unknown woman in white lingerie. Mrs Walters first met Ms Jaafari when the young woman's father hosted a cocktail party in his New York apartment in March 2011. '(Ms Jaafari) was bragging that they . had a great relationship after she came to her house for a cocktail . party,' a diplomatic source told the newspaper. The New York Post reports that the two women bonded that evening, and an unidentified diplomatic source said that the then-21-year-old 'was bragging that they had a great relationship after she came to her house for a cocktail party'. That connection came in handy when . the veteran reporter began dealing with Ms Jaafari on a regular basis . leading up the ABC News' exclusive televised interview with the Syrian . leader. In the interview, Ms Walters pressed . the president about the thousands of deaths of Syrian citizens and he . denied having issued any formal command for such force. Ms Walters and Jaafari continued to talk via email long after the interview aired . The Telegraph, . who published the most recent batch of hacked emails between Ms Walters . and Ms Jaafari, reported that the interview was received poorly by . Syrian government officials because it ended up being more harsh on . Assad than they originally expected. Shortly after, Ms Jaafari emailed Ms Walters in a panic, writing that she was 'in so much trouble' over the interview. A . few weeks  later, Ms Jaafari had determined that it was time for her to . get out of Syria and join her father in the U.S.- all the while . remaining extremely loyal to Assad, who she called 'the Dude'. In other . emails obtained by The Guardian in March, Ms Jaafari wrote that 'this man is loved by his people'. Upon her move from Syria, Ms Jaafari . applied to Columbia University's School of International and Public . Affairs, and hope to translate her time working as a press aide to Assad . into a staff position at a major American news outlet. Ms Walters immediately dismissed any . talk of her working for ABC since it would be a breach of journalistic . ethics. Instead, she offered to reach out on behalf of the 'dear girl'. Walters signed emails 'hugs' and 'love' The pair appear extremely close, with . Ms Walters signing her emails with ‘hugs’ and ‘love’ and Ms Jaafari . promising to bring back jewellery from Syria for her so-called adoptive . mother. Their email exchange was obtained by Syrian opposition forces who then passed them on to The Telegraph. Ms Walters emailed Columbia Journalism . School professor Richard Wald, former president of NBC News and vice . president of ABC News, to sing Ms Jaafari's praises. 'She is brilliant, beautiful, speaks five languages. Anything you can do to help?' Ms Walters wrote at the end of January. Mr . Wald responded that while his position at the Journalism School is . unconnected to the School of International and Public Affairs, he would . do his best to help, saying that 'through the Admissions Office network, . I will get them to give her special attention. I am sure they will take . her.' Now Columbia is saying that while she was accepted, Mr Wald's intervention- if any- had nothing to do with it. 'We cannot comment on an individual applicant’s materials, which are confidential,' Ms Gale said. Mr Wald's son, Jonathan Wald, is the . executive producer of Piers Morgan Tonight, was also the recipient of an . email from Ms Walters. She . told Ms Jaafari that she wrote to both Jonathan Wald and Piers Morgan . on her behalf and passed along her resume for their consideration, even . though she was unsure if they had any availability. That specific email . was not released. Neither Ms Walters nor Ms Jaafari heard back from CNN or the younger Mr Wald. In the wake of the emails, Ms Walters released a statement expressing her 'regret' for the questionable decision. 'In . the aftermath (of the Assad interview), Ms Jaafari returned to the US . and contacted me looking for a job. I told her that was a serious . conflict of interest and that we would not hire her,' Ms Walters said in . the statement. During her initial response to the . allegations, Ms Walters did not know that the young woman had, in fact, . been accepted to the program, but she still expressed her regret. 'I did offer to mention her to . contacts at another media organisation and in academia, though she . didn't get a job or into school. In retrospect, I realise that this . created a conflict and I regret that.'

'Malnourished': Joan Wood, 83, who served as a member of the Women's Land Army in Word War Two, died at Northern General Hospital in Sheffield . A pensioner who died in hospital was too weak to fight an infection because staff accidentally starved her for ten days, her heartbroken family has claimed. Medics forgot to properly attach a feeding tube to Joan Wood, 83, who served as a member of the Women’s Land Army in Word War Two, an inquest heard. Mrs Wood’s daughter Lori, 52, criticised the standard of care at Sheffield's Northern General Hospital. A pathologist and doctor told an inquest in the city that malnutrition could have hindered Mrs Wood’s ability to fight the infection which killed her. Mrs Wood - known as Betty - was admitted to hospital for the first time at the beginning of January last year, after fracturing her hip in a fall at Hazeldene Nursing Home in Poole Road, Darnall, in Sheffield. She had hip replacement surgery and was discharged on January 20. But she was readmitted to hospital when part of a prosthesis she had fitted collapsed. Doctors spent 13 days trying to solve the problem with pain relief and physiotherapy - while, her daughter says, her food and drink intake plummeted. Medics eventually operated to remove her hip implant and clean the infected wound. But Mrs Wood, who had dementia, died on April 1 after infection spread to her lungs and she developed pneumonia. Her daughter, of City Road, Sheffield, broke down as orthopaedic geriatrician Dr Philippa May described Mrs Wood’s nutritional state prior to surgery as ‘poor’. Questioning the doctor in court, Miss Wood asked if staff shortages at the hospital could have prevented nurses from being able to feed all their patients on the ward. Criticised: Joan Wood's daughter claimed the standard of care given to her mother at Northern General Hospital (pictured) was not good enough . Dr May said: 'She was confused and agitated. Some days she would eat better than others, so it was hard to tell. 'There is a very high demand on nursing staff. There are a lot of elderly patients, and that is why they have feeding charts. 'I would find it difficult to comment on staff shortages.' Miss Wood replied: 'She hadn’t eaten for ten days before that operation.' Sheffield coroner David Urpeth also heard Miss Wood had agreed to allow her mother, who had worked at John Lewis in Sheffield for 25 years, to be fitted with a feeding tube before the operation - but it never happened. Dr Richard Gibson, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon who treated Mrs Wood after her second admission, said: 'When a patient has difficulty with oral intake, a tube is one of the ways we give them food. 'I don’t know why she was not given one.' The coroner recorded a narrative verdict after a pathologist said Mrs Wood died from pneumonia brought on by an infection. Mr Urpeth said: 'It is clear to me that it has to be right that better nutrition would have helped.' Diane Fawbert, a matron at the hospital, told the inquest that since Mrs Wood's death, some policies in the hospital have been changed. She said more volunteers were being recruited to help dementia patients eat and relatives were encourage to bring in the favourite food of older patients. The matron said Mrs Wood often rejected food, spat it out and was difficult when nurses tried to help with oral hygiene. She said that Mrs Wood did eat some food and her nutrition was satisfactory. But Mrs Wood's daughter told her: 'I want to know why she came to be so malnourished when she was in the hospital. 'I don't understand how she ended up so malnourished. 'You are saying she was fed adequately and in the next breath you are saying she is difficult to feed.' The inquest was told that Mrs Wood was on a high-protein 'soft food' diet, but her daughter said she often saw the remains of other food that her mother had been unable to eat. After the hearing, Miss Wood said: 'I think the system is wrong. 'It is failing old people, particularly those with dementia. I'm not blaming any individual - it is the system that is wrong.' In April, the Daily Mail reported on the case of an emaciated pensioner admitted to hospital weighing less than five-and-a-half stone. A coroner launched a scathing attack on the Beeches care home in Wath-on-Dearne, South Yorkshire, over the treatment of Molly Darby. Just five weeks before, the 'sprightly' 94-year-old had walked into the privately-run care home in good physical health. ButMrs Darby deteriorated to such an extent that she was taken out on a stretcher and died shortly after. When she was admitted to hospital as an emergency case her family claimed she resembled a 'concentration camp victim'. Recording a narrative verdict the coroner said: 'Her basic care and medical requirements were not satisfactorily met and her decreased mobility during her time at the Beeches increased her risk of developing a chest infection.' The Daily Mail has fought a long-running battle to improve standards in hospitals and care homes with its Dignity for the Elderly campaign. Launched in 2002, it has highlighted public anger over the way elderly people who have worked and saved all their lives are stripped of their homes to pay care bills of several hundred pounds a week. Meanwhile, those who have not worked to own their own homes have their bills paid for them and are placed in homes alongside those who have had their properties repossessed. In 2002, the Mail highlighted the case of 108-year-old Alice Knight, who starved herself to death in protest at being moved from her care home in Norwich.","Family of Joan Wood, 83, claim she was so malnourished she was unable to fight infection .

A ‘sadistic’ father has been ordered to spend the rest of his life in prison for murdering his ex-partner and their two-year-old daughter in a jealous rage. David Oakes, 50, stormed Christine Chambers’ house and blasted her and their daughter Shania with a shotgun just weeks after the family gained a restraining order against him. Beforehand, he subjected Miss Chambers to ‘degrading assaults’ by forcing her to strip and cutting chunks from her hair. He then wounded his face with the gun himself following the attack last June. Brute: Former night club bouncer David Oakes, pictured left after being arrested over an unspecified incident prior to him murdering Christine Chambers and daughter Shania, and, right, baring his injured face last year after shooting himself following the savage killings. Escape: Christine Chambers' eldest daughter (not pictured) escaped the scene. Her mum and sister Shania (right) weren't so lucky . His were so grave that Essex Police have refused to release his arresting mugshot because it was 'too graphic'. Instead they released a photo of Oakes, who had a history of violent attacks against his former partner, taken following an earlier arrest. Officers refused to reveal what he was held for on that occasion. Last month the former nightclub bouncer admitted bringing a bottle of petrol, a drill and an axe round to the house late at night following a drunken night playing pool at a local pub but not to murder. But today at Chelmsford Crown Court a . jury of seven men and six women found Oakes, of Steeple, Essex, guilty . of two counts of murder after nearly nine hours of deliberation. Mr Justice Fulford ordered Oakes to . serve a whole life sentence for the ‘sadistic’ killings, meaning he will . never be released from prison. Mr Justice Fulford . He said: ‘These tragic and needless deaths occurred in deeply shocking circumstances. ‘A bullying and controlling man, who . had frequently inflicted violence on Miss Chambers during the six years . of their relationship, killed his ex-partner and their young daughter . simply because he knew she could not bear to be with him and wished to . start a new life.’ The judge added that Miss Chambers ‘carried not a shred of blame’ for what happened. ‘Instead of thinking of his daughter . who he has claimed to love, he concentrated on himself alone and most . particularly his desire for revenge and his determination that no other . man was going to be Christine's partner or act as Shania's father,’ the . judge added. ‘He resolved that, if the family was . at an end, that they would pay for leaving him with their lives and that . their last hours of live would be terrifying and, in the case of . Christine Chambers, extremely painful.’ The judge said Oakes ‘planned the . deaths in elaborate detail’ and took with him a series of implements to . inflict pain on Miss Chambers during the attack at her home in Braintree. Murdered: Christina Chambers and her daughter, Shania, two, were shot dead at close range with a shotgun . He made her beg and proclaim her love for him while at the same time ‘torturing’ her, the judge added. Miss Chambers' family wept as the . judge said: ‘Shania would have witnessed her mother's gravely injured . state and heard her cries for help. She would have seen the appalling . injuries to her mother. ‘That little girl must have been terrified. ‘He then put the shotgun against her head and pulled the trigger. ‘No decent, civilised human being could ever describe that as being the result of love.’ Oakes did not appear in court to be sentenced. Richard Connolly, in mitigation, said . his client's absence for the verdict and sentencing was ‘not intended . to show disrespect to the court, jury or the verdicts that have been . passed’. He added prison guards had been . concerned for Oakes's safety because he ‘expressed emotions’ which made . them fear he may harm himself. Murder weapon: The shotgun used by David Oakes to kill his partner and their two-year-old daughter . Brutal: A drill that Oakes brought to the house in the 'elaborately planned' attack . Savage: David Oakes, pictured at a previous hearing, has denied two counts of murdering his ex-partner and her two-year-old daughter . Andrew Jackson, junior prosecution counsel, read an excerpt from a statement by Miss Chambers' family. It said: ‘The tragic loss of Chrissie and Shania has deeply impacted on all of our everyday lives. ‘No parents should have to outlive their child, let alone grandchild.’ Miss Chambers' 10-year-old daughter . with former partner Ian Flitt witnessed the attack but escaped out of . the bedroom window to her father's house nearby. Mr Jackson said the 10 year old - Shania's half-sister - had suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder ever since. Oakes had some ‘old and trivial’ previous convictions committed ‘within the context of his relationship . with Christine Chambers’, he added. Chris McCann, head of the Crown . Prosecution Service's East of England complex case unit, said outside . court: ‘This was an extremely violent and horrifying assault by Oakes . upon Miss Chambers in advance of a family court hearing over access to . Shania and driven by a determination that he would kill both Christine . and Shania before attempting to kill himself. ‘Our thoughts are obviously with the family of Miss Chambers who behaved in such a dignified way throughout the trial.’","David Oakes planned savage shotgun attack in 'elaborate detail' after deciding that the 'last hours of their lives would be terrifying .

An Australian lawyer being held in Libya over allegations of spying following a visit to Colonel Gaddafi's son will be released if she provides details of where the country's most wanted man is, authorities have said. Melinda Taylor and her Lebanese-born interpreter Helene Assaf were detained last week while visiting Saif al-Islam Gaddafi in Zintan as part of an International Criminal Court (ICC) team. Officials in the town alleged that during the meeting the pair were caught passing documents to Saif al-Islam from his fugitive right-hand man Mohammed Ismail. Authorities say 36-year-old Ms Taylor had a suspicious pen camera on her and attempted to pass Saif al-Islam - the son of former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi - a coded letter from the fugitive. The authorities say if Ms Taylor - who has a two-year-old daughter - was carrying a letter from Ismail, that means she had met the wanted man. The deal was proposed yesterday by a government official as a second delegation from the ICC visited their colleagues. Speaking to The Times, Mohammed al-Harizi, a government spokesman, said it was very important for the country's new rulers to catch Ismail. He said: 'We do not have anything against this woman. Just we need some information from her. After that she will be free.' Human rights groups, the court in The Hague, and the Australian government have all demanded that they be released immediately, but Libyan prosecutors say Taylor and Assaf will be held for at least 45 days while they are investigated. Allegations: Ms Taylor has been accused of passing documents to Saif al-Islam, left, from his fugitive right-hand man Mohammed Ismail, right . 'The delegation as well as ambassadors for their (the detained ICC staff) countries visited them,' said Ahmed al-Gehani, a Libyan lawyer who is in charge of the Saif al-Islam case and liaises between the government and the ICC. 'They are well, they are in a guesthouse, not in a prison. They have food, water, and are being treated well.' The ICC delegation had earlier yesterday been prevented from entering Zintan by a local militia which closed roads into the town because of tribal clashes in the area. In scenes that summed up the chaos and instability in Libya since a revolt last year ousted and killed Gaddafi, when the delegation arrived at a checkpoint outside Zintan, militiamen told them no one was being allowed in because of clashes with a rival tribe nearby. Captured: Ms Taylor is being held in the town of Zintan, pictured, which was yesterday affected by tribal clashes . The 7-vehicle convoy parked near the checkpoint but waited to get into Zintan, even though the visit had been approved by authorities in the capital, Tripoli. The incident underscored the problem complicating negotiations over the ICC staff: Zintan is effectively outside the control of the central government. Instead, it is the brigade in Zintan, which captured Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam in November and has since refused to transfer him to the capital, which is, de facto, in charge. Saif al-Islam is wanted by the ICC for crimes during the uprising that ended his father's 42-year rule last year. Libya's new rulers insist he should be tried in his home country. Saif al-Islam is being held in Zintan by a local militia that captured him in November. An ICC team, including Taylor and Assaf, was meeting him under an arrangement with the Libyan authorities for him to have access to ICC-appointed defence lawyers.","Melinda Taylor was detained last week while visiting Saif .

This is because researchers measured not just the length of delay but also the ‘intensity’ of gridlock and the degree to which it is greater than normal free-flow traffic conditions. Gridlock: Britain's drivers spend an average of 32 hours annually in traffic jams, data from traffic information company INRIX showed . Manchester drivers suffer congestion 24.8 per cent worse than normal and waste 45 hours a year. The worst period is 9am to 10am on a Tuesday. London drivers suffer jams that are 23.8 per cent worse than normal, but endure 66 hours a year of delay. Liverpool is third with jams 21.3 per cent worse and delays of 39 hours, followed by Belfast at 20.6 per cent worse and 34 hours of gridlock.

Conservative councils have made seven times as many applications to sell off school playing fields as Labour since the general election, it has emerged. In the past two years, 30 out of 35 applications to sell playing fields have been made by Tory councils, according to figures unveiled by the Labour Party. Four applications were made by Labour-run councils and one by a Lib Dem council. Selling off more: Conservative councils have made seven times as many applications to sell off school playing fields as Labour since the general election . The applications threaten to undermine the central Government’s pledge to give more backing to school sports. Education Secretary Michael Gove has already come under fire for allowing the sale of school fields on five occasions against the advice of an independent panel in the past 15 months. And yesterday he faced claims  that he allowed the sale of a playing field in one borough against advice in exchange for its Conservative council funding a free school in the area. An independent panel last month rejected a call to sell off tennis courts at Elliott School in Putney, in the London borough of Wandsworth, but Mr Gove defied the recommendation. Under fire: Education Secretary Michael Gove has already been criticised for selling school fields on five occasions against an independent panel's advice . The school will now be turned into an academy while its operators have received the go-ahead to build a free school in the area. Transport Secretary Justine Greening, who is a governor at the school, has also publicly backed the sell-off to ‘provide investment’ in the school. However, campaigners accused the Government of ‘backroom stitch ups’. Stephen Twigg, shadow education secretary,  said: ‘There is clearly a very cosy relationship between Michael Gove and Tory Councils. ‘The Tory Council applies to sell off their school playing fields, and Michael Gove gives it the nod – often flying in the face of real concerns from the independent school playing field panel. ‘These figures show the effect a Tory Council can have. ‘It flies in the face of the assurances that David Cameron made about our Olympic legacy.’ Mr Twigg added that schools resorted to selling their fields because the Government had cut its schools capital budget by two thirds, leaving many desperate for funds for essential repairs. Resorted to selling: Schools sell their fields because the Government cut its schools capital budget, Stephen Twigg, shadow education secretary said . But a Government source said: ‘This is just the usual hypocrisy from Labour. ‘Labour sold off over 200 playing fields, including dozens when Stephen Twigg was a Schools minister. ‘The bottom line is that this Government has only approved sales if the school has closed, has merged, or if equal or better facilities are being put in their place.’ Pressure on ministers intensified at the weekend as the outgoing chairman of the British Olympic Association said private schools should share playing fields with state schools in exchange for their tax breaks. Lord Colin Moynihan suggested that sharing playing fields should be part of the ‘public benefit’ test which they have to meet to get tax breaks worth £100million a year. Spoken out: Mr Twigg, left, said the sell-offs 'fly in the face of the assurances that Cameron made about our Olympic legacy' while Lord Colin Moynihan suggested playing fields should be part of the 'public benefit' test . The former sports minister and retired silver medallist rower said: ‘State secondary schools with good sports facilities, as well as all independent schools, should be required to share their facilities and co-operate with the primary schools in their catchment areas.’ He added: ‘For the independent schools, this could be part of the public benefit requirement under the Charities Act.’ The Government’s commitment to sports has been called into question after ministers revealed that they had approved 31 school playing field sell-offs since the general election – ten more than previously disclosed. Even playing fields at the former schools of Olympians have been sold off. Dani King, a gold-medal winning cyclist, has revealed her dismay that her old school, Barton Peveril Sixth Form College in Hampshire, had sold off its football pitch to a housing developer. Gold medalist's dismay: Dani King, who won gold in cycling, was disappointed that her old school had sold its football pitch to a housing developer .

Glasgow city centre after Cardiff's match on Friday night and did not . return to the team's hotel until 5am to catch a plane at 7am. 'I stupidly carried on drinking . during the flight, for which I am truly embarrassed,' said the Welshman yesterday morning, in a . statement via his management company.

'I . know that I have let my team-mates, coaches, management, sponsors and . indeed my family down with my actions.

Prince Charles is 'extremely angry' that a convicted sex offender was allowed to stand alongside the Queen on the Royal Barge during the Jubilee celebrations. MPs have demanded an investigation after Harbinder Singh Rana was invited on the vessel - despite being jailed for four years for assaulting ten women in their homes while posing as a doctor. The 52-year-old – who was invited by Prince Charles in recognition of  his position as a 'leading member of  the Sikh community' – was pictured on the Spirit of Chartwell during Sunday's Jubilee River Thames Pageant, standing near Prince Harry, the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William. Security blunder: Harbinder Singh Rana with the Queen and Prince Philip during the royal flotilla . Raising questions: Harbinder Singh Rana on board the Spirit of Chartwell during the Queens Diamond Jubilee Pageant on the River Thameswith members of the Royal family .

Last night, as MPs demanded an . inquiry into the security blunder, the policeman who led the . investigation into Rana's crimes in the mid-1980s described him as a . 'con merchant'. He pointed out that at least two . newspaper articles relating to Rana's case could be found on the . internet using a simple Google search – suggesting even basic checks on . his background had not been carried out. He has been banned from all future events involving the royal family after the sex offender was exposed. An insider told the Daily Mirror that Prince Charles wanted to know how the offender was able to get so close to him. 'Understandably, Charles is extremely angry that he has been put in a position where he has had close contact with a convicted sex offender on more than a few occasions,' they said. 'He is determined to know how such a situation could have arisen. There is no question that had he known about Rana's criminal record, he would never have been invited on the Royal Barge. 'But he also wants to know why this information has not been made available to him in the past as he has met Rana at least five times since 1999.' Bartholomew Leigh, 76, a retired detective sergeant, said: 'It's obviously bad security. 'This man was a con merchant who was . convicted of a number of serious crimes on several victims. If he is . capable of posing as a doctor to molest young women in their own homes . it makes you wonder what else he could be capable of.

He targeted ten women – one of whom was pregnant – . after finding their details stored at work. Posing as a doctor, . complete with medical bag, bottles and needles, he bluffed his way into . his victims' homes, claiming he needed to carry out intimate . examinations. In one incident he posed as a . psychiatrist and injected a woman in the buttocks. Rana, who was senior . vice-president of the 30,000-strong International Sikh Youth Federation . at the time, was convicted at Dudley Crown Court of 11 assaults, five . indecent assaults and an attempted assault. Yesterday there was no sign of Rana or . his wife Parkash, 50, at their detached home in Walsall, West Midlands. But it was reported yesterday he had been invited to attend the . flotilla by Prince Charles's office three weeks ago. Asked whether he had been vetted, Rana said: 'I don't know what checks they do or how they do them.' The revealation will raise questions about why apparently no checks were carried out on Mr Rana's background before he was allowed to be photographed within inches of senior royals . The convicted sex attacker was at times during the 1,000 boat extravaganza just feet from the Queen . He added that he had never been asked . about his sex crimes before the event.

The Lottery-funded group is . supported by England cricketer Monty Panesar and seeks to promote the . Sikh community. On the group's Facebook page, Rana is . described as being a  'close friend' of the Prince. In 2006 he acted as . Charles's guide on his tour of the Punjab. Dr Kate Cook, from Manchester-based .

'Imagine how horrified you would be if you saw your attacker standing by the Queen,' she added. A spokesman for Clarence House confirmed that the Prince had no knowledge of Rana's sex crimes. Both Clarence House and Scotland Yard refused to comment on royal security procedures. Rana is understood to have been accompanied on the boat by his 22-year-old daughter Kamalpreet.

At the age of 77 and no longer in tip-top health, our greatest ever jockey Lester Piggott nevertheless still has an eye for an attractive filly. For I can reveal that the nine-times Derby winner is no longer to be found living in Newmarket with his long-suffering wife Susan, to whom he has been married for 52 eventful years. Instead, he has moved abroad to start a new life with a woman more than 20 years his junior. Hot to trot: Former champion jockey Lester Piggot has left his wife of 52 years for the attractive Lady Barbara FitzGerald, right, a woman 20 years his junior . She is attractive Lady Barbara FitzGerald, 55, whose estranged husband Lord John is heir presumptive to his brother, the Duke of Leinster. Piggott and Lady Barbara are, I am told, ensconced in a rented house on the outskirts of Geneva, a location some will see as ironic after Lester’s conviction for tax fraud 25 years ago. After a year in jail, he was stripped of his OBE, a move widely seen as unnecessarily cruel. According to friends, Lester and Swiss-born mother-of-two Barbara are planning to build a house together in Switzerland. They have known each other for many . years because Barbara’s marital home is in Newmarket, a town where all . the racing folk know each other intimately. Her . husband is the racing manager of Lanwades Stud at  nearby Moulton. Barbara previously worked in the town for racehorse auctioneers . Tattersalls.

Piggott, who won 5,000 races over 48 years, including the Oaks six times and the St Leger eight times, has two daughters by Susan — Maureen, a former eventer who is married to Derby-winning  trainer William Haggas, and Irish TV sports presenter, Tracy. He also has a son, Jamie, from a previous long-standing mistress and former assistant, Anna Ludlow. But their 16-year affair fizzled out some time ago. Lester has suffered cardiac problems . in the past and in 2007 was taken to hospital in Lausanne after . suffering a heart attack on holiday on Lake Geneva. But . he bounced back and just three months later I reported he was playing . golf in Newmarket with attractive blonde widow, Diana Vigors, 13 years . his junior.

Susan, who remains at the family home, is philosophical about the change in her domestic life. She tells me: ‘I have known Barbara for years and she is a very nice person. We are all still friends and that goes for all the family. ‘Put it this way, at 72 you feel very differently about things than you do at 25. All I wish for is Lester’s health and happiness. There are no hard feelings.’ ‘It’s all good. I have met Lester and I like him,’ says Barbara’s daughter, Hermione, 26, a professional golfer. ‘My mother is happy with him and as far as my parents are concerned, I hope it will be a fresh start for both of them.’","Lady Barbara .

The cost to taxpayers of transporting Polish criminal suspects from Britain to face court in their home country has doubled in the past two years, it has emerged. The secret extradition flights, dubbed Con . Air, now take place on a weekly basis to remove hundreds of suspects who . have fled to the UK across open borders. While Poland pays for the flights, the ‘hidden’ administration expenses for security and holding the fugitives for weeks as they are processed through UK courts is estimated to have cost the British taxpayer £50million last year, up from £25million two years previously. Illegal: The secret extradition flights, dubbed Con Air, now take place on a weekly basis to remove hundreds of suspects who have fled to the UK across open borders . Although some of the fugitives are wanted for serious offences, many have been extradited for motoring offences and minor crimes such as spraying graffiti or even stealing a chicken. And many of those extradited are back in the UK within three days of being dealt with by a court. In 2009, the extradition flights, which involve dozens of Polish police officers landing at a small airport near London as part of a massive security operation, were scheduled on a fortnightly basis. New figures from the Polish authorities show they have now become weekly – with two flights having to be run during some weeks in ‘peak periods’ when there are more than 50 prisoners waiting to be extradited.

Homeward bound: New figures from the Polish authorities show extradition . flights have now become weekly, with two flights having to be run . during some weeks in 'peak periods' Back in Poland: Last year, a total of 986 suspects were flown to Poland on 65 flights. This was up slightly on the figures for 2010 and a huge leap from the figures for previous years . Critics say the cost to Britain of processing the fugitives is the latest problem with the European Arrest Warrant. The cross-border crimefighting agreement was introduced in 2004 and states EU members must hand over people wanted in other EU countries with a ‘minimum of formalities’, in an effort to speed  up extradition. However it is argued it disproportionately costs Britain millions of pounds to enforce. During the handovers, prisoners are led across a runway handcuffed, carrying their possessions in plastic bags before being strapped into the seats of the usually full 80-seater Polish military twin-propeller aircraft. They are then shackled down inside before flying from Biggin Hill Airport in Kent – a former RAF commanding base during the Battle of Britain. The airport closes to other business for the flights, which are not published on the usual schedules. Since Poland joined the EU in 2004, hundreds facing court hearings have fled to seek refuge among Poles living in Britain. At first, they were sent home on commercial flights, but the huge cost led to Polish authorities using a military plane instead. Last year, a total of 986 suspects were flown to Poland on 65 flights.

Police said some of the Poles are suspected of minor offences which carry only a maximum one-year jail sentence – meaning most receive only a fine when sentenced. Patrick Mercer, chairman of  the House of Commons sub-committee on counter-terrorism, said: ‘The European Arrest Warrant is full of faults, but it was introduced for a sensible purpose. ‘It is mildly abused and the Government needs to tackle this and levy the whole cost against the warrant-issuing country rather than the British taxpayer.’ A senior police source told the Mail: ‘We’ve had requests to arrest people who are wanted for motoring offences and it’s cost a fortune on interpreters, transport and man hours processing them for the  flight only for them to return a few days later. ‘It’s insane that we’re wasting our time and resources processing these people for such trivial crimes. The Poles want all their offenders tracked down no matter what.’ Expensive: British officials have pleaded with Poland for a let-up in the extradition of those wanted for minor offences, but to no avail. Polish officials say they are constitutionally bound to find every offender. Arrested: During the handovers, prisoners are led across a runway . handcuffed.

A spokesman for the Polish interior ministry defended the flights, saying: ‘There is no other way.’ The Serious Organised Crime Agency, the body responsible for processing European Arrest Warrants in the UK, declined to comment. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We will always ensure that those who attempt to evade justice by crossing a border within the EU are quickly brought to justice. We will continue to press EU countries to consider proportionality when issuing European Arrest Warrants.’","Secret extradition flights take place on a weekly basis to remove hundreds of suspects who .

A miracle moggy has baffled vets after surviving for TWO YEARS as a stray - with metal wire tearing at its belly. Annie, who is at least two years old, first became trapped in the wire when she was just a kitten, medics believe. She has grown with the wire wrapped around her, leaving her with an abnormally skinny waist - and painful wounds where the metal cut into her skin. Agony: X-ray showing wire wrapped entangled around Annie's stomach and under her skin . Amazingly, the feline was entangled for such a long time that her body absorbed the wire as her skin healed over it. Annie's horrific injuries only came to light after she was spotted by a concerned member of the public who saw the wire sticking out of her skin. RSPCA officers were called to catch Annie on Thursday May 3 and immediately took her for treatment. It is believed the cat was living wild but had previously been a private pet, in Hucknall, Nottingham. RSPCA inspector Gary Eastwood said: 'The wire had actually cut slowly into the cat's abdomen and was mostly under the skin, and the skin had subsequently healed over it. On the mend: Annie after the operation to remove wire from her stomach . 'The likelihood is that this wire has been around the cat for a very long period of time, possibly from when she was a kitten. 'I am actually amazed she managed to survive for so long, and had she had got an infection she almost certainly would have died. 'I do not believe this wire was put on her deliberately, the likelihood is she got caught in it and couldn't get free. 'But this does act to as a timely reminder to people that they should keep any loose wire or hazards out of reach, as sadly, cats, small animals and wildlife can get caught in them, and it can cause a tremendous amount of pain and injury if this happens.' Annie will now be transferred to the RSPCA Radcliffe on Trent Animal Centre, Nottingham. The RSPCA are also appealing to anyone who may recognise Annie or who may know who her owner is to come forward.","Annie became stuck in the wire as a kitten, say vets .

A 26-year-old woman who suffered a fatal brain aneurysm gave birth to twin boys at a Michigan hospital weeks after she was declared officially brain dead. Christine Bolden, who had been happy and healthy only moments before the tragic March incident, suddenly got a horrible pain and fell to the ground. Two aneurysms, hidden since her birth, had finally burst. Doctors declared her brain dead, but she was miraculously able to carry her twins, Alexander and Nicholas, to 25 weeks and deliver them on April 17. Scroll down for video . Heaven Can Wait: 26-year-old Christine Bolden gave birth to Alexander and Nicholas while she was brain dead, in her last act of motherhood . Little Angels: Alexander and Nicholas were just six inches long when they were delivered on April 17 . Heavy Heart: Nicholas weighed only one pound nine ounces and Alexander only one pound five ounces . Danielle Bolden, Christine's aunt, spoke to WOODTV8 about how difficult it was to keep her niece on life support in a desperate attempt to save her children. 'It's hard,' said Danielle, welling up with tears. 'Real hard.' She said that Christine was walking with her boyfriend and three-year old son when she fell to the ground on March 6. They said she looked like she was just in a deep sleep and couldn't fathom how dire the situation had truly become. 'I guess she had a pain in her head,' Ms Bolden said. 'We didn't think it was as bad as it was.' Ms Bolden said that doctors told the family that the two aneurisms that took Christine's life were present from her birth and that the stress of pregnancy may have exacerbated them. Christine had already given birth to three children and Ms Bolden said they did not fully understand the diagnosis. Family Pain: Christine's aunt, Danielle Bolden, said she was happy and healthy only moments before two aneurysms burst in her brain . Keeping the Faith: The Boldens issued an obituary for Christine for March 6, the day her aneurysm burst, but still held out hope she would recover . After she was declared brain dead, the family began the grieving process by making . T-shirts in memorial of Christine's passing. They even printed an official obituary. However, the family refused to give up, and kept hope alive that she would somehow survive to see her little boys. 'We used to rub on her belly and talk to the babies,' said Ms Bolden. After weeks of watching Christine languish in the hospital bed, her increasingly high blood pressure became a danger to the children inside her, and the family had to make a tough call: Christine or the twins. They made the difficult decision to take her off life support in order to try and save the twins. Doctors performed her C-section without anesthesia at the family's request, in the hopes that the pain might rouse their sleeping Christine. To the Rescue: On April 17, Christine's blood pressure reached dangerous levels and the family made the difficult decision to take her off life support and have doctors deliver the twins . Will They Survive? The twins are still in intensive neonatal care at Helen DeVos Children's Hospital in Michigan, but doctors say their condition is fragile and are assessing their health 'day by day' Cost of Motherhood: Doctors said Christine was born with the aneurysms, but that her pregnancy may have exacerbated them . 'Christine's grandmother told them not . to numb her because maybe when they cut her (for the C-section) she . would have felt that, and woke up saying, 'wait a minute I can feel . that! What is you all doing to me!' But it didn't happen,' Ms Bolden . told WOODTV8. Alexander and Nicholas entered the world via C-section just as their mother left it. 'God could have took her and the boys. But he left the boys. That's a miracle.' Ms Bolden thought that Christine held on to life until the last possible moment to ensure the safety of her twins. 'Once the babies were born; that was the end of her,' Ms Bolden said. The boys were only about six inches long; Nicholas weighed only one pound, nine ounces and Alexander only one pound, five ounces. 'God, he could have took her and the boys,' said Ms Bolden. 'But he left the boys. That's a miracle.' The hospital is keeping a careful eye on the boys, keeping them in the neonatal intensive care unit as they fight for their lives. Remembered: Christine, remembered by her friends as 'full of life,' left behind three other young children . Hospital officials said they are in fragile condition and are assessing the boys' health 'day by day.' Bolden's . family set up an account at 5/3 Bank in Grand Rapids in Christine . Bolden's name for anyone who would like to help out the family. Love Lost: Christine's boyfriend, Mike, was with her when the aneurysms burst . Christine's friends and former coworkers are rallying behind the family, showing their support in any way that they can. 'She was full of life — so bubbly,' Christine's former manager, Astriana Sari, 31, remembered. Christine used to work at the Tiffany Woods apartment complex in Muskegon, cleaning and readying apartments for rental. 'She was all around a very funny and nice girl,' Ms Sari said, adding that her three other young children were the highlight of her life. 'She always brought her family and kids and nieces and nephews to events,' Ms Sari said. 'Just like other mothers, she was very caring about her kids. They were very well mannered; she raised them well.' When she heard the news of what happened to Christine, she was shocked. 'All I could think about was how we take life for granted. It could happen to anyone,' Ms Sari said. 'I'm praying for the twins to be all right. Hopefully they will make it.'

Running battles have broken out between police and protesters outside a British oil refinery facing mass job cuts. Today violence erupted at the Coryton plant in Essex where its Swiss-based owners Petroplus have collapsed and left at least 200 out of work. Essex police have arrested three people at the scene after they clashed with union members and political activists. Out of hand: Protesters blockaded the site in Essex and police were called in to break it up . Battle: A protester is cuffed and dragged off as violence breaks out at the Coryton refinery in Essex this afternoon . Anger: People are on a picket line at the site because around 200 people could lose their jobs . About 850 people work at the refinery in . Stanford-le-Hope near Thurrock, and it is feared that unless another . company steps in all the workers could lose their jobs. Just yesterday Labour leader Ed Miliband said the Government's decision not to give financial backing to the refinery was 'completely wrong'. 'I think they are showing an absolute abdication of their responsibility to the workers at Coryton,' the Labour leader said. Trouble: This man is cuffed and detained by two police officers today . Fury: A young man screams at a policeman as he tries to push the line of people back away from the gates . The Department for Energy and Climate Change claimed it would not be sustainable for the government to provide assistance. Administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers have said the 200 jobs would go this week, which led to the picket line outside. Meanwhile The UK's second biggest oil refinery, near Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, reported a big financial loss but its new owner said an efficiency drive will help it make money even when oil prices fall. Support: Around 100 Coryton Oil Refinery workers and their supporters were there as 200 workers lose their jobs this week . Battle: Police push people back from the refinery gates but soon afterwards violence breaks out . Stuck: Drivers were unable to move their trucks out of the refinery today when trouble flared . Supermarket Asda is cutting the price of petrol. From . tomorrow customers at Asda’s 196 filling stations will pay no more than . 127.7p a litre for petrol and no more than 132.7p a litre for diesel. Asda said this was the lowest price for a litre of fuel since February 2011. The . latest cut means Asda has shaved 14p off the cost of a litre of fuel . since the end of April, reducing the cost of filling up a family car by . almost £10. Sainsbury’s said it was reducing its fuel prices too, with petrol and diesel coming down 'by up to 2p per litre' from tomorrow. The AA said the 14p Asda reduction since April was welcome. While . Asda had dropped its petrol price largely in line with wholesale, the . UK average was down 10.5p a litre since the record high in mid-April. Tesco is also dropping prices, with its petrol and diesel coming down by up to 2p a litre from tomorrow. India-focused Essar Energy bought the . Stanlow refinery, which accounts for 15% of production from UK . refineries and produces around 1.5 billion litres of kerosene a year for . aircraft fuel, from oil giant Shell in July. The . operation made an underlying loss of 30.2 million US dollars (£19.4 . million) in the first eight months under new ownership as refining . margins in northern Europe were squeezed by overcapacity. But its plans to make efficiency savings and diversify the business into producing more oil-based chemicals and diesel are expected to add two to three US dollars on the margin on a barrel of oil over the next three years. This would mean that the operation would provide 'attractive returns' throughout the market cycle. The company said: 'In the UK, work is well under way on various projects aimed at increasing margins at our Stanlow refinery following its acquisition at the end of July 2011. 'Stanlow is operating in a tough European refining market, but we continue to see signs that uneconomic refining capacity is being removed from the market which we expect to have a positive impact on margins.' Stanlow, which supplies Manchester airport with jet fuel, saw supplies disrupted earlier this month, leading to some flights being delayed. The group saw profits slump nearly two-thirds to 129 million US dollars (£82.7 million) in the 15 months to March 31 compared with the previous 12 months.","There were three arrests at the Coryton refinery in Essex where at least 200 workers will lose their jobs this week .

A brave businessman was stabbed eight times in the face by a . robber as he fought to protect his shop in a terrifying daylight raid. Brave Maurice Leese, 65, was working alone at his cash-for-gold shop when the robber burst in armed with a large kitchen knife and slammed him to the floor. The pair grappled together for a number of minutes, during which the intruder repeatedly stabbed the defenceless pensioner who tried to push him off.

From the outside it looks unremarkable, but this flat-roofed brick building has been dubbed London's most expensive shed after going on the market for just under £260,000. The incredible asking price reflects the property's location in upmarket Highgate village which has recently seduced Kate Moss and Jude Law to buy properties in the area. It also comes with a kitchenette and skylights and estate agents have described it as an 'unusual property'. Shedloads of cash: From the outside it looks unremarkable, but this flat-roofed brick building has been dubbed London's most expensive shed after going on the market for just under £260,000 . But at £259,950, it is almost 10 times the average London salary of just over £27,000, and the new owner will only be able to spend a couple of nights a week there due to a clause in its lease. Mark Newton, associate sales director at Taylor Newton, which is selling the 250 sq ft property, said: 'It was an old barn and there are restrictions to how many nights a week you can sleep there. 'It is a niche market — I have had a couple of artists interested in using it as a studio, or it could be a crash pad for someone who was only in London part time.' Experts are divided over whether it is good value. Nicholas Leeming, a director of property website Zoopla, said: 'The question is whether anyone is willing to overlook the limitations of a property like this for the sake of a prime location.' Roomy: The spacious living space in the 'supershed' which is on the market for a cool £260,000 . Cleaning up: The plush shower room in the 224 sq ft shed in north London . However, Peter Rollings, chief executive of Marsh & Parsons, said: 'It is a bit wacky, but it is a stand-alone property. You could pay £500,000 for a studio flat in Kensington and Chelsea.' The sale starkly illustrates the  price gap between property in prime London locations and other parts of the capital and Britain. A few miles east, near the Olympic Park in Stratford, you can buy a house for £260,000 from Clarke Hillyer. In Halstead, Essex, a penthouse in a church is for sale with John D Wood for £259,950, complete with stained-glass windows.

Killer mother Lianne Smith today vowed to appeal after being found guilty of murdering her two children in Spain. Her lawyer said she was in 'a bad way' after the verdicts but would fight her conviction for smothering Rebecca, five, and baby Daniel, 11 months. Jenifer Lahoz Abos said: 'Lianne suffers from psychosis and cannot be held criminally accountable for her actions. No mother in her right mind would chose to end the lives of her children. 'She needs help. I spoke to her immediately after the conviction and she is in a very bad way. She has found the trial extremely difficult as it has brought back awful memories for her.' Smith suffocated the children with a plastic bag in the Hotel Miramar in the seaside resort of Lloret de Mar in May 2010. Last night at Girona Provincial Court, north-east Spain, a jury of seven men and two women unanimously found her guilty of double murder. Today she is on suicide watch in a Spanish prison. Smith, 45, from Lichfield, Staffordshire, is under constant supervision in a secure psychiatric hospital inside a jail called Brians 1 Penitentiary Centre near Barcelona. She is facing up to 34 years behind bars. Smith, a former county council children's services manager, is being watched 24 hours a day and will be assessed regularly by a prison psychiatrist. The hospital unit can house up to 60 male and female prisoners suffering from psychiatric illnesses. The jury rejected defence claims Smith was criminally insane, after hearing testimony from three psychiatrists during a four-day trial at Girona Provincial Court. Scroll down for video . Unanimous verdict: The jury rejected Smith's defence claim that she was mentally ill . Appalling case: Smith is led into the court in Girona, Spain, for the final day of her trial . The jury ruled Smith was 'fully conscious of what she did and that it was wrong'. Smith feared social services would take the children from her after her fugitive partner Martin Smith, a TV psychic, was arrested on child sex charges at their home in Barcelona. Girona Provincial Court heard the couple, who shared a surname but were not married, made a pact that they would kill themselves if they were ever separated. Blank stare: Lianne Smith looked impassive as the unanimous verdict was read out. Her TV psychic partner, Martin Smith (right) was found dead in his cell in January . Martin Smith, 46, from North Shields, was later jailed for 16 years for repeatedly raping his stepdaughter Sarah Richardson, now 24, but hanged himself in HMP Manchester in January, believing his partner had killed his young son and daughter. However the court heard DNA tests proved he was not in fact the father of either child. After killing them, Smith spent the night in the hotel room alongside their lifeless bodies writing a series of notes, including one to her children which read:"" ' love you very much. I wanted to give you a lovely life together. I'm very sorry.' She failed in several suicide attempts before asking a hotel receptionist to call police to the room. Martin Smith was previously thought to be the father of Daniel and . Rebecca, whom his partner has admitted killing in a Spanish hotel room . Smith, pictured with her son Daniel, was placed on suicide watch after learning of her partner's hanging in prison . Smith had become obsessed with the idea social services would take her children from her and put them into care - which she considered a fate 'worse than death'. Prison psychiatrist Harry Barker told the court Smith viewed the children's deaths as an 'unavoidable catastrophe'. She suffers from an unspecified psychosis and was 'pathologically obsessed' with Martin Smith. But prosecutor Victor Pillado Quintas told the jury her crimes were 'the most abominable, despicable, vile and horrific' imaginable. He called on the judge to jail her for 17 years for each count of murder. Judge Adolfo Garcia Morales will sentence her at a later date.","Smith facing 34 years jail after being unanimously convicted of two counts of murder last night .

A teenage girl was sexually assaulted by a masseur her mother had booked as a treat on her 17th birthday, a court heard yesterday. The girl told a jury that the incident occurred after Daniel Pytlarz gave her an all-over body scrub at his upmarket salon. She said that at first she did not know if what was happening was part of the massage, but she told him to stop when she felt him touching her intimately. Allegations: Masseur Daniel Pytlarz, 34, is accused of molesting female patients while he worked at the Violet Body and Skincare Clinic, St. John's Wood between March 2009 and September 2011 . ‘I was really confused,’ she said. ‘He . asked if I liked it and I said no. He said, “Sorry, I didn’t mean to . make you uncomfortable. I didn’t mean to push you too far”.’ The girl is one of 18 women that . Pytlarz, 34, is accused of assaulting at the Violet Clinic Body and . Skincare Spa which he runs with his wife in St John’s Wood, North . London. Lesley Jones, prosecuting, told . Southwark Crown Court that Pytlarz took advantage of women ‘from all . walks of life’ and of varying ages as they were in a ‘relaxed state’ and . lay naked or semi-naked on his table. Claims: Masseur Daniel Pytlarz, 34, is accused of sexually assaulting the young girl on her birthday . She added: ‘We will hear such terms as . full body massage, tantric massage and deep relaxation massage ... the . Crown say these terms are euphemisms used by the defendant to cover up . his predatory behaviour.’ The court heard that the teenage girl’s session took place on September 17 last year. The girl, who cannot be named for . legal reasons, said she was never offered the paper underwear which . masseurs are supposed to provide and was naked with just a towel over . her. She said the massage lasted 90 minutes . and it was five minutes from the end when the alleged assault took . place. She told police: ‘He started massaging my feet, then calves and . then my thighs. ‘When he was on my thighs he asked if I was relaxed and then started moving a bit upwards. ‘I was thinking, was this part of the massage? I was not sure. I told him to stop. I said, “No”, and he did stop.’ The teenager, who is a virgin, told . the court the massage then carried on ‘like regular’ and said she had . not left for fear Pytlarz might assault her further if she tried. She . said: ‘I felt maybe he would try to do something more or physically hurt . me.’ She said after he finished Pytlarz asked her if it was her birthday that day and said: ‘You’re 18, right?’ Claims: The jury at Southwark Crown Court heard the alleged victim begged Daniel Pytlarz to stop . When she said she had turned 17, he . allegedly told her: ‘I hope you enjoyed your massage’, and told her . where to go for her facial, performed by his wife. She said that as she changed she . noticed Pytlarz looking at her through a window in the door. Not knowing . what to do, she continued with the ‘top-to-toe treatment’ pamper . package even though she felt ‘shaky’. Her mother, who had dropped her off at . the spa, returned at 3.30pm to pick her up. Eleanor Laws, defending, . suggested to the girl that the incident ‘didn’t happen at all’. The girl . replied: ‘It did.’ She later confided in a friend before telling her mother, and the police were called. After three other women came forward, . detectives contacted more of Pytlarz’s clients and an additional 14 . women claimed they had been assaulted by the masseur, who has been . practising for 13 years and earned five diplomas in Poland. Pytlarz denies 14 charges of sexual assault and seven other counts of assault against 18 women.

Rallying residents have fought off controversial plans to build a gypsy site in the heart of an exclusive town which is home to a string of Premier League footballers and soap stars. Nearly 700 locals from Wilmslow, Cheshire - whose homeowners include Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, United captain Nemanja Vidic, winger Nani and Corrie stars Bill Roache and Simon Gregson - made objections to the plans. A series of public meetings was held and Cheshire East Council and townsfolk successfully argued that the application was far too vague and totally unsuitable for the area, a green belt site. Nearly 700 objections were received against the planned traveller camp in Wilmslow, Cheshire (above) Many feared hundreds of travellers would flock there in scenes reminiscent of the site at Dale Farm, Essex, which snowballed and became the largest traveller concentration in the UK. The group was finally evicted last year after a  ten-year legal battle which cost an estimated £18million. The . application for the Wilmslow camp was submitted by Green Planning Solutions, . which is run by former MP Matthew Green - known as the ‘Gypsy King’ for his work in getting planning permission on green belt sites. The proposal stated 'the stationing of caravans for residential purposes for 1 no. gypsy pitches together with the formation of additional hard standing and utility/dayrooms ancillary to that use'. But the submitted plans for the 0.46 . hectare site were criticised for being unclear and many residents feared . that many more caravans would occupy the site. Wilmslow locals feared a repeat of Dale Farm (above), the largest traveller camp in the UK, whose residents were evicted last year . Among those who live in Wilmslow are Coronation Street actor Bill Roache (left) and Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic (right) Cheshire East councillor Gary Barton . told a meeting which was attended by about 100 residents that . ‘inappropriate development is harmful to the green belt and should not . be approved, except in very special circumstances. 'Travellers' sites, temporary or permanent, in the green belt are inappropriate development’. Resident . Dennis O’Brien said: ‘The general shortage of dwelling properties and . current house prices is an ongoing problem to get our adult children . buying into their own home locally’. ‘I . therefore object strongly to this proposed application and can only . foresee turmoil for years to come in an established residential area.’ John . Woodhouse said: ‘The lessons of Dale Farm should be learned. Can . Cheshire East Council afford the millions of pounds that cost? As a . local taxpayer I do not want the council to take that chance.’ The result of Dale Farm was a violent, decade-long saga that cost an estimated £18m and required a strong police presence . During the eviction of Dale Farm, protesters such as Minty Challis (pictured) set fire to tyres and wood as barricades . Meanwhile, Chris Lomas said: 'The area surrounding this application is a quiet, established community with low crime rate which attracts visitors to use the adjoining countryside for walking, horse riding, exercising their pets, or where children play. 'Others visit to patronise local businesses or even to view the location of where the Lindow man was discovered. 'I believe that allowing the continuation of this application would have all the above negative effects on the area. 'This objection is based on over 30 years' personal experience as a serving police officer and having witnessed time and time again the effects on the community, environment and high rise in crime levels.'","Nearly 700 residents of Wilmslow, Cheshire object to the plans .

These thrilling pictures were taken by professional photographer Lukasz Warzecha, 29, who was visiting the fourth annual event for the first time this month. The Polish photographer, who is based in the UK, specialises in adventure photography and spotted the moment that some successfully make it all the way across - and others who don't. He said: ‘It's the biggest highline festival in the world and it's such a unique event. ‘It was quite breathtaking to see for the first time.

It was topped up by his gross salary . of £97,677 and more than £51,000 in housing benefit and car allowances. Dominic Raab, a Tory MP, said: ‘This is the kind of pay-off a banker . would receive. ‘Hard-pressed members are being fleeced by the caviar communists at the top of the union.’ Sources at Unite say the payout has . triggered widespread fury among union members, many of whom are . struggling to make ends meet.

In a statement, Unite said the sum . had been agreed at a meeting of the Amicus General Purposes and Finance . Committee in March 2008. Mr Simpson left last December.

Team GB coach Hope Powell has defended her decision to name a squad dominated by England players for London 2012. Two Scots - Kim Little and Ifeoma Dieke - are the only non-English among the 18 selected for the Games, with Wales and Northern Ireland not represented. Powell, England's manager since 1998, insists selection for the team's Olympics debut was based purely on picking the strongest possible squad. London calling: Team GB women's manager Hope Powell with Alex Scott outside Wembley following her squad announcement . E Aluko, A Asante, K Bardsley, S Bradley, R Brown, K Carney, I Dieke, S Houghton, K Little, C Rafferty, A Scott, J Scott, K Smith, C Stoney, F Williams, R Williams, E White, R Yankey. Stand-by players: J Clarke, E Higgins, J Ross, D Susi. 'I didn't feel any pressure to include players from Northern Ireland or Wales,' Powell said. 'I was tasked with picking the best squad of players and that's what I've done. We had everyone looked at extensively. 'I took the associations out of the equation and it was just about trying to pick a squad of players that I felt would do the best job possible. 'The location of the first game being in Cardiff did not nag my mind at all when it came to selecting a Welsh player. 'There's no disrespect to anyone, but my task was to pick the best players and I think I've done that. 'It was quite a challenging task and that goes to show the amount of talent we have to choose from. 'Since we knew there'd be a Team GB we spoke to other associations and managers and we had all teams looked at.' Case for the defence: Powell insists she picked the best 18 players available to her . Team GB chef de mission Andy Hunt insists that Powell was given free rein to choose the squad she wanted to take to London 2012. 'We've never put any pressure on selection. It has to be about picking the best players and that's been made very clear,' Hunt said. Arsenal Ladies playmaker Kelly Smith features in the squad after winning her latest injury battle, having sustained a broken leg in March. Smith, who has scored 45 goals in 111 caps, has been England's most creative player since beginning her international career in 1995 and Powell was delighted by her fitness. 'Kelly's doing really well. There have been question marks because she's been injured,' Powell said. 'But she's been in intensive rehab and she came on at the weekend. I've spoken to her and our medics. Support: Team GB Chef de Mission Andy Hunt backs boss Powell and Scott at Wembley . 'She's absolutely champing at the bit and is good to go. We all know the sort of player she is and is looking good.' The eyes of the sporting world will be watching when Team GB open the tournament against New Zealand at the Millennium Stadium on July 25. It will be the first competitive action of the Games and Powell admits it offers a unique opportunity to catapult the women's game into the public consciousness. 'When we get the squad together we'll make everyone aware of the expectations and the media attention around that opening game,' she said. 'Hopefully everyone will settle into the groove of the Olympics and the main thing is to enjoy it and what it will bring women's football.

"By . Rachel Rickard Straus . PUBLISHED: . 07:59 EST, 20 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:23 EST, 20 April 2012 . British expat businessman Neil Heywood, whose murder has caused political upheaval in China, left his wife and children in a financial situation so uncertain that a former business associate paid for their plane tickets to attend his London funeral. Mr Heywood left his family savings equivalent to a ‘five digit’ sum in British pounds, a family friend has revealed. Police suspect he was the victim of a poisoning engineered by the wife of ousted Chongqing Communist Party boss Bo Xilai, over a business dispute that turned personal. Suspicions: Police believe Gu Kailai, left, had businessman Neil . Heywood, right, poisoned after he threatened to expose her plan to move . millions of dollars abroad . They suspect that the 41-year-old Briton had been helping Bo’s wife Gu Kailai, a former high-powered lawyer, move money offshore in return for a commission on the transaction. However the lack of funds left to his family raise the possibility that any financial dealings with Gu may not have yielded him windfall profits. The account marks the first time that details of Heywood's financial affairs have emerged since he died in southwest China last November. Family friends also revealed more details about the final few days leading up to his death. If such transactions did take place, and he made personal gains from it, Heywood's widow, known to friends as Lulu but who kept her maiden name Wang, has no knowledge of them, according to the friend's account. Questions remain: It is thought that Mr Heywood was killed in one of the mountain-top hotel's £600-a-night villas, but details of his demise are sketchy . Wang, a native of China's northeastern city of Dalian where Bo was mayor from 1993 to 2000, and Heywood's mother, Ann, and sister in London have turned down interview requests. ‘She doesn't have a lot of bank savings,’ the source said, requesting anonymity, adding that she had to make monthly mortgage repayments on a three-storey town house the family owns in suburban Beijing. When Heywood bought the house a few years ago, similar homes in the gated compound sold for around 3 million yuan ($476,900), according to a local broker. Today such houses sell for about 7 million yuan following a boom in Beijing real estate. Police believe Gu plotted to murder Heywood after he demanded a larger-than-usual cut of a big transaction and threatened to expose her financial dealings if she refused, sources with knowledge of the investigation said. Private: Mr Heywood's body was found at the three-star resort - the same hotel where Mr Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, the prime suspect in his murder is said to have shown her power by getting the local police chief to subdue rowdy diners . The scandal, which has brought down Bo, once considered a contender for a top national leadership post, is potentially the most divisive the Communist Party has faced in more than two decades. It was not clear whether Heywood had other bank accounts his wife did not know about or owned assets overseas. If he did, his widow knew nothing of them, the family friend said. Heywood, educated at England's elite Harrow School and a fluent Chinese speaker, dressed well, drove a Jaguar and had friends in Britain's aristocratic circles. He once arranged a visit to China by Winston Churchill's granddaughter. One of Heywood's ancestors was Britain's consul general in the northern port city of Tianjin from 1929 to 1935. His children went to an international school in Beijing where the family paid attendance fees totalling more than $50,000 a year. But friends say his expatriate life, while comfortable, was not lavish. The chain-smoking Heywood made his living as a mostly self-employed consultant to companies, including the Beijing dealer of Aston Martin, helping them resolve disputes and assisting with due diligence. His grey Jaguar was second-hand, with a license plate ‘N007W3’. He requested and obtained the ‘007’ plate from Beijing traffic authorities as he was a fan of James Bond spy movies and classic sports cars, according to the family friend. Family friends dismissed UK media reports that Heywood may have been a British spy. The reports were based on the part-time work Heywood had done for Hakluyt, a UK-based private business consultancy founded by former British intelligence officers. Another source close to the family scoffed at the idea, saying a real spy would hardly advertise the fact by driving around in a car with ‘007’ plates. ‘Who would be so stupid as to carve 007 on his face if he were a real spy?’ this second source said. In 2006, Heywood advised the maker of London taxi cabs, which was looking to enter the Chinese market. ‘From a company viewpoint, he was rock solid - good knowledge, very intelligent, a well-organised sort of guy,’ said John Russell, chief executive of cab maker Manganese Bronze, which is 20 per cent owned by Chinese car maker Geely Automobile Holdings. Heywood's widow flew to London with the couple's children - aged 7 and 11 - last December to attend a memorial service after the Aston Martin dealer in Beijing paid for their plane tickets, the family friend said. Aston Martin Beijing declined to comment when reached by telephone. The 41-year-old widow returned to Beijing with her children after the church service. They did not suspect then that Heywood had been murdered. In his last days, Heywood did not appear stressed, family friends said. He attended the launch of a sports car club in Beijing on November 11 and bought his daughter a birthday gift, something from Apple, the next day.","British businessman left family savings equivalent to a 'five digit' sum in British pounds, says family friend ."
"By . Ian Gallagher . UPDATED: . 08:21 EST, 17 June 2012 . Lawyers have uncovered new evidence they say proves an innocent man has spent ten years in prison for the murder of a student. They claim CCTV footage obtained from close to the murder scene in Bournemouth ‘decimates’ the testimony of the main prosecution witness. Other evidence obtained by Omar Benguit’s defence team suggests the culprit may be Danilo Restivo, known as the hair fetishist killer. Deranged Danilo Restivo, left, may have killed foreign language . student Jong-Ok Shin, right, 10 years ago . After three trials, Benguit, 39, was jailed for life in 2005 for the murder of Jong-Ok Shin, 26, known as Oki. The main prosecution witness, a . heroin user and prostitute, had said Benguit and two men flagged down . her car on the night of the murder on July 12, 2002. She says she drove Benguit close to the spot where Oki was killed and he later returned covered in blood. But Benguit’s defence team checked . footage from a CCTV camera trained on the road close to the murder scene . that the witness insisted she drove along. Jailed: Danilo Restivo, left, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the death of 16-year-old Elisa Claps, right . They examined 20 minutes either side of the time of the attack and say they found no trace of the car on the film. The Mail on Sunday can also reveal . that lawyers have obtained a pathologist’s report that demonstrates that . Oki’s wounds are consistent with the knife found on Restivo, 39, when . he was arrested in 2004. Doubts over the safety of the . Benguit’s conviction have long existed and the Criminal Cases Review . Commission is now investigating whether Restivo killed Oki. Concerns about Benguit’s conviction . intensified after Restivo – who lived close to Oki – was jailed for life . in June last year for the murder in 2002 of seamstress Heather Barnett, . 48, in Bournemouth. Dorset Police last night declined to comment on the new CCTV evidence. Des Jensen, who is part of Benguit's legal team, said: 'We are confident it will be sent to the Court of Appeal.' Benguit's sister Amy Benguit said: . 'Everything is in the CCRC's hands and we have got to be patient . because they have got to carry out their own investigation. 'Omar is feeling very positive. He . will never ever say he did something if he didn't. He said he would . rather come out in a coffin than admit to something he didn't do. 'I know he will be handed leave to . appeal. A lot of mistakes were made along the way. I don't really want . to blame anyone - all we want is justice for Omar and Oki.' Barry Loveday, a reader of criminal justice studies at Portsmouth University, has spent months investigating Miss Shin's murder. He said: 'There are similarities in . Oki Shin's killing and Danilo Restivo's modus operandi, like the use of a . very long bladed knife. Discovery: The decomposed body of Elisa was found on the roof of the Santa Trinita Church in Potenza, Italy, pictured, last year . 'The likelihood of two killers . wandering around with similar knives three streets apart in Charminster . at about the same time is very, very small. 'The likelihood of two murders by two individuals three streets and four months apart is frankly unbelievable. 'One must conclude that one can probably link up the murder of Oki Shin to Danilo Restivo as well.' Restivo arrived in Britain in . March 2002 and was placed under intense surveillance since he became a . suspect in Miss Barnett's murder soon after her death. The house in Bournemouth, Dorset, where Heather Barnett was found murdered in 2002 . When previously asked whether . Restivo was responsible for any other killings, Detective Superintendent . Stuart Cooper said: 'As far as we're aware there are no other victims - . we're not actively looking for or concerned about anyone else. 'Restivo arrived in Britain in March . 2002, Heather was killed in November and we've been watching him . carefully since then - it's a relatively short window of time. 'I don't think you can ever be totally . sure but without any credible evidence to say there are further . suspicions it's difficult to say.' Asked whether Dorset police would . be re-opening the Oki Shin murder, a spokesman said: 'Omar Benguit was . convicted of Oki Shin's murder. He lodged and appeal and that was . dismissed.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 04:45 EST, 6 July 2012 . Los Angeles County is set to vote on whether to follow the city in making condom use obligatory for pornographic actors. The move comes after AIDS campaigners said they had collected 360,000 signatures backing a new law, enough for a November ballot. Michael Weinstein, president of AIDS Healthcare Foundation, one of five groups which spearheaded the poll, said turnout was likely to be high as it would coincide with the White House elections. Safety first: A law making condoms compulsory for porn actors in Los Angeles could be rolled out across LA County if voters choose to do so in November . 'This ordinance, modeled after the . County's similar health-permitting process for tattoo and massage . parlors and bathhouses, should go a long way to improve safety on the . sets for adult film performers.' Much of the U.S. porn movie industry is based in the San Fernando Valley north of Los Angeles. Mr Weinstein said: 'We are extremely . pleased to learn that our County of Los Angeles ballot measure to . require adult film producers to obtain public health permits has . successfully qualified for the November ballot. Using condoms on set would be a . requirement of any permit issued, whether the shoot was in a studio or . elsewhere, Weinstein said. Clamping down: According to one campaigner, using condoms on set would be a requirement of any permit issued, whether in a studio or elsewhere . He noted that the City of Los Angeles . already voted in January to require porn actors to wear condoms on set, . the latest move in a battle between AIDS activists and the US adult film . industry.' We look forward to taking this measure directly to voters throughout the County of Los Angeles in November,' he added. California porn film makers were . forced to suspend production temporarily last year after an actor tested . positive for HIV, the virus which causes AIDS, in the latest such . disruption to the multi-billion-dollar industry. Film L.A. Inc., which issues permits . for film companies shooting in the West Coast city, said about five per . cent of the 45,500 permit days the agency issues per year are for . pornographic film shoots. Confident: Michael Weinstein, president of AIDS Healthcare Foundation, said turnout was likely to be high as it would coincide with the White House elections . Authorities in Los Angeles were . expected to start enforcing the condom ban in the city from this month . after the council gave police, the city attorney and the porn industry . six months to recommend the best way to enforce it. There has been debate about the best . way to do this, with some suggesting health professionals or even the . police should be present on sets. To shoot a movie outside of a studio, the law requires a film permit and condom use. The larger porn companies that make . the movies on studio soundstages don't need permits and therefore are . exempt from the condom requirement. These filmmakers, however, would need one if they went to a house in a neighbourhood to shoot a scene. The cost of the inspections would be . paid out of fees the filmmakers would pay when applying for permits. Fees mooted range from $50 to $75. Filmmakers who are caught violating the requirement would be refused future permits. The question was posed whether smaller . companies, which often shoot films at houses in the San Fernando Valley . before moving on after a day or two, will pay any attention. Industry officials say the law isn't needed and that their audiences find the use of condoms a turnoff. They said the industry's own requirement, that actors be tested for sexually transmitted diseases every 30 days, is sufficient.","AIDS groups secure signatures for a November ballot .

Effective psychological therapies exist but are not widely available, the report by the Mental Health Policy Group from the London School of Economics (LSE) found. Two-fifths of patients suffering from anxiety or depression can recover if they are treated by means such as cognitive behavioural therapy. The authors say that if such treatments were more widely available, it would cost the NHS little or nothing because it would produce savings in other healthcare areas. Mental illness can manifest itself in physical symptoms and the group of experts estimate such symptoms cost the NHS at least £10 billion. Much of this money would be better spent on psychological therapies, they claim. 'Despite the existence of cost-effective treatments it (mental illness) receives only 13 per cent of NHS expenditure,' they write. 'The under-treatment of people with crippling mental illness is the most glaring cause of health inequality in our country.' One third of families have a member who is currently suffering from a mental illness, they say. It accounts for nearly half of absenteeism at work and mental illness accounts for nearly half of people on incapacity benefits. The authors, who include doctors, psychologists, NHS managers and economists, condemn local health commissioners for inappropriately using allocated mental health funding and say that in some areas mental health provisions are being cut. The authors also recommend better training of GPs and suggest that recruitment into psychiatry should be increased. They also call for an “imperative” upgrade of specialist help to provide children with affective therapies, as there are 700,000 children in Britain with behavioural problems, anxiety or depression. Professor Lord Layard of the LSE Centre for Economic Performance said that mental health is so prevalent in society that it deserves its own cabinet minister. He said: 'If local NHS commissioners want to improve their budgets, they should all be expanding their provision of psychological therapy. 'It will save them so much on their physical healthcare budgets that the net cost will be little or nothing. 'Mental health is so central to the health of individuals and of society that it needs its own cabinet minister.' The report concludes: 'Mentally ill people are particularly vulnerable. 'They are often afraid to seek help or even say they are unwell, and so are their relatives. But they represent nearly one half of all health-related suffering in this country. 'Within the NHS they represent the greatest areas of unmet need among adults and children.' Mental health charities welcomed the report. Sane chief executive Marjorie Wallace said: 'We are at an all-time low in the response of mental health services to people with severely disabling mental illness. 'While the Government has put money into psychological therapies, on the other hand resources are being drained from the fundamental care and treatment of people in crisis, those in need of in-patient care such as the suicidal, and those in the community where the cuts are depriving them of the few things that make their lives more tolerable, such as day centres, clubs, activities and occupation. 'We support Lord Layard’s call to action, before there are too many casualties and the services become too fragmented to help them.' Mental Health Foundation chief executive Dr Andrew McCulloch added: 'The report underlines the fact that mental health remains a poor relation to physical health despite the major links between depression, diabetes and heart disease, for example. 'We have to tackle a situation where only 25 per cent of people with common forms of mental illness are receiving treatment and where there is massive under-investment in mental health research.' The Royal College of General Practitioners said that GPs are facing an 'upward spiral' of patients suffering from mental illness. Professor Clare Gerada, chair of the RCGP, added: 'GPs face tremendous challenges in caring for patients with mental health problems in primary care and we welcome any development which will help us improve their care. 'Talking therapies have the potential to transform thousands of patients’ lives and we applaud Lord Layard and his team for their efforts to extend the programme further. 'This would be a major step forward, not only for patients, but for GPs and other health professionals working in mental health.' Sarah Brennan, chief executive of Young Minds, said: 'Lord Layard is right to highlight how mental health is often the Cinderella service of the NHS. Yet the picture is even worse for children and young people’s mental health where for every pound spent by the NHS less than a penny is spent on Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services. 'Getting it right for children when they are young plays a key part in reducing the number of people who suffer with mental illness throughout their lives.' Care Services Minister Paul Burstow said: 'Mental ill-health costs £105 billion per year and I have always been clear that it should be treated as seriously as physical health problems. 'We will shortly publish our plans to make sure the NHS, councils, voluntary organisations and others can play their part in improving the nation’s mental health. 'The Coalition Government is investing £400 million to make sure talking therapies are available to people of all ages who need them. 'This investment is already delivering remarkable results.'",NHS spends just 13 per cent of its budget on mental health .

A trio of stunning New York apartments once owned by reclusive heiress Huguette Clark have gone on sale for $55million. The flats, described as 'diamonds in the rough' requiring 'significant work', are said to be 'a time capsule from New York's Gilded Age'. All located at 907 Fifth Avenue, 72nd Street, they have a combined 42 rooms - two of them taking up the 10,000 sq ft eighth floor and a 5,000 sq ft flat that takes up half of the top 12th floor. They overlook Central Park's Conservatory Water, the sailboat pond where the mouse Stuart Little sailed in the EB White story, which is near the statute of Alice in Wonderland. Their sale come as a legal battle over the 104-year-old's $400million estate begins - because she created two contrasting wills before her death in May last year. The first, signed when she was 98, left almost everything to her family. The second, made just six weeks later, made plans for an art museum in California, a $36million donation to her nurse and handed a $40million Monet to the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington. Stunning: The apartments may need a bit of work, but pictures showing their former resplendence show how desirable they are . Central: The three flats are all in this building on New York's Fifth Avenue . Room with a view: Clark's three apartments overlook Central Park's Conservatory Water, the pond where mouse Stuart Little sailed in the EB White story, near the statute of Alice in Wonderland . It also detailed smaller gifts to her godchild, doctor, attorney and accountant - and led to her family accusing them of colluding to influence her will. Money from the sale will first pay estate expenses, with the remainder going to the winner of the court battle. Clark also owned a $100million ocean front estate in Santa Barbara, Californa, and a $24million country home in New Canaan, Conn. Interior pictures of the apartments have not yet been released as Clark's possessions, including collections of dolls and fine paintings, are still being cleared. Desirable: Apartment 8W is one of the two available on the eighth floor, with brokers saying that if the two were bought together they could be knocked into one super flat .

Chris Christie showed his pop culture chops and channeled the Seinfeld-Newman rivalry on a YouTube video posted on his page. In the three minute video, Christie is thwarted, time and time again by Newark Mayor Cory Booker, who last month rescued a neighbour from a burning building. Scroll down for videos . Hello! Gov Christie, back right, posted a Seinfeld spoof where he is Newman and Newark Mayor Cory Booker, left, is Seinfeld . Newman: Christie tries to volunteer his services, but is always thwarted by Booker in the video . Heroics: The video also gives a nod to Booker's helpful nature - last month, he saved a woman from a burning building . The parody spoofs the mayor's storybook heroics and Christie's vice presidential potential. Christie finds himself thwarted at do-gooding by Booker, who is always two steps ahead of the Republican governor. The video, which played at Tuesday's New Jersey Press Association's Legislative Correspondents Club show, shows Christie asking a New Jersey state trooper for good deeds to do. ‘You guys got any problems you want me to handle, like a fire anywhere, people trapped?’ the New Jersey governor asks. ‘Maybe a cat in a tree?’ The trooper shakes his head and tells him there is nothing happening. Moments later, Booker turns up and assuredly tells Christie: ‘Governor, I got this!’ Clash of the titans: Newman, a disgruntled postal worker, and Seinfeld had an embattled relationship throughout the long-running NBC series . I got this: Booker popped up everywhere, and even helped Christie change a flat tire on his car - only enraging the Republican governor, who muttered 'Booker' in Seinfeld fashion . When Christie’s Cadillac gets a flat, there Booker is, telling him 'I got this' with jack in hand. Booker later helps Bruce Springsteen replace a missing guitar (‘I always carry a spare’) and Tebows after catching a baby dropped from a state Capitol balcony before Christie's eyes. Each time, Christie grits his teeth and laments: 'Booker!' Booker is then shown on a phone telling Mitt Romney he wouldn't make a good running mate, saying: ‘Yes, that was me running into the fire. Yes, I do shovel snow as well. ‘Yes, you’re very persuasive, but I’m not a number two guy. I’m not a background singer.’ Christie grabs the receiver, saying: 'Excuse me mayor, I got this.' Seinfeld and Newman had a tumultuous relationship throughout the entirely of the NBC comedy. The jaded postal worker, played by Wayne Knight, was always coming up with schemes to outdo neighbour Jerry Seinfeld. At the ready: Booker offered Bruce Springsteen an extra guitar . Face off: While Christie couldn't keep up with Booker's good deeds, Booker conversely was no match for playing veep to Mitt Romney . The New Jersey governor has had his fair share of comedy in the past month. At the White House Correspondents’ Dinner last month, host Jimmy Kimmel singled out Christie for his waistline. Kimmel had joked: ‘You know, they say that inside every American governor is a president struggling to get out. In Chris Christie’s case, it’s the only one where you can still hear him screaming.’ But the jokes didn’t’ stop there. Kimmel said: ‘Gov. Christie, I think you might be misunderstanding New Jersey’s slogan – it’s not the Olive Garden state.’ Not to be outdone, Christie fired back a few days after the dinner, saying: ‘(When you have Sofia Vergara) next to you do console you… you don’t care what the heck Jimmy Kimmel said.’ The Modern Family actress shared a table with him during the night’s festivities. Jokers: Booker and Christie have always had a jovial relationship - here, they're pictured in 2011 sharing a laugh . Last laugh: At last month's White House Correspondents' Dinner, Jimmy Kimmel poked fun at Christie's weight, but the governor fired back, saying he was at least sitting next to Sofia Vergara .

A grieving mother whose son was brutally murdered by a gang as he played football has pledged to sell her family heirlooms to give his killers a better life when they leave jail. Forgiving Fatemah Golmakani, 56, will 'hug them and kiss them and hold their hands, and tell them that someone loves them,' despite the four attackers stabbing her son Milad to death in north London last year in a tit-for-tat gang attack. Sean Hutton, Sean Ferdinand, Mohammed Hashi, all 19, and Lij McSween, 17, were all jailed last month for life, and must all serve between 19 and 22 years before release. Happier times: Fatemah Golmakani and her beloved son Milad, who was stabbed to death by a violent gang his mother has now pledged to help . But through a charity set up in her son's memory Mrs Golmakani says she will then take them 'to Europe, to eat good food, wear nice clothes, show them what life is really about.' 22-year-old Milad had been playing football last April with friends on an estate basketball court in West Hampstead, London, when his killers, all wearing black jackets with hoods pulled over their faces, arrived by minicab. In the space of three minutes they knifed Milad 14 times in the neck, back and buttocks and stabbed another youth in the shoulder. The gang then left in the same taxi they arrived in and returned to a church barbecue on their own territory in Kentish Town. Killers: Lij McSween, top left, Sean Hutton, top right, Mohammed Hashi, bottom left, and Sean Ferdinand, bottom right, were all jailed for life for murdering Milad Golmakani in April last year . More than a year after her son’s murder, his room remains untouched. 'I can’t bring my son back but what I can do is forgive his murderers to begin to take the weight off myself. It’s the only way I can start coming to terms with it,' she said. 'What these men didn’t realise was that when they murdered my son, all their hopes and dreams were buried in Milad’s grave with him. All that went away when they killed my son, so really when we buried Milad we buried these murderers too. Attacked: Milad, pictured, was stabbed 14 times all over his body by a gang intent on killing him . 'Those boys would have been at work, and then by the time they were back their minds and bodies would be too tired to kill. This charity will be a present to the killers. I want to help them look for jobs, and I want to make dinner for them like their own mothers should have done. 'Maybe then they’ll go back home and teach their own parents what they should have been taught years ago.' Her son was taken to hospital with a punctured lung but was pronounced dead hours after the attack. His friend Zain Salahuddin was stabbed twice in the right shoulder when he tripped and fell trying to escape the gang. He managed to get up and find safety in the basement of a nearby food and wine store. Speaking during the court case, Prosecutor Neil Moore said: ‘Despite the warm weather they were all wearing jackets with their hoods up over their heads and they had at some stage concealed about their persons at least two knives. ‘The purpose of their trip was to seek out and attack Milad Golmakani and his friends.'","Grieving parent Fatemah Golmakani pledges to 'hug them and kiss them and hold their hands, and tell them that someone loves them.'

Russell Brand could face deportation from the United States and a subsequent ban if he is convicted of felony criminal damage. It's all heavily dependent on his immigration status, and the outcome when the case gets to court. If a judge finds him guilty of an aggravated felony, which could include the theft of the phone he snatched before hurling it through a window in New Orleans, Russell may face a jail term. Mugshot: Russell Brand has been arrested for criminal damage after 'throwing iPhone through window' If this is the case, his status in the US could be considered given that he isn't a US citizen. Brand, 36 , was planning to go down . the naturalization route as the spouse of an American, and based a stand . up show around it last Autumn. His Los Angeles show at the Elephant . theatre in Hollywood saw him ask the audience to help him pass the test . so he could stay with his wife. The comic may even ruefully reflect about how he joked about persuading the US to accept a man with his reputation. Booking sheet: Russell has been arrested for Simple Criminal Damage to Property in New Orleans . The route to citizenship for a spouse . takes three years but this increases to five for an immigrant who is . not married to an American. Judge Cristina Pérez told Mail Online: 'If Russell is on a work visa and is found guilty of a felony, it would almost certainly affect his future in the US. 'Immigration law is complicated and any offence deemed an aggravated felony can result in deportation and a ban for immigrant professionals. 'However, Russell's legal team aren't likely to let it get that far, and will be preparing to argue for the incident to be reduced to a misdemeanor, this is almost certainly what will happen in this case in my opinion.' They need to have lived in the US with a green card for five years, which Russell hasn't yet chalked up. Of course, he could be found not guilty, or guilty of just felony. The authorities are also likely to take into account Russell's unique abilities as an entertainer. This contribution to culture could balance out this incident to ensure he stays in the United States. He may have suffered the humiliation . of being arrested in New Orleans yesterday, but he wasn't about to go to . ground in the southern city. Indeed, . the renowned ladies man, back on the prowl again since his marriage . break up, was parading himself around the streets of the city's . hedonistic French Quarter last night. Affixed to his side was the current . ubiquitous brunette, who had formed part of his entourage earlier in the . day as he left the sheriff's office. Lost love: Russell spoke about how he wanted to become US citizen to be with his now estranged wife Katy Perry for good at an LA show in October . TMZ spotted the indefatigable Brit as he soaked up the atmosphere in the lively area, which they describe as: 'party central.' Earlier in the day, his mugshot had been released. With his head tilted softly to the . side, and a flattering light highlighting his soft expression, one could . be forgiven for thinking this were another promotional photo for the . popular actor. The 36-year-old comedian turned himself in to police in New Orleans Sheriff's office yesterday after learning he was wanted by officers. According to TMZ, Russell was charged on two counts of simple criminal damage to property. He was then released after posting a reported $5000 bail. Russell's camp were quick to make . amends and have reportedly paid $240 to the photographer over the . incident, according to the website. Entourage: Russell was met by a large group of people as he was released yesterday . The . comedian was seen leaving the police station with his mystery female . friend who he has been spending increasing time with in recent months - . she was also present when the incident took place on Monday. The New Orleans police told website TMZ they issued a misdemeanor warrant for the his arrest on Wednesday night. The comedian, who is in the city to film an untitled feature with Juliette Hough, was accused of . snatching a paparazzo's mobile phone and angrily hurling it through a . pane of glass in New Orleans on Monday night. Top hat: The actor still looked dapper despite his temporary stay behind bars . Russell has since offered a . bizarre defence for allegedly throwing the iPhone through the window - . saying he was honouring Steve Jobs. In . an apparent confession, he claims his apparent fit of temper was . because he believed the way the photographer was using his smartphone . dishonoured the memory of the recently deceased Apple CEO. He said: 'Since Steve Jobs died I cannot bear to see anyone use an iphone irreverently, what I did was a tribute to his memory.' Inspecting the damage: A police officer was spotted investigating the incident in New Orleans on Monday night . Snatched: Russell was spotted apparently grabbing the iPhone on Monday . Brand was reported by photographer Timothy Jackson, who is accusing the Get Him To The Greek star of criminal damages. He . told officers he was with a group of other photographers, and had began . to take pictures of the star with his iPhone from his car. He claims the angry funnyman lost his . temper, grabbed the phone from of his hand, and threw it through the . window of a local law firm. Damage control: It has been reported that a production assistant on Russell's film offered $240 on his behalf to repair the broken window . According to TMZ, a man who was inside the office during the incident said people connected to the actor tried to smooth things over with him after the incident. Brand's representative acknowledged he had thrown the phone, and a production assistant on the star's movie allegedly turned up with $240 to replace the damaged window.

Chris Evans, seen here playing in a previous Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, has been banned for taking part in future events . Radio DJ Chris Evans has been 'barred for life' from golf’s most glamorous celebrity tournament – after apparently giving himself too generous a handicap to help him win last year's tournament. The broadcaster won the Alfred . Dunhill Links Championship last October with professional playing . partner Nick Dougherty but their 40-under par performance over four rounds raised . eyebrows. And now three months before he was due . to defend the title he won last year, it has emerged that he will not be . allowed to defend his title. Evans, 46, and event organisers refused to fully explain why he has been banned but it emerged last night that it may be the result of Evans’s handicap for last year. His handicap was 10 - meaning he can take ten shots off his actual score to give a 'net score' that counts towards the final result - and he claimed after the win that he was given the impression organisers believed it was too high to reflect his ability. Those who saw him play suggested that he should not have been allowed so many shots. Evans said this weekend: ‘Sadly, I will not be defending my title this year. Why? It transpires I’ve been barred for life. ‘I could go into why but frankly it’s all a bit of a bore. Suffice to say, if we were kids in the playground, the boy who owns the ball just took it home in a huff because his team didn’t win.’ The annual event pro-am event sees teams of one professional and one celebrity playing rounds at each of the Old Course at St Andrews, the Championship course at Carnoustie and world-class Kingsbarns, in Fife. Celebrities such as actors Michael Douglas, Hugh Grant and Samuel L Jackson regularly participate in the Scottish event. And yesterday, Evans was still featuring on the tournament’s website - and talking with delight about the victory. This time last year, writing in his column in the Mail On Sunday’s Live magazine, the broadcaster revealed there had been ‘rumblings of dissent’. He wrote: ‘Along with congratulations, there were rumblings of dissent. The gloaming was dark with talk of my handicap being too high for my ability.’ Life ban: Chris Evans, pictured here with his wife Natasha at last years tournament, said he thought of setting up an alternative tournament . The Alfred Dunhill Links Championships always attracts its fair share of . celebrities, including actors  and keen golfers Samuel L Jackson and . Bill Murray . Chris Evans play in the tournament off a handicap of ten, meaning he expects to go round a golf course in ten shots over par. In the Alfred Dunhill tournament the team score for each hole is the lower score of each pair, with the handicap taken into consideration. As the pairings are made up of one amateur and one professional, the amateurs receive a stroke allowance equal to two thirds of their handicap, suggesting Evans normally plays off 15. For the tournament he would have been given one shot on the course's ten hardest holes (those given a stroke index 1 to 10) each round - or a total of 40 over the whole tournament. So on a par 5, Evans and Dougherty might have both taken four shots, but if it was recognised as one of the six hardest holes, Evans' score would be a net three - or two under par for the hole. This is how they were able to run up net scores of 66, 57, 64 and 61 (against par of 72) for a total of 40-under pair, leaving organisers suggesting that a handicap allowing Evans 24 shots was a little generous. But he is not alone, suspect high handicaps are the subject of much debate in golf clubs around the country. Players who claim to have a higher handicap than their ability suggests are branded 'bandits'. The broadcaster also revealed he was . the butt of jokes and asked: ‘Where did you get your handicap? Mexico’ and ‘Where did you leave your sombrero?’ ‘They were references to my 'bandit' status,’ he added. Evans . went on: ‘OK, so we finished 40 under par, which I’ve never heard of . before, but that was combination of mine and Nick’s best score on each . hole. ‘And when you consider the leading professional finished 22 under, I don’t think that’s entirely incredible.’ Shane Warne with Elizabeth Hurley and her son Damian during the event last year . Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas have also taken part in the celebrity pro-am event . But Evans’s banishment has still come as a ‘shock’ because he had booked his holidays to coincide with this year’s tournament. The former TFI Friday star said: ‘Because of Radio 2’s complicated schedules I have to book my holidays a year in advance. So I now have two weeks in October and nowhere to go.’ In spite of the ban, the broadcaster kept joking, suggesting he is considering setting up a rival competition for his golfing and celebrity pals. He said:  ‘Any sour grapes? Not really. But it crossed my mind to set up an alternative tournament on the exact same dates. ‘I think I’ll call it the Dung Hill Cup.’ A spokesman for the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship said: ‘We have no comment to make.’And a spokesman for the European Tour added: ‘ We have no involvement in the celebrity invitations for this tournament.’ Actor Hugh Grant is a regular fixture at the golf tournament .","Following rumblings of discontent over his handicap at Alfred Dunhill Links Championship .

An international child pornography ring that produced and distributed sexually explicit images of babies and toddlers online has been cracked, the FBI said today. Seven American men have been convicted and sentenced on various charges in the case, including three who were sentenced in federal court in Indianapolis on Wednesday, the U.S. attorney's office said. Two more who pleaded guilty were awaiting sentencing. Depraved: Operation Bulldog has cracked a child porn ring which had images of babies and toddlers being sexually abused, the FBI said in Indiana today . Assistant U.S. Attorney General Lanny Breuer said: 'This operation uncovered a dangerous and depraved group of criminals who were devoted to trading sexually explicit images of children under the age of five.' More than 20 suspects have been captured in nine states, and authorities are investigating yet more elsewhere in the U.S., as well as Sweden, Serbia, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. First Assistant U.S. Attorney Josh Minkler said at an Indianapolis news conference that more than two dozen young children in Indiana, other states and other countries were abused in the production of the pornography. 'Children who far too often weren't old enough to comprehend the crimes committed against them,' Minkler said. 'Children who were raped in this state and were too young to ask for help.' Operation Bulldog came to light in November 2010 with the arrest of David Bostic, 26. Federal, state and local investigators . raided Bostic's home in Bloomington, Indiana, and found hundreds of . images and videos on his computer of children between the ages of two . months and four years engaged in sexual acts. Busted: Assistant U.S. Attorney-General Lanny Breuer announced the arrest of more than 20 paedophiles today as part of porn sting Operation Bulldog . He was later convicted on 65 counts and sentenced to 315 years in prison. Further investigation of Bostic's computer led investigators to others in the group. Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve DeBrota said the members met though a website and traded videos and still images by email. He said: 'When they found a like-minded individual with this particular attraction that was very powerful and helped them rationalize what they were doing – in their world – was OK. 'That ability to find a like-minded individual online that you couldn't find in the real world is a severe danger that comes with the Internet.' Shawn Kuykendall, 32, of Summerville, South Carolina, was sentenced on Wednesday to 25 years, while 23-year-old Javahn Algere, of New Orleans, got 12 years and 21-year-old Richard Szulborski, of East Texas, Pennsylvania, was sentenced to a 15-year term. Sentenced earlier were Bostic; Danny L Druck, 58, of Louisville, Kentucky, eight years; Chris Reid, 37, of Saginaw, Michigan, 35 years; Todd King, 41, of Crestline, California, eight years. Nicholas King, 28, of Bellingham, Washington, and 22-year-old Jeremy Labrec, of Lubbock, Texas, have pleaded guilty and await sentencing. Assistant attorney-general Breuer said: 'Child pornography rings pose a threat to children around the world and we will continue to aggressively investigate and prosecute those who participate in such groups.'

It was carried out at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, where the boy was recovering in the cardiac intensive care unit. Scroll down for video . Brave: Young actor Max Page speaks of his apprehensions at a press conference ahead of yesterday's operation to have a pulmonary valve replaced in his heart at Children's Hospital in Los Angeles . The Force: Page shot to fame in 'The Force' Volkswagen commercial, which was one of the most talked about ads of 2011's Super Bowl. In the ad, he fails to move the family's dog, the washing machine and his sister's doll using his powers . Max, who plays Reed on the CBS soap . opera The Young and the Restless, was born with a congenital heart . defect and has undergone multiple surgeries. The valve used for Max will last about 15 years and won't require invasive surgery to replace it, according to the hospital. He was expected to be released in about five days, a hospital spokesman said. He faces six to eight weeks of recovery. Jennifer Page, his mother, said . there's been an outpouring of support and kindness and that Max and the . family welcome all 'prayers and encouragement.' Max's parents and his younger brother, Els, were at the hospital with him. He was in good spirits the night before the operation, making everyone . laugh, his father, Buck Page, said in a family statement.

'Max wanted to hold his brother's hand, and Max said to Els, ""It's OK, I'm not scared."" 'He just wanted to hold our hands and his stuffed animals. He was much calmer than we were,' Jennifer Page said. Earlier this week, Max said he had steeled himself for the operation when he spoke at a press conference. 'I kind of know I have to go through . it, and don't have an option, so I choose a good attitude,' said Max, . who serves as a junior ambassador for the hospital. 'I'll feel weak after this, but it will get better and better. I think I know it will be a good thing to go through this.' Max Page shot to national fame in 2011 when he appeared in a Volkswagen car commercial that had him dressed as a mini Darth Vader from Star Wars trying to use 'The Force' The boy's mother, Jennifer Page, told reporters on Wednesday that Max was informed on Sunday he would need the surgery. 'He took the time to cry and be scared, and jumped on board with a positive attitude,' she said. Little Max, who carried a stuffed whale, shared with reporters some 'Star Wars' wisdom ahead of his surgery. 'The Force can really achieve anything,' said Max. The boy's heart valve has deteriorated, said Dr. Vaughn Starnes, the cardiothoracic surgeon at the hospital who will perform the procedure. That is creating a problem for the heart to empty out into the pulmonary arteries, which is why the operation is set to give Max a new valve. According to an email from Max’s mother, Jennifer, the young actor started crying when he first learned about his upcoming operation. Max Page was positive ahead of his open-heart surgery which is scheduled for tomorrow . The email, released through the ad . agency that conceived the successful advert, revealed that the . seven-year-old was most scared of ‘blood draws, spending the night in . the hospital and hurting.’ However, . the cherubic looking boy soon put on a brave face reportedly telling . his mother: ‘I have to go through it. I don’t like it and it’s still . scary — but I have to. So I think I might as well go through it with a . good attitude.’ As an ambassador for the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, Max raises money for other children with heart defects. Page was first diagnosed with the . heart defect when he was a few months old and was later fitted with a . pacemaker, which keeps his heart beating at a regular rate.

A nun who planned to put up a 24ft high illuminated cross in her garden to stand as a symbol of 'hope' for neighbours has been thwarted by planners. Sister Mary Michael, 68, had intended to use the giant cross for three hours of daily prayers at her modest bungalow in North Hykeham, Linconshire. But planning officials have rejected the nun's proposals and described the planned Christian symbol as 'inappropriate'. Sister Mary Michael in the back garden of her home in North Hykeham, Lincolnshire where she had intended to put up a giant 7.38m cross . North Kesteven District Council agreed with neighbours who had complained about the LED-lit cross, saying it would 'have a harmful visual impact'. The 68-year-old has said she is disappointed but has no plans to fight the decision: 'You can't fight the council. I think the Devil is a bit easier really. Sister Mary included an example of what the illuminated cross would have looked like in her application to the council . The huge illuminated cross would have towered over the nun's rented bungalow, pictured, if the application had succeeded . 'I thought it would be lovely for people,' she added. Sister Mary planned to hold daily prayer meetings with fellow worshipers at her rented bungalow in the quiet cul-de-sac. However, her initial planning application attracted widespread opposition from nearby residents with 19 formal objections lodged with the local authority. And even an anti-light pollution group - the Campaign for Dark Skies - objected to the proposed lighting on the cross. The proposed cross would have towered over the nun's property - but the application has hit a brick wall after being rejected by planners . Sister Mary had planned for the cross to stand as a 7.38m replica of the enormous 'Glorious Cross of Dozule'. But as well as facing problems with planners, the nun also appeared to have funding difficulties after only managing to raise £20 towards the cost of the cross which would have towered over her home. A neighbour who voiced concerns about the giant cross said she had no objections to the Christian symbol but was concerned about the LED-illumination. Betty Snell, whose property backs on to the proposed site of the cross, said: 'I object to it because of the height and the fact that it will be illuminated. Sister Mary hit the headlines when she protested against movie The Da Vinci Code by holding a 12 hour . vigil with Gerard Fox, 31, infront of Lincoln Cathedral where scenes . from the film were shot . A spokesman for the Diocese of Nottingham has described Sister Mary Michael as a 'one-woman order' 'The fact it is a religious symbol is irrelevant, it is the size of it and that it will be lit up.' In the notice refusing planning permission, the local council went on to say the cross would 'represent an...intrusive feature within (a) wholly residential area.' Sister Mary also hit the headlines in 2006 after travelling from Lincolnshire to the Cannes Film Festival to protest at the premiere of the movie The Da Vinci Code. She attracted international attention for the protest and also appeared in the world's media after kneeling on the steps of Lincoln Cathedral as the movie was being filmed inside. She claims to belong to Our Lady’s Community of Peace and Mercy in Lincoln. But the Roman Catholic Church has said Sister Mary is not ‘canonically recognised’ even if she does do ‘good works’. She is known to have spent three years with a closed Carmelite order in Cornwall, but decided to continue wearing a slightly modified habit despite no longer being a fully-fledged nun. A spokesman for the Diocese of Nottingham, in which she lives, said she was now a ‘maverick’ and a ‘one-woman order’.","Sister Mary Michael, 68, had hoped to use the giant cross for three hours of daily prayers at her modest rented bungalow in North Hykeham, Lincolnshire .

North Korea is armed with ‘powerful modern weapons’ capable of defeating the United States with a ‘single blow’, a military chief warned today. Vice Marshal Ri Yong Ho emphasised the importance of strengthening the military to defend the Communist state against threats it sees from the U.S. and South Korea. He called his nation a nuclear and military power and praised new leader Kim Jong Un, believed to be in his late 20s, as a ‘military strategist’ who has been giving the army guidance for years. Big guns: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, right, with his military advisers Vice Marshal Choe Ryong Hae, center, and Vice Marshal Ri Yong Ho, who claimed the country could defeat the U.S. with a single missile strike . ‘The Korean People's Army is armed with powerful modern weapons ... that can defeat the (U.S.) imperialists at a single blow,’ he told party and military officials, using familiar descriptions of the country's rivals. The meeting, attended by Kim Jong Un, was held to mark the 80th anniversary of the army's founding. It comes amid increased speculation abroad about the nation's missile arsenal and nuclear ambitions. Ri, who is chief of the army's General Staff, did not provide further details about North Korea's weapons, but his call to arms comes as the United States, Britain and others warn the nation against a provocation that would further heighten tensions.

A paralysed man who goes to court tomorrow to win the right to die is at the centre of an extraordinary Twitter campaign to get him to change his mind. Days after Tony Nicklinson – who can communicate only by moving his eyelids – posted his first tweet, strangers from around the world have begun bombarding him with pro-life messages. Tweets to Mr Nicklinson, which can be seen publicly, state ‘God loves you’ and try to persuade him to ‘hang in there’. One urges him that he must change his mind, if not for himself, ‘for your children’. Court plea: Tony Nicklinson, 58, pictured with his wife Jane, suffers from 'locked-in' syndrome will find out later if the High Court has thrown out his case seeking a right to assisted suicide . Mr Nicklinson, 58, is seeking to make . legal history by challenging the Government over the right to die. He . has suffered from locked-in syndrome since a stroke on a business trip . in Athens in 2005. While his . mind was unaffected, his condition has meant he has spent most of the . past seven years alone in his room and unable to communicate with family . and friends. In a landmark . case, he and his family are due to go to the High Court to argue that a . doctor should lawfully be allowed to end his life. Mr . Nicklinson began using social networking site Twitter on Wednesday. His . first message read: ‘Hello world. I am Tony Nicklinson, I have . locked-in syndrome and this is my first ever tweet.’ It . is thought that he is the first person in the world to tweet with his . eyelids, using a computer system which tracks his blinks to translate . his thoughts into written words. His posts have provided a fascinating insight into the life of someone trapped inside their own body. Response: Strangers from around the world have contacted Tony Nicklinson with pro-life messages . Campaign: Within days of posting his first tweet, people began contacting Tony Nicklinson, who has 'locked-in syndrome', with pro-life messages . In one, he wrote: ‘Just had an old . school friend call in for a chat with us but mostly Jane [his wife] . because she can speak. Still, it was nice to see him.’ He amassed almost 14,000 followers in . just five days – but while some have supported his fight, many who . believe he should not be allowed to ask a doctor to kill him have used . the site to try convince him to change his mind. One . user, writing under the name @llanguages, wrote: ‘Hi Tony, I will pray . that you will reconsider as every life is a celebration. If not for . yourself, do it for your children.’ Another added: ‘Everything happens for a reason. Please Tony, fight to live.’ One . Twitter user from the US has started sending him links to websites for . charities which offer physical therapy to help those suffering from . paralysis. Another wrote: ‘You hang in there and do what’s right’, while many messages mentioned the will of God. Urged: Tony Nicklinson has been bombarded with messages on Twitter urging him to change his mind about seeking the right to die . Sheila Marie King wrote: ‘God has a plan and a purpose why these [sic] happens in your life. Be a good example and an INSPIRATION to everyone.’ In response to the more supportive messages received by her father, Mr Nicklinson’s daughter Beth wrote on the site: ‘Loving how much support my dad @TonyNicklinson is getting. HIS choice, HIS life, HIS rights.’ At the High Court tomorrow, lawyers for Mr Nicklinson will argue that it is necessary to allow a doctor to kill him because forcing him to stay alive would be worse. Mr Nicklinson is too severely disabled to take his own life. Today in an article for The Times, Mr Nicklinson, who writes with the aid of eyeball-tracking computer technology, describes the extreme frustration he experiences. He said: 'At 8.30 the day-carers arrived and shaved, showered and dressed me, supervised my exercise and left. 'Being manhandled is a necessary part of the process and it reminded me of why I am going to court; I would hate all of this when I am old and would want a way to make it stop.' Among those who support the legal battle is neurologist Dr Stelios Doris, who saved Mr Nicklinson’s life after he had a stroke. On a Channel 4 Dispatches, programme about Mr Nicklinson’s case which will air tonight, Dr Doris said: ‘Death is more normal than to stay alive in this condition. So when I was informed that he was still alive I was surprised and sad also. I wouldn’t like for even for my worst enemy to stay alive in this condition for so many years.’ Earlier this year, an independent commission on assisted dying concluded for the first time that certain people should be helped to die. But this only applies to those who are terminally  ill and are able to take the final action to end their lives themselves – which excludes Mr Nicklinson. Some campaigners have objected to the way Mr Nicklinson has been bombarded with outspoken messages  on Twitter. A spokesman for campaign group Dignity in Dying, which does not entirely support Mr Nicklinson’s case, said they hoped ‘people will be respectful of Mr Nicklinson on Twitter regardless of whether they agree with him or not’.","Tony Nicklinson, 58, is seeking to make legal history by changing the Government's policy on assisted dying ."

The collapse in value of Facebook shares after the company's disastrous flotation on the stock market might be a sign of worse things to come. One senior investment analyst predicts that the firm will collapse in value and will virtually disappear within eight years. Eric Jackson of investment firm Ironfire Capital predicts that Facebook will collapse like ex-internet titans such as Yahoo, as it struggles to keep up with younger, leaner firms. Zuckerberg in the wake of the firm's recent disastrous IPO - but an analyst predicts things will get worse for the company . Speaking to the CNBC show Squawk on the Street, he said that Facebook would struggle with the 'modern', mobile web, and would disappear. ‘In five to eight years they are going to disappear in the way that Yahoo has disappeared. Yahoo is still making money, it’s still profitable, still has 13,000 employees working for it, but it’s 10 percent of the value that it was at the height of 2000. For all intents and purposes, it’s disappeared,’ said Jackson. The key to the impending disaster that Jackson predicts for the social networks is that it's falling between 'generations' of technology - and will struggle with moving into mobiles. Facebook has aggressively targeted mobile users with a range of new apps, but has struggled to make apps profitable without making advertising too intrusive. Jackson divides companies into three generations - web portals, such as Yahoo, social sites such as Facebook, and mobile companies, such as today's hot app start-ups. ‘When you look over these three generations, no matter how successful you are in one generation, you don’t seem to be able to translate that into success in the second generation, no matter how much money you have in the bank, no matter how many smart PhDs you have working for you,' says Jackson. Initial public flop: Shares of Facebook have fallen 30 percent since Zuckerberg proudly announced the $38 IPO of his social media giant . ‘Look at how Google has struggled moving into social, and I think Facebook is going to have the same kind of challenges moving into mobile.’ He continued, ‘The world is moving faster, it’s getting more competitive, not less, and I think those who are dominant in their prior generation are really going to have a hard time moving into this newer generation.’","Shares of the social media giant have dropped 30 percent to below $27 .

The information was revealed in a new genetic study of horses across Eastern Europe and Central Asia - which dated domestication to around 6,000 years ago, and a far narrower area than previously thought . One herd of horses tamed in the wide-open grasslands shared by Ukraine, southwest Russia and Kazakhstan could be the ancestor of all modern horses. The information was revealed in a new genetic study of horses across Eastern Europe and Central Asia - which dated domestication to around 6,000 years ago, and a far narrower area than previously thought. The research followed 16 years of collecting hair samples from more than 300 horses in Russia, China, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia and Lithuania - areas where horses were the first to be domesticated and weren't too heavily bred. Researchers generally date domestication to about 6,000 years ago, but genetic evidence taken from modern-day horses has suggested a wide variety of ancestors, raising the possibility that horses were tamed independently in several different places. The University of Cambridge's Vera Warmuth said she and her colleagues had used a combination of genetics and maths to narrow down the origin of horse domestication to the ‘western Eurasian steppe’ - an area now shared by Kazhakstan, southwest Russia and Ukraine. The research followed 16 years of collecting hair samples from more than 300 horses in Russia, China, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia and Lithuania - areas where horses were the first to be domesticated and weren't too heavily bred. Warmuth said that fellow researchers took hair samples from ‘local village-type horses,’ simple animals whose genetic profiles would be less likely to have been deformed by inbreeding or crossbreeding typical of their Western European cousins. She said the horses' genetic profiles were compared to various scenarios plugged into established mathematical models that measure how populations spread and change over time. The results suggested that the wide diversity of horse DNA could be explained by the frequent breeding of domesticated male horses with wild mares brought in by early horseback riders because ‘breeding with existing stock was too slow,’ Warmuth said, speculating that early societies might have used wild females ‘because they're a bit more tractable.’ A horse on the Russian plains today - researchers said ALL horses might be descended from a herd in the Russian steppes .

Parviz Sorouri, who sits on the powerful committee of foreign policy and national security, said agents had been operating with Israel's Mossad as well as other regional agencies, and targeted the country's military and its nuclear programme. ‘The U.S. and Zionist regime's espionage apparatuses were trying to damage Iran both from inside and outside with a heavy blow, using regional intelligence services,’ he was quoted as having said yesterday. ‘Fortunately, with swift reaction by the Iranian intelligence department, the actions failed to bear fruit.' He did not specify the nationality of the alleged agents, nor when or where they had been arrested. Concern has been growing in both Israel . and the U.S. at the prospect of a nuclear Iran and Tel Aviv has long . warned it might carry out a military strike on Iran's nuclear programme. Spying: The discovery damages U.S. attempts to track the activities of . Iran and its president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, right, and Hezbollah's Sheik . Hassan Nasrallah . A UN report earlier this month claimed . the country was on the verge of building an atomic which prompted a . strident response from Iran's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that the country would not . retreat 'one iota' from its nuclear programme. Hezbollah and Iran are among the CIA's toughest adversaries and have been improving their ability to hunt spies by relying on patience and guile to exploit holes. The number of CIA agents in Iran and Lebanon countries is classified - but Iran claimed in May it arrested at least 30 people allegedly linked to a CIA-run spy network. Hezbollah - backed by Iran - has built a professional counter-intelligence operation they proudly describe as the 'spy combat unit'. But the U.S. has had no diplomatic presence in Iran for 30 years and this makes the CIA's job of finding out what is happening on the ground all the more important. The report said Iran . could start building a nuclear bomb in a matter of months. The issue of what to do about Iran . has came to the fore in the U.S. political scene yesterday after Newt . Gingrich, frontrunner in the Republican presidential race, called for . regime change in the country. He said the U.S. and its allies could . ‘break’ the country within a year by cutting off the country’s fuel . supplies and sabotaging its sole oil refinery. He added that the U.S. should bomb Iran’s facilities to prevent it becoming a nuclear power, but only as a ‘last recourse’. His hawkish comments will alarm experts who have warned of catastrophic consequences if military action is taken against Iran. Iran periodically announces the capture . or execution of alleged U.S. or Israeli spies, and often no further . information is released. The announcement follows the unravelling by Lebanon's Hezbollah - an extremist Shiite Muslim group with close links to Iran - of a CIA spy ring in that country. Hezbollah's long-time leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, boasted in June on television he had unmasked at least two CIA spies who had infiltrated the ranks of the organisation. Though the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon officially denied the accusation, American officials conceded that Nasrallah wasn't lying and that Hezbollah had subsequently methodically picked off CIA informants. Earlier this week it was reported that more than a dozen CIA spies had been caught in Iran and Lebanon. The U.S. government now . fears they have been executed. Past explosions: In 1983 more than 300 people - including 260 Americans - were killed in an attack on the U.S. embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut . The . spies were said to be paid informants who were targeting Iran and Hezbollah group in Beirut. Their . discovery is a big hindrance to U.S. attempts to track Iran’s nuclear . activities and discover if Hezbollah is plotting any attacks against . Israel. Former . senior CIA officer Robert Baer worked against Hezbollah in the 1980s . and told ABC news that the group will often execute those it believes to be spies. Other officials pointed out Hezbollah killed more Americans than any other terrorist organisation before the 9/11 attacks. In 1983 more than 300 people - including 260 Americans - were killed in an attack on the U.S. embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut. Bob Baer said U.S. spies no longer know the trade well enough . A former senior CIA officer has admitted that the loss of agents is a major setback – and not an isolated incident. ‘When you lose your entire station, either in Tehran or Beirut, that's a catastrophe,’ Bob Baer (pictured right) told ABC News. He said it was due in part to a new generation of agents not using traditional methods of intelligence gathering. ‘They don't understand tradecraft,’ said Baer, who thinks the CIA has taken on military habits. ‘And we have lost our touch in espionage.’ Baer said that simply serving in war zones means many agents are unprepared for other demands. Other CIA officers agree with this. ‘There is an entire generation of case officers who have only met with assets on a base, surrounded by security,’ said one retired officer. ‘It's not the same as meeting assets on a street, where you are responsible for your own security and surveillance.’","A member of Iran's national security committee believes the alleged agents were operating with Israel's Mossad .

A mother-of-two accused of murdering her 70-year-old roommate has been blind for more than 20 years after losing both her eyes in a prison fight, it has emerged. Geraldine Cherry, 50, had her eyes gouged out in the 1980s during a confrontation at the Clinton Correctional Facility For Women in New Jersey. She was last month charged with murder after the body of Kathleen McEwan, a grandmother who had special needs and needed round-the-clock care,was found in their shared apartment in Roxborough, Philadelphia. Crime scene: Geraldine Cherry has been charged with murdering her roommate Kathleen McEwan at their shared apartment (pictured) in Philadelphia last month . Cherry and Ms McEwan were living together under the care of social services agency Resources for Human Development . Bizarrely, she was initially thought to have died from natural causes and police said there was no reason to suspect foul play. It . was only when undertakers attempting to embalm her body found ten . inches of cotton rope, a candy wrapper, a lotion bottle and a piece of a . diaper that a murder investigation was launched. Jeff Thompson, of John J Byers Funeral Home, said that he knew something was amiss from the moment he saw Ms McEwan's body.

It was poached from the BBC with much fanfare by Sky, which reportedly bid three times as much for the rights. But the satellite broadcaster may be regretting its decision to snap up American advertising drama Mad Men. Viewing figures sank to just 47,000 for the third episode of the fifth series on the Sky Atlantic channel on Tuesday night. Drop: Viewing figures sank to just 47,000 for the third episode of the fifth series of Mad Men on Sky, down from 355,000 during the premiere of the fourth series when it was shown on BBC4 . New dynamic: Jon Hamm as advertising boss Don Draper with his wife, Megan, played by Jessica Pare, in episode two of season five . That’s an alarming drop from the 355,000 viewers who watched the premiere of the fourth series when it was on BBC4. It is understood that Sky is paying about £250,000 an episode for the glossy 1960s drama. Based on Tuesday’s figures, that amounts to more than £5 per viewer. While the show, starring Jon Hamm as Don Draper and Christina Hendricks as Joan Holloway, picks up more viewers from repeated episodes and ‘consolidated’ viewing through video recorders, the ratings have surprised many within the industry. It has been claimed that Sky’s deal for the rights to Mad Men is worth more than £5million, which is thought to cover two series. Poor return: John Slattery as Roger Sterling with Draper and Vincent Kartheiser as Pete Campbell in a show which, based on Tuesday's figures, is costing Sky around £5 per viewer . At the time of the new deal being agreed in 2010, it was said that the BBC could not compete with Sky’s 'deep pockets' as the licence-fee funded broadcaster looked to reduce its spend on acquired programmes. A Sky insider said: ‘Mad Men is the centrepiece of the Atlantic channel. But there has been a huge gap from when it was on the BBC to the new series airing on Sky. ‘Sky do not care about the ratings. If it makes thousands subscribe to Sky or stops thousands unsubscribing, then it is OK. 'But that is a lot of money to pay for Mad Men.’ The series was delayed due to contract negotiations between the show’s creator Matt Weiner and the US network AMC. Losing ratings: When aired on the BBC, the show, which also stars Elisabeth Moss as Peggy Olsen (left) and Christina Hendricks as Joan Holloway (right), was watched by 1.5million once the BBC2 repeat was included . Some have suggested that the programme has suffered particularly badly after switching from the BBC to Sky because it appeals to a certain type of viewer who may be reluctant to take out a subscription with Rupert Murdoch’s satellite giant. Mad Men’s figures compare with the . opening episode of fantasy action series Game Of Thrones, which got . 522,000 viewers on the same channel. Despite this, Sky has said Mad Men is rating well. The fifth series launched last week with two episodes aired consecutively. The first attracted 98,000 viewers but the following installment dropped to 45,000. According to sources, when the show aired on the BBC it was watched by 1.5million once you include the BBC2 repeat, which aired after it had originally been shown on BBC4. A Sky spokesman said: ‘In Sky homes Mad Men has never been more popular. 'When you look at those who watched the first episode of Mad Men live, or caught up through Sky+ or on-demand, it was the most watched episode in Sky homes ever, and by some margin.’ ‘We’re delighted with the response from Sky customers and will continue to invest in the shows that create more value for our existing customers and give more people a reason to join Sky.’ According to the satellite broadcaster’s figures, in Sky homes, the satellite broadcaster’s ratings were 35 per cent higher than the highest rating for a premiere performance of a Mad Men episode when it was shown on BBC4. The broadcaster refused to comment on the monetary value of the deal.","Glossy advertising drama watched by 355,000 for last series on BBC4 .

"By . Claire Bates . PUBLISHED: . 07:58 EST, 22 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:39 EST, 22 May 2012 . The mother of a baby boy who was turned away twice by hospital receptionists today said he nearly died because of a lack of doctors. Jaiden Daley was rushed to Grantham and District Hospital by his mother Michaela Sleney, 22, when he became lethargic and unable to keep liquids down. But she was amazed when the receptionist in the accident and emergency department claimed her son was not ill enough to be seen by a doctor and sent them home. Relief: Jaiden was finally seen after Michaela and her partner Luke insisted he was seen at their local hospital . The mother-of-two brought Jaiden, now nearly two, back to the department a few days later when his conditioned worsened - but again a different receptionist tried to convince her to go. She stood her ground and eventually her son was seen by doctors - who found he was suffering from severe dehydration and was just hours from death. He was rushed to a specialist baby unit and clung to life for three days before eventually showing signs of improvement. Michaela then recorded a matron blaming the blunders on the fact the hospital was 'understaffed' and morale was low. She said: 'The bottom line is this is a result of the NHS cuts. 'Staff have to work longer hours and do everything - because there is nobody else to cover them if they don’t. 'There are not enough doctors working so the receptionists are trying to keep the waiting list down by only checking in emergency cases.' She added: 'It makes my blood boil that the government will throw tax payers’ money at things like the Olympics but they can’t get elementary things right on the NHS and have ended up in a situation where a receptionist is attempting to diagnose patients.' Jaiden, pictured after he was finally diagnosed with severe dehydration at Grantham hospital's busy A & E department . Michaela, who lives with Jaiden and partner Luke Daley, 26, and Gabriel, seven months, in Grantham, Lincolnshire, took her sick son to casualty in April 2011. She noticed that Jaiden was lethargic and not keeping any liquids down - but the receptionist at Grantham’s busy A and E department quickly sent her home. The mother was sent home with a booklet and told if she was really concerned she should take him to an out-of- hours GP instead. Michaela said: 'I was pregnant at the time with Gabriel and extremely emotional. 'A male receptionist said he was not ill enough to be seen in A and E so I presumed if the receptionist was sending me home he must have some medical experience. 'When people say something authoritative and they work in a hospital, you presume they know what they are talking about. 'The truth is that same receptionist was checking in drunks and patients with minor injuries and they were attended to by doctors - whilst my little boy who was actually in the last stages of dehydration and dying was sent home. 'I remember thinking that wasn’t right but I didn’t know what to do.' Jaiden was taken to Boston Hospital, Lincolnshire, an hour away, and put on a drip in their specialist baby unit . Michaela then took Jaiden to the out-of-hours GP surgery that same night after his condition worsened. But the doctor did not pick up on how sick the poorly her son was either and told her to take him home. However, less than 12 hours later Jaiden’s eyes had sunk in, he was barely moving, being violently sick and had chronic diarrhoea. Terrified Michaela called NHS Direct - who advised her to take him to A and E at Grantham Hospital. But again a different receptionist tried to send her home. Michaela said: 'I couldn’t believe it when another receptionist tried to fob me off. 'Here I was with a clearly sick baby in my arms and another receptionist tried to tell me again that I was overreacting and that I should just take him home. 'She was huffing and puffing and trying to make me feel stupid. But this time Luke was at my side, and together we stood our ground and demanded to see a doctor. 'She reluctantly booked Jaiden in and shortly afterwards a doctor examined him.' The doctor immediately flagged Jaiden up as a medical emergency because of his limpness, high temperature and his inability to hold down liquids. He was diagnosed as being in the last stages of dehydration and medics warned his body was starting to shut down. Angry: Michaela said she could have lost her son if she hadn't pushed to see a doctor . They took him to Boston Hospital, Lincolnshire, an hour away, and put on a drip in their specialist baby unit. Michaela said: 'I couldn’t stop crying - I thought he was going to die. Luke tried to console me but I was a mess. 'We didn’t know if he was going to pull through. He was fighting for his life.It was an agonising three days before he began to show signs of improvement and that whole time I wasn’t sure if I’d lose him. 'I just kept thinking that the whole situation could have been avoided if Grantham A and E had not sent him home in the first place. 'And by now I felt furious that the person who had sent us home was just a receptionist.' His furious parents demanded an apology from the hospital and finally secured a meeting with the United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, who run the facility, months later. During the meeting Michaela recorded a matron at Grantham Hospital blaming the Easter break for the blunders, stating they were “understaffed”. Mandy Charles, matron at the hospital, told Michaela: 'We have been understaffed. 'That’s not your fault. We have had to work some pretty awful shift patterns so morale has been really low and that makes people a bit bad tempered.But that is absolutely no excuse for what has happened to you.' In the recording of the meeting, the out-of-hours service doctor, Dr Codi Ramesh, also apologised. He said: 'I should have taken longer to examine him them had him immediately admitted to hospital. I’ve learnt from this incident and I will make sure it won’t happen again.' United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust and Lincolnshire Community Health Services apologised to Michaela. A spokesman said: 'Patients are routinely asked if they would normally seek GP advice for the condition they are presenting with and if so are directed to the out of hours GP next to A and E for the initial consultation. 'Work has recently been completed to integrate the GP into the A and E department which means patients are seen by the right clinician more quickly. 'In the last year we have made significant changes to the Grantham A and E department including a review of paediatric pathways, an increase in paediatric training for staff and we have also introduced a new Paediatric Liaison Nurse.'",Michaela was told by a matron that the blunder happened because the hospital was 'understaffed' and morale was low .

A conman wore a stethoscope and white coat to pose as a doctor and sexually abuse six women patients, a court heard today. Antonio Gobbato, who said he was a doctor working for the NHS, claimed he was diagnosing the women by fondling their breasts, a court was told. He also posed as a gynaecologist, paediatrician and a psychiatrist and had fake certificates and microscopes to fool the women at various premises across London, it is alleged. Antonio Gobbato, 51, pictured outside Inner London Crown Court . From August 2009 he ran surgeries from his home in Pinner, north-west London, then at a beautician’s in Whitechapel, east London before borrowing a doctor’s surgery in Kilburn and finally setting up in south London. Gobbato, 51, also allegedly tricked parents into paying for expensive treatments abroad for their children so he could enjoy all-inclusive holidays. In reality, the fake GP had little or no qualifications, the jury heard. Prosecutor Linda Strudwick told Inner London Crown Court: 'Antonio Gobbato is a charlatan and a make believe doctor.' During the ten month con he he convinced six women to strip off and fondled their private parts 'under the guise of medical examinations', the court heard. He lied to three separate parents that their children were suffering with serious illnesses - including potential leukaemia - in an attempt to trick them into taking him to Italy, it is said. Ms Strudwick said: 'Whatever qualifications he did have, and even these are questioned, they were not as a medical doctor, whether in traditional western medicine or complementary medicine. 'However, he called himself Doctor Gobbato. 'Furthermore, he gave every impression to his patients that he was a qualified medical doctor. The new-build block of flats in Pinner, north-west London where Antonio Gobbato lives and is alleged to have run a fake doctors' surgery . 'He wore a typical doctor’s coat with Dr Gobbato embroidered on the pocket and a stethoscope was worn around his neck in the consulting rooms along with medical paraphernalia and framed certificates. 'He referred to himself as a GP and he acted at all times as though he were qualified and able to make diagnoses of serious illnesses when he had no such training or ability.' The Brazilian-born fraudster registered using fake documents with the Complementary Medical Association claiming he was a doctor and had qualified in Portugal in massage, homeopathy and herbal medicines, it is alleged. He then 'very cleverly' used his £150 membership, which was granted because the CMA trusted him and no-one could speak Portuguese, to get further certification, Ms Strudwick said. She said: 'Gobbato portrayed himself as a qualified doctor, with the skill and expertise to diagnose, that tricked the women who came to him into their removing their clothes and allowing him to examine them and parents into believing him when he told them that their children were seriously ill.' He targeted women from his homeland who were 'ripe for exploitation', trusted him as he spoke their language, and were sometimes illegally in the UK unable to get NHS registration. He used tricks including claiming to work for the NHS and used a microscope to look at blood and make 'nonsense' diagnoses. It was also said that he surrounded himself with paraphernalia such as business cards calling himself Dr Gobbato and a CV listing fake jobs in an attempt to back up his lies. One woman who complained of liver problems had her breast fondled on the pretence he was looking for 'nodules and hormones' and she even paid a consultation fee in the belief the treatment was genuine. In others cases he made 'terrifying statements' to persuade parents to let him accompany their children to Italy for treatment, it is claimed. Gobbato denies seven counts of sexual assault, two attempted frauds and one fraud. The case continues.","Antonio Gobbato, 51, called himself Dr Gobbato and wore a stethoscope, a court heard .

Shares in British banks soared yesterday . after the Government outlined a dramatic plan to pump £140billion into . the ailing economy. Stock in state-backed Royal Bank of Scotland rose . nearly 8 per cent and part-nationalised Lloyds Banking Group went up by . more than 5 per cent, adding £2.1billion to the value of taxpayers’ holdings in the two banks. Barclays was up more than 4 per cent. Mansion House: George Osborne, with Lord Mayor Alderman David Wootton (centre) and Bank of England governor Mervyn King, before his annual speech at Mansion House last night . But . the jump in bank shares raised fresh questions about whether the banks . could end up being the main  beneficiaries of the scheme, which is meant . to force them to lend more money directly to cash-strapped small . businesses and homeowners. The mini surge came after the Treasury and . the Bank of England joined forces to launch two packages to stimulate . the economy and tackle the crisis spilling over from the eurozone. Last . night Chancellor George Osborne was also facing questions about whether . the taxpayer could be left with a fresh bill if the new loans turn bad. Stunt: George Osborne is handed a GCSE Maths exercise book by Heydon Prowse as he films a new comedy show for BBC 3 . Tory . MP Steve Baker, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, . said: ‘It’s more or less explicit that the reason the Government is . stepping in to force lending is because their loans are to the type of . businesses they would otherwise not make. ‘That means it’s a bad risk and I think that means the taxpayer could well end up picking up the can.’ Fellow . Tory David Ruffley gave a cautious welcome to the scheme but urged Mr . Osborne to be upfront about the risks of the taxpayer being landed with . new ‘sub-prime’ loans. Mr Ruffley, a member of the Commons Treasury . committee, said: ‘New lending will only happen if the commercial banks . take advantage of this cheap money to lend on. ‘Some banks will only . do so if the taxpayer covers losses when their customers default or go . bust. Is the British taxpayer prepared to stand behind these cheap . loans? Graham Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, . said the Chancellor and Governor of the Bank of England were right to . act. But he warned that the ‘core problem’ remained the uncertainty . caused by the eurozone crisis. ‘The funding-for-lending scheme helps the . supply of money and the demand for it, by lowering the cost of . borrowing,’ he said. ‘But the core problem remains. Companies alarmed by the euro crisis will not be eager to borrow regardless of the cost.’ Britain's biggest bank will hammer  millions of cash-strapped families by  hiking the cost of slipping into the red. State-backed giant Lloyds will make 17million customers pay 20 per cent more to set up an overdraft and is raising rates to a whopping 19.94 per cent. The new rate is the highest charged by any of the big five banks and makes dipping into your overdraft more expensive than spending on a credit card. Experts say the hikes, which take effect on October 2, are unfair on loyal customers battling record low savings rates and a painful income squeeze. And they come despite the Bank of England freezing the base rate at its historic low of 0.5 per cent for more than three years. Marc Gander, founder of campaigners Consumer Action Group, said: ‘This is a nasty, cynical move and is catastrophic for families, who are being forced to rely on overdrafts far more because of a financial crisis created by the banks.’ Lloyds is Britain’s biggest provider of current accounts with 22million customers including its Halifax arm. With the financial crisis in the eurozone spilling into Britain, bank profits have come under threat. As a result, they are trying to squeeze more out of customers who run out of cash at the end of the month. Currently, Lloyds customers who arrange to have an overdraft pay between 12.43 and 19.28 per cent, depending on the type of account they are in. Customers also pay £5 a month for the right to be overdrawn. From October, the rates on all accounts will increase to a minimum of 15.43 per cent, rising as high as 19.94 per cent. The monthly cost increases to £6. Those hit with the biggest interest rate are customers in Lloyds’ Classic account. This is a free account and is most likely to be used by cash-strapped customers. It means that on each £1,000 borrowed for a year, they will pay £199.40 before any debt is scratched off. Injection: The Bank of England is to pump up to £140bn - or one in every five pounds of total Government spending - in to the UK economy in a bid to stimulate lending . Big decision: The scheme was approved by the 'quad' of senior ministers; Danny Alexander, David Cameron, George Osborne and Nick Clegg . Banks will be lent the cash on condition they pass it on in the form of cheaper business loans and mortgages. Ministers . say the intervention will ease the credit drought starving small . businesses and home buyers of cash. The initiative is also designed to . protect our banks against fallout from the eurozone crisis by giving . them easy access to cash from the Bank of England. But some Tory . Right-wingers questioned the idea of trying to stimulate the economy by . pouring billions more into cheap loans. Tory MP Douglas Carswell . described the policy as ‘continuity Gordon Brown’. He added: ‘This is . precisely the sort of medicine that made the economy sick in the first . place.’ David Jones, strategist at City trading firm IG Index, said: . ‘Investors have broadly welcomed this move as an effort to try and . insulate at least some of the UK economy and banking sector from further . fallout from the European debt crisis. ‘However, whether this will . end up having a significant impact on the underlying UK economy is . debatable – the reluctance of banks to lend is arguably just a small . part of the overall economic malaise.’ Supporters: Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, left, and Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott have backed the initiative .","Shares in state-owned RBS rose nearly 8 per cent and Lloyds benefit from 5 per cent boost .

The 100-year-old physician still makes house calls and has no plans to give up his work - although he did cut back from five eight-hour days a week to three at the age of 96. Party: Well-wishers line the hallway and fill the entryway of Dr Fred Goldman's office in the old Jewish Hospital to celebrate his 100th birthday, in Cincinnati, Ohio. He has been a physician for 76 years . Still going strong: Dr Goldman, left, is pictured with Dottie Mazzaferri, 93, right, who has been a friend and patient for more than 50 years. Dr Goldman has been a physician for 76 years . On December 12 his patients, friends and family - some using walkers, some in strollers - gathered at his office for a surprise birthday party. He ended up surprising them by arriving 90 minutes early. ‘I almost had a heart attack seeing all of the people in the hall and the waiting room,’ Dr Goldman said between greeting well-wishers with a question about their health. ‘People ask me why do you go to a doctor who's 100?’ said Patti Levine, a fourth-generation patient of the doctor. ‘I tell them, because he's seen it all and he knows everything.’ 'People ask me why do you go to a doctor who's 100? Because he's seen it all and he knows everything' Patti Levine . The Blue Ash woman stood by a stroller holding her 10-month-old daughter, Madyson. ‘She's not his patient,’ Levine said, ‘yet.’ Fellow physicians also gave birthday greetings to Goldman. ‘He asked me to come work for him in 2007,’ said 85-year-old Dr Leo Wayne. ‘I told him I would not work for him. I'm too young.’ ‘I would not dream of advising him to retire,’ Dr Wayne replied. ‘Dr Goldman is an excellent diagnostician. He knows his patients, including himself. He knows this patient is still up to the task.’ Long-time client: Dr Goldman, left, is welcomed by Leah Levine, right, of Amberly, Ohio, for a 100th birthday celebration. Ms Levine has been a patient for 70 years, since she was 15-years-old . Days gone by: A copy of The Cincinnati Enquirer from the date of Dr Fred Goldman's birth - December 12, 1911 - lies on display for his 100th birthday celebration in Cincinnati, Ohio . ‘Don't feel anything different,’ Dr Goldman said of being aged 100. When Fred Goldman was literally a birthday boy, he was born on December 12, 1911, at his family's home. ‘My mother - a housewife - was from Poland. My father - a shopkeeper - was from Russia,’ he said, ‘and I was from both of them'. 'He's still going strong. They don't make men like Fred Goldman anymore' Patti Heath . On the day the doctor was born, another native Cincinnatian, William Howard Taft, waddled about the White House as the 27th President of the U.S., Czar Nicholas II sat on the throne in Russia and George V - Queen Elizabeth II's grandfather - reigned as the King of England. ‘Hell, when I became a doctor in 1935,’ Dr Goldman said, ‘Freud was still seeing patients.’ In 1911, Madame Curie won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. George Washington Carver was making 100 products from peanuts and Alexander Fleming was 17 years from discovering penicillin. His schedule is set by his sole employee, . Patti Heath. ‘I came to work here when he was 91,’ she said. She . thought she would be a short-timer. ‘Here I am nine years later. And . he's still going strong. Memories: Dr Goldman sits in his office at the old Jewish Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio, on December 12, 2011 . Equipment: An old scale is still in use in Dr Goldman's office on Burnet Avenue in Cincinnati, Ohio . ‘The first year I worked for him, I collapsed on a beach for my vacation. He hiked the wilderness in Alaska and lived in a tent. They don't make men like Fred Goldman anymore.’ At the old General Hospital in Cincinnati, he was making his rounds one day when he met, wooed and eventually wed Esther Nelson, a red-haired farm-girl turned nurse from Amelia. 'I had never had a date with a woman before. This was around 1937. I asked her to go to dinner. She said, sure. I guess she was hungry' Fred Goldman . ‘She was tending to my patients. And, she had her own ideas about things, which I admired. The best thing was she became the mother of our three kids, the best gifts she ever gave me,’ he said. One of his three sons, audiologist Tom Goldman, joined the tour. He beamed at those words. ‘I was a little, shy guy when I first dated Tom's mom,’ Dr Goldman added. ‘I had never had a date with a woman before. This was around 1937. I asked her to go to dinner. She said, sure. I guess she was hungry.’ They married the next year in Galveston, Texas, while he was teaching at the University of Texas. ‘We were married by a justice of the . peace,’ he recalled. ‘We stood in line with 30 drunken Mexicans who had . just been arrested. The justice of the peace pushed me aside and asked . if I had $25. I did.’ Starting out: This is a photo of a picture of Dr Goldman, when he first became a doctor in 1935 . Celebration: A birthday cake sits on display for Dr Fred Goldman's birthday party as he turns 100 years old . Three years later, with America at war, the Goldmans returned to Cincinnati. He enlisted in the Navy. ‘They took me three months later and I got out of the Navy in 1946. I served in the Pacific,’ he said. ‘I was in a unit with six docs and 20 corpsmen. We were sent wherever they had a battle.’ Another party guest asked the centenarian tour guide for his secret to a long life. The doctor looked around the room. He spoke in a whisper. 'Haven't a clue why I've lived this long. Maybe it's because my office is a mess and I keep saying I'm going to clean it up. That keeps me going' Fred Goldman . ‘I have no secrets,’ he confided. ‘Haven't a clue why I've lived this long. Maybe it's because my office is a mess and I keep saying I'm going to clean it up. That keeps me going. That and it's in my genes. ‘My mother died at 91. So did one of my brothers. Another brother died in his 80s. So did my sister.’ He admitted to ‘some bumps in life.’ He survived major heart surgery and licked prostate cancer. ‘I had good doctors,’ he explained, ‘who took good care of me’. His wife of 60 years died in 1998. ‘When she died, I had to go on,’ he said, ‘I could not afford to feel sorry for myself. I had to be diverted by work.’ He has no plans of stopping now. ‘Work is life,’ he said. ‘I work on demand. ‘If there's not much demand, there's not much work. Fortunately, the demand exists. I feel I can still be helpful to people. And, I can still do the job. So, there's no sense to consider retirement.’","Physician Fred Goldman, of Cincinnati, Ohio, has been a doctor for 76 years .

Casey Anthony has broken her almost year-long silence to conduct the first interview since her acquittal in July last year for the murder of her two-year-old daughter Caylee by declaring that 'I didn't kill my daughter...but I'm ashamed of the person that I was.' Talking to CNN's Piers Morgan before he spoke to her attorney J. Cheney Mason on his 'Piers Morgan Tonight' show, the most reviled mother in America denied murdering her child and acknowledged that, 'The public perception of me is bad, absolutely horrible.' Reading aloud the transcripts of his 'world exclusive' chat with hated Anthony, Morgan revealed that the 26-year-old denies reports she has put on massive amounts of weight and refuted any suggestions she was moving to Costa Rica. Scroll Down for Video . Piers Morgan talks to Casey Anthony's attorney, J. Cheney Mason after he conducted his exclusive telephone interview with her . Casey Anthony's last public appearance was in October in a YouTube diary she posted online. She spoke today to CNN's Piers Morgan . 'I do not weigh 500 pounds and I am not moving to Costa Rica,' said Anthony to Morgan in a telephone conversation that Mason was present for prior to his appearance on CNN. 'It's doubtful she weighs 120 pounds,' said Mason. Telling Morgan that she was 'not a party girl' and that she had, 'never done drugs apart from marijuana in my early 20's,' Anthony was keen to set the record straight. Telling Morgan that she 'had gone through hell' since her July 2011 acquittal, the 26-year-old impressed the CNN host with what he called her new-found maturity. 'Obviously, I didn't kill my daughter. If anything in this world I was . more proud of was my daughter. She was my greatest accomplishment. I . didn't kill my girl,' explained Anthony to Morgan. J. Cheney Mason told Piers Morgan that Casey Anthony has led a domestic life since her acquittal in July and rarely leaves her home . Heading off any suggestions that CNN might have paid Anthony for the interview, Morgan sought clarification from her. 'I'm not making gazillions dollars,' said Anthony. 'I don't give an expletive about money... I may have in past... I was a stupid kid. I am . 26 now. I have gone through hell.' However, her attorney Mason did add: 'We are sitting back watching. ... When the time comes she will have her story to tell.' During the aired twenty minute segment, Morgan revealed a snapshot of Anthony's life since she was acquitted of the murder of her two-year old daughter Caylee in July 2011. Cut off from everyday life, Anthony told Morgan that she spends each day at home cooking, cleaning, exercising and watching television. Admitting to Morgan that she has come to love old comedy shows such as 'The Three Stooges' and 'I Love Lucy', Anthony also said that she enjoys reading fiction, especially 'The Hunger Games' trilogy in which children fight to the death in televised contests. Gone: Anthony's toddler daughter Caylee, whose body was found in woods near Anthony's home in 2008 . 'She doesn't watch the news. She doesn't watch these so-called reality . shows that are about as real as wrestling.,' said Mason. 'She's reading a trilogy of . books called 'Hunger Games.' .. She's very interested in photography, . works out a lot, likes 'I Love lucy,' 'The Three Stooges,' travel.' Granting the exclusive telephone conversation to CNN's Morgan, Anthony was explicit on how she feels about the public's perception of her during and after the trial. 'It's horrible. It looks absolutely horrible, and I'm ashamed in many ways of the person that I was,"" Anthony said over the phone. 'Even then, that wasn't who I am.' Responding to these comments, her attorney was keen to say Anthony has not had the chance to explain herself. 'Casey had a bad background. Lot of problems with her history that don't need to be talked about now,' said Mason. 'Indeed, she didn't trust anybody. 'In Casey-world she made things up, she denied things but she just closed in. She just had a very difficult time dealing with it. 'She is now trying to emerge from that. 'She learned at the same time a lot of the world did how she grieves differently after her child disappeared and an expert explained that.' Mason made it clear that despite earning her freedom, Anthony's life is not free. 'She is in a different prison,' said Mason. 'She can't go outside. 'She spends the day in the house, cooks, cleans, exercises, watches programs on TV, movies mostly.' Casey Anthony confers with attorneys Jose Baez and . Dorothy Clay Simser during her murder trial last year . Discussing his conversation with Anthony to Mason, Piers Morgan said that he was struck by her self-awareness of her situation. 'She accepts reality,' said Mason. 'She knows that the hate mongers are out there in their legions.' 'She has to accept that people hate her. 'She gets a lot of favourable mail too.' Asking Mason if Anthony would ever consider becoming a mother again, her attorney was equivocal. 'She probably would. It would take a long time [though] for her to be accepted.' Anthony is currently on probation in Florida as she awaits a check on a fraud conviction, but the . court has ordered her exact location to be kept a secret because of death threats. Since going into hiding, Anthony has appeared only occasionally in online video diaries that have been leaked. In one online posting, she discussed her new blond bob hair style, having her . nose pierced, and her new pet dog. Other images on the Internet showed . Anthony in a bar. In none of these appearances was her daughter mentioned. Hidden: Anthony has not been seen in public since her trial, and has spent most of the last 10 months inside . It was initially speculated that Anthony . could command up to $750,000 for her first exclusive interview . following her trial, but the big four national networks and cable news . declined to pay that sum. The infamous Florida mother, had teamed up with Los Angeles-based TV producer Scott Sternberg to pitch an interview to all the networks. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the interview had a price tag of $500,000 to $750,000, but CBS News, ABC News and NBC News all stated they would not pay for an interview with Anthony. Recent reports have revealed that Anthony has been forced to leave her South Florida hiding place and go on the run after her location was discovered by private investigators. It has also been reported that 26-year-old Anthony has lost her looks because she has put on so much weight that she has become virtually unrecognisable. The private investigators who discovered where she has been hiding were said to have been hired by Zenaida Gonzalez, who is suing the 'tot mom' for defamation. A source told RadarOnline: 'Casey absolutely flipped out when she found out that private investigators hired by Zenaida Gonzalez, discovered where she was. 'The private investigators were attempting to serve Casey with a subpoena to appear at the trial, which is expected to begin in January. 'Casey had been venturing out at night and the investigators had been tipped off by people who had seen her.'Casey is a smart girl and quickly determined that she had been found and refused to leave the house or accept service of the subpoena. In hiding: Casey has been spending time with her new boyfriend who she made reference to in YouTube video's she has posted while in hiding . 'The P.I.s weren't stalking her or doing any surveillance, they just wanted to serve her and move on. 'Casey was extremely upset that she had been found because she had settled into a routine and felt safe in South Florida. 'Casey's lawyer advised her that she needed to move though and they worked together over the past two weeks to move yet again. She is hopeful this will be the final move before her probation ends, at which time, she doesn't have to stay in Florida.' Anthony has not been seen in public since her trial, pictured, and has spent most of the last 10 months inside . After her dramatic acquittal, Anthony spent months in hiding where she reportedly just sits indoors on the computer while comfort eating - and so has piled on the pounds. But a source has revealed that this new look - including a 'puffy face' - has apparently given her fresh courage as she has been leaving her home regularly. 'Casey has been venturing out on a much more frequent basis recently because she is almost unrecognisable,' a source told RadarOnline.com. 'She hasn't needed to wear a disguise because of the physical transformation.' The source added that she has turned to comfort eating and pops out at night to rent films and collect food from restaurants - but won't stay anywhere too long. 'Casey doesn't feel safe anywhere and just wants to leave the country and begin a new life,' the source added. It has since been claimed that she become a newborn Christian and was been baptized again in a bid to symbolise a new beginning.

"By . Daniel Miller . UPDATED: . 00:28 EST, 13 June 2012 . A gang of teenage thugs who were jailed for an armed-robbery spree in which they blasted victims with a sawn-off shotgun are to appeal against their sentences claiming they are 'too young' for prison. The five youngsters, two aged just 13 and 14, robbed shopkeepers and taxi drivers in Liverpool at gunpoint during a ten-day crimes spree that spread terror across the city. One gang member, who had already racked up a host of previous convictions, was jailed indefinitely. Others were sentenced to between four and nine years following a trial in October last year. Jailed: Jobe Kilbride, 13, poses with . the shotgun used by him and others when they robbed taxis and shops. The gang are now to appeal against the length of their sentences at the High Court . Now their lawyers are taking a case to the High Court claiming the custodial sentences are unduly harsh considering their age. During the brutal rampage  over the 2011 May Day bank holiday, one victim was shot in the neck while others, all chosen at random, had a loaded shotgun pointed in their faces. Jailed: Jobe Kilbridge (left) was given a sentence of four years, while 14-year-old Dylan Currie (right) was jailed for six years . Declan Kilbride (left) was locked up for nine years and Declan Culshaw (right), who acted as look-out in the gang's final robbery, was given five years . At the time Judge Mark Brown described the gang as capable of ‘ruthless villainy’ and of having ‘no sense of danger’. Jailing them, he said people were ‘sick and tired’ of the gangs and gun crime that blighted Liverpool. Ringleader Bradley Beveridge, 18, has been on the police radar since his early teens . The judge ordered that all five . teenagers should be named after they admitted armed robbery and firearms . offences at Liverpool Crown Court. Their faces covered by hoods or simply by pulling up their jumpers, they carried out a string of opportunistic crimes. In the first, a taxi driver was lured . to a quiet side street where he was confronted with a loaded shotgun, . and robbed of his car and takings. Just . 24 hours later, another taxi driver became the gang’s next victim after . picking up three youths and driving them across the city. As . they neared their destination, one of the thugs grabbed the handbrake . while the driver was threatened with a shotgun. He also lost his car and . takings. Later that day two youths with a shotgun burst into a shop and stole cash after threatening terrified staff. Three days later the gang struck again at a convenience store where they helped themselves to cash and cigarettes. The . final two crimes took place within minutes of each other. CCTV captured . the gang huddled in a bus stop in the Norris Green area of the city, . then filing into another  convenience store and robbing it, leaving the . lone member of staff cowering in the corner. As they fled into a nearby estate, they were confronted by the shop’s owner who was on his way to his business after hearing what was going on. They shot at Sri Lanka-born Rajeethan Pulendran and his friend Mani Mohan who was hit in the neck and chest, but escaped serious injury. Campaign of fear: The gang's first crime was robbing a Quickhomesave store in Selwyn Street, Walton . Violent rampage: The boys threatened staff with a shotgun at the All in One convenience store in Huyton and stole cash and cigarettes . Ringleader Bradley Beveridge, 18, who . has already racked up a host of convictions, shouted abuse at the judge . as he was jailed indefinitely. Kilbride was given four years while his . older brother Declan, 16, was locked up for nine years. Declan . Culshaw, a 15-year-old who acted as look-out in the gang’s final . robbery, was given five years while 14-year-old Dylan Currie was jailed . for six years. Judge Brown said the gang members had no respect for authority and ‘limited thinking skills’. He said: ‘This case highlights the scourge of gun crime and gang  culture which we have in our  society today. The residents of those communities are sick and tired of it.’ Their appeal is scheduled to take place on June 21 with a decision expected the same day.","The five youngsters, two aged just 13 .

Mystery: Joshua Shane, pictured, went missing two days ago while night-swimming with three friends in Thailand . The mystery surrounding an American student who went missing while swimming in Thailand may now have been solved after a body was found this morning not far from the place where the student was last seen. Joshua Shane went missing two days ago while night-swimming with three friends on Patong beach. The 21-year-old had arrived in Phuket earlier this week on a study abroad programme with Arizona State University. A search and rescue mission immediately began following his disappearance, but this was called off yesterday afternoon. Instead, it was decided to focus on finding his body. The plot thickened when Phuket Marine Police said this morning that a local resident had found a body washed up on Kalim Beach - which is just a few minutes away by car from Patong beach. Speaking to Phuket Gazette, Lt Jeerayuth Onthong of the marine police, confirmed a body was found washed ashore at Kalim Beach, however in a bizarre twist, the newspaper later . reported that a Royal Thai Navy medical team had arrived at the location . where the body had supposedly washed up but found nothing. It was later reported that a body was found at 7.30am this morning close to where Joshua Shane disappeared. It is not clear if the body is the same as the one spotted by villagers on Kalim Beach. Staff at Patong Hospital said that no one can confirm that the body is Mr Shane due to the condition it is in. Bizarre: Thai marine police officers are pictured heading to the sea on their rubber boats to search for Mr Shane. His body was reported washed up on a beach - only for search teams to find nothing . Speaking at the scene, marine police officers said the search for Mr Shane's body had now been completely called off. Instead, they will wait for reports from members of the public. Mr Shane, from Kansas, had arrived in the country earlier this week as part of a 20-strong group who were studying under a project called 'Urban Sustainability and Planning in Thailand'. Arizona State University students have been offered counselling for those students who knew Mr Shane. Missing: Marine police officers have now called off the search for Mr Shane's body . His family said he had been passionate about international social justice and the sustainability of the planet. A family statement, reported by KCTV, said: 'He was here to make the world a better place. 'We would like to thank those involved including the people of Thailand and Arizona State University for their dedication and compassion during this difficult time. 'We will continue to be inspired by Joshua's life and appreciate the outpouring of support and prayer.' Tropical: Mr Shane was swimming with friends on Patong beach, pictured, when he went missing.

Controversial: A leaked e-mail from Peter Horrocks, pictured, has asked staff to come up with money-making schemes . The BBC has told its own journalists they must come up with ideas to make the corporation more money, a leaked e-mail has revealed. Management are insisting its 2,400 staff at BBC Worldwide devise cash-generating schemes to present at their staff appraisals, calling into question its future editorial independence. With the BBC already making redundancies and budget cuts, journalists have been told they must: 'exploit new commercial opportunities (and) maximise the value we create with our journalism.' Critics fear that this could lead to them ignoring important stories across the globe in favour of ones that will bring in extra cash. It came as the corporation is being investigated by media watchdog Ofcom, who are looking into how some BBC World News programmes became 'commercially influenced'. BBC bosses have already apologised for these mistakes. Peter Horrocks, the director of BBC Global News, told his journalists that their official appraisals will include an objective section on their ability to generate cash. His leaked e-mail to The Independent says: 'With the income objective, let us know if you have any ideas on how we can strengthen our commercial focus and grow income. 'No matter where you work, you can help meet these objectives. They have been designed to encompass all departments, using strengths and expertise of all members of staff. 'Please use these objectives during your appraisal to talk through with your line manager what these objectives mean to you as an individual and your role in the fulfilment of them.' The move has been branded 'appalling' by former BBC staff and union leaders, who say the BBC's editorial independence could be compromised, especially in areas like China and India. Regrettable move: Former correspondent and MP Martin Bell says the BBC is not a money-making organisation . BBC World already sells adverts on its TV channel as well as on BBC.com, an international version of its news website. Former war reporter and MP Martin Bell told the Independent: 'The BBC is not a money-making organisation. It is mostly a money-spending organisation. I find this a regrettable move.' John Tusa, who was managing director of the World Service for seven years, said to the paper: 'The notion that as a journalist you are having to think about how you can sell or turn your output into money is just so wide of the mark. If he [Horrocks] pushes it too far he can start to undermine the values of trust on which the BBC World Service news has existed for 80-odd years. It sounds like management gobbledy-gook.' Anger: Burmese politician Aung San Suu Kyi visits the BBC World Service last week, but people fear a move towards commercialism could compromise its output . Michelle Stanistreet, the general secretary of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), added it was a 'shocking development' that threatened the 'ethos at the heart of public service broadcasting.' The BBC today denied to MailOnline that the plans would compromise its integrity. 'It is not true that the BBC's international journalists are being 'ordered to make money,' a spokesman said. 'The job of the BBC's journalists will always remain providing impartial, independent news and there are no specific commercial targets for frontline journalists. 'The BBC’s public service mission to provide impartial and independent news will always takes precedence over wider commercial goals and nothing in this email suggests any different. 'The BBC's international news services such as BBC World News and BBC.com already have a long tradition of generating commercial income to reinvest in independent public service journalism and these objectives simply aimed to reflect that.'","BBC World boss Peter Horrocks tells 2,400 staff to 'exploit new commercial opportunities' and present them at their appraisals .

"By . Jill Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 02:38 EST, 9 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:39 EST, 9 April 2012 . Israel has banned German author Gunter Grass from entering the Jewish state, over a poem in which he accuses Israel of plotting Iran's annihilation and threatening world peace. In his work called What Must Be Said, the 84-year-old longtime leftist activist said Israel 'could wipe out the Iranian people' due to the threat it sees in Tehran's disputed nuclear programme as well as labelling the country a threat to 'already fragile world peace.' The dispute with Grass, who only late in life admitted to a Nazi past, has drawn new attention to strains in Germany's complicated relationship with the Jewish state. Travel ban: Gunter Grass poses with his poem - Israel has barred the German author from entering the Jewish state, because of his work in which he accuses Israel of plotting Iran's annihilation and threatening world peace . It has also focused unwelcome light on Israel's own secretive nuclear program. The poem has touched a raw nerve in Israel, where officials have rejected any moral equivalence with Iran and been quick to note that Grass admitted only in a 2006 autobiography that he was drafted into the Waffen-SS Nazi paramilitary organization at age 17 in the final months of World War II. Grass' subsequent clarification that his criticism was directed at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, not the country as a whole, did little to calm the outcry. Furious reaction: Eli Yishai, announced yesterday that Grass would be barred from Israel, citing an Israeli law that allows him to prevent entry to ex-Nazis . On Sunday, Israel's interior minister, Eli Yishai, announced that Grass would be barred from Israel, citing an Israeli law that allows him to prevent entry to ex-Nazis. But he made it clear the decision was related more to the recent poem than Grass' actions nearly 70 years ago. 'If Guenter wants to spread his twisted and lying works, I suggest he does this from Iran, where he can find a supportive audience,' Mr Yishai said. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman accused Grass of anti-Semitism. The uproar has touched upon some of the most sensitive issues in modern-day Israel: the Holocaust, Iran's alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons and Israel's own illicit nuclear program that is widely believed to have produced an arsenal of bombs. It also has unleashed a debate in Germany, where criticism of Israel is largely muffled because of the country's Nazi past. Grass' most famous book, The Tin Drum, is about the rise of the Nazis and World War II as told through the lives of ordinary people. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1999. According to a biography from his museum in Germany, Grass has been in Israel at least once - notably accompanying Chancellor Willy Brandt in 1973 on the first official state visit of a German chancellor to Israel. Israel gained independence in 1948 in the wake of the Holocaust and became a refuge for hundreds of thousands of survivors of the World War II Nazi genocide of 6 million Jews. Some 200,000 aging survivors still live in Israel. The scars of the Holocaust have deeply influenced Israeli thinking over the years. Israel marks a Holocaust memorial day every year with a siren that brings the country to a standstill for two minutes. Israel's drive to maintain a powerful military has been shaped by the thought that its enemies want to repeat what the Nazis tried to do. More recently, Netanyahu has turned to Holocaust imagery in warning the world of the threat posed by a nuclear-armed Iran. Award winning; Grass' most famous book, The Tin Drum, is about the rise of the Nazis and World War II, it was also turned into a film, pictured. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1999 . In a speech last month to American Jewish leaders, Netanyahu said, 'Never again will we not be masters of the fate of our very survival. Never again.' Israel, along with much of the international community, believes that Iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon. The Israelis fear a nuclear Iran would threaten its existence, given repeated Iranian calls for the destruction of the Jewish state, and have threatened to attack Iran if diplomacy and sanctions fail. Aim: Grass' subsequent clarification that his criticism was directed at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, not the country as a whole, did little to calm the outcry . A new round of talks between the West and Iran are set to begin this week in Turkey. Rarely mentioned in the debate - except by Iran - is that Israel itself is widely believed to possess its own undeclared arsenal of nuclear bombs. That assessment, by foreign experts, is in part based on photos that were taken by a rogue technician at an Israeli nuclear facility in 1986. Israel neither confirms nor denies having nuclear weapons and has refused to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which would subject it to international inspections. Grass' poem took exception with Israel's alleged programme, and alluded to Germany's sale to Israel of submarines capable of firing 'all-destroying' nuclear missiles into Iran. He further outraged Israelis by referring to their 'alleged right to the first strike that could annihilate the Iranian people' - even though Israel has not threatened the entire country, only its nuclear installations. Grass' poem has also opened up some delicate issues in Germany. As . a result of the country's Nazi past, German governments have made . staunch support for Israel a cornerstone of their foreign policy, making . the country one of Israel's most trusted allies in the EU. For decades, criticism of Israel was . largely taboo, though that has begun to loosen in recent years, . particularly when discussing Netanyahu's hawkish stance on peace talks . with the Palestinians. Remembrance: A Jewish man looks at images of holocaust survivors at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. Some 200,000 aging survivors still live in Israel and the scars of the Holocaust have deeply influenced Israeli thinking over the years . The government, however, has resoundingly criticized Grass' poem. Politicans, leaders of Jewish groups and newspaper editorials have all accused Grass of turning reality upside-down by labeling Israel the aggressor and Iran the presumed victim. The author was also openly accused of being anti-Semitic, not least by the country's conservative mass-circulation tabloid Bild. Writing in the newspaper Sunday, Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle became the first Cabinet member to react publicly to the controversy. 'To put Israel and Iran morally on the same level is not intelligent, it is absurd,' Westerwelle wrote. A few voices have come forward to welcome Grass' comments as a valuable contribution to public debate, by dragging Israel's nuclear arsenal into the spotlight and outlining the danger of a military confrontation with Iran - which could cause global economic and military mayhem. 'It is a war that could plunge the entire world into the abyss,' editorialist Jakob Augstein wrote in Germany's top-rated news website Spiegel Online.","In his poem he wrote Israel 'could wipe out the Iranian people' with a 'first strike'
Grass' subsequent clarification that his criticism was directed at the Israeli Prime Minister and not the country as a whole, did little to calm the outcry .
Israel's interior minister, announced Grass would be barred citing an Israeli law preventing entry to ex-Nazis ."

China has warned David Cameron and Nick Clegg of ‘serious consequences’ for Britain after they had a private meeting with the Dalai Lama in London. Britain’s ambassador in Beijing, Sebastian Wood, was summoned to the foreign ministry to receive a rebuke from China’s vice foreign minister Song Tao. The foreign ministry said Monday’s meeting between the exiled Tibetan leader and the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister had ‘seriously interfered with China’s internal affairs’. Prime Minister David Cameron, centre, and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, right, meet the Dalai Lama during his visit to the UK to receive the Templeton Prize . A spokesman said Mr Song had told Mr Wood the British leaders should fully consider the ‘serious consequences’ of ignoring Beijing’s objections and going ahead with the meeting. He urged Britain to take ‘practical actions to correct the error’. A Beijing spokesman said: ‘We call on the British side to . . . stop conniving at and supporting separatist attempts to achieve Tibetan independence, take practical measures to eliminate the terrible impact and take actions to preserve Chinese-British relations.’ Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘The Dalai Lama is an important religious figure. We don’t want to see our relationship with China disrupted by the visit of the Dalai Lama. ‘The Dalai Lama travels all over the world and has visited the UK several times in the past, and I believe that former prime ministers also met him when they were in office.’ The Dalai Lama speaks to the audience during a ceremony in St Paul's Cathedral in central London yesterday to collect the Templeton Prize . The Templeton Prize valued at £1.1m is the world's largest award given to an individual, honouring a living person for making exceptional contributions to spiritual life . Both Gordon Brown and Tony Blair met the Dalai Lama. The Foreign Office said: ‘British ministers believe that who they see is a matter for them. If they choose to see someone, it does not necessarily indicate they support that individual’s viewpoint.’ The Dalai Lama, 76, has lived in exile in India since fleeing his homeland in 1959 after a failed uprising against Communist rule. He met Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg at St Paul’s Cathedral, where he received the Templeton Prize for his work affirming the spiritual dimension of life.","Exiled Tibetan leader is considered separatist by Beijing .

Grand finale: The Queen's granddaughter will carry the iconic flame down the finishing straight of the racecourse in Gloucestershire tomorrow . Zara Phillips spent today preparing to bring a royal touch to the next leg of the Olympic torch relay around Britain. The Queen's granddaughter will carry the iconic flame down the finishing straight of the Cheltenham Racecourse in Gloucestershire tomorrow. The 31-year-old will be riding her faithful horse, Toytown, who is now retired, and will light a cauldron at the racecourse, which will burn throughout the country-wide event. She met torchbearers Eleanor Smallwood, 15, and Toby Jones, 15, as well as children from Chilton Foilat Primary School in Hungerford, as the flame was carried from Taunton to Glastonbury to Bristol in the west of the country. Meanwhile, a woman was warming up to carry the torch today - just seven days after giving birth to her new-born son. Eleanore Regan, 28, was supposed to run with the flame while heavily pregnant, but gave birth to William eight days early, last Wednesday. The charity worker, who is also battling a brain tumour, still ran 300-metres through Bath, Somerset, with the torch yesterday while tiny William looked on. The torch resumed its epic journey at 8am this morning, starting in Taunton and heading through Ilminster and Glastonbury towards Bristol, where it ended the day at around 6pm . Ms Regan was selected for her tireless work over more than a decade to improve the lives of individuals and communities across the UK, Eastern Europe and Africa. Scroll down for video .

The mother of one, who is leading a fundraising group climbing Mount Kilimanjaro next year, is looking forward to the responsibility of carrying the torch, despite being heavily pregnant. 'This is such a great time for the country. I feel proud to be able to carry the flame amongst such inspirational people and in such a beautiful city,' she said. Organisers will be hoping for a repeat of the crowded streets during the first three days of the relay when excited onlookers gathered to catch a glimpse of the torch as it made its way from Cornwall to Somerset.

An Olympic torch bearer who sold her torch for £153,100 on eBay says she faces a £15,000 bill to settle the auction site’s selling fees because the winning bidder has so far failed to come forward. Sarah Milner Simonds, 38, has attracted attention in recent days since controversially placing her official torch and uniform on eBay to raise money for the community gardening group The People’s Plot. The community gardener - who ran with the flame through Dunster, Somerset, on Monday - said she was overjoyed and flabbergasted to find the auction had raised £153,100. But since the auction ended at 10.33pm on Sunday after attracting 163 bids, Sarah says the winning bidder has not been in touch and she fears it may have been a hoax. She said: 'EBay has strict rules stating bids are legally binding contracts and an invoice has been sent to the bidder for £153,100, but we have received no response so far. The buyer has a 100 per cent positive feedback rating based on previous purchases but just seems to have disappeared.' 'This is incredibly disappointing not only because The People’s Plot will miss out on this wonderful funding, but because it could now leave me out-of-pocket too. eBay has already been in contact asking me to pay the 10 per cent selling fee for the item, amounting to over £15,000. 'We just hope that the winning bidder comes forward and fulfils the deal.' Yesterday, rapper and music producer Will.i.am made a surprise appearance and carried the torch in Taunton town centre. He is one of several celebrities joining unsung heroes carrying the torch in areas including Glastonbury, Bath and Bristol today on the flame's journey through Britain. The torchbearers range in age from children to 91-year-old Doris Whiting. Mrs Whiting will be one of the oldest of the 8,000 torchbearers who will carry the Olympic flame on the way to the July 27 opening ceremony. The nonagenarian, from Trowbridge, will carry the flame through Shepton Mallet. Her nomination says he received an MBE in 2008 to recognise more than 30 years of community work. 'Doris is one of the few people I know who is instantly recognised by just her first name. Mention the name Doris in Trowbridge and everyone knows who you mean,' her nominator said. 'Not only Doris herself, but a great many in Trowbridge too would be delighted if she were to be selected for the honour of carrying the flame. A fitting climax to a long life of ceaseless service to the community.' There is also dedicated Gavin Harvey, 31, from Salisbury, who will carry the torch in Frome. He lost both legs while injured in a bomb blast while serving the Army in Afghanistan in August 2009. His wife, who nominated him, says: 'He lost both his legs, shattered his pelvis and suffered multiple internal injuries after spending 10 and a half weeks in hospital he was finally discharged. 'Since then he has been an inspiration to all who know him in his determination to live life to the full and still be a very active father to our two very young daughters.' A former heavy drinker and smoker who saw the error of her ways will carry the torch through Bristol. Joanne Plumbley, 36, from Tytherington, grew up disliking exercise but changed her lifestyle after joining the Territorial Army. 'Joanne grew up hating strenuous activity and was notoriously bad at games and sport,' her nominator says. 'By 20 she was a heavy drinker and smoker when she had a significant health scare. Subsequently she joined the Territorial Army as a combat medic which proved strong motivation for exercise.' A man who became a marathon runner after losing 14 stone in 18 months will be also be in the spotlight. Richard Warren carrying the Olympic Flame on the leg between Trowbridge and Bradford-on-Avon .

In Bath, 19-year-old James Eynon will be a torchbearer after being nominated for helping in a campaign to save his former school in the city from closure. He said: 'My radio interviews speeches and pieces in the local newspaper helped to overturn a decision to close my school just weeks before the closure was finalised. 'I have already shown that if you put your mind to things you can achieve your desired goal.' There are 16 ‘core vehicles’ assigned to accompany the torch for its epic journey. Everywhere the procession goes, a small army of support and ancilliary vehicles is also called into service. In Cornwall on Saturday, for example, the convoy was escorted by police motorcyclists bearing the emblems of five separate constabularies. In south Devon, an ambulance, local dignitaries, firearms officers and police ‘safety officers’ on BMW mountain bikes joined the parade. It was a similar turnout yesterday in north Devon and Somerset, with a bomb disposal team in the convoy. The London Olympic organising committee insists the vehicle fleet is necessary for what it describes as a ‘huge’ logistical operation, adding that each one has a specific and important role. For the three most prominent vehicles on parade, that role is mostly commercial. Sponsors Coca-Cola, Samsung and Lloyds TSB each have a truck or coach kitted out in brand-name colours and they travel full time with the convoy. By the time the convoy gets to the Olympic stadium in July it will have left a massive carbon footprint. Dr Wendy Buckley, director of Carbon Footprint Ltd, which helps organisations to become carbon neutral, told the Daily Mail that if 47 was a typical daily average for vehicles, they were likely to emit a total of 223 tons of carbon dioxide. That would be equivalent to driving a Toyota Prius hybrid car more than 1.4million miles. Alternatively, of course, the runners could borrow a tip from ancient Greece – and just run.","Flame set out from Taunton this morning on its continuing tour of Britain .

New documents released in Denver suggest a rogue local dentist who was found to have been reusing dirty syringes on patients for 12-years was also high on prescription drugs. The Colorado Board of Dental Examiners has said Dr. Stephen Stein wrote Vicodin and Vicoprofen prescriptions for his patients and then collected them himself while he was operating as a dentist between 1999 and 2011. The board has claimed that Dr. Stein was under the influence of these drugs while practicing dentistry in Denver and is accused of reusing sedation drugs, IV's and syringes on patients. Scroll Down for Video . Bad dentist: Dr Stephen Stein, pictured, is accused of being high while he reused sedation syringes on patients for nearly 12 years . Dr.Stein who denies criminal charges of prescription fraud while he was operating out of his offices in Highlands Ranch and Cherry Creek in Denver, did admit to attending rehab for chemical and substance abuse in 1998. This follows an advisory from Colorado health officials in July that thousands of Colorado residents could be at risk of HIV or hepatitis after Dr. Stein was found to have been reusing dirty sedation syringes on patients for nearly 12 years. State health officials requested 8,000 former patients of Dr. Stein get tested after a probe revealed the rogue dentist used the same syringes and needles for multiple patients to give intravenous medications, including sedation, between September 1999 and June 2011. 'Needles and syringes were used repeatedly, often days at a time,' a fact sheet on the state's website explains. Three people so far have tested positive, although it is not conclusive if it is because of maltreatment by Dr. Stein. 'The CDC and department confirmed it would be difficult if not . impossible to conclude definitively whether the dental practice was the . actual source of transmission for any of these positive test results,' the CDPHE said in a release sent out in early August. One anonymous former patient of Dr. Stein's spoke to 9NEWS in Denver after her husband was one of the three who received a positive diagnosis after testing - for Hepatitis C. The male patients had several procedures performed by Dr. Stein and the last was in September 2009 when the dentist removed one of his wisdom teeth. Dr. Stephen Stein was in a rehab facility in Colorado in 19998 before the period of 1999 to 2011 when he is accused of reusing syringes on patients and using prescription drugs . 'Because there can be a small amount of blood that remains in syringes and needles after an injection through an IV line, there is a risk of spread of bloodborne viruses, such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, between patients.' Dr Stein hasn't worked since June 2011, although his website gives no indication the dentist is no longer practicing. For more than two decades, Dr Stein worked out of Stein Oral and Facial Surgery at South Quebec Street, Highlands Ranch. Between August 2010 and June 2011, the dentist also worked at a surgery known by the same name or, to some, as New Image Dental Implant Center, located at East 1st Avenue, Denver. Celebrate: Dr Stein, pictured centre celebrating the opening of his Cherry Creek surgery in 2011, potentially infected patients with HIV or hepatitis . Another surgeon, Dr Jeremy Miner, has taken over the Highlands Ranch office. The state is contacted at least 8,000 at-risk patients they have identified through dental records, advising them to get checked for HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C, and also appealing to the public in a bid to reach those they have no addresses for. Infected: At least 8,000 patients could be at risk of HIV or hepatitis because of Dr Stein's 'mind-blowing' blunder . Dr Stein's patients who got only local, oral anesthetic shots are not believed to be at risk of the potentially deadly viruses and no infections have been reported so far. Hollynd Hoskins, a Denver attorney who represented victims who were infected with Hepatitis C at Rose Medical Center in 2009, told the Denver Post that Dr Stein's alleged reuse of syringes and needles was 'mind-blowing and indicates an utter disregard of the known consequences of spreading life-threatening diseases.' Colorado public health director Dr Chris Urbina added: 'This is a very unusual case, and that's why we're taking this so seriously.' Patients who don't know whether they . received IV medication should get tested anyway and those who were . treated by Dr Stein prior to 1999 should if they are concerned, but the . state doesn't know whether syringes were being reused back then. Those . who are sure they didn't get an IV don't need to be tested. Surgery: Patients who had an IV at Dr Stein's East 1st Avenue, Denver, office, pictured, or at Highlands Ranch are being asked to get tested . The Dental Examiners' Board forced Dr Stein to stop practicing on June 24, 2011, although the ruling was unrelated to his potentially infecting thousands of patients with bloodbourne viruses, according to the Denver Post. The Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies, which overseas medical licenses, refused to disclose the nature of the complaint that prompted its investigation, and by chance brought the unsafe syringe use to light. 'When public safety became an issue, we immediately jumped on it,' spokesman Maulid Miskell told the newspaper.","A July report also revealed that Dr. Stephen Stein was found to have been reusing dirty .

George Zimmerman’s father took the stand today at his son’s bond hearing, telling the Florida court in a sort of mini-trial that the chilling howl in the now notorious 911 tapes were ‘absolutely George’s.’ Robert Zimmerman told those in the Seminole County courtroom in Sanford – including the parents of slain teen Travyon Martin – that the screams are from his son, George, and not Martin, which goes directly against what Martin’s parents testified. Both were wearing dark suits and conservative ties, and the faint lines of bulletproof vests could be seen under each of their shirts. Taking the stand: George Zimmerman's father, Robert Zimmerman, told the court at his son's bond hearing that the screams from the 911 tapes are 'absolutely George's' Appearance: George Zimmerman, left, seen with longer hair, and attorney Don West appear before Circuit Judge Kenneth R. Lester, Jr. today; Zimmerman did not testify . George Zimmerman himself did not testify at the hearing, though his attorney, Mark O’Mara briefly considered it. The judge presiding over the case, Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester, did not immediately release a decision on whether or not he will again allow Zimmerman to post bond, nor did he indicate when he might make a decision. He had revoked Zimmerman's bond earlier this month when prosecutors told the judge Zimmerman and his wife misled the court about how much money they had during the April bond hearing. Prosecutors said a website Zimmerman created for his legal defence had raised $135,000 at the time of his first bond hearing, and Zimmerman and his wife did not mention the money then. Much of the bond hearing focused on the donations raised through a PayPal account and how it was repeatedly transferred between bank accounts Zimmerman and his wife controlled. Waiting game: Circuit Judge Kenneth R. Lester has not decided whether or not to let Zimmerman out on bond again; he revoked the first $150,000 bond earlier this month . Hidden words: Tracy Martin (left) and Sybrina Fulton, the parents of Trayvon Martin, talk to each other while listening to testimony during a bond hearing for Zimmerman at the Seminole County Criminal Justice Center . Stress: At another point in the hearing, Martin's mother puts her hand to her face, her eyes closed . 'It was done to hide the money so they could deceive the court, lie to the court. Mr. Zimmerman lied to the court and this defendant just sat there and let it happen,' prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda said. Zimmerman's attorney attempted to show there was no effort to hide the money from the judge.'It is not the grand conspiracy the state seems to suggest,' Mr O’Mara said. There was also a great deal of evidence and testimony about the head injuries Zimmerman suffered the night of the fight with Martin, including a broken nose and cuts on his skull. Zimmerman was also described by a probation officer as a 'model client' who had not violated any of his previous bond conditions. Open book: George Zimmerman sits (left) while attorney Mark O'Mara argues in his defense during his bond hearing; O'Mara told the judge Zimmerman has nothing to hide . Emotion: Mark O'Mara (left) has an exchange with Assistant State Attorney Bernardo de la Rionda (right) during the hearing . At times, the bond hearing had the flavour of a trial or a self-defence hearing, with both sides presenting what sounded like opening statements. Attorneys for Zimmerman called prosecutors' case weak and said he gave 11 voluntary statements to police and re-enacted the shooting with authorities. O'Mara twice played a chilling 911 call in which someone is repeatedly screaming 'help' in the background. A gunshot is also heard on the recording. George Zimmerman's father took the witness stand and testified that he was certain that it was his son yelling for help on the tape. Prosecutors argued they had evidence that Zimmerman was the aggressor and chased Martin, who they said acted in self-defence. Other evidence: Sanford firefighter K.P. O'Rourke looks at a photo of George Zimmerman on the stand as he testifies . But the judge was not ruling on the merits of the case. Instead, the judge was focused on what happened at the previous bond hearing. Zimmerman's attorney called an expert on finances to testify, attempting to show that Zimmerman and his wife did not try to hide anything. Adam Magill, a financial forensic specialist, said everything was in order and matched up 'perfectly.' But Magill also testified that moving the money around from different accounts would 'make it appear that you didn't have the money.' Also in court: Trayvon Martin's mother Sybrina Fulton, centre, arrives at the Seminole County Criminal Justice Center today for Zimmerman's bond hearing . Family ties: Tracy Martin, far left, Jahvaris Futlton, second from left back, brother of Travon Martin, an unidentified man, center, Sybrina Fulton, and attorney Benjamin Crump, far right, all attended the hearing . Prosecutors also said the couple talked in code during recorded jailhouse conversations about how to transfer the donations to different bank accounts. At one point, George Zimmerman asked how much money they had. She replied '$155.' Prosecutors allege that was code for $155,000. Their reference to 'Peter Pan' was code for the PayPal system through which the donations were made, prosecutors said. Shellie Zimmerman has since been charged with perjury. She is out of jail on $1,000 bond and her arraignment is set for July 31. Zimmerman's defence also played videos of Zimmerman talking and showing his injuries after the shooting. Attorneys then spent time questioning Kevin O'Rourke, a Sanford firefighter and emergency medical technician who responded to the shooting scene. Attorneys asked questions about the extent of Zimmerman's injuries, particularly how much blood was on his head and face. 'A good 45 per cent of his head and face were covered with blood,' O'Rourke said. Zimmerman has been charged with second-degree murder for fatally shooting 17-year-old Martin on Feb. 26 at a gated apartment community in Sanford. Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty and claims the shooting was self-defence under the state's 'stand your ground' law. Martin's parents and supporters claim the teenager was targeted because he was black and Zimmerman started the confrontation that led to the shooting. Zimmerman's father is white and his mother is Hispanic.The 44 days between the shooting and Zimmerman's arrest inspired nationwide protests, led to the departure of the Sanford police chief and prompted a U.S. Department of Justice probe.

Samsung posted net profits of 5.04 trillion won - $4.44 billion - US dollars for the first quarter of 2012, up 81.3 percent from 2.78 trillion won a year earlier . Samsung sold 20,000 of its Galaxy handsets every hour during the months from January to Match - outselling Apple's iPhone by 44.5 million to 35.1 million. One in four phones sold is now a Samsung - putting the electronics giant ahead of Nokia for the first  time. The sales catapulted the Korean giant to a record $5.2 billion quarterly profit. The record figures came as a respected analyst from Forrester research warned that Apple would 'decline' without Steve Jobs's leadership. 'When Steve Jobs departed, he took three things with him, charismatic leadership, the ability to take big risks, and an unparalleled ability to envision and design products,' says George Colony, CEO of Forrester research. 'Apple’s momentum will carry it for 24-48 months. But without the arrival of a new charismatic leader it, like Sony will coast, and then decelerate.' The new figures seem to tally with Colony's prediction. Chairman Lee Kun-hee's South Korean group, whose $190 billion market value is 11 times that of Japanese rival Sony Corp, sold 93.5 million handsets in the first quarter. During the first quarter of this year, more than one in every four phones sold was a Samsung handset - according to Strategy Analytics, overtaking long-time handset leader Nokia. The total included 44.5 million smartphones, giving Samsung a 30.6 percent share of the high-end market. Apple's sales of 35.1 million iPhones gave it a 24.1 percent share. Demand for the company's Galaxy S2 smartphones beat expectations, and the Galaxy Note tablet computer also sold well . Samsung reported record first-quater profits boosted by a surge in sales of its Galaxy smartphones as it outsold Apple's iPhone and became the world's top mobile phone maker . ‘Samsung and Apple are out-competing most major rivals and the smartphone market is at risk of becoming a two-horse race,’ said Neil Mawston, an analyst at Strategy Analytics. CLSA analyst Matt Evans said in a recent report that ‘Samsung's smartphone success in the first quarter was the flip-side of Nokia's disappointment.’ The near duopoly in high-end smartphones is unlikely to come under much threat this year or next, according to Bernstein analysts, and Samsung will look to keep that momentum going next week with the launch in London of a third generation of Galaxy S, hoping to boost sales ahead of the summer Olympics, where the group is among the leading sponsors. ‘The Galaxy S 3's . specifications are expected to be sensational and it's already drawing . strong interest from the market and consumers,’ said Brian Park, an . analyst at Tong Yang Securities. The new Galaxy will be powered by . Samsung's quad-core microprocessor, which the company hopes to see used . in handsets sold by Nokia, HTC and Motorola, as well as Apple, its . biggest customer for components. ‘We . anticipate very strong demand for the Galaxy S 3,’ Robert Yi, Samsung's . senior vice president and head of investor relations, told analysts. ‘When there's strong demand in the market, we don't necessarily need to . spend a lot of marketing dollars to promote sales.’ Analysts warned that the battle for domination of the lucrative smartphone market was becoming a 'two-horse race' between Apple and Samsung . Samsung's dominance of the mobile phone sector ends a long reign for Nokia. Nokia became the world's largest cellphone maker 1998 when . it overtook Motorola - at a time when Samsung had just entered the industry - . and it controlled around 40 percent of the market for years before Apple Inc's . iPhone was unveiled in 2007, launching the smartphone boom. Some analysts said losing the top spot would be a blow to . Nokia, but would have little impact on its attempt to turn around its fortunes. ‘I think it will hurt them from a PR . perspective, but in reality it does not change anything: at the end of the day . the problems are the same if they remain the No 1 or become the No 2,’ said . analyst Carolina Milanesi at Gartner. ‘In contrast it will be greeted with euphoria by Samsung - . they'll be dancing from the boardroom to the factory floor,’ Wood said.","Samsung sells 44.5 million smartphones - Apple sells 35.1 million iPhones .

Gunned down: Modesto Pellino was shot seven times in front of dozens of people in the busy central square in Nettuno, near Rome . Fears are growing that Rome may be at the centre of a Mafia turf war after a gangster was gunned down in a busy square. Modesto Pellino, 46, was on the phone when he was shot seven times in front of dozens of people in the central square of Nettuno, near the Italian capital. More than two dozen similar execution-style killings have been carried out on Rome's streets in the last year, as organised criminals from the capital and elsewhere battle over territory and interests in drugs and extortion. Pellino had previous convictions and known links with the Moccia clan of Naples's Camorra, one of Italy's oldest and largest criminal organisations which dates back to the 18th century. Zaratti Filiberto, chairman of the Lazio region's security and crime prevention commission, said police chiefs had warned that rival gangs from different Mafia groups were operating in and around the capital. 'This is the umpteenth episode of tit-for-tat in an area where the clans have been jockeying for dominance for some time,' he told La Repubblica newspaper. 'After some months of silence the gunfire has returned... The brutality of the murder, carried out in broad daylight in one of the city's main squares shows how worryingly powerful organised crime has become in this area.' Turf war: The shooting follows more than two dozen similar execution-style killings on Rome's streets in the last year . Experts believe the rise in violence may be linked to the resurgence of Rome's Magliana gang. Younger elements of the gang are fighting over the drug trade, possibly in conflict with members of southern Mafia groups such as Camorra and 'Ndrangheta, the Independent reported. Rome's mayor, Gianni Alemanno, has admitted the city is suffering an 'assault by organised crime, the like of which we haven't seen since the 1970s'. Opposition politicians say the capital has become the new 'Wild West' and have accused Alemanno of failing to keep his promise to clean it up.

Charges: Mobile phone companies could be making up to £90 million a year by legally using 'hidden' contract clauses . Mobile phone companies could be making up to £90 million a year by legally using 'hidden' contract clauses to raise the cost of what should be fixed-rate tariffs, the consumer group Which? has warned. The organisation has filed an official complaint to regulator Ofcom after an investigation found that 70 per cent of people on fixed contracts did not know that network providers could increase prices during the lifetime of their contract. It has launched a campaign, Fixed Means Fixed, calling for an end to price increases on mobile phone contracts, arguing they should stay the same price from start to finish of the contract. Richard Lloyd, the executive director . of Which?, said: 'These hidden price rises mean millions of people are . forced to pay more than they expected at a time when household budgets . are already squeezed. 'They are then trapped in a contract, unable to switch to a cheaper provider without paying a hefty penalty. 'Ofcom must intervene now and stamp this out. Consumers must be confident that fixed really does mean fixed.' Which? said companies including Three, Vodafone, T Mobile and Orange were all . raising prices, saying Three was today increasing its fixed-tariff . prices by 3.6 per cent, a move Which? said would affect more than one . million customers. It said it had been contacted by more than 1,700 people regarding price rises and called for price and all other aspects of fixed deals to remain the same for the contract period when consumers are also tied-in. If there is a chance that prices may rise, operators must be more upfront about this in their advertising and allow people to switch providers without penalty, it said. On its website, Three said it was increasing the cost of phone and mobile broadband contracts set up before March 8 2012 by 3.6 per cent, in line with the Retail Price Index (RPI) measure of inflation. 'Our terms and conditions allow us to raise prices in line with inflation so that we can cover our business costs,' it said. 'This means that you won’t be able to leave your contract early as a result of this change. Investigating: Ofcom said it had been investigating the . practice across all networks since January after receiving complaints . 'While we know a price increase is never welcome, this is the first time that we’ve ever raised the price of our pay monthly phone contracts and we’re confident that your plan still represents excellent value for money.' Ofcom said it had been investigating the practice across all networks since January after receiving complaints and said it would look at information submitted by Which? A spokesman said: 'We understand why consumers in fixed term contracts are sometimes disappointed to find that the particular contract they have signed up to allows price rises. 'While current rules allow for contracts to include price increases in certain circumstances, after receiving consumer complaints on this issue, Ofcom launched a review in January 2012. 'The review is examining requirements on communications providers relating to consumer contracts, including provisions covering changes to contracts. 'This exercise has identified a number of potential issues with the current regime and the adequacy of the current level of customer protection. 'We will consider the material provided by Which? alongside this evidence.

Some of the secrets of Saturn’s pock-marked moon Phoebe have been revealed, with Nasa scientists discovering that it is actually remarkably planet-like. Thanks to data beamed back from the agency’s Cassini probe, which has been loitering nearby, astronomers now know that the moon is far rounder than previously thought. What’s more, they believe that the moon may have actually been warm for tens of millions of years – and probably hosted water. Rock on: Phoebe's true nature is revealed in startling clarity in this mosaic of two images taken during Cassini's flyby on June 11, 2004, from 20,200 miles away . Scientists had their first close-up look at Phoebe when Cassini began exploring the Saturn system in 2004. Using data from multiple spacecraft instruments and a computer model of the moon's chemistry, geophysics and geology, scientists found Phoebe was a so-called planetesimal, or remnant planetary building block. ‘Unlike primitive bodies such as comets, Phoebe appears to have actively evolved for a time before it stalled out,’ said Julie Castillo-Rogez, a planetary scientist at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. ‘Objects like Phoebe are thought to have condensed very quickly. Hence, they represent building blocks of planets. They give scientists clues about what conditions were like around the time of the birth of planets and their moons.’ Cassini images suggest Phoebe originated in the far-off Kuiper Belt, the region of ancient, icy, rocky bodies beyond Neptune's orbit. Rounding out the facts: This panel of images shows the nearly spherical shape of Phoebe . Saturn lies 890 million miles from the Sun on average. It has a diameter of 74,897 miles. It’s a very very cold planet, with an average temperature of -140C (-220F). It’s made of liquid and solid hydrogen and helium and is so light it would float on water. It’s most famous for its rings, which were first discovered in the 17th-century. They extend 46,000 miles out and have a total diameter of almost 170,000 miles. It has 60 moons – more than any other planet in the solar system, bar Jupiter. One of them, Titan, is the second largest in the solar system and actually has an atmosphere – composed mainly of nitrogen. Saturn is extremely stormy, with winds gusting at 1,000mph at the equator. Data show Phoebe was spherical and hot early in its history, and has denser rock-rich material concentrated near its centre. Its average density is about the same as Pluto, another object in the Kuiper Belt. Phoebe likely was captured by Saturn's gravity when it somehow got close to the giant planet. Saturn is surrounded by a cloud of irregular moons that circle the planet in orbits tilted from Saturn's orbit around the sun, the so-called equatorial plane. Phoebe is the largest of these irregular moons and also has the distinction of orbiting backward in relation to the other moons. Saturn's large moons appear to have formed from gas and dust orbiting in the planet's equatorial plane. These moons currently orbit Saturn in that same plane. ‘By combining Cassini data with modeling techniques previously applied to other solar system bodies, we've been able to go back in time and clarify why it is so different from the rest of the Saturn system,’ said Jonathan Lunine, a co-author on the study and a Cassini team member at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. Analyses suggest that Phoebe was born within the first three million years of the birth of the solar system, which occurred 4.5 billion years ago. The moon may originally have been porous but appears to have collapsed in on itself as it warmed up. Phoebe developed a density 40 per cent higher than the average inner Saturnian moon. Objects of Phoebe's size have long been thought to form as ‘potato-shaped’ bodies and remained that way over their lifetimes. If such an object formed early enough in the solar system's history, it could have harboured the kinds of radioactive material that would produce substantial heat over a short timescale. This would warm the interior and reshape the moon. Stunning: Saturn's rings stretch 46,000 miles into space . ‘From the shape seen in Cassini images and modelling the likely cratering history, we were able to see that Phoebe started with a nearly spherical shape, rather than being an irregular shape later smoothed into a sphere by impacts,’ said co-author Peter Thomas, a Cassini team member at Cornell. Phoebe likely stayed warm for tens of millions of years before freezing up. The study suggests the heat also would have enabled the moon to host liquid water at one time. This could explain the signature of water-rich material on Phoebe's surface previously detected by Cassini. The new study also is consistent with the idea that several hundred million years after Phoebe cooled, the moon drifted toward the inner solar system in a solar-system-wide rearrangement. Phoebe was large enough to survive this turbulence. More than 60 moons are known to orbit Saturn, varying drastically in shape, size, surface age and origin. Scientists using both ground-based observatories and Cassini's cameras continue to search for others. The findings appear in the April issue of the Journal Icarus.",Phoebe was probably warm for tens of millions of years before it froze up .

One of the more unusual arrest warrants in US history was issued yesterday when a federal judge authorised the Department of Homeland Security to seize a dinosaur from an art company. The US government is trying to force the auction house to return the skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus bataar that roamed Mongolia 70 million years ago to the Asian country. The nearly complete fossil is believed to have been unearthed between 1995 and 2005 and is one of several specimens first discovered in the Gobi desert in 1946. 'Looted': This 70million-year-old Tyrannosaurus bataar skeleton is at the centre of a legal battle demanding it be handed over to the U.S. government so it can be returned to Mongolia . The skeleton is 24 feet (7.31 meters) long and eight feet (2.43 meters) tall. Tyrannosaurus bataar is estimated to have weighed a ton. Despite a Mongolian law declaring fossils property of the state and banning their export, the skeleton arrived in Gainesville, Florida, in March 2010. It was sold at a New York auction on May 20 for $1.05million by Heritage Auctions. According to documents filed Monday in U.S. District Court in New York, it is alleged to have been illegally imported from Britain through false claims that it was worth $15,000. US authorities are now demanding that it be handed over to the government so that it can be returned to Mongolia. 'Wrongly taken': The nearly complete fossil is believed to have been unearthed in Mongolia's Gobi desert (pictured) between 1995 and 2005 . The government of Mongolia had obtained an injunction judge in Texas - where the auction house is based - to prevent the sale of the skeleton, but it went ahead anyway. 'We auctioned the Tyrannosaurus bataar conditionally, subject to future court rulings, so this matter is now in the hands of lawyers and politicians,' Jim Halperin, co-chairman of Heritage Auctions, said. US Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement the skeletal remains are 'of tremendous cultural and historic significance to the people of Mongolia and provide a connection to the country's prehistoric past'. 'When the skeleton was allegedly looted, a piece of the country's natural history was stolen with it, and we look forward to returning it to its rightful place,' he said. The news release also included a quote from Mongolia's President Tsakhia Elbegdorj, saying he was thankful for U.S. efforts to recover the skeleton, calling it 'an important piece of the cultural heritage of the Mongolian people.' A June 5 examination by three experts has concluded that the Tyrannosaurus bataar skeleton almost certainly originated in the Nemegt Basin in Mongolia. But according to Heritage, the consignor purchased the fossil in 'good faith, then spent a year of his life and considerable expense identifying, restoring, mounting and preparing what had previously been a much less valuable matrix of unassembled, underlying bones'. A statement on the day of the auction said it marked 'the first time a fully prepared Tyrannosaur has been made available at public auction'.","70m-year-old Tyrannosaurus bataar fossil was unearthed in Gobi desert .

Superior Court Commissioner Mitchell Block ruled that she could be released to home confinement when electronic monitoring is set up. Day in court: U.S. Open referee Lois Ann Goodman pleaded not guilty on Wednesday in Los Angeles and won a bail reduction . 'Ailments': Lois Goodman, center, with her attorney, Allison Triessl, who claimed the 70-year-old tennis referee could not have murdered her husband as she has arthritis and needs a shoulder replacement . The commissioner cited her ties to the community and lack of criminal record in making that decision. But prosecutor Sharon Ranson paints a different pictures of Goodman, telling the judge that she went to get a manicure as her husband lay dying, according to the Los Angeles Times. In arguing for reduced bail, Treissl . argued that there was no chance Goodman would flee as she does not have a . passport and has strong ties to the San Fernando Valley where she was . born and raised. She . added that Goodman cooperated with the police investigation and . submitted to three interviews, even driving herself to the police . station when she was summoned.

About two dozen supporters filled the courtroom. Goodman, . who has refereed matches between many tennis greats, was arrested last . week in New York just before she was to referee at the U.S. Open. Plea: She was extradited back to Los Angeles for her trial, but her lawyer has asked for her bail to be reduced . 'Victim': Her husband of nearly 50 years, Alan .

Her husband, 80-year-old Alan Goodman, died in April. Authorities initially believed he likely fell down stairs at home while she was away, but later decided it was murder. Goodman, who is well-known in . professional tennis circles, stands accused of murdering her husband, . Alan, at their condominium in Los Angeles, California, on April 17 by . smashing a coffee mug over his head and stabbing him to death with the . sharp, broken handle. The prosecution asserted Wednesday that the victim was struck 10 times on the head and there was evidence of Lois Goodman’s premeditation and no remorse. Defense attorney Alison Triessl has claimed her client was physically incapable of committing the crime, saying that she suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, . hearing loss and constant spinal pain that's controlled by an electronic . device implanted in her spine. She has also had two knee replacements, Triessl said. Triessl wrote in a previous filing that Goodman has many infirmities, including knee and shoulder replacements, and couldn't have bludgeoned her husband to death. She had also submitted 40 . testimonial letters from colleagues, neighbours, family and friends, . lauding Goodman as a beloved friend, mother and grandmother who treated . her husband like a king and was never violent. Questions: Goodman, right, features in a sketch in a Manhattan court last Friday before she was sent to L.A. The mother of three told authorities she had arrived home to find the blood-covered coffee mug and her husband lying in bed not breathing after apparently falling down the stairs. But after paramedics and investigators became suspicious of the man's grisly injuries - including deep wounds to his head - Goodman was arrested on a murder charge. She was arrested last week in New York, . where she was preparing for this week's U.S. Open - just one . of many high-profile tournaments she had worked since 1979. Claims have also emerged that she was . having an affair, after police found emails and handwritten letters to . another man during a search of the house. 'Lois minimised what she had seen,' Detective Jeffrey Briscoe of the Los Angeles Police Department said . of an interview four days after the death. 'Lois’ emotional reaction to . what she had seen and the loss of her husband was not typical of a . grieving spouse.' She . had told detectives that she arrived home and found a trail of blood leading . upstairs to a broken mug covered in blood. Arrest: Goodman was arrested for murder by NYPD last week while still wearing her U.S. Open uniform . She followed the blood to her . bedroom, where she found her husband not breathing, according to the . affidavit. She then called 911. Investigators . also deemed the large stain of blood near the stairs suggested he had . suffered an injury and stayed there for some time, court documents said. When . she was questioned again, Goodman said the body looked as if it had . been positioned by an intruder. Despite these conflicting accounts, . Goodman has protested her innocence.

Callous French fishermen are eating steaks carved from dolphins which have been illegally caught in the English Channel, conservationists claim. Experts believe the animals are being hauled on board trawlers after becoming trapped in nets off the Cornish coast. Fillets of flesh are then sliced off to be eaten before the bodies of the highly intelligent mammals are callously tossed back into the water. Threat: Common dolphins seen off the Cornish coats. Wildlife experts have accused French fisherman of eating the animals . Since the beginning of January, Cornwall Wildlife Trust's Marine Strandings Network has examined and recorded 50 dead dolphins and porpoises. Just under half, 23, showed distinct signs of having died in fishing gear. A common dolphin, examined on the beach at Mousehole in early April, one of five discovered in the same week, showed scars typical of a large trawler net from which it presumably tried to escape. A spokesman for Cornwall Wildlife Trust said: 'A large fillet of flesh had been removed from the back - presumably for eating. 'This is a known practice on French boats and French pair trawlers were working close to the south coast at the time. 'The . dolphin's tail had been cut off in the course of cutting the animal . free from a winch strop which was used to lift it over the side of the . boat. Marks: A common dolphin discovered on the beach at Mousehole, Cornwall, shows signs off having been trapped in trawler nets . 'Local people were very upset to see what had been done to this beautiful animal and to hear that this was just one of many.' Cetacean researcher, Nick Tregenza, added: 'UK mid-water trawlers have been pushed outside the 12 mile limit by national fishery regulations but French vessels are allowed to come in closer. 'Some research is underway by the Sea Mammal Research Unit at St. Andrew's University in Scotland they're hopeful of finding an acoustic deterrent to keep animals out of the nets but there's no EU requirement on fisheries to use such a device. 'In the present situation we believe that EU mid-water trawlers should be subject to video monitoring to assess the size of the bycatch offshore of these animals that are so highly valued by people here and across the world.' Dolphins that died in gill nets were also recorded by the network and four porpoises that had been caught almost certainly by local boats were also found stranded. Nick Tregenza added: 'Many people are unaware that porpoises were a common sight quite close to shore in the recent past but they suffered a major decline that was almost certainly caused by pesticide pollution of the sea from agricultural run-off on land. 'That problem has diminished substantially and if pingers were widely adopted, we could expect to see porpoises along the coast and in our estuaries again.

A stylist employed by hairdresser Daniel Hersheson was left scarred for life after her clothes were set on fire by a candle at his flagship beauty salon, a court heard. Gail Purcell was badly burnt after the horrific accident at Mr Hersheson’s boutique in Conduit Street in the heart of London’s West End. Mr Hersheson is the head of a family beauty dynasty which includes his wife Ruth, son Luke, and daughter Lauren, and whose clients have included the Duchess of Cambridge, the socialite Tara Palmer Tomkinson, the model Pixie Geldof and the actress Sienna Miller. The injured stylist was employed by celebrity hairdresser Daniel Hersheson, whose clients include the Duchess of Cambridge (left) and Tara Palmer-Tomkinson (right) His firm, Rudan Ltd, accepted responsibility for the fire which broke out at the salon on May 29, 2009. Sarah Lefevre, prosecuting on behalf of the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, told Westminster Magistrates’ Court: ‘Ms Purcell felt a warmth to her legs and when she looked down she saw flames. ‘No fire alarm was sounded, nobody appeared to know what to do, and no first aid was administered to her.’ Ms Purcell was taken to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital following the fire, which was caused by candles placed around the salon for atmosphere. ‘She will be scarred for life and has suffered considerable discomfort’, said Ms Lefevre. ‘She has been away from work for a period of time and has been advised to keep out of the sun for a period measurable in years.’ Famous faces: The model Pixie Geldof (left) and the actress Sienna Miller (right) have been clients of Mr Hersheson's company . Fire investigators found the fire alarms at the salon were faulty, staff were untrained at dealing with emergencies, and there was a substandard fire risk assessment in place. It also emerged fire doors at the luxury boutique were routinely propped open. Ms Lefevre added that a proper risk assessment at the salon was carried out by LFEPA after the fire, showing why the original document was ‘far from satisfactory’. The company admitted two offences under fire safety legislation at magistrates’ court and faced a maximum £10,000 fine. But District Judge Andrew Sweet decided his sentencing powers were not enough and opted to send the case to Southwark Crown Court at a date to be fixed where unlimited fines can be handed out. ‘I reached my view based on the facts brought to my attention today’, he said. ‘My powers of sentencing in this court are not adequate to reflect the appropriate sentence, and for that reason I’m of the view the case should be sent to the crown court.’","Gail Purcell, who was employed by hairdresser Daniel Hersheson,  was badly burnt after her clothes were set on fire by a candle, court heard .

As Kristen Stewart and Rupert Sanders attempt to rebuild their broken relationships, the Snow White And The Huntsman director's wife believed they had already conquered their marriage woes. In a frank interview, just two weeks ago with YOU magazine, Liberty Ross revealed her ten-year marriage had suffered due to Rupert's catapulting career in Tinseltown - which led to his absence. Following last night's news - and photographic evidence - that the 41-year-old engaged in infidelities with the Twilight actress during a tryst last Tuesday, the 'absence' of which Liberty speaks now casts a sinister new light. Scroll down for video . Can they survive? Liberty Ross believed her marriage woes to Rupert Sanders had been solved . Bad news: It emerged yesterday that Kristen Stewart had an affair with Liberty Ross' husband Rupert Sanders . Speaking to YOU, Liberty said: 'I . think that having been a model and so self-sufficient for those years, I . was very ready to get married and have babies. 'I romanticised domesticity for a while, and loved having a shopping list of groceries stuck to the fridge for the first time. 'But moving here (from London to LA) and starting a life all over again was a lot harder than I had . anticipated. I just didn’t think it would be as isolating and daunting . as it turned out to be. 'I can honestly say that it took me five years to feel happy here.' The 33-year-old beauty then opened up . even further, insinuating she lived life as a single mother, but never . actually saying a bad word about her beloved Rupert. She continued: 'I would never say out loud that I am raising my children alone, but a lot of the time it has felt like that. Too much: Liberty, pictured with Rupert on the set of Snow White and The Huntsman, has deleted her Twitter . Passionate: Kristen and Rupert, at a May screening of their movie, were caught in a romantic clinch . 'I went from the glamour of working . with Karl Lagerfeld and John Galliano to living on an isolated hilltop, . with my husband gone most of the time.' However, she seemed to think they had . conquered their differences, adding: 'But that’s why everything feels . so amazing now. We rode through the really hard times and we stuck it . out... 'Without them (her siblings, four out . of six whom also live in Los Angeles) I probably would have packed up . and gone back to London.' Liberty's world was turned upside down when allegations emerged that K-Stew had an affair with her husband. And the model and actress, who played 22-year-old Kristen’s mother in . Snow White and the Huntsman, responded yesterday by tweeting just one word: 'Wow.' She posted the message on July 24, just moments after Us Weekly called her director husband's spokesperson for comment, according to the magazine. Cryptic: Liberty retweeted this Marilyn Monroe quote shortly before deleting her Twitter account . Co-stars: Liberty, pictured with (L-R) Charlize Theron, Kristen, and Lily Cole, played Kristen's mother in the fantasy film . Liberty, . who has two young children with Rupert, has since deleted her Twitter . account, presumably due to being bombarded with messages after the news . broke. Before deleting her page Liberty had also posted a series of cryptic tweets that seemed to be referencing the alleged affair. She retweeted a quote from Marilyn Monroe which read: 'Sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.' She . later followed this with another retweet, this time quoting American . author and poet Maya Angelou, saying: 'If you find it in your heart to . care for somebody else, you will have succeeded.' Liberty played Queen Eleanor to . Kristen’s Snow White in the box office hit, which was directed by Rupert . and released last month. Kristen today issued a grovelling apology to her boyfriend, Twilight co-star Robert Pattinson, in a uprising public statement. Mum's the word: Liberty played Queen Eleanor, the late mother of Snow White in the film . Star of the show: Kristen played a grown-up Snow White in the modern adaptation of the fairytale . In a statement to People, she said: 'I'm deeply sorry for the hurt and embarrassment I've caused to those close to me and everyone this has affected. 'This momentary indiscretion has . jeopardised the most important thing in my life, the person I love and . respect the most, Rob. I love him, I love him, I'm so sorry.' Rupert quickly followed suit and issued a statement to People which . said: 'I am utterly distraught about the pain I have caused my family. My beautiful wife and heavenly children are all I have in this world. I . love them with all my heart. I am praying that we can get through this . together.' Only a few weeks ago, Liberty gushed . to YOU about how proud she is of her husband since he found . fame in his own right, compared to when she was the bigger star. She recalled how she used to call him . 'the Hand' and explained: 'In every picture that was taken of me at a . party or a premiere, he'd be chopped off, and all you would ever see was . his hand. 'At the world premiere in London, I . had tears in my eyes, because we got out of our fancy car and all of his . fans started screaming his name. The tables had really turned!' The pair married when Liberty was 24 . and Rupert was 31, and Liberty said of the beginnings of their romance: . 'Once we started going out, I knew he was the one for me. He is a very . special soul.' More trouble ahead?: Rupert has signed on to helm the sequel to the Snow White saga starring Kristen . They have seven-year-old daughter Skyla and a five-year-old-son named Tennyson together. Kristen's infidelity came just months after Robert gave an interview to .

Bullish: David Cameron's chief adviser Steve Hilton (above) has left Downing Street, but not before firing a broadside in frustration at the slow pace of Whitehall and welfare reforms . A row has broken out between the head of the civil service and ministers over plans to reform Whitehall by slashing the number of public sector workers. Sir Bob Kerslake has publicly rejected suggestions by ministers that civil servants are ‘lazy’ and has hit back at reports that his staff will be cut by between 70 and 90 per cent. Meanwhile, a meeting between the mandarin and David Cameron’s policy adviser Steve Hilton ended in Mr Hilton storming out in apparent frustration. Revealing his thoughts on Twitter last week, Sir Bob described a meeting with Education Department staff, saying: ‘Really enjoyed talking to DfE staff yesterday. Lots of good, challenging questions. Rebutted recent rubbish about “lazy” civil servants.’ He added: ‘For the avoidance of doubt there are absolutely no plans to cut the civil service by either 70 or 90 per cent.’ It followed his heated row last month with Mr Hilton, who will soon be leaving his post to move to California, over Whitehall reforms including staff numbers and plans to introduce some fixed-term contracts. Mr Hilton, who is reported to want to see the number of civil servants reduced by 90 per cent, was so frustrated he stormed out. He and others at the heart of No 10 blame the civil service for resisting many of the Tories’ more radical reforms – including the sacking of poor performers and fast-tracking of high fliers. Downing Street now wants to bypass senior civil servants when it comes up with new policy ideas to prevent them being lost in the Whitehall machine. On Sabbatical: Mr Hilton, who has worked closely with Mr Cameron for more than five years, is heading to California this week to study how governance can be improved . Ministers have grown increasingly angry at a culture which sees civil servants holding on to their jobs, along with generous salaries, flexible hours and pension perks. The overhaul of Britain’s army of Whitehall bureaucrats will be unveiled in the next month. Ministers have been asked whether they could run their departments with as little as a third of their current staff. Downing Street wants them to produce detailed reports on the impact of a ‘radical’ reduction in numbers. The Government is also drawing up plans to bring in more workers from the private sector to formulate policy. Sources have revealed that under the outsourcing scheme, departments would commission consultancies, charities or think-tanks to draw up policy. Barriers: Head of the Civil Service, Sir Bob Kerslake (left), and new Cabinet Secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood (right), have both been resisting Mr Hilton's radical reforms, much to his frustration . The shake-up could also see civil servants ranked according to their ability. And Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude is being encouraged by colleagues to put permanent secretaries on fixed-term contracts to make them more accountable. But Sir Bob, who is also permanent secretary at the Department for Communities and Local Government, told Mr Hilton that talk of shrinking their numbers was ‘flipping nonsense’. The radical measures will infuriate public sector unions, who staged another day of industrial action last week. Strategist: Mr Hilton is moving to California with his wife, where he will take up a teaching post and learn about better governance at Stanford University . In a further sign of tension, Ian Watmore, the senior civil servant in charge of the Coalition’s Whitehall cost-cutting drive, has announced he is resigning to spend more time with his family. His surprise announcement came after it emerged that the Efficiency and Reform Group, which he established, has cost taxpayers £60million in just two years. Mr Watmore, who was put in charge of finding billions of pounds of efficiency savings soon after the Coalition was formed in 2010, will quit at the end of June to focus on non-executive and ‘spousal roles’ in support of his wife, who has recently become a vicar. There are 434,000 civil servants, the lowest number since the Second World War and down from more than 500,000 at the time of the 2010 General Election.","Steve Hilton frustrated by slow pace of Government reforms .

It is the latest twist in a tail that could have come straight out of one of Oprah Winfrey's chat shows. One week after the billionaire bought her father Vernon's barber shop when it went into foreclosure, he has been accused of cheating on his wife and making threats to kill her. It comes at the same time Oprah is accused of trying to force her stepmother out of the marital home. Barbara Winfrey made the accusations against Vernon Winfrey, 79, in divorce papers, claiming her husband conspired with his daughter to have her thrown out of their home in East Nashville, Tennessee even though she has nowhere to go. Divorce battle: Barbara Winfrey, right, made accusations against Vernon Winfrey, left, in divorce papers saying he threatened to kill her and cheated on her numerous times . Family feud: Oprah Winfrey bought her father Vernon's property when it went into foreclosure at the beginning of this month, paying $425,000 . According to The Tennessean, Barbara Winfrey claimed in Williamson County court that on one occasion, her husband 'became angered at her, chased her with a gun and threatened to shoot her. She also claims he had 'more than one adulterous relationship' during their 12-year marriage. The accusations were made in a counterclaim after Vernon Winfrey filed for divorce from his third wife on June 22, just five days after their 12th anniversary. He claimed that his 64-year-old wife was 'guilty of inappropriate marital conduct' and cited irreconcilable differences. She denies the claims. The couple lived together in the gated . Laurel Brooke subdivision in Williamson County’s Grassland community, according to the Tennessean, in a property worth almost $1.5 million. But because the home is titled in Oprah's name, both she and her father have been trying to force Barbara - who is seeking alimony support - out of the marital home even though she has nowhere to go, according to the court papers. Dispute: Vernon Winfrey filed for divorce from his wife of 12 years saying she was guilty of 'inappropriate marital conduct' which she has denied . The store in Nashville, Tennessee, was bought by Oprah last week for $475,000. Barbara . Winfrey said the purchase means the chat show host, who now runs her . own YV network, has gained control of the business and cut her out. Bail out: Oprah Winfrey paid $425,000 on July 2 for her father's property when it went into foreclosure and her stepmother has accused her of trying to force her out . ‘I know what is going on. I'm tired of it, and I've had enough,’ Barbara Winfrey told WSMV TV in Nashville. On the same day Oprah bought the property, Williamson County Sheriff’s officials responded to a call from Barbara who said Vernon and an 'entourage of his friends' had shown up at her home. Barbara told the local media that Oprah was controlling her father. ‘He believes what he's told. His . daughter doesn't care about the community. His daughter doesn't care . about the barbershop. But I do,’ she said. WSMV said they had confirmed that Oprah, who is worth an estimated $2.7billion, paid $475,000 for the barber shop. In a statement to the TV station a spokesman for Oprah said: ‘Oprah purchased the property that was in foreclosure. ‘Vernon Winfrey has been a fixture in the community for decades and will continue to manage the business on a day-to-day basis.’ In a telephone call to the TV station . Vernon said: ‘My wife and I, we have not been getting along well, and I . did not want to endow myself to another drawn-out, struggling debt.’ Vernon, a former town council official, has run a barbershop in East Nashville for 50 years. He moved from the old premises in 2011 and the new salon had a boxing theme. At the opening of the new barber shop Vernon said the premises would be his legacy to the community. ‘When I'm gone, I'm glad I'll be able to say I left the neighborhood looking nice,’ Winfrey said. He said his daughter had urged him to give up cutting hair, but he planned to continue. ‘Some folks say, “Winfrey, you're kind of old to be doing it.” I say, “You're right, but I feel good,”’ he said. Vernon said his famous daughter wanted him to retire.","Barbara Winfrey has filed counter divorce claim .

Theresa May told police they were not being ‘picked on’ by the Government as she faced down furious rank-and-file officers yesterday. The Home Secretary was barracked and booed by Police Federation delegates as she defended cuts to police pay and pensions. Mrs May was told she had lost the trust of officers as she addressed the federation’s annual conference in Bournemouth. Scroll down for video . Theresa May was heckled by police officers as she tried to explain changes in their pay and conditions in front of a provocative stage banner . The Home Secretary was jeered throughout her speech to the Police Federation in Bournemouth today . She faced shouts of ‘disgrace’ and ‘resign’ from angry officers as she insisted cuts were necessary for the good of the country. Simon Payne, of Warwickshire Police Federation, told her: ‘Home Secretary, you may not like this, but we no longer trust you in the police service. Full stop. End of story.’ But Mrs May said that if outdated pay and pensions arrangements were not reformed, the only alternative was job cuts. She added: 'I know the Fed often say we’re singling out the police. But that simply isn’t true.' Tom Winsor, pictured, was asked by Mrs May to carry out the most wide-ranging review of police pay and conditions in more than 30 years . Pointing to cuts in prisons and probation and 7,000 redundancies in the Armed Forces, she said: . 'So let’s stop pretending the police are being picked on. Every part of the public sector is having to take its share of the pain.' She said that even after major reforms to pay and overtime, police in England and Wales would remain the best paid of all the emergency services. 'We have taken the difficult but necessary decision to face up to our debts, deal with our deficit, and get our spending under  control,' she said. Mrs May entered the hall to a standing protest with officers displaying posters declaring 'enough is enough'. She insisted the Government was right to reform policing. She said: 'I know that change can be difficult, unsettling, sometimes even painful. 'But it is my job to tell it like it is, not how we’d like it to be.' Police Federation chairman Paul McKeever told the conference that cuts to police funding were 'putting public safety at risk'. He accused the Government of treating policing as a 'low priority'. He claimed cuts in Home Office spending on police, which will total 20 per cent by 2015, had already cost 5,000 'frontline' jobs. 'You are on the precipice of destroying a police service that is admired and replicated throughout the world,' he added. Mrs May's speech was greeted with silence from the 1,200 officers at the conference who got their message across with banners . A huge cheer and applause erupted across the conference as one federation member, Dave Bennett, told Mrs May: 'Home Secretary, I believe you are a disgrace' Under fire: Home Secretary Theresa May was trying to put the criticism behind her when she attended the Asian Women of Achievement Awards at the London Hilton last night . He said cuts would inevitably lead to higher crime levels. But Mrs May pointed to forces where crime was falling despite officer numbers having fallen. Federation officers, already angry over a pay freeze, are livid at the prospect of radical changes to overtime, bonuses and working practices. They condemned the review of pay and conditions carried out by former rail regulator Tom Winsor. Police Federation members protested against spending cuts and wide-ranging changes to their pay and pensions in central London last week . Mrs May’s insistence that he was independent of Government drew laughter from the 1,200-strong audience. Around 30,000 off-duty officers marched through central London last week to demand that ministers change path.

It looks like a floating car seat - but Honda's robotic Uni-Cub unicycle lets ordinary people do what used to be the province of circus performers, and stay upright on just one wheel. You simply lean to 'drive', and to steer - and in a demonstration in Tokyo this week, volunteers piloted it with ease. When not in use, it can be folded up into a tiny carry case - although its top speed, 3.7mph, not far off walking speed, may mean it's not enormously popular with commuters. # . Honda unveiled the new device on Tuesday, which allows the rider to control its speed, up to 3.7mph per hour, and direction by shifting one's own weight . So far, there is no release date for the robot unicycle, which has a top speed of 3.7mph . The device was shown off by Honda this week - as yet, there are no plans for a release date. The device is meant to be nimble enough that it can be used indoors. As well as cars and motorcycles, Honda also has a long track record in robotics, with a humanoid robot, Asimo, that is a regular at its stage shows. Swaying your body from side to side is all you need to do to turn, rotate full circle and zip around on the Uni-Cub. The Uni-Cub has one main wheel, while a tiny wheel at the back helps for circular moves. Reporters got a test ride on the machine Tuesday. It takes some getting used to but responds smoothly and quietly. Lean forward to go straight, to the left to go left. If all fails to stop, just put your foot down. Uni-Cub will be on display at a Tokyo science museum. There are no plans yet for a commercial product. The single . wheel on the U3-X is made . up of many tiny motor-controlled wheels, packed inside the bigger . wheel, allowing the device to swerve in any direction. The U3-X weighs just under 22 pounds, runs . on a full charge for an hour, and has a lithium-ion battery. It is best suited to those over 5ft. Mamoru Mori, Executive Director of National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation (Miraikan) and former astronaut, rides Honda Motor Co's new UNI-CUB personal mobility device at the museum in Tokyo .

Two young girls were making new friends at nursery this week after spending months in hospital strapped to a life-saving artificial heart. Holly Keogh and Ellie Beale spent every hour of every day attached to the Berlin Heart at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital. Their world was restricted by the 8ft of tubes and wires connecting them to the miracle machine. The youngsters' own hearts had failed and Ellie and Holly spent five and six months respectively rigged up to the contraption. It kept them alive by pumping blood around their body, while they waited for suitable donor organs to be found. The three-year-olds showed incredible determination to survive, with the risk of infection, blood clots or a fall ever present. Their frightened parents spent up to 16 heart-wrenching hours a day by their side. Ellie's dad Simon said: 'We were living from moment to moment. The journey begins, but you don't know when it is going to end.' Holly's mum Lisa, who left her other two children with their dad Alan and grandparents at home in Dublin to be with her daughter. She told The Times: 'As a parent you try to give them a little bit of life, find ways to distracted her. 'You have to be strong, you have to be there for your children. It is only when you come home that you realise what you have been through.' Holly and Ellie, from the Reading area, arrived in cardiac intensive care in end-stage heart failure and were diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy - a condition which did irreversible damage to their hearts and was thought to have been caused by a virus. Bedbound: Holly Keogh, 3, spent months in hospital strapped to an artificial heart . If they were struck down a few years earlier, the girls may not have survived, but advances in cardiothroaic care means doctors are able to stablise patients while they search for a positive organ match. Holly and Ellie were up against a decline in donor numbers, with 167 adults and children on the waiting list compared to 124 a year ago and many parents reluctant to give up their child's organs after they die. The girls' parents allowed a TV crew to film them in hospital in the hope of encouraging more donors. The BBC Two documentary is on Tuesday at 9pm. Even with a donor match, Holly and Ellie would not have survived long enough for a transplant if it was not for the Berlin Heart, which is the size of a small fridge and named after the German city where it is made. The machine moves air in and out of a pumping chamber and pushes blood back into the heart and around the body. A cannula is needed to be inserted into the patient's heart during an operation lasting up to eight hours. Lisa said: 'It took Holly 12 days to realise she was no longer attached to a machine after her transplant. She stepped outside the room and said mam, I'm outside on my own, what do I do? Playful: Holly Keogh can look forward to making new friends thanks to doctors . 'Just keep walking, I said. And she walked so proudly down to the nurses' station with her head held high and said, look at me I have no Berlin Heart! I can walk on my own. 'We will always be extremely grateful to the staff who helped us through the hardest time of our lives, but we will also be extremely grateful to the family of the donor who made that decision to donate their child's organs.' But despite its life-saving potential, one in four children die waiting for a transplant. Ellie suffered multiple infections and needed four chambers replaced due to clotting, one of which went undetected and caused a stroke. Children on a Berlin Heart are given priority on the organ waiting list, with doctors able to transplant a heart up to three times the recipient's body weigh - meaning youngsters can benefit from an adult's heart. In January, three-month-old Daniela Soto in Dallas became the youngest person ever to be treated with a Berlin Heart. In December 2010, two-year-old Joe Skerratt was attached to a Berlin Heart at Great Ormond Street Hospital. He was kept alive by the artificial organ for 251 days - more than any other child in the UK - before under going a successful heart transplant last year.

For the ‘unsung heroes’ chosen to bear the Olympic flame on its journey around Britain, the torch they carry is meant to be a proud keepsake to show to future grandchildren. Yet hours after the relay began on Saturday, the souvenirs were already appearing on eBay. Some runners put their torch up for sale even before they had carried the flame, offering to post them to the highest bidder immediately after their leg of the event. Former England footballer David Beckham lights the Olympic torch as it arrives in Cornwall at the start of the mammoth relay . Others offered to include the white-and-gold torchbearer uniforms. Several runners asked for a minimum of £100,000. When contacted by the Mail, some said they planned to donate the proceeds to charity, but others admitted they were simply cashing in. The majority of the 8,000 torchbearers were selected after being nominated by friends and family for their work in the community. The 70-day relay started in Land’s End on Saturday and will finish on July 27 at the opening ceremony of the Games. It cost £495 to make each torch, but runners were offered the chance to buy them for just £215 while those who won their places through sponsors such as Coca-Cola were given them free. Yesterday, readers flooded Mail Online with their views. One wrote: ‘I am so incensed by this total lack of respect for anyone including us folk who were so proud to see you carrying it.’ Bids for the prized torches have reached in excess of £150,000 on eBay, although it is not clear if the auctions have been targeted by hoaxers . The Olympic torch has been greeted by crowds of people since the start of its tour of the UK . Another suggested that the torches should have been issued with a covenant that they could not be sold for at least ten years. Torchbearer Andrew Bell, 32, who ran his relay leg in Marazion, Cornwall, on Saturday, took down his eBay advertisement after receiving criticism. He said: ‘I understand some people may find the idea of selling an Olympic torch offensive but we could genuinely use the money. ‘Without giving you a sob story, we’ve a lovely baby boy and my wife has just gone back to work after maternity leave. Also, the torch is nearly a metre long, and looks weird on the mantelpiece.’ Community gardener Sarah Milner Simonds, 38, from Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, will run through Dunster today. Her torch has already attracted bids of up to £7,000. She said she would donate any proceeds towards her organisation, the People’s Plot, which helps community gardening projects. ‘I was wondering whether it was right to sell the torch and so I asked my dad, who is in his eighties. He said that one could create much more of a legacy using that funding than one could by using a bit of shiny bling that 8,000 other people have.’ Yesterday, more than a dozen torches were up for sale on eBay. One lot advertised ‘a souvenir to collect and treasure’. A spokesman for Olympic organisers Locog said: ‘The majority of people will want to keep their torch, but ultimately it’s their property and for them to decide what to do with it. We hope the torches and uniforms find good homes.’ Today, 100 days from the opening of the Paralympic Games, the remaining one million tickets go on sale. Organisers announced yesterday that Coldplay will headline the Paralympics closing ceremony. The relay has already seen its first disruption attempt, as pictured here when a man was tackled to the ground by police after trying to reach the torch .

The 23-year-old's live performance was widely slammed by viewers on Twitter, who ridiculed her singing ability and also her outfit choice. Scroll down to watch the video .

Some of the scathing remarks about the performance on Twitter included: 'Sorry but tulisa is talentless.' Another wrote: 'Tulisa was HORRIBLE on Britain's Got Talent. Never have I appreciated Cheryl Cole more!' Hundreds of tweets made cheeky reference to the star's recent sex tape scandal. Outfit change: Tulisa ripped off her dress mid-performance to reveal a cropped top and shorts . 'Oh Tulisa? Give her credit, it was better than her tape,' wrote one. Some of the less racy remarks included: 'Tulisa disappointed me, not once did she slap the mic on her face.' And: 'Good luck to Tulisa..she's had it hard recently and had a lot to swallow #BGT.' No problem walking in them: The singer was pictured returning to her trailer from the stage in her flats, and later leaving the studio in a mini dress and heels .

Exhausted: Suri Cruise looks tired by the news her . parents are set for a custody battle following their divorce . Little Suri, dressed in a pink dress and holding onto a cuddly toy, clung to her actress mother. She looked upset by the media circus as she buried her face into Katie's shoulder. And despite a brave face, the . Dawson's Creek beauty herself appeared to show the results of her split . from Tom, showcasing a slender figure in fitted jeans from the . bi-product of a break-up diet. Growing closer: The girls rarely leave each other's side, with Katie often seen carrying Suri . Super trim: Katie was seen carrying Suri as her daughter buried her head in her shoulder . Taking its toll: While Katie put on a brave face, Suri showed the strain . Yesterday, Katie - who filed for divorce from the Hollywood . star last week - spent American holiday Independence Day as a single . mother for the first time. The 33-year-old was seen at Wholefoods supermarket near her Chelsea apartment stocking up on food supplies. Making her way to the store, dressed . casually in a denim shirt and a floral summery skirt, the mother-of-one . looked feminine and pretty as she skipped along with Suri, who was in . the same multi-coloured poppy dress she was in the night before. Taking life into her hands: Katie stepped out braless and ringless in her efforts to rebel from controlling Tom . Protected: Katie was flanked by a burly security guard . Inside . the market, Suri rode in the front of the shopping cart playing with a . pale pink cowboy hat, with Katie photographing her wearing it. The mother and daughter duo were accompanied by one of Katie's bodyguards from her top heavy security team. During the outing Katie reassured fans that she is coping following the split from the Hollywood star. Brave face: Katie managed a smile as she and Suri left the museum following their day out . Rail-thin: Katie's halterneck top clearly showed off her bony back . Approached as she stocked up on food, Katie told a New York Daily News reporter: 'I'm alright. Thank you.' Meanwhile . it emerged today that Katie has been secretly planning her divorce . assault for several weeks with the help of her father Martin Holmes. The super secretive plan included switching all her cell phones and email addresses. Helping hand: Suri was guided along by her mother, who tenderly placed an arm on each of her daughter's shoulders . Tea time: Katie and Suri also had a meal at Alice's tea cup during their girly day out together . Katie was said to be contact with Tom, right up until last week, playing the role of doting wife. 'She was talking to Tom on the phone up until last week saying, ""I love you,""' a source told People magazine. But the escape plan was well underway when the actress recently visited China for work commitments. Moving on: Katie Holmes was seen at Wholefoods supermarket near her Chelsea apartment yesterday, stocking up on supplies . Sweet treat: The night before Katie took Suri out for some ice-cream . 'Her inner circle has been planning this and switching out cell phones since she was in China [in mid-June],' the source said. 'When . new cell phones arrived, then nobody could reach her. Her old best . friends from last week don't have her new number, no e-mail. She's . unreachable.' Katie even bent the truth to Tom about her new Chelsea apartment. Suri emerges: It was the first time that the youngster had emerged since Tom and Katie's split was announced . Hold on tight: Katie's top priority in the split is her six-year-old daughter . '[Tom] knew that she moved there, but [he thought it was] for different reasons,' the source told People. 'She . said she moved there to drive into the underground garage. There are . fewer paparazzi and it's less intrusive for her,' the source continued. 'It was the first phase of getting . everything out of the house, and that's why she was able to say she's . moving without giving an indication that she was going to divorce him.' Top heavy: Katie has enlisted burly bodyguards who are currently watching the actress 24/7 . Katie's father also fired some of his daughter's assistants and hired new ones in place to help out with the grand plan. In their new apartment building, neighbours say mother and daughter are a joy to have. 'Katie and Suri have been very . friendly to everyone they see in the building,' a source told Radaronline. 'But they mostly keep to themselves.' However the pair have been spotted using the communal children's playroom. Desperate: Tom is said to be going to a court in LA in person to ensure he is legally allowed to see Suri . 'Suri was there playing. Katie was with her and they were very sweet to the other people in the room. 'There were a few other kids there and . Suri quietly played with them. She seemed like a nice little girl and . the other kids looked like they were having fun with her.' Meanwhile, Tom, who has been kept busy shooting his latest movie Oblivion in Iceland, yesterday returned to Los Angeles where he marked his 50th birthday with a quiet lunch alongside adopted children Connor and Isabella. The way they were: Katie announced that she was splitting with her husband of six years last Friday . He is said to have made it his 'first priority' to get temporary visitation rights to his daughter Suri. The 50-year-old actor - who was 'blindsided' when his wife filed for divorce from him last week after five years of marriage and sought legal custody of their child - intends to go to court in Los Angeles in person to ensure he is legally allowed to see the youngster. Hints: In next month's ELLE magazine Katie hints that she may not have been happy in the relationship for some time . Katie filed for the divorce in New York because she believes she has a better chance of winning custody, and although Tom was encouraged to file in California, the law states divorce cannot be filed in separate states at the same time. A source said: 'Tom has told Dennis Wasser and Bert Fields, his long-time entertainment lawyer, that his first priority is getting a court order in place, obviously a temporary one, that will allow him to legally see his daughter. 'Team Cruise has extensive documentation to prove that Los Angeles is where the case should proceed, because this is where he says they have lived. 'Tom is extremely disappointed that Katie filed in New York, and he feels that she is trying to cut him out of their daughter's life. 'Tom won't tolerate it and told his lawyers that if he personally needs to go to court and make a plea in front of the judge for an order allowing him to see his daughter, he will.' It is believed Katie wants legal custody because she is worried about Tom's devotion to sci-fi cult Scientology and the effect the quasi-religious sect may have on their six-year-old daughter. However a source told TMZ: '[Katie] was totally committed to Scientology. She had enthusiasm for it and would voluntarily and gladly participate in it when Tom was off shooting movies. 'This is not a fight over religion. It's being used as a way to hurt Tom.' Meanwhile, an interview with Katie from next month's ELLE magazine hints that she may not have been happy in the relationship for some time. Discussing turning 33, she told the US publication: 'I definitely feel much more comfortable in my own skin. I feel sexier. I'm staring to come into my own. It's like a new phase.' Asked about her marriage, she admitted she wanted to focus on herself. She said: 'He has been Tom Cruise for 30 years. I know who I am and where I am and where I want to go, so I want to focus on that.'","Sources close to Tom say divorce was NOT over Scientology .

His body was taken straight to the coroner's office - and the insider claims no suicide note was found. 'I suspect he had been dead for quite a while when he was discovered,' the source told the website. 'Usually medics will be at the scene . for around 45 minutes but they were out of there within half an . hour. 'There were a number of prescription bottles found at the scene but it did not appear to be suicide and no note was found.' Pronounced dead at the scene: The coroner's van was spotted at Sage's home in Los Angeles along with news crews .

Double act: Sage appeared alongside his father in the 1990 movie Rocky V, playing the role of Rocky's son Robert Balboa . 'He was a very talented and wonderful young man. His loss will be felt forever.' Police said they found the younger . Stallone in the home while responding to a 'welfare check', however . Sage's lawyer George Braunstein said he was found by a housekeeper. Friends and acquaintances had become concerned because they hadn't heard from Sage in the past day. Braunstein said the death came as a shock, telling the New York Post this afternoon: 'He was in good spirits, and working . on all kinds of projects. 'He was planning on getting married. I am just devastated. He was an extremely wonderful, loving guy. This is a tragedy.' Before the heartbreak: Stallone was pictured yesterday with Arnold Schwarzenegger at the Comic Con film convention in San Diego .

'He was a full of life filmmaker with . his whole future ahead of him,' he said. 'He was just very up and . enthusiastic and positive. 'I think it was probably some sort of accident,' he said of the death. Braunstein added that Sage Stallone greatly admired his father but was working hard to make his own name in the film industry. 'He was very proud of his father and proud to be his father's son,' he said. Stallone's split from Sage's mother Czack in 1985 after 11 years together. They also have a another son .

Sage, who was raised by his mother following his parents' divorce, felt distant from his father growing up, a theme which hit home as they were filming Rocky V together. Big boots to fill: Sage said he always worried about living up to his father's success, seen here together again in Rocky V . ‘When I was screaming, “You never spent time with me! You never spent time with my mother!” - that was true,’ he told People magazine in 1996. ‘I was looking into my father's face and really saying that.’ But it proved a turning point for the father and son, who went on to form a close bond and they acted again together in the 1996 film Daylight. ‘Between takes, Sly and Sage would roll around in the dirt like two puppies,’ the director Rob Cohen observed at the time. Sage certainly felt the pressure of growing up with such a famous father and would worry that he would never match his success. ‘I tell him, “As long as you give it your best, that's all that matters,” his mother Sasha said in that same year. Sage went on to pursue a career behind the camera and shunned the wild Hollywood party scene, preferring to watch horror zombie films instead. ‘People call me a hermit,’ he said while promoting the film. ‘But I'm happy.’","Star 'devastated and grief-stricken' over sudden loss of his eldest child .

A Russian billionaire who bought a New York City penthouse for his daughter for $88million is being sued by his estranged wife over the purchase. The estranged wife of Dmitiri Rybolovlev claims the 6,700 square foot apartment was not bought for their daughter Ekaterina to live in while she attends school in New York as he had claimed. 'She does not attend school in New York,' Elena Rybolovleva said in papers filed today in Manhattan Supreme Court. Tycoon: Dmitry Rybolovlev, pictured watching a match at football club AS Monaco, of which is he president . Her lawyer David Newman adds that the . 22-year-old would live in slightly more modest accommodation if she did . attend school in the city. The suit contends that fertiliser . magnate Mr Rybolovlev, 45, - ranked the 100th richest man in the world by . Forbes - actually bought the pad in a failed bid to hide his assets from . his wife of 24 years. 'That apartment is large enough to house her whole undergraduate class if she goes to school here,' Mr Newman said. The lawyer claims Mr Rybolovlev bought the apartment through ‘a sham entity’ in order to keep his identity and actions secret. Marc Salis, a lawyer who represented . Rybolovlev on the purchase of the home, did not immediately respond to a . request for comment. High end: The penthouse apartment boasts great views of Central Park and its own gallery . The purchase of the penthouse from . former head of Citigroup Inc Sandford I.Weill and his wife Joan was the . highest price ever paid for a New York residence. The Wall Street Journal says the sale . generated nearly $2.5 million in city and state taxes and the brokers' commission alone came to about $3.5million. The previous record for real estate in Manhattan was $53million. The ten-room apartment boasts wrap around terraces and its own gallery. Elena Rybolovleva, also 45, said she . had begun divorce proceedings in Switzerland in 2008 after 21 years of . marriage, and that a Geneva court later imposed a freeze on some of her . husband's assets. Luxury: Ekaterina Rybolovleva is a resident of Monaco and is an avid equestrian . Dispute: Ekaterina Rybolovleva, 22, tends to keep out of the limelight, choosing instead to focus on equestrian pursuits . Despite this, she said her husband has . been using marital property to buy a multitude of other assets through a . variety of trusts and limited liability companies, hoping to put those . assets beyond her reach. Mrs Rybolovleva said these assets . include majority ownership in French soccer club AS Monaco, a $295 . million stake in Bank of Cyprus, and a $95 million Palm Beach, Florida . home purchased from another tycoon, Donald Trump. Mrs Rybolovleva is seeking a . constructive trust over the penthouse 'to ensure that assets are . available to satisfy any monetary judgment' she may be awarded in . Switzerland. She has filed a similar lawsuit in Florida over the Palm . Beach home. Mr Rybolovlev is one of the small . group of Russians who became fabulously wealthy during the post-Soviet . privatization of the economy and are known as oligarchs. He is the . former owner of fertilizer business Uralkali. Luxury: The 6,744 sq ft apartment boasts 10 rooms, a wrap-around terrace, library and seven walk-in closets . Nice garden: The apartment has an enviable view over Central Park . Architectural Digest ran a feature on the Manhattan pad. It describes the designers as . making the apartment ceilings and windows as high as they could. 'The sweep of space they configured made possible a Versailles-like enfilade of grand rooms with views,' it said. Sandy Weill and his wife Joan bought the apartment themselves for a then record $42.4million. Mr Weill said when it went on the market that the proceeds would be donated to charity. Miss Rybolovleva is following in the . footsteps of Petra Ecclestone, who earlier this year bought the spelling . mansion, which was listed at a selling price of $150million - America's . most expensive home.

The medals of an RAF pilot who downed 22 Nazi fighters during World War II are expected to fetch £50,000 when they are auctioned by his son. Group Captain Mike Stephens was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for carrying out one of the most incredible acts of bravery during the war when his plane was badly damaged and on fire. With injuries to both feet and much of his engine and half his cockpit shot away, he was preparing to leap from the burning wreckage. Group Captain Mike Stephens' war medal haul: (from left to right) Distinguished Service Order G.VI.R. service medal from 1942; Distinguished Flying Cross with second and third award bars from 1940;  1939-45 Star Battle of Britain medal; Star Air Crew Europe medal; Africa Star medal 1942-43; Defence and War medal 1939-45, Coronation 1953 medal; Malta 50th anniversary medal; Flying Boot club membership badge . But when the Luftwaffe pilot who had attacked him flew on ahead, he calmly climbed back inside his Hurricane fighter-bomber and shot the enemy Messerschmitt down. It was only then that he jumped to safety and by that stage he was on fire himself. He beat the flames out as he parachuted to the ground before landing just 300 yards from the German front line. He hobbled towards friendly lines in the Western Desert before being picked up by Polish troops. The action, in December 1941 over Acroma, Libya, was one of many acts of heroism carried out by the 'ace' who bagged an estimated 22 enemy craft during the war. The episode for which Grp Cpt Stephens received the DSO was identical to one carried out by legendary Wing Commander Eric Nicolson, who received the Victoria Cross for it. War hero: Captain Mike Stephens with his wife Violet on Investiture Day. His medals are being sold off by his son eight years after his death in 2004. The pilot's wife died in 2000. They were married for 58 years . War memorabilia: Captain Stephen's flying helmet complete with oxygen mask will also be sold off in the auction on June 27 and 28 . As well as the DSO, he won the Distinguished Flying Cross with two bars. The distinguished pilot died in 2004 aged 84, and now his medals and other mementos are set to go under the hammer. His log book, photographs and a flying helmet with oxygen mask are among the other items set to be sold off. They are expected to sell for £50,000 at the Dix Noonan Webb saleroom in London. Hero: The distinguished captain with his Spitfire plane. He downed 22 Nazi planes . Grp Cpt Stephens’ war record is among the finest in the RAF - and he ranks among the top dozen pilots for skills, but the speed with which he achieved them is astonishing. His career was also unique because he was admitted to three informal RAF ‘clubs’ for wartime pilots. They were the Caterpillar Club, for those who baled out with a parachute; the Goldfish Club, for those who baled out into water; and the Flying Boot Club, for those who came down in the desert and had to walk to friendly lines. David Erskine-Hill, of Dix Noonan Webb, said: 'The remarkable wartime career of Mike Stephens epitomises the sustained gallantry displayed by the young pilots of Fighter Command. 'It was a career encompassing several hundred combat sorties and the award of four decorations for gallantry - only 15 airmen received the combination of a Distinguished Service Order and Distinguished Flying Cross with 2 Bars in the 1939-45 War. 'A fighter ace three times over and, on account of having to take to his parachute on two occasions, once over water, he was also a member of the Caterpillar, Flying Boot and Goldfish Clubs. 'Most notable of his wartime combats was the occasion on which he was wounded when his Hurricane was set ablaze by an attacking Messerschmitt 109 over the Western Desert - as he was in the process of baling out his adversary overshot his crippled aircraft. 'So Stephens regained his cockpit and shot it down, before taking to his parachute in burning overalls, a remarkable act of gallantry witnessed by Polish troops on the ground. 'A little over a year earlier, at the height of the Battle of Britain, Flight Lieutenant Nicolson had been awarded the VC for an identical act of bravery, though on this occasion Stephens was rewarded with an immediate DSO. He was just 22 years of age.' Mementos: A selection of photographs of Mike Stephens' war exploits which are also being sold off later this month . War hero: Captain Mike Stephens, second left, in front of his Spitfire during the war . Shot down: Captain Mike's crashed Spitfire during the war. He was twice forced to bale out of his planes . Grp Cpt Stephens graduated from RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire, in 1939 and was posted to France where he was quickly in the thick of the action, shooting down enemy planes. Returning from his final sortie in France he had six inches shot off one of his propeller blades but landed the unsteady machine at the airfield. He was told that he couldn’t take off with the propeller damage and the plane would have to be destroyed. But the pilot had six inches taken off the other end of the propeller and made it back to Britain. Grp Cpt Stephens then went to Turkey and north Africa where he continued to shoot down enemy planes and survive close shaves himself. Decorated: Group Captain Mike Stephens with his two elder brothers Richard (left) and Jack (centre) in the Royal Air Force . In October 1942 he volunteered to go to Malta and remained lethal in the skies but came close to death. He wrote in his logbook: 'Squirting 109 good and proper, got him smoking when a Spit (Stead) pulled up in front of me, so had to stop. Shot the port wing off another at 7,000, then later was bounced by a 109 who damaged my engine. 'Flew on a little way and then had to bale out. Trouble with dinghy, picked up after 3 hours.

Wreckage: Captain Stephens inspects damage to his Spitfire plane following a sortie on December 1, 1941 . What he didn’t add was that the dingy operation was made difficult because he kept his left hand in the air throughout because he was wearing a watch his parents had bought him and didn’t want to break it. In May 1943 Stephens was awarded his third DFC and returned home and saw no further action. He retired from the RAF in 1960 and worked in the aero-engines division of Rolls-Royce in Paris. He retired with his late wife Violet to the south of France before they returned to live out their days in Britain. The auction takes place on June 27-28.

But when Nurse Bennett returned to work after the weekend, Hayley was lying with her head in an oxygen ‘headbox’ to help her breathe, and being fed through a tube. She told the court: ‘I haven’t got an explanation for Hayley’s sudden collapse, but I can tell you that in 17 years of working on Ward 11, I have seen babies having sudden and inexplicable cardiac arrests.’ Overlooked: Paula Stevenson told an inquest her one-year-old daughter was neglected at the hospital . The coroner heard from a succession of doctors and nurses who said Hayley’s rapid deterioration had come as a shock to them. Mrs Stevenson has told the inquest she begged nurses to move Hayley into intensive care, but was repeatedly assured this was unnecessary. At one point, she even tried ‘bribing’ a nurse with £100 to pay more attention to Hayley, who was born in Northern Ireland. Mrs Stevenson told coroner Aidan Cotter: ‘I could not believe that Hayley had just been left to deteriorate. All along the family had expressed their concerns about Hayley's breathing and had even asked if there was a problem with her lungs, yet nothing was done. ‘All she did was sleep. I missed my little girl so much and I felt as though I hadn't seen her eyes in so long, her big blue eyes.’ Hayley was born with a hole in her heart and was recovering from surgery when complications arose . Describing the awful moments as her daughter’s life ebbed away, she said: ‘I saw that Hayley was really gasping for breath. ‘Her eyes were panic-stricken and they started rolling back in her head. ‘Hayley looked awful, she was like a fish out of water. She was gasping and gasping for every breath.’ Paula Stevenson, seen here with a picture of her baby girl Hayley, says the staff at Birmingham Children's Hospital failed 'abominably' Mrs Stevenson said there were around 15 people in the room working to save her daughter. She said: ‘All the time I was stroking her head and telling her she was the best wee girl in the world. ‘They worked on her until their hands hurt. All I could see was the monitor flashing [cardiac] arrest. ‘All the time I kept squeezing her hand gently just to see if she would squeeze it back. Hayley never squeezed my hand back. It was cold and lifeless. ‘After 19 minutes everyone had stopped looking at Hayley and they were now all looking at me with pity in their eyes. ‘At 20 minutes [a doctor] confirmed my worst fears. He said, “Sorry mum, we've lost her.” ‘And all I could think about was that I was no longer a mummy because Hayley was my only child and she was dead. I was in shock and utterly devastated. ‘The treatment has led me to question how can the staff at Birmingham Children's Hospital fail Hayley so abominably?’ Mrs Stevenson and her husband Bobby Fullerton now live in Australia, and have another daughter, one-year-old Casey. The inquest was adjourned and is not expected to resume until September when expert medical witnesses are available.","One-year-old Hayley died after her lungs collapsed .

The press standards probe has already spent £3.2 million since it was set up in July last year. Figures released to Parliament suggest the final cost is likely to be around £5.6 million. 'A lot of money': Lord Leveson speaking last July during the early stages of the press standards inquiry, which is expected to cost taxpayers around £5.6million, latest figures have revealed . Questionmaster: Lead barrister Robert Jay (pictured) is in line to pocket £500,000, according to legal sources . Legal sources have suggested that the inquiry's lead barrister Robert Jay could pocket more than £500,000 for his work grilling politicians, journalists and celebrities. The soaring cost has led to fresh questions about David Cameron's decision to set up the inquiry in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. Philip Davies, a Tory member of the Commons culture, media and sport committee, said most members of the public could not understand the point of the inquiry. Mr Davies said: 'We are spending a lot of money feathering the nests of lawyers in order to find out what we already know and, potentially, to end up with a form of statutory regulation of the media that will be a disaster for free speech. 'Feathering the nests of lawyers': Tory MP Philip Davies (pictured) claims most members of the public don't understand the point of the inquiry . 'All we have learned is the blindingly obvious - that journalists and politicians have close working relationships. 'I don’t think people are lying awake . at night wondering what text messages Rebekah Brooks has sent the Prime . Minister. We need to get back to focusing on real people’s concerns, . such as jobs, bills, crime and immigration.' Details . of the costs were revealed to Parliament by Culture Secretary Jeremy . Hunt, who has himself given evidence to the inquiry. Mr . Hunt said: 'The cost of the Leveson Inquiry to the public purse to date . is about £3.2 million, which represents payments made. 'The . total cost for part one of the Leveson Inquiry from start-up in July . 2011 is currently projected to be about £5.6 million.' Part one of the inquiry is expected to report later this year on the future of the press. Lord Justice Leveson has himself . raised question marks over whether part two of the inquiry, due to look . at unlawful activity at the News of the World after court proceedings . have finished, should ever go ahead - partly on cost grounds. ‘That . inquiry will involve yet more enormous cost, both to the public purse . and the participants,’ he said. ‘It will trawl over material then more . years out of date and is likely to take longer than the present . inquiry.’ Under fire: David Cameron, who appeared at the inquiry last week, is facing fresh questions about why he set up the media probe . Fresh details: Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who was grilled about his dealings with the controversial BSkyB takeover, revealed the costs of the probe to parliament . If the second . phase of the inquiry is abandoned it would mean that the issue of phone . hacking at the News of the World, which sparked public outrage, will . never be fully examined. The Leveson Inquiry website's most recent entry, for expenditure to the end of January 2012, revealed spending of £536,100 on counsel to the inquiry, and £682,100 on the inquiry’s secretariat. That suggests lead counsel Robert Jay can expect to pocket a hefty six-figure sum once the inquiry is concluded. One legal source last night said Mr Jay would pocket more than £500,000, with his assisting barristers each taking £80,000. Costs for the hearing room, annexe and office accommodation had run to £121,200 by January. The Leveson Inquiry has dominated politics in recent days, with David Cameron, George Osborne, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband all giving evidence, along with former Prime Ministers Gordon Brown and Sir John Major. The inquiry will hold no public hearings next week. The next phase of the inquiry is expected to focus on evidence from political journalists.","Has already cost £3.2m since inception in July last year .

The head of the Syrian Olympic Committee has been refused a visa to travel to London for the Games, according to reports. There had been suggestions for months that General Mowaffak Joumaa would be barred from entering the UK because of his connection to the Syrian military. The BBC said the application has been refused because of his links to the regime of Syria’s President Bashar Assad. The troubled Middle East state has seen a recent spike in violence by the forces of President Assad’s regime.

The government refers to the rebels as terrorists. 'The terrorist groups in Daret Azzeh committed a brutal massacre against . the citizens, whom they had kidnapped earlier in the day,' SANA said. The report said at least 25 people were killed, but others were missing. The regime has been condemned by Britain for its crackdown on opponents. It is thought that Syrian athletes may receive visas because those of Olympic standard are not required to serve in the armed forces, but there is a question mark against General Joumaa and other officials. Condemned: Prime Minister David Cameron has previously said the killings taking place in Syria under President Bashar Assad's regime are 'brutal and sickening' An IOC spokesman said: 'At this stage we have not yet received any official approach on this issue and it would be premature to comment on any individual cases.' The uprising against President Bashar Assad's regime began in . March last year. Activists say more than . 14,000 people have been killed since it began.

Jailed: 'Lady' Jenny Glanister, 51, who took £338,000 from the care home where she worked and its residents . With a penchant for expensive jewellery and fur coats, Jenny Glanister liked to think of herself  as a member of the aristocracy. But the self-styled 'Lady Glanister' was behind bars yesterday after stealing more than £330,000 from the care homes where she worked to fund a luxury lifestyle of cruises, magnums of champagne and diamond jewellery. A court heard the 51-year-old accountant became hooked on a television shopping channel – splashing out £233,000 on 180 items of jewellery during a six-year spending spree. Many of the packages from the Rocks & Co channel, which included an £18,000 diamond brooch, were ordered under  the Lady Glanister name she had adopted. In reality, Glanister – the daughter of a respectable couple who ran their own furniture business for 60 years – was a crooked finance manager responsible for two care homes treating adults with learning difficulties. Between 2004 and 2010 she stole a total of £338,805 from the homes and residents' personal accounts. She was jailed on Tuesday for 32 months by a judge who said she was guilty of 'wholesale plundering' and a breach of trust. The court heard Glanister was trusted with the accounts of Oakfield Ltd, which runs two care homes in Northamptonshire. However, she used her role to  funnel cash from the homes  and residents into her own  bank account. When police searched her then home in the village of Whiston, Northamptonshire, they found 15 fur coats, racks of designer clothes, unopened bottles of champagne and a receipt for  a £3,400 cruise. They also discovered packets of jewellery which had been addressed to 'Lady Glanister'. The court heard Glanister was in charge of Oakfield’s accounts for its homes in the villages of Easton Maudit, near Wellingborough, and Yardley Hastings, near Northampton. More...

Prosecutor Kathryn Howarth told Northampton Crown Court that the fraud was uncovered when Glanister left the company in 2010. Her successor discovered 'serious and alarming anomalies' in the firm's accounts. Glanister, she said, had used the firm's accounts to pay her heating bills and petrol for her car, inflated her salary and paid herself for extra hours not worked, then forged spreadsheets to cover her tracks. It was found that £72,923 had been taken from the homes' petty cash, £227,000 in cheques cashed from the accounts  and £17,272 by claiming for  additional hours Glanister had not worked. More than £2,000 was charged to Oakfield for the cost of fuel for her home and £17,000 to the residents' personal accounts. Glanister also charged tights and spray tan to the residents' accounts. Families of some adults at the homes reported difficulties in obtaining money from their relatives’ accounts and complaints were made. Toby Long, defending, said Glanister stole the money because she felt 'undervalued'. Jenny Glanister's grand house in the village of Whiston, Northamptonshire . He added: 'The money was not needed and to some extent it was stealing for comfort or control in which she perhaps lacked the ability to control her life.'

'You were aware of precisely what you were doing and precisely what consequences there would be.' He said she was 'responsible for wholesale plundering involving a vast number of transactions'.

No cap: Labour Party leader Ed Miliband tried to win back support from voters by outlining plans to combat immigration within the EU . Ed Miliband refused to back a cap on immigration yesterday – despite admitting it was still ‘too high’. He outlined plans to combat immigration from within the European Union in an effort to win back support from voters who felt the Labour government abandoned them by supporting the huge influx of foreign workers. But his attempt to convince voters that his party has learned its lesson on immigration was undermined by his failure to tackle the greater scale of migration from outside the EU. The Labour leader offered no prescriptions for restricting the total net immigration, which is still running at 250,000 a year. The Tories have committed to reduce annual immigration from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands by the 2015 general election. So far, the numbers have remained stubbornly high, but ministers say measures they have introduced in recent months to reform student visas and restrict the number of family members who can move here will begin to push numbers down. But Mr Miliband refused to endorse that approach – despite evidence that the huge influx of immigrants in recent years has left health, education and social services stretched. He said: ‘I am not going to do what the Government does. I am not going to make a blanket promise about numbers. The answer to numbers is it depends who is coming in and what they are coming here to do. 'On low skill migration I think numbers are probably still too high. I’d like to do something about it. But most of that is from within the EU because we have tightened up the other routes.’ Mr Miliband proposed new measures to prevent Britons being ‘locked out’ of jobs by foreign workers, including forcing firms to declare if they employ high numbers of immigrants. Labour would ban employment agencies that only use foreign workers and job centres would have to be informed of firms employing more than one in four staff from overseas. Mr Miliband distanced himself from the rhetoric of his predecessor Gordon Brown, saying: ‘I am not going to promise “British jobs for British workers”.’ He also said worrying about immigration ‘does not make people bigots, not in any way’, a reference to Mr Brown’s rebuke, during the 2010 general election, of pensioner Gillian Duffy, who he dismissed as a ‘bigoted woman’ after she raised concerns with him about immigration. Changes: Mr Miliband proposed new measures to prevent Britons being 'locked out' of jobs by foreign workers, including forcing firms to declare if they employ high numbers of immigrants . In a reference to the last Labour government, Mr Miliband added: ‘We too easily assumed those who worried about immigration were stuck in the past, unrealistic about how things could be different, even prejudiced. ‘But Britain was experiencing the largest peacetime migration in recent history, and people’s concerns were genuine. To those who lost out, Labour was too quick to say “Like it or lump it”.’ Sir Andrew Green, of Migrationwatch, said: ‘What was missing from his speech was an appreciation of the scale immigration has reached. It’s running at 250,000 a year. That is going to add  millions to our population in 15 years.’ Immigration Minister Damian Green said: ‘Until Ed Miliband supports the Government’s measures to cut and control immigration, Labour will have no credibility. Under his leadership, Labour have opposed our aim to get annual net migration down to the tens of thousands, and they have opposed the cap on economic migration, our changes to student visas and our reforms to family visas.’ Lesson from the past: Gordon Brown speaks in 2010 to resident Gillian Duffy, who he dismissed as a 'bigoted woman' after she raised concerns about immigration .","Labour leader outlines plans to combat immigration from within the EU .

Furious: Local government minister Bob Neill (pictured) said the decision by some councils to give its councillors inflation-busting pay rises was 'completely unjustifiable' Hundreds of councillors awarded themselves inflation-busting rises in allowances last year. Figures show that a dozen town halls did so despite the pay freeze for many local government workers. One council increased allowances by 28 per cent – the first stage of an 85 per cent rise over three years. The hikes, which came even as local authorities made vocal protests about the impact of the Government’s budget cuts, have been condemned by local government minister Bob Neill as ‘completely unjustifiable’. There have been repeated complaints that allowances – which are paid automatically to all elected councillors and are not linked to the amount of work they do or meetings they attend – have been overly generous. They cost taxpayers more than £200million a year, with several town halls doubling their allowances over the past seven years. The latest national breakdown of increases has been published by the TaxPayers’ Alliance, which found 32 councils raised allowances between the financial year 2010/11, the Coalition’s first year in power, and 2011/12. Twelve raised them by more than 4 per cent – the level of inflation at the start of the last financial year as taken from the consumer price index. They included Boston borough council in Lincolnshire, which gave its 32 elected members a 28 per cent increase to push the basic allowance paid to a councillor with no special responsibilities from £2,378 a year to £3,052. A further increase to £3,727 followed this spring, and next year there will be another rise to £4,400. This will amount to an 85 per cent hike since 2010, pushing basic pay from £46 to £85 a week. Peter Bedford, leader of the council, argued that allowances for the authority ‘lagged far behind all others in Lincolnshire’. Inflation-buster: Boston borough council (above) in Lincolnshire gave its 32 elected members a 28 per cent increase . In Slough, allowances went up  by 19 per cent in the autumn of 2010 from £5,973 to £7,100. ‘It was the first time in seven years that the allowance was increased,’ a council spokesman said. ‘Our allowances were considerably lower than those in neighbouring boroughs.’ In fact, Slough is bordered on three sides by South Buckinghamshire district council, which pays its councillors a basic £4,100 a year. Of the 12 which raised allowances above inflation, five councils also increased council tax. The TPA pointed to major differences between the allowances in neighbouring authorities, and questioned why Manchester pays £16,000 while next door Trafford pays less than £6,500. Of large metropolitan authorities, Birmingham pays £16,267 – almost £10,000 more than Trafford. TPA chief executive Matthew Sinclair said: ‘With local authorities up and down the country having to rein in spending, councillors who have awarded themselves an increase in their allowances in defiance of government advice should hang their heads in shame. 'They cannot retain the moral authority to make tough decisions on spending.’ Mr Neill said: ‘Most councils have frozen or cut councillor allowances to do their bit. ‘However, a small minority have hiked them which is completely unjustifiable given rank-and-file workers in local government have faced a pay freeze. These councils should be held to account.’","Hikes come as local authorities complain about the impact of Government cuts .

Beijing was hit with the heaviest downpour seen in the city in 60 years on Saturday, with many roads submerged under waist-deep water for hours. The death toll had reached 37 by Sunday night according to the municipal government, after 25 people drowned, six were killed in cave-ins in houses, five were electrocuted and one was killed by lightening.

Swept away: A vehicle washed away by flooding in Fangshan district in Beijing can be glimpsed still partially submerged in the muddy rainwater . Bereft: A Beijing family try and salvage their belongings from their damaged home after a storm wreaked havoc in the city at the weekend . Scenes such as those witnessed in Beijing across the weekend are becoming an all too familiar sight in China this summer, with rainstorms and flooding wreaking havoc in cities including Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongquing and Shenzhen. Experts believe the floods are largely down to urbanisation, with vast networks of roads and the elimination of greenbelts reducing some cities' ability to cope with heavy rainfall. Wang Hao, from the China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research, said more than 80 per cent of Beijing's roads are covered in impermeable materials like concrete and asphalt - which prevent the infiltration of rain water. But an investigation led by Li Haiyan, a professor at the Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture, about half of the city's drainage networks are filled with sediments - with some layers as thick as ten to 15 per cent of the pipes' diameter. Urban flooding: China's flooding problems are not limited to Beijing - this picture shows waterlogged streets in Gaogiao township in Dongxing district in Neijiang, in southwest China's Sichuan province at the weekend . Submerged: This picture taken in Chongqing in southwest China over the weekend shows people wading along a flooded street . Sheng Minzhi, an engineer at the Hangzhou Planning Bureau, said the mass construction of tall buildings and underground parking lots in some Chinese cities had also slowed the rate at which rainwater is absorbed into the ground. Wang Yi, from Beijing's flood control and drought relief headquarters, said the drainage systems in the city's downtown area are for the most part build to withstand rainfall of between 36 and 45 millimetres per hour. Only a few places, such as Tiananmen Square, have a more robust system that can withstand 56 millimetres of rainfall per hour. Wang Zhansheng, an environmental and engineering professor at Tsinghua University, said the flooding would not be so severe if drainage systems were designed to handle more severe rainfalls, adding that the flooding could be avoided if regulations governing urban drainage took population growth, water usage and sewage treatment into consideration. Xu Chenghua, an engineer at the Hangzhou Urban Planning Academy, said storm drainage systems are supposed to be designed in accordance with the Urban Drainage Engineering Planning Regulations approved by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development in 2000. A central government group responsible for drafting regulations related to urban drainage engineering gathered on May 18 to discuss the problem of urban flooding. New regulations are expected to be launched next year, according to a source with the group. But experts have pointed out that the reconstruction of the drainage systems would be a very expensive and difficult undertaking. Since the lay-out and the functional structure of the cities are already in shape, renewing the drainage systems to bring them up to the level of developed countries would be hugely costly, according to Wang Hao at the China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research. Experts have urged the government to launch a uniform urban flooding drainage standard to guide the urban planning of Chinese cities, Xinhua said.","Death toll reaches 37 after city battered by heaviest downpour in 60 years .

A large portion of New York City is going to be sprayed with a pesticide in an effort to fight West Nile virus. The announcement that parts of the city's Upper West Side and Central Park will be sprayed comes as the summer heat has caused some of the highest instances of the disease in the past decade. It is the third time in the past ten years that portions of New York will be sprayed, with the process being contained between 1am and 6am Friday morning. Moving up north: While areas of Fort Worth, Texas (pictured) were sprayed with pesticides earlier in the summer, portions of Manhattan are scheduled to do the same as the mosquitoes continue to spread . West Nile virus cases are up 40 per cent . since last week and may rival the record years of 2002 and 2003, . federal health officials said Wednesday. So far this year, 1,590 cases of the mosquito-borne disease have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and 66 deaths. Spreading: So far this year, 1,590 cases of the mosquito-borne disease have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and 66 deaths . About half of the cases are serious illnesses, and the CDC considers those the best indicator of West Nile activity because many mild cases do not get reported and their symptoms may not even be recognized. Typical symptoms are fever, headache and body aches, and most people get better on their own in a few days. Less than 1 per cent develops neurological symptoms such as stiff necks and even coma and paralysis. Based on reports of West Nile so far this year, 'we think the numbers may come close' to those of 2002 and 2003, when nearly 3,000 severe illnesses and more than 260 deaths occurred each year, said the CDC's top expert on the disease, Dr. Lyle Petersen. Health officials think that West Nile activity will peak in mid-to-late August, but likely will continue through October. Because symptoms can take two weeks to appear, reporting cases lags behind when people became infected. The disease first appeared in the United States in 1999. Officials say this year's early spring and hot summer may have contributed to the current boom in cases. Mosquitoes get the virus from feeding on infected birds and then spread the virus to people they bite. All states except Alaska and Hawaii have found West Nile virus in people, birds or mosquitoes this year. Texas has been the hardest hit, accounting for half of the cases reported to the CDC so far. 'I'm not convinced that we have peaked. We may have plateaued,' said Dr. David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services. The CDC also says it does not expect Hurricane Isaac to have much of an impact on cases in Southern states. Heavy storms can wash out mosquito breeding grounds, although standing water can aid breeding, Petersen said. Many other factors, such as the population of infected birds, influence the severity of West Nile outbreaks, he said.","Parts of the city's Upper West Side and Central Park will be sprayed .

Kenneth Boxall reacted angrily when District Judge Ron Coia refused to let him appeal a Department of Works and Pensions decision to reduce a funeral grant from £742 to £691. The 58-year-old denied making the threat to shoot Judge Coia, but was found guilty at the end of a four-day trial at Teesside Crown Court last month. Kenneth Boxall, 58, from Peterlee, County Durham, has avoided a custodial sentence, after Teesside Crown Court heard he threatened to shoot Judge Ron Coia . He was given a suspended sentence and ordered to observe a curfew. Prosecutor Richard Bennett told the court: 'He contacted the tribunal service in Newcastle to discuss the case. 'During the call he told Erin Slater, a clerk, he would find out where Judge Coia lives and shoot him. 'His intention to do so was repeated later in the call. The threat was taken seriously, as it had to be, but it’s now accepted there was no intention to harm the judge.' Boxall, of Peterlee, County Durham, was convicted of making threats to kill on September 1, 2010. He has previous convictions for assault, fraud and related offences of dishonesty, and theft. Teesside Crown Court heard Boxall has previous convictions for assault, fraud and related offences of dishonesty, and theft . His last conviction was in 1986. Representing himself, Boxall said: 'The case has taken a long time to come to court partly because I had six solicitors and 10 barristers, although I was happy with a couple of them. 'I can’t agree with the remarks in the pre-sentence report about my inter-personal skills, but I suppose everyone is entitled to their opinion. 'I am a carer for members of my family.' Judge Peter Armstong sentenced Boxall to 12 months in prison suspended for two years, and a night-time curfew for eight weeks. The judge said: 'Making a threat against any public servant is a serious matter, but I accept this threat was made in temper and never likely to be carried out. 'The offence still passes the custody threshold, but I have concluded society will be better served by you remaining at home to carry out your caring duties.'

Peers seem to have forgotten Britain is suffering a deep double dip recession after splurging £175,000 on new artworks last year. Official House of Lords figures show that tens of thousands has been spent on sculptures, paintings and silverware during the spending spree. The £175,000 is almost ten times more than spent a year earlier because it includes a £108,000 blow out on fresh artwork for the peers' new offices in Millbank next to Parliament. Additions to the giant House of Lords art collection include a £7,500 portrait of suffragette Viscountess Rhondda, who fought for the rights of women to vote, by Alice Mary Burton. Splurge: A bust of Prince Philip, left, and a portrait of Lady Rhondda, right, have taken their places in the House of Lords giant art collection as part of a £175,000 spending spree . There was also £25,200 splashed out on a silver piece by British maker Brett Payne. Another £8,500 was laid out on a bust of Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, and a £5,000 painting of Queen Victoria's Jubilee procession by Robert Weir Allan. Peers get around £50,000 a year in grants from Government departments to add to the 8,000 pieces of Parliament art on display and in storage. But they can opt to save up the money over several years and go on a huge spending spree. The Lords has been able to build up artworks since the 17th century, and has bought up major pieces throughout the centuries to the present, with some art around 1,000 years old. 'The House of Lords works of art budget for purchases has been halved from £50,000 in 2010/11 to £25,000 in 2011/12. There will be no grant in 2012/13,' a House of Lords spokesman told MailOnline. 'In September 2011 the House of Lords opened a large new office block in Milbank House. A separate grant of £135,000 was provided to purchase works of art for the new building. 'This was a one-off expenditure which will not be repeated. Peers: The House of Lords and Parliament has a collection of at least 8,000 artworks worth millions . 'The House of Lords art collection is a public collection and much of it is on view to the public on tours of the Palace of Westminster. It can also be viewed online on the Parliament website.' But the spending pales in comparison to the Coalition's plans to reform the House of Lords, which will cost taxpayers nearly half a billion pounds, it has been claimed. Labour peer and economist Lord Lipsey put the estimated cost of running a fully-elected chamber over five years at £484million, enough to fund 15,000 nurses' salaries. It is £7million more than the previous estimates and more than five times the £91million cost of the existing House of Lords in the last five years, according to the peer.","£108,000 of taxpayers' money was spent on new artworks for offices close to Parliament .

The Army psychiatrist charged in the deadly Fort Hood shooting rampage told a judge on Thursday that he chooses to defy Army regulations by not shaving his beard because it follows his religious faith. It was Maj Nidal Hasan's first time speaking in court since showing up with a beard in violation of Army regulations in June, prompting several fines and questioning for his defiance. 'In the name of almighty Allah, I am a Muslim,' Hasan told Col. Gregory Gross in his response to the judge. 'I believe my religion requires me to wear a beard.' The beard: Maj Nidal Hasan is seen left, before the 2009 shooting that killed 13 at the Fort Hood, Texas base with him seen more recently, right, while refusing to shave on reasons of his religious faith . Hasan said his beard was not a show of disrespect to the court. The pretrial hearing was the first since a military appeals court stopped proceedings Aug. 15 to consider the dispute over Hasan's beard less than a week before his court-martial was to begin. Gross held Hasan in contempt of court and fined him $1,000 for a sixth time on Thursday, and again sent him to a nearby room to watch the rest of the proceedings on closed-circuit television. 'I am not trying to disrespect your authority as a judge,' Hasan said before his latest removal from the courtroom. 'When I stand before God, I am individually responsible for my actions,' he said, apparently referring to the beard. Hasan faces the death penalty if convicted in the November 2009 attack that killed 13 and wounded more than two dozen others on the Texas Army post. Gross, who has said he would order Hasan to be forcibly shaved before the trial if he did not get rid of the beard himself, said Thursday that he will order a forcible shaving next week. That will delay the case again because Hasan's attorneys can appeal before a decision is made on whether he'll be forcibly shaved, Gross said. Contempt of court: Hasan, seen after charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder, is held in contempt of court for his beard which could be forcibly shaved . Earlier this week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces ruled that Hasan's appeal was premature because Gross has not issued a definitive order for Hasan to be forcibly shaved. The court said that if Gross issues that order, he must address several issues, including whether the Religious Freedom Restoration Act applies in the court-martial. Some witnesses for prosecutors and defense attorneys may testify at another pretrial hearing at Fort Hood next week to address those issues. Hasan's attorneys have argued that forcing him to shave would violate his religious freedoms. They also have said Hasan wouldn't shave because he had a premonition that his death is imminent, and doesn't want to die beardless because he believes not having one is a sin. According to military regulations, soldiers who disobey orders to be clean-shaven can be forcibly shaved. Gross has said he wants Hasan in the courtroom during the court-martial to prevent a possible appeal over the beard if Hasan is convicted. Hasan is paralyzed from the waist down after being shot by police on the day of the rampage, but appears to have full use of his arms. Prosecutors have said they don't believe that religion is Hasan's motive, noting he was clean-shaven at the time of the shootings.","Maj Nidal Hasan fined six times for the beard that violates Army regulations .

Women working at the centre have developed the ritual of bending down for a kiss through the glass each time they pass his tank. Gary, a giant Gourami from Indonesia measuring nearly 28 inches long, never fails to return the gesture. Nigel Croasdale, manager of the centre, said: 'They don't seem able to go past Gary's tank without stopping for a quick smooch, and Gary seems to love it.'

The freshwater species is a popular food fish in India but many people keep them as pets. Their preference for eating vegetation has led to them being used to clear weed from rivers and lakes. They are also capable of breathing moist air, so can survive out of water for long periods. Giant Gourami are one of the most common species requiring rehousing from home aquariums. Displays supervisor Kieran Copeland added: 'They are often found in pet shops measuring just a few inches long, and people buy them without realising how big they grow, and how quickly.'

A banker once described as Ireland's public enemy number one has been charged over a failed insider trading scam. Former chairman of Anglo Irish Bank Sean Fitzpatrick was brought before the Criminal Courts in Dublin for alleged financial irregularities. He was earlier arrested at Dublin Airport as he arrived from the U.S. after arranging to meet officers. Scroll down for video . Former Anglo-Irish chief Sean Fitzpatrick has been charged in Ireland over a failed insider trading scam . The court heard the 64-year-old replied 'no comment' when charged with 16 offences by gardai attached to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in a city centre garda station. Each charge relates to advising on and lending millions to a golden circle of investors to falsely inflate Anglo's share prices. Bankrupt billionaire Sean Quinn's wife and children were among those involved in the ill-fated plot to save the sinking bank in July 2008. Anglo was nationalised months later, in . January 2009, and has since cost the Irish taxpayer about 30billion euro . (£23.4billion) - almost half the value of the country's bank bailout. The Anglo Irish Bank sign was removed from its premises on St Stephen's Green, Dublin, in April last year .

But now, following a disastrous period for the country's economy, the property is on the market for just €395,000 (£325,500). The 4,080 sq ft house had been purchased in 2006 by developers intent on building a 60-bed nursing home. At the end of March, data from the Central Statistics Office revealed that residential property prices fell by almost 18 per cent in the year to February. The property crash has resulted in more than 1,600 ghost estates across Ireland. Prime Minister Enda Kenny is currently implementing massive budget cuts to get the country back on track after it was forced to accept a £70bn bailout from the EU - signalling once and for all the end of the Celtic Tiger boom years.

A U.S. judge asked that the chief executives of Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd speak to each other at least once on the phone before a jury begins deliberating next week in the high-stakes patent trial between the two tech companies. 'It's time for peace,' U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh said on Wednesday in a San Jose, California, federal court, just miles from Apple's headquarters. Apple and Samsung are going toe-to-toe in a patents dispute mirroring a struggle for industry supremacy between the rivals that control more than half of worldwide smartphone sales. Despite the ongoing dispute, Kylie Minogue performed in Roberto Cavalli dresss last night at the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 launch event at One Mayfair . Apple accuses Samsung of copying the design and some features of its iPad and iPhone, and is asking for a sales ban in addition to monetary damages. South Korea's Samsung, which is trying to expand in the United States, says Apple infringed several patents, including some for its key wireless technology. However, Samsung ignored the dispute last night to launch a new tablet at a lavish showbiz party in London. The Note 10.1 was unveiled as Kylie performed five songs, and Olympic stars including Victoria Pendleton looked on. The U.S. trial is now in its third week. Before the jury was brought into the courtroom on Wednesday, Koh told attorneys for the companies that they had succeeded in raising awareness about the importance of their intellectual property rights. Top executives from both companies had participated in mediation with a U.S. magistrate judge several times. They remained far apart shortly before trial on how they viewed the value of each other's patents. Koh asked them to explore settlement once again. 'I see risks here for both sides,' Koh said. The lavish event was attended by a host of Olympic stars, including Victoria Pendleton and Laura Trott . Attorneys for both companies told Koh they would pass along the message. Samsung continued presenting witnesses on Wednesday, including an industrial designer from South Korea who described developing the Galaxy line of tablets. Speaking through a Korean interpreter, Jin Soo Kim said he began working on a tablet in October 2009, months before Apple launched the iPad in January 2010. Kim recounted the rationale behind different design choices for the Galaxy Tab 10.1. The screen, for instance, was set at 10.1 inches both to maximize its size and contain manufacturing costs. 'I really enjoy what I do as a designer,' Kim said. 'I am proud of what I do.' Asked by Samsung attorney John Quinn whether he copied the designs of any other company, Kim said: 'I have not.' Apple attorney Harold McElhinny showed Kim internal Samsung emails, referring to a meeting between Samsung and Google executives. At the meeting, Google told Samsung executives they should redesign its early tablet because it too closely resembled Apple's iPad, according to the February 2010 emails. Google created the Android operating system, which runs on the Samsung phones and tablets at issue in the lawsuit. Kim said he did not attend the Google meeting and was not briefed about it by his colleagues. The nine-member jury is scheduled to begin deliberations next week.","Despite ongoing dispute, Samsung launches new tablet with lavish party featuring Kylie Minogue and Team GB athletes .

Lindsay Lohan just can’t seem to keep her nose out of trouble – and now a newly leaked document reveals that the actress was recently banned from a hotel over a $46,350.04 unpaid bill. Lilo stayed in the upscale Chateau Marmont Hotel in West Hollywood during June and July of this year, all the while racking up heavy room service bills. The star, who was last night spotted leaving the Wolfgang Puck Restaurant in New York, ordered up room service meals, cigarettes and regularly used the mini bar during her stay but failed to pay the hotel for their services, forcing the manager to ban her from the premises. Sheer daring: Lindsay Lohan, who has been banned from Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, dined at Wolfgang Puck Restaurant in New York last night . Here comes trouble: The Mean Girls actress has been at the centre of plenty of drama this week . In a letter to Lindsay obtained by TMZ, hotel general manager Philip Pavel wrote to the troubled 26-year-old on July 31, reiterating their ‘repeated attempts to resolve’ the bill. Philip writes: ‘As you are aware from our previous correspondences starting on July 8, you currently owe the hotel a grand total of $46,350.04 in charges for your stay starting on May 30, 2012.’ The general manager of the hotel also informed Lindsay that she would no longer be welcome on their premises. Letter of intent: Lindsay Lohan has been banned from the Chateau Marmont after failing to pay a bill of $46,000 . Big spenders: Chateau Marmont is frequented by some famous Hollywood names as a place to hang out . The letter continues: ‘As we have made repeated attempts to resolve this pressing matter over the last few weeks without any resolution, I regret to inform you that we will no longer be able to extend any further credit for you to remain in the hotel. ‘Please have all of your belongings removed from Suite 33 by 12:00PM, Wednesday, August, 1, 2012.’ Not only was Lindsay told that she would have to leave her suite at the hotel, she was also told that she could no longer use the facilities or eat in the popular restaurant. The big bill: Lindsay failed to settle her debt with the hotel and was asked to remove her things from the suite . Money makes the world go round: Amongst the things Lindsay was charged for were garden services, mini bar and cigarettes . ‘Furthermore, until we get the matter . of your outstanding debt paid, know that we will be unable to host you . on property or in the restaurant.’ To perhaps coax Lindsay into paying . her colossal bill, manager Philip Pavel even dismissed charges for . rental use of a computer that Lindsay had been using. Paying the price: The hotel removed a $75 daily cost for rental of a laptop as a sign of good faith . Long haul: The Machete star ran up the huge bill after staying at the hotel from 31 to May to 1 August . During Lindsay’s 47-day stay at the Chateau Marmont some of the things she spent money on included: . ‘In regard to your bill, please note that I have adjusted off the daily $75 charge for computer rental for use of the hotel’s laptop as a gesture of good faith, with the understanding that you will return the computer upon your departure tomorrow.’ Lindsay was staying in the hotel while she filmed Liz & Dick – where she plays Elizabeth Taylor in the biopic of her life. In recent years the troubled star has become more famous for her court appearances than her acting work, with Lindsay reportedly hoping that her performance in Liz & Dick will help save her ailing reputation. No stranger to scandal, Lindsay was recently caught up in an alleged jewellery heist after being formally named as a suspect in a burglary – with reports now suggesting that she will not face prosecution after she claimed that she had been framed. Mail Online have contacted both the Chateau Marmont and Lindsay Lohan’s representatives for comment but have not heard back.

An oak tree has gone back to its roots - 200 years after it was taken to the other side of the world. As locals emigrated to Australia in the 19th century they took with them acorns from an oak tree in Holme-On-Spalding-Moor, East Yorkshire. When they settled, the seeds were planted in the families' own little corner of England. And now a sapling grown from an acorn from one of the trees nurtured in Australia has been planted back in the village where the 20,000-mile cross-generational round-trip began. What a family tree! The acorn taken from the tree in Australia (pictured) has returned home 200 years later as a sapling . Digging in: Aleck Brown, 6, and younger sister Katy, 3, plant the sapling in the same village where it was originally taken from . The journey was prompted after someone read a book about people from East Yorkshire moving to all corners of the earth. The tree's story begins in the 1820s . when the British Government offered land for settlers to populate . Western Australia fearing the French might try to land there. The call was answered by a tiny group of farmers from northern England including the Clarksons family from Yorkshire Holme House. In 1829 the Clarksons and 37 other passengers set sail from Hull on the ship The Tranby destined for a new life - accompanying a handful of acorns from a tree growing on the family farm. The seeds survived despite being crammed onto a tiny ship for an eight month journey and they even dodged a meteor strike that struck the ship, before eventually being planted by the settlers in their new home. Now 183 years later saplings from the trees those acorns became at the settler's new Australian home have come all the way back again - and they've been planted by the grandson and granddaughter of the family who now live in Holme House. At Holme-On-Spalding-Moor Primary school Aleck Brown, six, and his young sister three-year-old Katy had the honour of planting the extraordinary sapling. Putting down some roots: The amazing journey has come full-circle thanks to someone in Australia seeing a book written by Dr Robb Robinson about people from Hull moving all over the world . Dr Robb Robinson, whose book prompted the move, with the Australian sapling and the oak tree at Holme Hall in the paddock . Aleck and Katy's grandparents Michael and Pat Rhodes live at Holme House, the place where the original tree still stands where the acorns came from. The amazing journey has come full-circle thanks to someone in Australia seeing a book written by Dr Robb Robinson called Far Horizons - From Hull to the Ends of the Earth. Dr Robinson, from the University of Hull, said he wrote the book to chart the stories of people leaving Hull for other parts of the world and one of the stories was about the fabled acorns. He said: 'Around the 1820s the British government were worried the French might settle western Australia as we didn't have many people living there. 'They issued a call in all the national newspapers asking for settlers who would be willing to go there. 'It was a big risk, they had to take all their farming equipment and livestock and if had to arrive before January 1831 to guarantee them a plot of land. 'The Clarksons were just one of the family's who left from East Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire on an 87-foot-long ship, The Tranby. Tracing its roots: Aleck's grandparents, Michael and Pat Rhodes, who still live in Holme Hall, with what is believed to be the original oak behind them . Branching out: The tree, which has flourished in Australia, was grown when a family packed up and emigrated in the 1800s . 'It was an eight month journey to Australia with around 37 passengers and 14 crew along there was plenty to contend with on the way, in fact the ship was hit by a meteor en-route killing a sheep and breaking a dog's leg. 'When they arrived the settlers made a home for themselves on an area of land called the Perth Peninsula not far from modern-day Perth. 'In honour of the journey one family built a house named after the ship, Tranby House, which remains one of the oldest or the oldest building in western Australia.' Dr Robinson, who published his book telling the story of the Tranby and others in 2011, said he was amazed when a few months later he was contacted from Australia. He said: 'When I saw the two oak trees at Tranby House I realised they came from the acorns taken over with the settlers, I jokingly said ""could you send some acorns over?"" and they did. 'We planted the seeds in the botanical gardens at the university but then we thought how fitting it would be if they returned to the spot where they came from.'","Journey began when family from East Yorkshire set sail for the other side of the world .

Human beings are surprisingly bad at spotting deception - perhaps because we do so much of it - but one group are VERY good... liars themselves. In a speaking test, liars were able to spot other liars far more accurately than people who told the truth - which might explain why poker players are good at both. Oddly, the ability ISN'T related to IQ or emotional intelligence - the ability to lie is a separate thing. University College, London, researchers graded 51 volunteers simultaneously on their abilities to tell lies - and spot other liars. Graphing the results, it's clear that people who are good at TELLING lies can also spot them far more easily than 'normal' people. There are clear 'tells' that people are lying - such as the fact that they tend to take longer to start talking, which the research confirmed, but liars pick up on these more easily. 'It is not uncommon to hearof ‘poachers turned gamekeepers’, such as infamous confidence-trickster,Frank AbagnaleJr., who is now an FBI financial fraud consultant,' say the researchers. What is more mystifying is that the liars and non-liars are of similar intelligence level - ie it's not a simple difference in intellectual ability. The ability to deceive seems to be separate - although it's not clear whether people are born with it, or learn it. 'A significant relationship was found between the deception-related . abilities; those who could accurately detect a lie were able to produce . statements that others found difficult to classify as deceptive or . truthful,' say the researchers. 'Furthermore, neither ability was related to measures of . intelligence or emotional ability. We, therefore, suggest the existence . of an underlying deception-general ability that varies across . individuals.'

The number of police officers in England and Wales has fallen to its lowest level in nine years, figures showed today. Office numbers plummeted  to 134,101 - more than 5,000 fewer than the previous year and fewer than at any point since 2003, the Home Office data showed. The number of police staff was also down, dropping 8.8 per cent to 67,474 and police community support officers (PCSOs) fell 9 per cent to 14,393. PCSOs are not police officers; they are . civilian members of police staff. They are designed purely to tackle . local anti-social behaviour and local issues. But the number of special constables rose 10.4per cent to 20,343, the figures showed. Special Constabules are the UK's . part-time police force. They are made up of volunteer members of the . public who when on duty wear a uniform and have full police powers. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: 'The Tory-led Government has cut nearly 10,000 police officers from communities across the country. 'And we know that substantially more than half are from 999, neighbourhood and traffic response - the officers we rely on in an emergency. Yvette Cooper says the Conservative government is more interested in cutting police numbers than crime . 'These figures show the cuts to the police are deeper and faster even than experts predicted. 'David Cameron's promise to protect the front line has been ripped apart by these appalling figures. 'In just two years the Government has taken police numbers back by nearly a decade, weakened police powers, undermined morale and reduced crime prevention. 'Theresa May has no strategy to cut crime, only to cut police.' In the 12 months to 31 March 2012, the 43 police forces have recruited just 2,394 full-time equivalent officers. Only the Surrey police force has seen an increase in its number of officers over the 12 months to March, rising 4.7per cent from 1,885 to 1,974. This is because they are recruiting now as they underwent reductions in officer numbers between 2006 and 2009, several years before England and Wales as a whole. The biggest drop  in terms of percentage came in Derbyshire, where police officer numbers fell 10per cent from 2,021 at the end of March last year to 1,819 12 months later. Warwickshire, where officer numbers fell 8.2per cent from 919 to 844, and Cleveland, where officer numbers fell 7.6per cent from 1,655 to 1,529, also saw significant reductions. The largest numerical decrease was felt by the West Midlands, whose lost 323 officers (4 per cent). Policing and Criminal Justice Minister Nick Herbert said: 'These reductions in officer numbers are in line with HMIC (Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary) predictions as a result of necessary savings by forces who are playing their part in reducing the deficit. 'However, HMIC projections also showed that 94per cent of officers in the front line will remain, the proportion on the front line is increasing and service to the public is largely being maintained. Fading fast: Police graduates passing out at the Hendon police academy, London, as it was revealed the number of police officers has fallen to its lowest level in nine years . 'We inherited a situation where there . were some 25,000 officers not on the front line, so there was plenty of . scope for forces to make savings while improving performance, as forces . are showing as they continue to drive down crime.'

Picking out the heat against the blazing beams of a parent star is like picking out a single candle among 10,000 - but scientists have picked up infrared rays from a planet  40 light-years away. But human beings are unlikely to be moving to 55 Cancri e - at 2,000 degrees centigrade, the surface of the planet is hot enough to liquefy steel. Researchers at MIT and other institutions say the planet may lack reflective surfaces such as ice caps, instead absorbing most of the heat from its parent star — much as Earth’s dark oceans trap heat from the sun. Scientists on a planetary-heat-seeking mission have detected the first infrared light from a super-Earth ¿ in this case, a planet some 40 light-years away . From this data, scientists have now calculated 55 Cancri e¿s radius (twice that of Earth¿s) and the duration of its orbit (18 hours, versus our leisurely 365 days) Using telescopes on the ground and in space, scientists examine light patterns from a star to determine the traits of any planets around it. Periodic dips in starlight indicate that a planet has transited, or passed in front of, its star. From this data, scientists have now calculated 55 Cancri e’s radius (twice that of Earth’s) and the duration of its orbit (18 hours, versus our leisurely 365 days). While the stellar brilliance enables researchers to detect changes in starlight, it’s much trickier to detect light of any wavelength — visible or infrared — from the planet itself . ‘This planet is so close to the star that it’s very strongly irradiated,’ says co-author Brice-Olivier Demory, a postdoc in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. ‘It’s like in the movie ‘Avatar,’ where Pandora orbits the gas giant Polyphemus. Seeing Polyphemus from Pandora gives an idea of how big the star would look from 55 Cancri e.’ The group obtained observations from NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope, which monitors infrared radiation emitted by objects in the solar system and beyond. Demory and his colleagues trained the telescope on 55 Cancri, observing the star during a six-hour window during which the tiny exoplanet passed behind it — a phenomenon known as an occultation. Demory measured the starlight before and after the planet’s occultation, discovering a minute dip when the star completely eclipsed the planet. To make sure the dip wasn’t merely a fluke, the team obtained three more sets of data for the same orbital window, and analyzed all four datasets together. ‘When you stack all the data together, you see a beautiful dimming light that clearly shows the light from the planet that disappears,’ says co-author Michael Gillon, principal investigator of the Spitzer telescope program. ‘This is the first time that we see light from a planet that is that small.’ ¿It¿s like in the movie ¿Avatar,¿ where Pandora orbits the gas giant Polyphemus. Seeing Polyphemus from Pandora gives an idea of how big the star would look from 55 Cancri e' say the researchers . From the planet’s infrared light, the researchers precisely calculated its temperature — a scorching 2,360 degrees Kelvin, or 3,700° F. With such high temperatures, Demory posits that the planet is likely rather dark, having no reflective surfaces such as ice caps, and probably absorbs most of the heat given off by its star. The planet’s temperature may also give researchers a clue about its atmosphere. 55 Cancri e orbits its star much like the moon circles Earth, always presenting the same face. Demory suspects that much of 55 Cancri e’s heat remains on the ‘day side’ of the planet, and that it would be difficult to circulate such high temperatures to the planet’s dark side: In other words, it’s unlikely that the super-hot planet harbors any strong winds. Phil Armitage, an associate professor of astrophysics at the University of Colorado, says it’s extremely difficult for any instrument — including the Spitzer telescope — to make a direct detection of an exoplanet. He sees the group’s detection as ‘a great example of really pushing an instrument to its limits.’He adds that the planet’s infrared light will help identify more characteristics from this particular super-Earth. ;Super-Earths are fascinating objects because they don't have any analogs in the solar system,’ Armitage says. ‘We don't have a clear idea how they formed or even what they’re made of. It’s a mystery that requires data beyond the planet’s mass and radius to resolve.’","First time infrared light from planet this small has ever been detected .

Melanie had opted for a flirty printed white dress for the occasion, which she teamed with a black leather jacket. Jack, 26, dressed in an extremely tight white T-shirt and grey jeans. Given that the pair met on the social networking site it was fitting that Melanie Sykes chose Twitter to announce her engagement to a builder 16 years younger than her. The . 42-year-old former model yesterday revealed she will marry her toyboy . lover Jack Cockings following a four-month whirlwind romance. Sparkler!

Cockings, 26, grew up in Dorset and apparently owns his own roofing contracting company. He has a five-year-old son from a previous relationship. Miss Sykes is no stranger to brief affairs resulting in marriage proposals - she walked down the aisle with her previous husband actor Daniel Caltagirone - just three months after meeting. The couple were married for eight years up until their split in 2008. A close friend said Miss Sykes’s sons got on ‘extremely well’ with Cockings, saying: ‘For Mel, the children are key in everything, they come first and foremost. Especially with Valentino, whom Mel is so protective over. Passionate: TV presenter Melanie Sykes and boyfriend Jack Cockings are engaged after a four month romance .

On the back page he attached the engagement ring with a ribbon, with the words ‘will you marry me?’. He told friends that Miss Sykes ‘cried continuously while looking through the album’. The roofer revealed the details to work mates during a job in Didcot, Oxfordshire. A friend revealed that Cockings had said of the proposal : ‘I don’t believe in grand gestures, I just wanted it to be just me and her, nice and intimate.’ ‘When you know you’ve found the one, you just know. Melanie is my best friend. It’s like hanging around with your mates.’ Bride-to-be: Melanie is seen out and about in London today as she geared up to make the happy announcement . Mr Cockings first contacted Miss Sykes with flirty messages on the micro-blogging site in April. He had previously sent messages to Cheryl Cole and former glamour model Jodie Marsh begging them to date go out with him - but they did not respond. Miss Sykes finally agreed to an actual date with him in May and the pair quickly hit the headlines with their public and graphic flirtation. In one of the racy posts she tweeted that she had ‘the giddiest knickers of my life’ and told him: ‘I’ve got the raging horn, please take me’. Fit: Melanie insists the 15 years age gap doesn't bother her . In another, the star wrote: ‘Jack the rabbit I need some bunny love so hop to it!! Xxx boing boing!!! Loooooool xxxxxxx’. She was condemned by many for playing out her private life in public. But she defended herself in a recent interview with the Daily Mail: ‘I don’t even consider the people who follow me on Twitter as fans. They’re friends, my community. It was just giddiness, banter; silly fun. ‘Nothing rude was actually happening, we were in different counties at the time. And I didn’t mean to offend anyone because I’m not an offensive girl. I’m nice! If I did upset anyone, I’m really sorry. I just got a bit carried away.’ She also insisted the 15 year age gap did not bother her. Miss Sykes explained: ‘Some older men find my independence threatening. Younger men don’t. It’s a generational thing. ‘It’s quite a big ask for a man to be with someone as insanely independent as me, and younger men have the confidence.’ ‘My ex-husband was two years younger than me. ‘I’ve always gone out with younger men. They’re more fun and love to have a laugh.’ In the 1990s, she also dated Bros star Matt Goss and actor Max Beesley.

After only a few hours in the Celebrity Big Brother House, Rhian Sugden opened up about her well documented friendship with married TV presenter Vernon Kay. The glamour model confided in Jasmine Lennard about her friendship with the star and explained how her life had been ruined by him and their text messaging. She said: 'We spoke as friends. We were just friends – but we spoke too much. I never sent a sex text. I never sold a story.' Confession time: Rhian Sugden confided in Jasmine Lennard about her alleged affair with Vernon Kaye . Talk of the town: Vernon Kay, pictured last month with wife Tess Daly, reportedly sent sex texts to Rhian . The two girls debated whether it is okay to text a married man and Jasmine declared: 'It was your fault at the point you knew he was attracted to you. 'People are not going to feel sorry for you. They will feel sorry for her.' The 25-year-old discussed how tough her life became in the aftermath of the phone scandal and how she couldn't even go out without being attacked. It's good to talk: Jasmine Lennard asked the glamour model several questions about the incident and Rhian answered them all . Innocent party: Rhian claimed that she never sent a single sex text to Vernon but was blamed for the whole thing . Are you watching Celebrity Big Brother? Rhian told Jasmine that she had been spat at and bottled in nightclubs even though she had done nothing wrong. Kay, who has been married to TV sweetheart Tess Daly since 2003, has two daughters Pheobe Elizabeth, 7, and three-year-old Amber Isabella. After the pair's 'friendship'  was exposed Kay issued a grovelling apology saying: 'I've been an idiot and I've let my family down.' In last night's show Rhian explained: 'We were from the same area and I was in with his family and I knew his brother, but he admitted in the paper that he got drunk and sent sex texts to five girls. 'I've been proper screwed over. He admitted that he sent the text messages and yet I'm the one that has been labelled a sex texter.' Thirsty work: The glamour model said she had been attacked in nightclubs and bottled since the incident . Shock horror: Rhian spoke to Danica about her earlier conversation and admitted she was surprised by the questioning . When asked if their relationship was sexual and if she fancied him, she said: 'He's a good looking guy but it was never like that at all. 'I read somewhere that Samantha wrote an article saying she didn't trust men because of me.' Jasmine was stunned at the revelation and said: 'You have been very diplomatic because if someone had written that about me it would have been on.' Watch out: The two girls discussed how dangerous Jasmine is and Rhian said she would be sacred to cross her . Bad girl: Jasmine has made quite an impression on the other housemates already with her honest and straight opinions . Later in the evening, however, Rhian spoke to Danica Thrall about her reservations of Jasmine following their conversation in the garden. 'She asked me a lot of questions earlier about Vernon. I wouldn't mess with her. 'I think what you see is what you get with Jasmine.' In the line of fire: Jasmine said she would have said something to Samantha Brick if she had written about her .","Page 3 model confessed she had been spat at and bottled at nightclubs after 'friendship' exposed .

World leaders at the G20 summit have focused their attention on Europe, as efforts continue to resolve the financial crisis branded 'the single biggest risk for the world economy'. David Cameron was among those pushing for 'core' eurozone states like Germany to take decisive steps towards the fiscal and banking union which will help the euro function properly. The Prime Minister's calls came after the financial crisis sweeping Europe was described as 'the single biggest risk for the world economy'. David Cameron was among the world leaders at the G20 summit pushing for 'core' Euro states like Germany to find fiscal and banking union to help stabilise the eurozone . However, the President of the European Commission attacked critics of the of the eurozone's crisis management, declaring that the crisis originated in the U.S. After facing fresh calls for Europe to find a resolution, Jose Manuel Barroso claimed 'the crisis originated in North America' with the collapse of real-estate-linked financial products. At the G20 summit in Mexico today, David Cameron and other world leaders called on political parties in Greece to get on and form a coalition government, following Sunday’s elections, warning any delay could be ‘very dangerous’. Spain, meanwhile, is likely to pay record prices to borrow at debt auctions today and on Thursday, after the Greek election failed to ease concerns about the future of the euro zone . The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds hit a fresh high of above seven per cent yesterday, as initial relief over the victory of pro-bailout parties in Greece gave way to ongoing fears of deeper problems facing the bloc. Seven percent is considered too pricey for a country to afford over the long term. Such levels have previously led to bailouts in Greece, Ireland and Portugal. United front: G20 leaders, including Barack Obama on the front row and David Cameron and Angerla Merkel in the central row, have had their discussions dominated by the euro crisis . Jose Angel Gurria, secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation Development, branded the euro crisis 'the single biggest risk to the world economy' Among the 17-country group that uses the euro, there still appears to be little concrete agreement over how best to solve the problems of too much government debt holding back the region's recovery. A narrow victory for the New Democracy party in elections over the weekend in Greece means that the country is more likely to stick to the harsh austerity terms of its 240bn euro ($300bn) bailout package and avoid a chaotic exit from the euro in the very near future - an event many fear would destabilize Europe and send shockwaves through the world. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso defended the eurozone, insisting 'the challenges are not only European, they are global' Spain, the euro zone's fourth-largest economy and more than twice the size of bailed-out euro zone partners Greece, Portugal and Ireland combined, is at the centre of market jitters as it struggles with a deep recession and banking sector restructure. Despite the financial instability, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso defended the eurozone, insisting 'the challenges are not only European, they are global'. He also took what was seen as a subtle dig at China and other non-democratic countries at the summit in Mexico. 'Not all the members of the G20 are democracies but we are democracies and we take decisions democratically. 'Sometimes this means taking more time,' he said. 'Frankly we are not coming here to . receive lessons in terms of democracy or in terms of how to handle the . economy, because the European Union has a model that we may be very . proud of.' He was speaking . as the IMF announced a further $456bn (£290bn) for its euro crisis war . chest - on top of the $430bn (£274bn) announced in April. Tackling the euro crisis has so far dominated the G20's talks in Los Cabos. Despite . the victory of a pro-euro party in Greece's elections at the weekend, . there has not yet been an announcement on the formation of a government . in Athens. Jose Angel . Gurria, the head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and . Development (OECD), had earlier said the crisis was 'the single biggest . risk for the world economy'. Prime . Minister David Cameron urged Greece's centre-right New Democracy party . to move 'decisively and swiftly' to form a new administration, warning . that 'delay could be deadly'. But . he acknowledged that the crisis in the eurozone could rumble on 'for . some time' and made clear that he is looking elsewhere in the world for . trading partners to replace lost demand from the UK's traditional export . markets in Europe.","But President of European Commission says crisis originated in U.S.

Once they ranked among Britain’s  golden celebrity couples – but now relations have sunk so low between Sven-Goran Eriksson and Nancy Dell’Olio that the former England manager has resorted to legal action  to evict her from his London flat. On Tuesday, lawyers for Mr Eriksson and Miss Dell’Olio will battle it out in front of a judge for control of the £2.7 million property in Eaton Place, Belgravia, where neighbours include Lady Thatcher and Joan Collins. If Mr Eriksson succeeds in his bid for a possession order, Miss Dell’Olio could be forced to leave the two-bedroom flat within 28 days or face the prospect of being forcibly removed by bailiffs. Italian lawyer Miss Dell’Olio remained in the stucco-fronted building when she and Mr Eriksson broke up in 2007, claiming that they had a verbal agreement that she could live there indefinitely. But the 64-year-old Swede claims he agreed to let her live rent-free for only a year as a gesture of goodwill while she found a new home. Sources close to Miss Dell’Olio say she would be prepared to leave only after a financial settlement. A friend of Miss Dell’Olio said: ‘He told Nancy he would always take care of her financially. Their relationship went on for nearly a decade. ‘Nancy feels she is only fighting for what she was promised.’ Last October, a man thought to be acting for Mr Eriksson’s lawyers visited Miss Dell’Olio with papers believed to be related to his attempts to force her to move out. Since then, it is understood the  couple have tried to resolve the issue but reached a stalemate leading to this week’s court case. It is thought that Mr Eriksson wants to sell the property while he pursues football management opportunities abroad. Mr Eriksson bought the flat, which is on the road used as the setting for TV drama Upstairs Downstairs, for just under £1 million in 2005. Now its fate is at the centre of the final chapter in the chequered history between the couple, who met in 1998. Their . nine-year relationship survived the Swede’s infidelities – with TV star . Ulrika Jonsson and Faria Alam, a secretary at the FA. They finally . broke up five years ago. Happier times: Sven Goran Eriksson and Miss Dell'Olio's relationship lasted nine years and survived two highly publicised infidelities by the former England manager . Miss Dell’Olio, 50, has since gone on to enjoy relationships with theatre director Sir Trevor Nunn and former Marks & Spencer boss Sir Stuart Rose. Last year she appeared on Strictly Come Dancing. Neither Miss Dell’Olio nor Mr Eriksson is expected to attend the court hearing in Hammersmith, West  London, which is set to last just  15 minutes. A source close to Mr Eriksson said: ‘This has been rumbling on for so long now that I think more than anything he just wants it resolved.’","Miss Dell'Olio claims she had a verbal agreement with Mr Ericksson that she could stay on there indefinitely .

Lady of leisure: Emily Maynard grabbed lunch with a friend in Charlotte, North Carolina today . The blonde bombshell was spotted going for lunch in an eye-catching purple maxi dress. She carried a cream bag and donned huge sunglasses as she entered an eatery in the location where the eighth season of the reality show is being filmed. The day before she was seen stopping at Charlotte Skins & Laser to get a facial treatment in between running errands. BFF time: She donned a purple maxi dress to the eatery as she enjoys her time before The Bachelorette season finale on Sunday . This time donning a light tie-dye style floor-length dress and tying her long hair back. Perhaps she was freshening up her face in preparation for her relocation to Los Angeles with her five-year-old daughter Josephine Riddick 'Ricki' Hendrick. She has been excitedly talking about her initial plans when she arrives in California. Star style: Emily fashioned some large sunglasses and a cream bag . But while it might be a good idea to have some business meetings booked in, Emily is more concerned with beauty appointments to keep her looking like a star.

Al Qaeda terrorists do not want to destroy Western civilisation - and in fact aim to defend themselves, a provocative study has argued . Al Qaeda terrorists do not want to destroy Western civilisation - and in fact aim to defend themselves, a provocative study has argued. The study is certain to cause anger among relatives of victims of extremist groups, which often unleash violent and unprovoked attacks. The academics claim, however, that the goals of such groups are broadly 'defensive'. The study, which analysed 2,000 propaganda texts from Al Qaeda and other Islamist groups says that the group's goals are 'defensive'. The researchers looked at quotes from the Qur'an, and found that the extremists focused on maintaining faith and hope in the face of attacks. The researchers claim that simply altering the Western view of Islamic extremists as would-be 'conquerors' could help to halt the global conflict. Notorious verses from the Qur'an were quoted in Al Qaeda materials far less than the researchers expected. The so-called ‘Verse of the Sword’ (9:5) that says ‘fight and slay the pagans wherever you find them’ was . used only three times. How this fits in with the violent attacks unleashed by Al Qaeda and affiliated groups is unclear. The researchers catalogued more than 1,500 quotes from the Qur'an that extremists used to support their arguments, and identified the chapter (surah) and verse represented in the quote. ‘We were surprised at the very limited use of the sword verse,’ said Bennett Furlow, a research assistant and one of three co-authors of the study, ‘How Islamist Extremists Quote the Qur'an.’ ‘Conventional wisdom says Islamists are bent on world domination and this verse is the justification. We found it to be insignificant,’ he said. ‘These findings challenge the idea of a clash of civilizations,’ said the study's lead author Jeff Halverson, a professor of communication in ASU's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. ‘What extremists are really saying to Muslims is, 'our communities are under siege and God will defend us if we have faith and courage. If we try to portray them as evil conquerors when their audience sees them as protectors and champions, it damages our credibility and makes our communication less effective,’ he said. Other studies have shown in fact that al Qaeda-linked militants are 38 times more likely to kill a Muslim than a member of another group – hardly the activity of a ‘competent champion,’ the ASU study states.","Controversial study claims Qur'an quotes 'prove' Al Qaeda are 'defenders'

Production staff in an English TV crew were dismayed when they lost the chance to work at the World Snooker Championships for the BBC. But their disappoint turned to anger, when they realised their jobs were still available, but had been replaced under a quota scheme which favoured  employing staff from Scotland. As a result, Scottish production crews were relocated to England and put up in a hotel - while the previous crews who had built up a specialist knowledge working on the programme were sidelined simply because they were English. Out of a job: Scottish production crews relocated to England were put up in a hotel - while the previouse English staff who had built up a specialist knowledge working on the programme were sidelined . About a dozen people are thought to be have been replaced by workers from Scotland, for the two-week tournament in Sheffield, which ended last night with victory for Ronnie O’Sullivan over Ali Carter. IMG is the company that produces the snooker championships for the BBC. One freelancer, who used to earn up to £6,000 a week, working on the two-week tournament voiced his annoyance. 'The absurd thing is that this an an event taking place in England. If happened the other way round - Scottish workers in Scotland losing their jobs to the English- you would never get Alex Salmond off the airwaves,' he told The Times. Quota: The BBC trust set a target of moving 50 per cent of programing outside London in 2008- this is why programmes such as BBC Breakfast moved from Television Centre, pictured, to Salford . He said local students used to get paid for doing the lower level roles such as making tea and other runner jobs, but 'this year they have moved people from Scotland and 'paying for expensive hotel rooms.' Another worker, was told he could not be employed because 'I did not have a Scottish address.' Under rules enforced by Ofcom, public service providers, such as the BBC, comply with a quota for the number of workers they employ from outside London. This is to ensure regions such as Scotland, Wales and Ireland get a fair and equal proportion of the possible jobs and funding for TV programmes. In 2008, the BBC trust set a target of moving 50 per cent of programing outside London -  this is why programmes such as BBC Breakfast moved from Television Centre, in London to a new building in Salford. They announced the plan would see more money spent in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland at the 'national hubs' in Glasgow, Cardiff and Belfast. Under the plan spending in Scotland, rose from 3.3% to around 9% of total BBC network programming investment. Although BBC Vision director, Jana Bennett, stressed at the time: ""Growth in the nations will not come at the expense of the English regions, which we expect to account for one third of network production by 2016.' A BBC spokesperson said IMG gained the snooker contract partly because it had a commitment to recruiting from Scotland and said it seemed in 'the spirit of our commitment to move production out of London.","Scottish staff relocated to England and put up in 'expensive hotels'

Mr Cameron said he had deserved a ‘second chance’. Strathclyde Police, which sent . officers 400 miles to detain Mr Coulson at his South London home . yesterday, said a report would be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal . which will decide whether Mr Coulson is to face court proceedings. Perjury carries a maximum life . sentence in Scotland although a spokesman for the justice department . yesterday said three years was a more typical tariff. Mr Coulson, already on police bail . after being arrested last July over phone hacking and police bribery . allegations, was taken into custody following a 6.30am raid. Yesterday he was . driven to a police station in Govan, Glasgow, for questioning and then charged.

Mr Coulson was called to give evidence at Sheridan’s trial because he was editor of the News of the World between 2003 and 2007. It is understood that officers in . Strathclyde Police liaised closely with Scotland Yard, which is . investigating Mr Coulson over the phone hacking and corruption claims, . before detaining him yesterday. Embarrassment: David Cameron and Andy Coulson at an award ceremony in 2009 - The dramatic development is acutely embarrassing for the Prime Minister whose decision to bring him into Downing Street has already raised serious questions about his judgement . In a bizarre twist, a smiling Mrs . Sheridan drove past Govan police office after Mr Coulson arrived there . and waved to photographers. Speaking outside his home, Sheridan, who maintains his innocence, . said: 'We were led to believe by Mr Coulson and his acolytes at News . International during my trial and the initial phone-hacking . investigations that the problem was a rogue reporter. It’s the . equivalent of a bad apple in the barrel. 'Well, I think we all know now that there is no bad apple in the barrel, what there is is a rotten orchard full of bad apples. 'Fortunately, given the hard work of Operation Rubicon, we now have a start to what will hopefully become criminal charges.' 'I firmly believe that today marks the first in the journey towards the quashing of my conviction, which was unsafe and unsound.' Sheridan’s solicitor, Gordon Dangerfield, added: 'We have very strong grounds of appeal and will be lodging a full appeal in due course. 'We believe that when the whole truth comes out, the public will be given an entirely new perspective on what the Tommy Sheridan trial was really about. It is safe to say that many people will have their eyes opened for the first time.' Controversial: Tommy Sheridan and Gail Sheridan shown leaving the Glasgow court in 2010. Sheridan was eventually jailed but his wife was acquitted . Calling for an urgent review of the . Sheridan conviction, MP Tom Watson said: 'Tommy Sheridan was convicted . on an 8-6 verdict of a jury in a Scottish court. 'Mr Sheridan lost his liberty and is still the subject of restrictions on his movement. 'If they knew what the police now know, it seems impossible not to conclude that Mr Sheridan would be a free man. 'His conviction should be urgently reviewed.' Lawyer . Aamer Anwar, who was Sheridan's solicitor during the trial, said: 'In . July last year I handed over a dossier to Strathclyde Police that . contained allegations of criminality in relation to mobile phone hacking . and perjury at the High Court. 'At the time I said that nobody was above the law and we expected a rigorous and robust investigation. 'Under . the circumstances, everyone is entitled to the presumption of innocence . and it would be inappropriate to comment on Mr Coulson's detention . today.' Speaking about Coulson's detention, a spokesman for Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said: 'These are matters properly for the Crown Office and the prosecution authorities.' The spokesman recalled that Mr Salmond had spoken about the Strathclyde Police investigation into phone hacking in Holyrood earlier this month. The First Minister told MSPs then: 'At present we have a live police inquiry in Scotland which has up to 40 officers working on it. 'That is a huge commitment of resources by Strathclyde Police. 'I know that because of the inaction in the past of the Metropolitan Police, people are sceptical about police inquiries into these matters, but there is no reason to be sceptical about the inquiry by Strathclyde Police. 'It is a live inquiry, huge resources are being devoted to it and the expectation is that the force will pursue the evidence without fear or favour and produce effective results.' Mr Salmond also stated: 'At all times the rule of law will be upheld in Scotland.' In a statement today, his solicitor Jo Rickards of law firm DLA Piper said: 'Andy Coulson will vigorously contest the perjury allegations made against him yesterday by Strathclyde Police, should they ever result in a trial. We have no further comment at this stage.'

A property tycoon has pledged to leave his £100m fortune to the elderly of Jersey after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. David Kirch used his 76th birthday to announce he had would dedicate his wealth to those that are ‘often left out and forgotten.’ He said Jersey had been ‘very good to him’ since he arrived almost 40 years ago and that his illness had ‘sharpened my mind’. Generous: Mr Kirch, who made his fortune in property in London, hopes his wealth will benefit an estimated 9,000 Jersey islanders . For the last six years Mr Kirch - who has no living family - has given away £100 shopping vouchers as a Christmas gift to every islander older than 70. Now he hopes the fortune will help an estimated 9,000 Jersey islanders. He said: ‘I love the island, and so have decided to leave my wealth to benefit the elderly as they are often left out and forgotten. ‘Also, I have recently discovered that I have cancer and I have been amazed at how this has sharpened my mind and changed my perspectives on life. ‘I have worked very hard all my life to earn this money and I want to see it used well.’ Mr Kirch has also put his 600 piece strong collection of airship memorabilia on the market to add to his legacy. It includes scorched letters found on board the ill-fated Hindenburg, silverware and newspaper billboards from the First World War and is expected to raise £1m. Mr Kirch - who has never married - made his fortune in the London property market and through investments in the leisure industry and healthcare. In 2006 it was claimed he had made £2m in two months from dealing in the shares of UK Coal. Mr Kirch was 70 when he began his scheme to give the septuagenarians and older of Jersey a £100 voucher to spend in the Co-Op at Christmas. At the time he said: ‘I couldn’t think of a better way to celebrate than to start giving my money away. Wealthy benefactor: Mr Kirch said Jersey has been 'very good to him' - he plans to leave his multi-million pound fortune to the island's elderly (file photo) ‘I have had 70 years to build it up and now was the time to give it away.’ But he has admitted that he had to change his attitude to wealth before giving it away. He said previously: ‘I have mixed feelings, all my life I have wanted to make money and build it up. ‘I find it difficult, the difference between giving money away and being charitable and building it up to make as much as possible.’ Mr Kirch admitted his wealth had ‘dwindled somewhat’ since it was valued at £250m before the recent financial crisis. But he added: ‘It still makes a sizeable gift to the community and it is what I want to do.’ When Mr Kirch dies his fortune will go to the David Kirch Charitable Trust which already runs the winter voucher scheme. The Trust has already built the Margaret and Leonard Terraces named after Mr Kirch’s parents and is building a further 20 bungalows in the Grouville area of Jersey.","David Kirch will leave his millions to those that are 'often left out and forgotten'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:18 EST, 22 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:36 EST, 23 May 2012 . Police, neighbors and friends struggled to unravel the mysterious deaths of a Nebraska woman and her 10-year-old son that began with them appearing to go on an excursion and ended with their bodies found deep in the woods of an Iowa state park. Charlotte Schilling, 41, of Plattsmouth, Nebraska, and her son, Owen, had been missing since May 10, when the mother checked the boy out of his elementary school. It was not unusual for the stay-at-home mother-of-three to surprise her children with short road trips to parks, zoos and other nearby attractions, relatives said. But the Schilling always called home and the excursions never lasted long. Her family grew worried when neither she nor Owen returned home, and her cellphone went unanswered. Gone: Charlotte Schilling, 41, checked her son Owen, 10, out of his elementary school on May 10 to go camping and had not been heard from since . Charlotte's daughter, Lindsay Schilling, 20, said that is when she became concerned. 'I called until her phone died - every minute,' she told KETV.com. 'The fact that she didn't pick up mine - that's when it hit me: there's something wrong right now.' 'None of this makes sense,' said Polly Best, who lives next door to the Schillings. 'It's just tragic. There was never a hint of anything wrong there.' Best stood outside the family's home on Tuesday holding a roast she had cooked for relatives gathered inside. Yellow police tape blocked the Schillings' driveway and front steps from reporters trying to talk to family members and neighbors wanting to offer condolences. Surveillance video from a convenience store in the area where the woman and boy's bodies were found Sunday showed Owen hugging his mom and Schilling kissing her son on the head. KETV in Omaha aired the store video footage. 'I just can't believe it,' Best said. 'That did not look to me like a woman who would hurt her child.' But that appears to be what investigators believe may have happened. Mystery: Police have not ruled out the possibility of a murder-suicide in the deaths of Charlotte Schilling, left, and her son Owen, right . Police in Council Bluffs, Iowa, said on Tuesday they 'do not suspect any outside foul play' in the deaths of Schilling and her son. Their bodies were found on Sunday evening in Lake Manawa State Park, south of Council Bluffs in western Iowa, about 20 miles north of Plattsmouth. Authorities investigating the deaths added they are not looking for an 'outside' killer or at-large suspect. Asked whether that means police believe Mrs Schilling killed her son and then herself, Police Sgt. Dave Dawson replied: 'I can't say at this point.' Dawson told the Omaha World-Herald that police are convinced 'a murderer is not on the loose,' adding that the mother and son were not victims of an attacker. Investigators stopped short of labeling the case a murder-suicide, saying they must wait for further autopsy results before determining the cause of death. Council Bluffs Sgt. Dave Dawson said he expected to announce the cause of death by the end of the week. Investigators are leaning toward the belief that the bodies had been in the spot where they were found since May 10, the day that Schilling checked Owen out of Wade Robin Elementary School in Bellevue, Nebraska, and they went missing. Happy: Carl schilling, left, with his wife Charlotte Schilling, centre, and their son Owen, right, in a family photo posted on Facebook in 2010 . The day after they disappeared, police found Schilling's vehicle at the same park where the pair would eventually be found dead. Schilling's cellphone and wallet were in her car. Nine days after the discovery of the vehicle, a passer-by found the woman and boy's bodies in thick woods about a half-mile from where the car had been parked. Authorities had to rely on autopsy results to confirm the identities because the bodies had decomposed. 'I just about went to my knees,' said the family's neighbor, Naomi Raposo, 50, describing her reaction to news of the deaths. She just found out Tuesday, not realizing that earlier reports of bodies being found were about Schilling and her son. 'They've been very peaceful neighbors. They're very friendly,' Raposo said. The night before the woman and boy went missing, another neighbor, Athena Meneses, said she spoke to Schilling at a local Cub Scout meeting, where Meneses had taken her own son and Owen. Owen had wanted to join the group, Meneses said. 'I didn't really know her very well, but she seemed upset. She had a bump on her head,"" Meneses said of Schilling. ""She didn't seem like she was really happy that night. She said she wasn't feeling well and that she'd like to go home. She told me that she had fallen down earlier that day.' Sunday night a passerby saw two decomposed bodies found at Lake Manawa State Park . After an autopsy officials confirmed on Tuesday that they were the mother and son . The night before she disappeared Charlotte told a neighbor she didn't feel well and had fallen and bumped her head. But her husband said nothing was out of the ordinary . Meneses and her family moved to Plattsmouth about two years ago, just blocks from the Schillings. She said Owen was a playmate to her four oldest children, ages 6 to 14. 'We had a trampoline, and he would come over almost every day to play on that,' she said. Owen was closest to her eight-year-old son, Christian. 'I think my son said it best: He was energy-filled, and a very happy little boy,' Meneses said. School officials said students were having difficulty coping with the fifth-grader's death. Tuesday was the last day of school before summer break. 'There's a lot of sadness and a lot of confusion,' said Bellevue Public Schools Superintendent Frank Harwood. Cody Johnson, a clerk at the Lake Manawa convenience store where surveillance video captured Schilling and her son shortly after she checked him out of school, was one of the last people to see them alive. Schilling bought a pack of cigarettes for herself, and apple juice and snacks for Owen. 'The kid came in all hyper, like a normal kid would be, and went around looking at stuff,' Johnson said. 'Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. They were just like any other mom and son. There was nothing that showed me anything bad was going to happen.' Investigators have been treating the case as if the boy had been kidnapped, but they had said they didn't believe he was in danger.","Investigators are not looking for an outside killer or at-large suspect .

Accused: Frank Saucier allegedly enticed children into his postal truck to 'play house' A postman has been accused of sexually assaulting children in his delivery truck after enticing them into his vehicle to ‘play house’. Former US Postal Service (USPS) worker Frank Saucier, 44, was arrested on April 26 in Manchester, New Hampshire after children told their parents he had invited them inside his truck, police said. The postman allegedly assaulted several children while on his postal route on the west side of Manchester. In the games, Mr Saucier would allegedly play the ‘dad’ and sometimes pretend to be driving the parked vehicle according to The Manchester Union-Leader. Mr Saucier was originally arrested for allegedly smacking a 10-year-old boy inside his truck and as investigations continued, more charges involving other children, aged seven to ten-years-old, came to light. Originally charged with assault, police investigators have now accused the man from Tyngsborough, Massachusetts of several charges including six counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault, one felony charge of indecent exposure and one charge of sexual assault. On his postal route: Mr Saucier allegedly assaulted several children while working . Yet to be convicted: Mr Saucier, who was working in Manchester, New Hampshire when the alleged incidents occurred, is expected to front court again in August . The USPS released a statement in response to the allegations on the day of Mr Saucier’s arrest. It reads: ‘This isolated incident is not representative of the honesty and integrity of postal employees serving our nation today. ‘The Postal Inspection Service will continue to enforce the laws that protect and prevent the American people from criminal acts. ‘Even with today’s arrest, the individual charged is entitled to a presumption of innocence until he or she has been convicted in a court of law.’ Mr Saucier fronted Hillsborough County Grand Jury last Friday to hear the charges and an arraignment date expected to be set sometime in August.","Frank Saucier, 44, was arrested after allegations he had smacked a 10-year-old in his postal truck .

A senior NHS manger has received . almost £1 million in compensation for racial discrimination and unfair . dismissal after he was subjected to a 'breathtaking and callous' campaign of bullying . and harassment from colleagues. Elliot Browne, one of only a few . black senior managers in the NHS, was awarded a settlement of ££933,000 . by an industrial tribunal - one of the highest payouts awarded for . racial discrimination at work. A union official described Mr Browne's abuse as 'breathtaking and callous' and said he had never in his career seen such 'systematic intimidation and bullying of a single individual'. 'Breathtaking and callous': The Central Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust was urged to tackle a 'culture of institutionalised racism'. However the trust said it strongly believed that discrimination did not feature in Mr Browne's case . Mr Browne's 34-year career it the NHS . came to an end when he lost his job as a trust director in 2008 for the . Central Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust. An employment tribunal in Manchester . ruled the 55-year-old was subjected to 'discriminatory treatment from . 2007 onwards', when he was repeatedly singled out and accused of . departmental overspending while other white directors escaped reprimand . for the same thing. The tribunal also heard that Mr . Browne claimed he has been harassed and verbally bullied because he was . black and was the only black director in the trust. The judge was told he was subjected to consistent abuse over a period of more than a year. Singled out: The hearing heard how the claimant (not pictured) became depressed, took time off work and needed psychiatric help . Mr Browne, an Afro-Caribbean grandfather-of-one, . had left school at the age of 16 and had worked his way up the NHS . career ladder from a junior lab technician to top managerial roles. The hearing was told how he was . accused of allowing his clinical services division to consistently . overspend, even though the tribunal ruled they were only relatively . small amounts compared to the total budget size. He . alleged that he was discriminated against over his department’s . overspending because he was black and that white directors had not been . reprimanded over their overspends. Mr Browne, who earned a management . degree while working for the NHS, was threatened with disciplinary . action and then dismissed from his £80,000-a-year job. The full hearing of the case, which . was held last year, heard how Mr Browne became depressed, took time off . work and needed psychiatric help. The judge was also told he was so unwell that he was unable to enjoy the birth of his oldest child's baby. Unite, Mr Browne’s union, called for the trust ‘to tackle its culture of institutionalised racism’. The tribunal awarded Mr Browne, whose health was ‘severely affected’ by his treatment in the workplace, a total of £933,115 for unfair dismissal, aggravated damages, and loss of earnings and pension. He had already received £71,415 from the trust. Speaking through his union Mr Browne - a former director at the trust -  said: 'It is scandalous that this kind of behaviour and culture should exist in an organisation whose prime purpose is to care for others.' 'The systematic intimidation and bullying of a single individual was breathtaking and callous' A spokesman for the union added that Mr Browne did not wish to say any more on the matter. But Unite’s head of health Rachael . Maskell said: ‘Unfortunately, the case of Elliot Browne is not unique . within the NHS. Discrimination and harassment in the health service is . all too common from our experience as a trade union and needs to be . rooted out. 'NHS employers need to establish . comprehensive and effective training programmes and human resources’ functions so that there will be no repetition of this case. Dignity at . work needs to be a reality.' Unite . regional officer Keith Hutson said: ‘This is a well deserved outcome . for Elliot Browne. It reflects the pain, suffering and grief that he was . put through by his employer, Central Manchester University Hospital NHS . Foundation Trust. 'Hopefully this will act as a catalyst for his former employer to face up to their obligations in tackling the culture of institutionalised racism that they seem happy to endorse and that is underpinned by a cavalier attitude in their management style. 'The expenditure of almost a million pounds of taxpayers’ money could have been avoided, if this employer had just followed its own policies and procedures from the outset, instead of believing that NHS funds are there to defend the indefensible, rather than deliver patient care. 'The systematic intimidation and bullying of a single individual, the like I have never seen in my career as a union regional officer, was breathtaking and callous.' A spokesman for the trust said: 'As an organisation we take issues of any discrimination seriously. We strongly believe that discrimination did not feature in this individual’s case.'","Black director singled out for departmental overspending while white managers escaped reprimand .

Payoff: Former Barclays Bank chief operating officer Jerry del Missier has received a cash payoff worth almost £9million . A Barclays boss who resigned in disgrace over the interest rate rigging scandal has been handed a cash payoff worth almost £9million, it emerged last night. Jerry del Missier will receive the £8.75million windfall despite ordering traders to manipulate crucial interest rates used to set mortgages and trillions of pounds in complex investments. Barclays was fined £290million by US and UK regulators over the scandal last month, leading to the resignation of chief executive Bob Diamond and chairman Marcus Agius. News of the windfall emerged on the day that Alison Carnwath – chairman of the bank’s remuneration committee which sets bonuses – also quit for ‘personal reasons’. It is not known whether her resignation was in protest against the award for Mr del Missier, which is set to spark another row about the bonus culture in the City. Deborah Hargreaves, chairman of the High Pay Commission, said: ‘This is staggering. Why on earth should this man get a multi-million pound payoff for resigning in disgrace? This is further proof that the whole system of bonuses needs to be urgently reformed.’ It is thought that the Canadian banker’s award represents just over half of a potential £17million long-term incentive award made to him several years ago and which matured in March. The payoff could spark further anger over the bonus culture in the City . Jerry del Missier, Bob Diamond's former right-hand man, giving evidence to the Treasury Select Committee at the House of Commons last week . Insiders say Mr Diamond’s former right-hand man and chief operating officer was persuaded to delay receiving the bonus because of escalating public anger over pay. The windfall is thought to have been settled on to secure Mr del Missier’s signature on his severance package. It comes despite promises from Barclays, and led by Alison Carnwath as the executive in charge of pay at the bank, to claw back bonuses from Mr Diamond and fellow directors. Bob Diamond, former Chief Executive of Barclays, walked away with a £2million package . Mr Diamond forfeited bonuses worth up to £20million amid a growing public outcry but still walked away with a £2million package. But Mr del Missier’s decision to pocket the cash will mean he will join his former colleague as a lightning rod for criticism over rewards for failure. Earlier this month he was identified as the Barclays executive who instructed junior colleagues to rig benchmark Libor rates, used to set mortgages, during the financial crisis. In an appearance before the Treasury Select Committee of MPs last week he claimed he was instructed to do so by Mr Diamond following a phone call between his former boss and Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England. Tom Powdrill from shareholder lobby group Pirc, said: ‘This is enough to make you sick. Barclays must make it clear immediately if there was any discretion involved in this settlement, and if so they should make clear which directors approved it. ‘In any case this decision is likely to incense shareholders, particularly if any of the payoff includes rewards relating to the period in which the bank was involved in Libor manipulation.’ Barclays refused to comment. But the bank is understood to have felt it could not legally claw back the cash payout to Mr del Missier, given he was entitled to receive it in the spring. It is unclear whether he will be able to keep separate share options thought to be worth tens of millions of pounds.","Jerry del Missier receives payment despite resigning over ordering traders to manipulate interest rates .

He's gone from standing in the dock of a central London court to lounging on the deck of a luxury yacht and even with the threat of an FA charge against him - nothing can take the wind out of footballer John Terry's sails. The 31-year-old Chelsea captain was spotted relaxing on the boat with his wife Toni and her parents in an effort to put his recent troubles behind him. A thrilled Terry was cleared of a racially aggravated public order offence against Anton Ferdinand at Westminster Magistrate's Court last Friday and in true footballer fashion decided to head for the nearest available sunshine to help him wash the criminal charges right out of his hair. Leaving his troubles behind: John Terry relaxes on a yacht in the south of Portugal following his court case last week . Wearing a pair of pink swimming shorts and a red T-Shirt, Terry looked completely at ease as he kept himself busy on the yacht. His wife kept him company wearing a white bandeau bikini and sunglasses as they relaxed in the sunshine. Tonie's mother was also seen sporting a white bikini as the group soaked up the heat and worked on their tans. Not alone: The footballer was joined by his wife Toni and her parents . Don't forget your suncream! Terry appeared to be a little burnt as he relaxed in the sun wearing pink swimming shorts . They were later spotted enjoying drinks in the shade on the yacht which was named Aaliyah. It was a million miles away from Terry's gruelling schedule last week which saw him arriving at court by 9.45, standing in a dock and listening to legal counsel for hours. The multimillionaire defender was prosecuted over an ugly clash that lasted less than 35 seconds during a game last October watched by more than two million fans on television. He was accused of hurling a volley of racist abuse at Ferdinand, whose brother is Terry’s England team-mate Rio, after being taunted over his affair with a team-mate’s girlfriend. This is the life! Terry and his family relaxed on the yacht which was called Aaliyah . Lucky group! Toni and her parents enjoyed some drinks aboard the yacht . He admitted calling him a ‘f****** black c***’ and a ‘f****** k***head’ as they squared up on the pitch. But the 31-year-old claimed he was simply repeating the words after being falsely accused of saying them. As the pair traded insults, he claims to have heard Ferdinand say: ‘Calling me a black c***?’, and to have replied: ‘A black c***? You f****** k***head.’ Perfect getaway: Terry has escaped to Portiamo following the court case which found him not guilty . The players met in the Chelsea changing room after the match and shook hands, writing it all off as ‘handbags’ and on-pitch ‘banter’. Even when he was shown footage of the incident on YouTube, Ferdinand did nothing. But an off-duty police officer watching on TV, who claimed to be able to lip read, complained to the Met that a racially-aggravated offence had taken place. Friends: Ashley Cole (R) backed Terry in court and is now enjoying a holiday in Los Angeles . However, the England captain marched out . of court in silence on Friday after a judge said it was impossible to . prove he was guilty. Meanwhile, as Terry enjoyed his summer holiday, his team mate Ashley Cole - who backed him in court - is enjoying another getaway in Los Angeles. According to The Sun, the Chelsea player is said to have been partying with Drake and spent £13,000 on champagne at a Hollywood club one night.","But troubles may not be over as footballer could still face FA charge, despite being cleared by the courts of abusing Anton Ferdinand ."

Tulisa has slammed former X Factor consultant Chris Herbert's apology over his part in her sex tape leak, saying his apology does not make up for the trauma the leak caused her. Today Chris Herbert issued a grovelling apology to the star - and then pinned the blame solely on her ex. The trusted executive lost his job after the X Factor judge accused him of being the middleman in her scandal, claiming that he played 'a pivotal role in commercial exploitation of the film'. Herbert, who is currently facing legal proceeding over his part in the leak, said he was sorry and even alleges he advised Tulisa ex Justin Edwards not to try and cash in on the video. Not the best ending: Chris Herbert, the man Tulisa is suing for his involvement in her sex tape scandal, has apologised for any part he may have paid in the sex tape saga . Speaking to The Sun on Sunday Herbert, who represented Edwards, explained he told his client he would be sued and said he never 'made a penny' from the leak. In a grovelling apology he said: 'My reputation and business has been ruined by these unsavoury people. I never tried to make a penny. 'I was disgusted by the whole thing and from day one advised Justin not to do anything with the tape. I even got a lawyer to tell him he would be sued.' But Tulisa hit back today, with her manager telling MailOnline: '‘If Chris Herbert were genuinely sorry, he would be saying nothing. 'One ‘sorry’ does not make up for all the upset caused to Tulisa. This trauma to Tulisa was compounded by the defendants before admitting their lies, allowing claims this was a Tulisa publicity stunt which was 100 per cent never the case. 'Herbert is no longer involved in the X-Factor in any way as announced by X Factor. Simon Cowell had nothing to do with Herbert’s hiring.' Although Herbert has been fired from X Factor he manages four-piece band JukeBoxx, with members Adam Wallis, Daecolm Diego, Jazz Rocket and Xorael Harrison, wowing the judges at the Manchester auditions.

Tradition: The sound of the Bow Bells is said to give the area within which true Cockneys are born . Tradition dictates that only those born within earshot of the 'Bow Bells' can claim to be  Cockneys. But it seems that the ranks of these 'true' Londoners are dwindling - because noise pollution is . drowning out the sound of the bells of St Mary-le-Bow church. As the street noise in the capital increases every year, the area in . which the peeling of the bells can be heard has been gradually reduced. The phenomenon is considered so serious by church officials that they . have backed plans to give the Bow Bells an audio boost with an MP3 . recording of their sound. Around 150 years ago they could be heard across the City, Islington, . Hackney, Tower Hamlets, Southwark and even parts of Camden and Waltham . Forest. They now can only be heard in a small area in the City and Shoreditch. And the study into the bells' sound revealed there are no maternity wards within earshot of St Mary-le-Bow. But now internet users can listen to the bells in the online download - as . researchers aim for their sound to be heard more widely. A study undertaken to coincide with the . new Times Atlas of London found that in 1851, noise levels in the . capital were similar to that of Britain's countryside today. Shrinking influence: A diagram shows, in green, the area where the sound of the Bow Bells reached in 1851, and in blue, the much smaller area that it reaches now . Would you Adam and Eve it? True Cockneys like the Trotters could have their days numbered due the lessened influence of the Bow Bells and the rise of other dialects . While sound levels were around 20 to 25 DBA in the evening, ambient levels now measure around 55 DBA. Researchers said it was due to a combination of road and aircraft noise pollution. Describing the MP3 soundtrack which it is hoped will keep the Cockney tradition alive, Reverend George Bush of St Mary-le-Bow church said: 'There are hundreds of thousands of people of Cockney descent across the world, from Australia to Canada, the United States to South Africa, and I hope that they will enjoy hearing the chimes that were so very familiar to their ancestors. 'Perhaps this digital initiative will help create a new generation of global Cockneys, and, if so, I hope that in the years to come they will have the opportunity to visit London and hear the remarkable sound of Bow Bells in person.' In the 14th century the term Cockney . was used by rural people to native Londoners who relied on their wits . rather than their strength. By the 16th century it suggested a lack of . masculinity. In time the term became synonymous . with working class Londoners and it lost its negative connotations, but . is occasionjally still used disparagingly by those in the North to . describe all Londoners. The reference to the Bow Bells appeared around 1600 in Fynes Moryson's . 'An Itinerary' that said: 'Londoners, and all within the sound of Bow . Bells, are in reproach called Cockneys.' Lexicographer John Minsheu was the first to define it in this sense. In . his Ductor in Linguas (1617) he wrote: 'A Cockney or Cockny, applied . only to one born within the sound of Bow bell, that is in the City of . London.'

Georgia flesh-eating victim, Aimee Copeland's recovery is coming on, according to her father, who blogged  yesterday that his daughter is already able to do 200 sit-ups in seven minutes, thanks to a gruelling rehabilitation training. Andy Copeland's pride was evident as he told how Aimee, 24, also completes a programme of 400 leg lifts in the same amount of time as well as 'planks' and 'sideplanks'. To keep her fighting spirit in check, her physical therapist make Aimee say a complete sentence with each repetition, one her father says is usually something along the lines of: 'My therapist is a sadist.' The long road: Aimee Copeland smiles bravely as she is transported to the rehabilitation clinic on July 2nd where is already able to do 200 crunches in seven minutes thanks to a dedicated physical therapist . The truth, he revealed in a lighthearted blog entry, is that Aimee loves the physical therapist at her east Georgia rehab clinic and is already stronger than a lot of people. Andy wrote: 'At this point I have to pause and ask a simple question. How many of you can do two hundred crunches in seven minutes?' The student's incredible recovery comes after just weeks after she was finally released from Joseph M. Still Burn Center at Augusta's Doctor's Hospital. Aimee, a humanist psychology student from Snelville, had been recovering there after a zip-lining accident on May 1st left a rare flesh-eating bacteria known as necrotizing fasciitis, wreaking havoc on her body. Pensive: According to Andy's blog, Aimee is made to say complete sentences after each repetition during her sessions which include crunches, leg-lifts and other abdominal strengthening exercises . Sticking together: Andy and Donna Copeland have been building an 'Aimee wing' at their Snelville, Georgia home as Aimee gets stronger in preparation for her prosthetic limbs . Doctors amputated one of her legs, a foot and most of both hands to stop the deadly bacteria from spreading and during the six week stint, Aimee drifted in and out of consciousness and on and off life support as doctors laboured tirelessly to overcome the disease. Now that she has been moved to the rehabilitation clinic, her father says her determination is relentless and has already vetoed his plans to drive her around in a wheelchair friendly van when she returns home. Fun times: Aimee is determined to return to life as normal and was outraged by her father's suggestion that he chauffeur her around in a wheelchair friendly vehicle . Hippie chic: Old photographs of Aimee show an energetic and active young student who will no doubt be relying on the $150,000 prosthetic limbs he parents are hoping to afford to give her the freedom she enjoyed before . According to his blog post, Aimee's reaction on learning about his new automotive purchase was: 'No way! I am not going to be chauffeured around town like a handicapped person.' Without relaying his concerns about his daughter's future driving career to Aimee herself, proud father Andy wrote: 'The simple fact is that between her ears, Aimee is 100%. She knows that she can accomplish anything she wants and that lacking the hands or feet to accomplish such tasks is only a minor inconvenience.' Road trip: Though Andy joked that his daughter was a terrible driver even when she did have all her limbs, his tone turned more serious as he wondered how how she thinks she could drive with her disability . Both he and his wife, Donna, have been hard at work building what they call 'an Aimee wing' onto their home to make sure her life can return to normal as soon as possible and she can get on with studying for her master's degree. The extension will include a bedroom, fitness room, sunroom and study and will be accessed by a special lift built by concerned volunteers. In the meantime, the Copelands have also been trying to raise the funding to buy their brave daughter the $150,000 prosthetic limbs that she hopes will allow her to live as independently and actively as before her horrifying ordeal.","The gruelling programme also includes leg-lifts and 'plank' exercises .

The Kosovo-born star chose a bright orange outfit as she joined judges Tulisa Contostavlos, Louis Walsh and Gary Barlow for a second day on the panel at London's O2 Arena. The pop newcomer, 21, stood out from the crowd in an eye-catching vintage Thierry Mugler jacket, Christian Blanken trousers and towering Christian Louboutin heels. The future's bright: London singer Rita Ora wears an eye-catching orange outfit on her second day as a X Factor judge in London . Following a successful Monday on the panel, Rita was invited back again today - but could only do a half-day because she was supporting Coldplay in concert in Coventry later this evening. She wrote on Twitter this morning: 'Good Morning X Factor day 2 only half day then straight on a helicopter to coventry for COLDPLAY! Work Work Work! YES!!! 'Today surrounded by the talented @officialtulisa @radioleasy @gbarlowofficial & the 1 & only Louis Walsh thanks 4 makin' me feel so welcome!' After her half-day, Rita jumped in a private jet to dash up to the Midlands, leaving Nicole Scherzinger to take her place in the afternoon. Good impression: The 21-year-old pleased bosses on Monday so was invited back for a second day - albeit a half-day . Rita tweeted a photo of herself by her private plane: 'Just left the O2 thank you so much @xfactor and everyone there for having me! Jumping straight on a plane to do a show with coldplay!' At the auditions, a wannabe singer stormed the stage without following correct audition procedures and tried to have his own moment in the spotlight. As he tried to belt out a song, Tulisa pointed out: 'There are people waiting back stage who have been queueing here for hours. They have gone through the proper process. It's not fair on them.' Rita's temporary addition to the judging panel has caused some controversy because she is so new to the charts herself. Team X: X Factor host Dermot O'Leary (left) and Xtra Factor co-star Caroline Flack, wearing a River Island playsuit, were spotted outside the O2 . Although she scored her first No.1 with R.I.P. earlier this month - it was her first solo single ever to be released in the UK. She previously was a featured artist on singles by DJ Fresh and Craig David. However, Tulisa defended Rita's place on the judges' table: 'Rita is great for the panel. Despite just breaking the commercial scene, she's been in the industry for years and knows what she's talking about.' This is the way to travel: Rita climbed into a private jet up to Coventry after her half-day at the auditions . News of Rita's popularity will come as a blow to Geri Halliwell, who was hoping to land the spot permanently after Kelly Rowland's departure . However, she failed to impress at last week's Liverpool auditions and show bosses are said to have ruled out the former Spice Girls star joining the ITV show. A source told The Sun newspaper: 'Geri had a lot of energy and tried her hardest to make an impression. 'But you need chemistry with the other judges in spades if you are going to join the panel full time.'

Rhode Island lottery officials confirmed Tuesday that Louise White of Newport, described as a 'vivacious octogenarian' by her lawyers, had won the sixth largest jackpot in U.S. history. 'I want to say that I’m very happy and I’m very proud, and this will make my family very happy,' she said at a press conference on Tuesday morning. Scroll down for video . Louise White, 81, pictured with the governor of Rhode Island, came forward on Tuesday to collect her $336.4 million Powerball prize. She purchased the ticket on a quick trip to a convenience store to buy rainbow sherbert . Rhode Island Governor Lincoln D. Chafee commended her for her prudence in waiting to come forward until after she got help and set up a trust. 'Not only were you lucky, you were very . smart. You took your time and you hired professionals, ' he said. 'You’re a lucky and smart woman.' She bought the winning ticket for the February 11 drawing at a Stop & Shop supermarket in Newport when she was buying rainbow sherbet. She has since set up the Rainbow Sherbert Trust in honor of her fortuitous purchase. After she realized she had the winning ticket she tucked it her Bible for safe keeping at home, where she lives with her son LeRoy, a musician, and his wife Deborah, a nurse. Ms White's son LeRoy, pictured here with his wife Deborah, is an artist and musician in Newport . White said she wrote down the numbers when they were read on television after the drawing, but missed a few — so she waited 10 minutes to hear them again. She didn't check her ticket immediately. 'Vivacious octogenarian': White has chosen to receive her winnings in a lump sum of $210million . When she did, each of the numbers was the same. 'Is anybody awake — I want you to come look at something,' she yelled. Not believing she was the winner, she said, she checked the numbers online. Still the same. 'We still didn't believe it, so we turned off the computer and turned it back on and went back to the website and my numbers were still there,' White said. 'We hugged each other and jumped up and down screaming!! ... We hid the ticket in the Bible and went for breakfast on Sunday since we couldn't do anything with it.' The lump sum payment she has elected to receive will be a whopping $210 million before taxes, and she'll then pay $52.5million in federal taxes and more than $14 million to the state. The ticket price for Powerball increased from $1 to $2 in January. Rising sales nearly doubled the jackpot from $173.5 million on February 1. Powerball is played in 42 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The chance of matching all five numbers and the Powerball number is about 1 in 175 million.",Louise White will get a $143.5million lump sum after taxes .

Conjoined twin girls who were abandoned by their parents because they could not afford their care have been given new hope of surgery and returning home to their family. Veena and Vani, eight, were born joined at the head, but their parents left them in their local hospital in Hyderabad, India because they could not pay their medical expenses. For eight years the girls have eaten, played and slept in one room at Niloufer Hospital and have been cared for by nursing staff. New hope: Veena and Vani, eight, have been living in Niloufer Hospital, Hyderabad, India, for the last eight years because their parents were unable to pay for their care . Hopes: The girls, eight, want to be separated but their parents have been reluctant to allow an operation because of the risk both may not survive . But now their parents, Maragana Murali, 45, and wife Naga Laxmi, 40, have finally given their consent for them to undergo an operation to be separated. Naga said: 'I've found it too hard to let doctors operate on my girls any earlier because they couldn't give me any guarantees they would survive. 'They were healthy, happy and intelligent girls. I couldn't sit back and play with their future and risk losing one. 'But now they're getting older I realise they can't go on as they are. I'm just praying they survive and they can come home to us.' Risks: Parents Maragana Murali, 45, and wife Naga Laxmi, 40, pictured with their other two daughters Bindhu, 11, and Sindhu, nine, have now agreed their twins can undergo surgery . Naga Laxmi was unconscious when her daughters were born in October 2003. It was 15 days before she finally saw that her girls were joined at the head. She remembers breaking down in tears, devastated. 'For many months I couldn't stop crying,' she said. 'What had I done wrong? My insides were breaking into little pieces every time I thought of them. 'We didn't want to leave our girls behind, but we had no choice. 'We barely had enough money to keep a roof over our heads never mind care and pay for all their medical bills. Our only hope was that the hospital would save them.' When doctors admitted an operation to separate the twins could not guarantee the survival of both girls, their parents halted the procedure. Home: The girls have been leaving in a room at Niloufer Hospital, Hyderabad, for the last eight years . Veena and Vani continued to stay in the hospital and they would visit them as often as they could as they raised their other daughters Bindhu, 11, and Sindhu, nine. Their parents would save up money to go and visit their daughters, costing them 2,000 Rupees each time. But Naga would stay at the hospital for three days because she found it hard to leave them again. 'I sometimes find myself sobbing as I make the dinner or wash the floor. 'I still cry at unexpected times because of what my famil is going through. For years it was easier to just live as we were, it was too hard to commit to a decision.' Earlier this year, Niloufer Hospital officials invited the parents for a meeting and they made the decision to risk an operation. Operation: Doctors at the hospital are now hoping to get an international surgeon with neurosurgery expertise to separate the twins . Dr Narendra Kumar, a paediatric surgeon, is trying to find an international surgeon who specialises in neurology to perform the operation. He said: 'It has always been possible to operate on the girls because they both have individual brains. 'The problem lies with the one main blood vessel they share so it does have its risks.' The girls have built up a close friendship with Dr Kumar. Vani dreams of becoming an engineer and Veena wants to be a doctor. Dr Kumar added: 'We don't have any neurologists at this hospital so we have to look elsewhere. 'The girls dream of being separated so we hope their wish will come true soon.'","Veena and Vani are joined at the head, but have separate brains allowing surgery to take place .

Some 36 per cent thought there was excessive violence on TV, while 37 per cent thought foul-mouthed rants from stars such as Gordon Ramsay were too frequent an occurrence. The regulator’s annual report into consumer attitudes on broadcasting also found that one in four adults think there was too much sex on TV. It comes after family shows  such as X Factor caused public  outrage over sexualised performances by singers such as Rihanna and swearing before the watershed. Last year Ofcom set out stringent guidelines for programmes, saying that scantily-clad singers and  lewd dance routines must be cut from programmes being aired before 9pm. And earlier this year they warned that channels broadcasting repeats of post-watershed programmes before 9pm could face fines. The annual report also revealed that around a quarter of adults disagree with the time of the TV watershed. Ofcom’s figures show 9 per cent thought the watershed was ‘too late’ last year. In 2005 just 6 per cent thought it was too late and should be brought forward. And almost 20 per cent of adults said they had been offended by something they had seen on TV in the past year. But Ofcom said these figures were down considerably from 2005 for each of the categories. The Ofcom report comes after family shows such as X Factor caused public outrage over sexualised performances by singers such as Rihanna (pictured) It also claimed the survey showed that the proportion of adults saying there is too much sex, violence or swearing on TV has fallen by about a third since 2005. The proportion of adults saying the standard of TV programming had ‘got worse’ was 31 per cent. But 46 per cent of those 65 and above thought that standards had worsened. Just over one in ten felt standards had improved. The top two reasons given for the standard of TV programmes getting worse were ‘more repeats’ (71 per cent) and ‘lack of variety’ (43 per cent). The report also found that 96 per cent of adults are aware that broadcasters are allowed to show programming unsuitable for children only after a certain time.","37% think rants from stars like Gordon Ramsay are too frequent .

ITV bosses are risking a 'self-destructive war' with Simon Cowell by criticising the TV mogul and 'disrespecting' the work he has done for the channel's ratings. The explosive new biography of Cowell, 52, accuses ITV bosses of being 'disloyal' and 'ungrateful' to the X Factor supremo by not respecting the work he has done in rescuing the channel's plummeting ratings. The latest revelations from Tom Bower's book, which has been serialised in The Sun, also claim Cowell branded former business partner and talent show rival Simon Fuller 'the Devil'. Cowell, pictured with Cheryl Cole, Dannii Minogue and Louis Walsh while an X Factor judge, has been involved in a simmering feud with ITV bosses, according to a newly-released biography . But the details of the growing feud between ITV and Cowell revealed in Bower's book could strain the talent show boss's relationship with the channel to breaking point, according to the author. Bower claims the simmering row could force jeopardise ITV's £100m deal to screen The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent, with Cowell possibly being forced to offer his smash-hit TV shows to other channels. The author told The Sun: 'ITV are shooting themselves in the foot by criticising Simon Cowell. Spilling the beans: Cowell spent time with author Tom Bower, right, but insists the book is still unauthorised . 'They are risking a self-destructive war by not respecting the man who has saved their channel from bad ratings when they have failed to create other original and attractive programmes.' The 'power struggle' detailed in Bowers' unauthorised biography is said to centre on ITV accusations that Cowell was 'disruptive', 'interfering', and was accused of 'spinning too many plates'. According to The Sun, the fallout continued when it was emerged that Cowell wanted to sack Gary Barlow from The X Factor for his 'stiff performances'. Judge Barlow, 41, will return to The X Factor after signing a deal worth as much as £2 million to be on this year’s series. ITV . had earlier this week moved to counter revelations that Cowell had . wanted the Take That star singer sacked because of lacklustre ratings . last year. Best of enemies: According to the new book, Cowell jokingly refers to former business partner and ex Spice Girls manager Simon Fuller as 'the Devil' The latest revelations in Bower's book also tell of Cowell's bitterness towards fellow pop guru Simon Fuller. Bower told The Sun that Cowell jokingly calls his former business partner and ex-Spice Girls manager 'the Devil'. The author goes on to give an account . of how Cowell first revealed the notion of Pop Idol in 2001 during a . dinner with Fuller and former judge Nicki Chapman. Bower . writes: 'The idea, Fuller knew, was nearly as old as television itself, . but he immediately offered Cowell a twist to the Opportunity Knocks . format that he had been mulling over since 1998: 'The audience should . decide the winner by telephone voting.' 'Brilliant', said Cowell.' But . after a verbal agreement to split rights to the show 50/50 broke down . and Fuller took all the credit for Pop Idol, Cowell is said to have told . Fuller in 2010: 'All I've done, BGT, X Factor and much more, is revenge . for what you did to me. And there's much more to come!' Tom Bower's book, 'Sweet Revenge: The Intimate Life of Simon Cowell', is released today. Cowell . himself has since taken to Twitter to insist that although the . scandalous biography contains a number of lurid anecdotes, it is still . completely unauthorised.

Senior Assistant State's Attorney David Holzbach, 52, allegedly used a camera concealed in a pen to take the photos inside state Superior Court in Connecticut. The News-Times of Danbury reported in Friday's print editions, citing multiple sources it did not identify. On leave: David Holzbach, pictured in 2006, has been on paid leave after reported complaints that he surreptitiously took photos of women's legs and feet in court . Peeping prosecutor: Senior Assistant State's Attorney David Holzbach, 52, allegedly took photos photos of female attorneys' legs at the Superior Court in Danbury, Connecticut, pictured . Holzbach, a prosecutor in Danbury for 24 years, didn't return a phone message left at his home by The Associated Press. He told the newspaper earlier this week that he has not been informed of the nature of the allegations against him. 'I don't even know what the claim is,' Holzbach said before declining further comment. Holzbach's boss, Danbury State's Attorney Stephen Sedensky III, confirmed Friday that Holzbach has been on paid administrative leave for 'a couple months.' He declined to say why. Holzbach's salary is $129,000 a year. Candid camera: He allegedly used a pen camera to snap photos of his female co-workers' legs and feet (stock photo) Sedensky also said the case wasn't a criminal matter, but declined to elaborate. 'It's just a personnel matter that I can't comment on,' Sedensky told the AP. The state's voyeurism law makes it illegal to photograph or videotape someone's image without his or her permission, but it doesn't apply to public places such as courtrooms where the person would be in plain view and doesn't have a 'reasonable expectation of privacy.' Chief State's Attorney Kevin Kane also declined to release the allegations against Holzbach on Friday, saying it was 'an administrative matter.' He said Holzbach will remain on leave until the administrative process ends. He declined to say whether Holzbach faces a disciplinary hearing.

But now her flirtatious behaviour has landed her in hot water in the Celebrity Big Brother house yet again as she faces eviction for a second time. The 24-year-old beauty was slammed by love rat MC Harvey, incredibly without a hint of irony, for causing a 'love triangle' between former pals Mike 'The Situation' Sorrentino and Prince Lorenzo Borghese. Emotional: Danica Thrall burst into tears as she confronted Mike 'The Situation' Sorrentino about nominating her for a second time . And she was forced to listen to every word of their criticism as Big Brother ordered the group to make their nominations in front of each other yet again. Before the contestants even took to the sofas to deliver their verdict, Martin Kemp admitted he had been shocked by the glamour girl's behaviour in the 'Gods and Mortals' task, explaining she had been 'teasing' both The Situation and Prince Lorenzo. Speaking in the Diary Room, he said: 'The whole argument between Danica and The Situation has been caused by Danica's bed-hopping. She teases those boys. 'It's disgraceful': MC Harvey fumed about Danica's behaviour to Prince Lorenzo following the nominations . 'They think they can snog her. Danica . led Lorenzo to the point where I thought he was going to propose. She . knows what she's doing and she's very good at it.' But worse was yet to come when Danica's fellow housemates slammed her behaviour in front of her. And . not one to shy from flinging the insults MC Harvey said: 'I'm sick of . this love triangle situation, and I think she was one of the main causes . of The Situation and Lorenzo becoming distant when they used to be . friends.' Cheater: Alesha and the rapper (left) wed in . 2005 but their marriage collapsed when it was revealed he had been . unfaithful with singer Javine (right) Perhaps he was speaking from experience as the So Solid rapper is well-known for cheating on his wife, TV's sweetheart Alesha Dixon, with singer Javine Hylton - subsequently breaking up his marriage after creating his own love triangle.

'I thought out of everyone I could rely on you, like I said I could.' Upset: Danica looked on as she was nominated by Ashley, Harvey, Julie, Samantha and The Situation . But the Jersey Shore star claimed his decision was tactical, saying: 'I practically love you, but I know you have a boyfriend.' And Danica's actions caused a further divide between the group when Prince Lorenzo attempted to stand up for her against MC Harvey. However, the rapper immediately hit back in a scathing attack, suggesting the model's behaviour has been 'disgraceful'. 'I'm sick of this love triangle': The Celebrity Big Brother housemates fumed that they were fed up of the model's incessant flirting . He fumed: 'She's got a boyfriend and how she's acting is wrong.

Emotional: Katherine Jackson read a statement to ABC as she claimed she was 'devastated' to lose custody and said she had been on a 'short vacation' Bizarre: Katherine was surrounded by family in a show of unity, with Janet, Jermaine, Rebbie and Rebbie's daughter joining her, along with the marketing manager for the Tuscon resort where she has been staying . Earlier the Jackson family . matriarch had lost custody of her late son Michael's three children after a judge . awarded temporary guardianship of the trio to their cousin TJ. Prince, . 15, Paris, 14, and Blanket, 10 will be cared for by their 34-year-old . cousin who had been staying with them in their grandmother's absence. Katherine said: 'I am devastated that while I've been away, my grandchildren have been taken away from me and I'm coming home.' And she claimed the move was 'based on a bunch of lies.' Supportive? Janet and Jermaine whispered to each other and exchanged glances . But she failed to explain why she hadn't notified her three wards of her intention to take a 'short vacation and rest'. New guardian: The children's cousin TJ has been awarded temporary custody . 'One reason I didn't call is I just gave up my phone and I didn't want to have any phone calls while I was here,' she said. Katherine also confirmed that she had left her grandson TJ in charge. The film crew were told they were not to ask Katherine any questions as she read the statement.

Bizarrely she also repeatedly thanked the resort where she had been staying, adding: 'I had a very good time here - and if anyone wants to rest I think they should come here.' ON THE 'KIDNAPPING' There are rumors going around about me that I have been kidnapped and held against my will. I am here today to let everybody know that I am fine and I am here with my children, and my children would never do a thing to me like that, holding me against my will. It's very stupid for people to think that. ON THE LOSS OF CUSTODY OF HER GRANDCHILDRENI am devastated that while I've been away, that my children, my grandchildren, have been taken away from me, and I'm coming home to see about that, also. WHO WAS LOOKING AFTER HER GRANDCHILDREN? Before I left I put everything in order with the appropriate people to take care of my children for me and it's really bad to hear that what's going on at home, and the children have been taken away - but I know that... I'll get there in time to get them back. And after I finish this, I will be on my way home. WHERE DID SHE GO?I am grateful for my children that they saw that I needed rest and they wanted to take me away for a while, just a short vacation and rest up. They have taken good care of me and have made sure that I got the rest that I needed. WHY DIDN'T SHE CALL?One reason I haven't called is I just gave up my phone and I didn't want to have any phone calls while I was here.

'I've never heard my grandmother talk like that,' said TJ, who once dated Kim Kardashian. Saying . he thought she was talking in code, he went on: 'She wasn't sharp. The . pauses, choice of vocabulary... she has not used certain phrases like . that before.' Members . of her house are said to have been 'alarmed and nervous' after . Katherine's call - with sources telling TMZ the 'prevailing view . is that Randy and company have drugged their mom'. Judge Beckloff said that his understanding was that TJ's application was not a 'power play'. While members of the Jackson clan . are feuding over Michael's estate TJ is not one of them. Earlier this week TJ's father Tito . withdrew from the plot - involving Randy, Janet, Jermaine and Rebbie - . to overthrow the executors of their brother's will, which leaves everything . to his children and nothing to them. Judge Beckloff said Katherine's . guardianship was not suspended for wrongdoing - but argued she has been . prevented from doing her duties by 'intentional acts from third parties' - . an apparent reference to Randy, Janet, Jermaine and Rebbie. Tough . talk: Katherine lawyer, Perry Sanders, gives a press conference after . the hearing and said he will file a motion to get her reinstated as . guardian upon her return to LA . TJ's attorney, Charles A. Schultz described the situation as dire. He . said: 'There's immediate harm to the minor children, there was a . potential abduction at the house, in addition to a phone call from . Katherine last night that gave us real concern. Schultz went on: 'We are looking at this as a Band-Aid until Miss Jackson returns or re-establishes contact with the kids.' One of Katherine's lawyers, Sandra Ribera, added: 'I have reason to believe she's being held against her will.' Confused: Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson have been pining for their grandmother over recent days . Another of Katherine's lawyers, Perry . Sanders, said he will file a motion to get her re-instated as guardian . upon her return to LA. The judge also ordered that Prince, . Paris and Blanket should not be removed from California without a court . order - and urged TJ to file for permanent guardianship. TJ claimed he had previously assisted his grandmother with caring for his cousins. In court papers seen by website TMZ he claims that before Katherine left the house she had placed her grandchildren in his care. Daily updates: Paris tweeted this picture of herself . Seeking solace: Paris quoted lyrics from her father Michael Jackson's 1993 Will You Be There . And in a new twist TJ also alleged . that his aunts and uncles arranged for a 'fake' doctor to convince his . grandmother to abandon plans to attend a concert, instead going to a . luxury spa to rest. The court case was simply the latest . twist in an ongoing sage which began when Katherine left the house over a . week ago, telling her grandchildren she was going to see her sons in . concert. She did not return or contact her grandchildren. With a worried Paris tweeting that . her grandmother was 'missing' concerns arose that Katherine had been . 'kidnapped by her children', with her own lawyers even stating . that this was the case. Police stepped in and performed a . welfare visit, with the 82-year-old found to be in good spirits at her . daughter Rebbie's house in Arizona. But she still failed to contact her . young wards, with her son Jermaine admitting he had cut off her access . to phones for her own 'well being'. Enlarge .

Kelly Rutherford was seen back at work on the New York set of hit show Gossip Girl on Thursday. Her real life of late has echoed the trials and tribulations suffered by some of the characters as it emerged that she lost 'residential custody' of her young children. The 43-year-old Gossip Girl actress who plays Blake Lively's mother in the show is said to be . 'devastated' after a judge ruled her five-year-old son and . three-year-old daughter should remain with their father in France, where he . currently resides. And now it has been revealed the judge gave custody to her ex-husband Daniel Giersch as it was his opinion that she had repeatedly tried to cut her ex-husband out their children's lives. The show must go on: Actress Kelly Rutherford returned to work on the set of Gossip Girl in New York, after it emerged that the judge felt she was 'attempting to cut father Daniel Giersch out of their children's lives' The judge says Giersch - who lives in France - did facilitate the relationship, according to TMZ. Meanwhile, Rutherford refused to put . Daniel's name on their daughter's birth certificate, despite repeated . requests to do so from the court. The judge wrote: 'Even while under the . scrutiny of an extended trial, Kelly still has declined to demonstrate . the level of commitment to facilitating the relationship that would be . required of a residential parent in a relocation situation.' Under the arrangement, U.S.-based . Rutherford will get the children 50 per cent of the time - but they will . live and go to school in France. Rutherford was fighting the 37-year-old German businessman in family court to bring her children back to the U.S. Happier times: Kelly Rutherford with son and then-husband Daniel Giersch in March, 2007 . TMZ previously reported Giersch is unable to return to the U.S. because his visa has been revoked as of April this year. High society role: Rutherford stars as Serena's (Blake Lively) mother Lily van der Woodsen in Gossip Girl . According to the website, the judge . ruled Rutherford will be allowed a flexible visitation schedule so that . she may spend time with her children when travel and work arrangements . allow. According to . the ruling, she will be permitted to see their five-year-old son and . three-year-old daughter 50 per cent of the time. However Rutherford, who married Giersch back in 2006 and divorced him in 2010, plans to appeal the ruling. Rutherford’s lawyer’s attempted to . depose Giersch, a German businessman, about his visa, back in 2010 but . at the time the judge ruled in favor of Giersch, noting that the risk of . him being deported and taking the children to Germany was 'very low.' It's unclear when Giersch took the children to France and how long Rutherford expected the visit to last. It makes for another disappointing . legal row for Rutherford, who in April was sued by a private eye . claiming he was hired to spy on Giersch. According to court documents obtained . by TMZ, the actress engaged the services of Edward Banach to spy on her . ex back in April 2010 'in relation to certain issues regarding child . custody and other matters'. Handover: Rutherford, right, takes her daughter from Giersch's arms in April 2010 . The website reports the pair went . through a messy divorce, with issues of 'restraining orders and . allegations of child endangerment'. Banach alleges he spent months snooping on Giersch's ex, which left Rutherford with a whopping bill of $86,249.85. Working mom: Rutherford was all smiles in June 2010 when out and about with her brood . However, he alleges he only got paid $28,214.35, leaving bills of around $58,000 unpaid. Now, Banach - who was sub-contracted . through a now-defunct security company - is suing the business along . with Rutherford to get the remaining $58,000. According to TMZ, at the height of . their legal disputes, Rutherford admitted she hired a private . investigator to prove Giersch  'did not properly secure the pool and . play areas at his home,' which she alleges endangered the couple's young . son. The warring pair also previously argued over . 'potty-training' their son and the actress’s ex claimed he was never . notified of the birth, and instead read about it in online reports. He put out a statement soon after the . birth that said: 'I was never informed by Kelly about the birth of our . daughter, nor was I invited to attend. 'In fact, I found out about it . through Internet reports like everyone else. Although this sickens me, I . am of course overjoyed that our baby was born healthy. 'I would’ve wanted nothing more than . to hold our newborn daughter for a few moments, and I only seek to . co-parent both our children responsibly and with love.' Rutherford’s publicist Jill Fritzo . countered: 'The doctors advised that no one be in the birthing room; . [Daniel] was notified when [Helena] was born and was immediately invited . to come see her.' The Gossip Girl star was previously married to Carlos Tarajano for seven months, before their union dissolved in January 2002.

Prince Andrew’s bid to save the Duke of Wellington’s battalion from defence cuts received a boost last night after reports that the Army chief behind the move plans to discuss the issue with him. Well-placed sources said Major General Graham Binns, Regimental Colonel of the Yorkshire Regiment, was ready to reconsider his decision to cut the Army’s link with the victor of the Battle of Waterloo. The 600-strong Duke of Wellington’s battalion, formally known as 3rd  Battalion, the Yorkshire Regiment, will be one of the most high-profile victims of the Army cuts to be announced this week. Boost: British soldiers take positions during clashes with gunmen in Basra, Iraq, in 2004. There are signs that the Duke of Wellington's battalion could be saved from defence cuts . The regiment is to be reduced to two battalions, but the Duke of York, who is Colonel-in-Chief of the Duke of Wellington’s battalion, currently serving in Afghanistan, is known to support moves to retain its historic name. Prince Andrew last week spoke of his ‘passionate care’ for the soldiers in the battalion, prompting hopes of a U-turn. He also dined with officers of the Yorkshire Regiment last week. Former officers in the Duke of  Wellington’s battalion were shocked to hear Maj Gen Binns announce two months ago that when the regiment was cut from two to three, the Wellington’s name would disappear. Following a mini-mutiny, it is understood that he is considering a number of ways of retaining the name of the man who defeated Napoleon. One proposal is to name the two remaining Yorkshire Regiment battalions, the Duke of York’s and the Duke of Wellington’s. Another is to call one of the 200-strong regimental companies the Duke of Wellington’s. Tradition: Prince Andrew (right) is known to support moves to retain the historic name, which retains the Army's link with the victor of the Battle of Waterloo (left) A spokeswoman for Prince Andrew said he had not met Maj Gen Binns last week, but declined to say if the two men had spoken. The Army cuts, which will reduce its fighting strength to 82,000, its lowest level since the Napoleonic Wars, is expected to see several other famous regimental names disappear including the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, whose Royal Colonel is the Queen; the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards; 3rd Battalion, Mercian  Regiment; and 2nd Battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. Savings: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond is expected to claim that the cuts focus on regiments with the most foreign-born recruits . The cuts have been delayed for weeks amid squabbling over where they should fall. English MPs claim that Scots regiments have been spared for fear of antagonising public opinion in Scotland ahead of the vote on  independence. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond will claim that the reductions focus on regiments with the most foreign-born recruits, in particular regiments with a high number of Commonwealth troops. However, critics say this does not square with his decision to exempt the Gurkhas, who previously have been championed by actress Joanna Lumley. ‘The Scots, Welsh and Gurkhas have been spared the worst for political reasons, so the English regiments are in for a nasty shock,’ said a source. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said last night: ‘The traditions and heritage of the regimental system are hugely respected. 'The Defence Secretary has been clear that the regimental system is fundamental to British Army fighting power. 'We are not going to change that.’ Historic: The Duke of Wellington's army goes into battle in 1815, as imagined by artist Robert Alexander Hillingford .","Major ready to reconsider decision to cut Army's link with the hero who defeated Napoleon at Waterloo .

According to legend, a black fox brings bad luck, but an amateur photographer could hardly believe his good fortune when he spotted the rare animal near his house. It is believed to be only the second time a black fox has been spotted in Britain. John Moore, 58, from Bassingbourn, near . Royston, Herts, saw the creature, with its distinctive white-tipped . tail, in fields behind his home. Rare spot: John Moore, 58, from Bassingbourn, near Royston, Herts, saw the creature, with its distinctive white-tipped tail, in fields behind his house yesterday . 'My neighbour thought it was a stray dog but I looked through my binoculars and realised it was definitely a fox, especially because of its white-tipped tail,' said Mr Moore . Unusual: The black fox is so rare that wildlife experts believe there are only a handful of the breed left in the country . Lucky: John Moore from Bassingbourne in Cambridgeshire . His wife Cheryl, 64, first spotted what she thought to be a black sack blowing in the wind last week. Mr Moore then spotted it for himself last Thursday but it has disappeared by the time he managed to get his camera out. He then spent four days watching for . the black fox, which has a distinctive white-tipped tail and is believed . to be one of just a handful in the country. 'I've heard black foxes are mythical creatures because they supposedly don't exist,' he said. 'My . neighbour thought it was a stray dog but I looked through my binoculars . and realised it was definitely a fox, especially because of its . white-tipped tail. 'I . didn't realise how rare it was until I did some research. An RSPCA . officer told my neighbour the organisation had never seen one before as . they are that rare. The black fox is . in fact an ordinary red fox which has black fur or is going through a . phase where the colour of its fur is particularly dark. The phenomenon is normally seen in growing cubs and generally the fox will develop to have a dark chestnut coat. But . a few red foxes will remain black due to a rare genetic flaw dating . back hundreds of years. Only a handful of them are thought to exist in . Britain. Unwelcome sight: In medieval times, the black fox was considered a bad omen by superstitious villagers . Colouring: The black fox is in fact an ordinary red fox which has black fur or is going through a phase where the colour of its fur is particularly dark . In Gaelic tradition, black foxes are . bringers of bad luck. Rural communities used to tell of a fox as . 'black as night, so that it could live in a man's shadow and never be . seen.' Centuries-old superstitions are often found attached to black animals, such as black dogs and black cats. It is thought to originate from when the black dog was said to bring disaster and doom to whoever saw the animal. In Medieval times, villages were very afraid of the sighting of a black fox and considered it to predict trouble or bad luck. In North America, foxes with black coats are often found with a variable amount of white or white-banded hair in the dark coat. Mr Moore added: 'I first saw the black fox last week so when it appeared again yesterday I was ready with my camera. 'I managed to get within 100 metres of it but then it ran off. 'I was really pleased with the photos. I wanted to get them because when we spotted it before no one believed us. 'They thought we must have been mistaken, but from these pictures there's no mistaking it.' Mr Moore even believes there is a second black fox living in the fields. 'I caught a glimpse of a second one but I'm not sure if it's a cub or a male and female fox,' he added. The . red fox was introduced to America by the peans and black foxes exist in . much greater numbers there because they were not hunted as widely. In the UK their pelts were highly prized in the fur trade and it is believed the genetic strain became much scarcer. Only one other black fox has been spotted in Britain before in Preston, Lancashire in 2008. Some people took it as a bad omen as only a few weeks later the banks in Britain nearly collapsed. But it seems the bad luck was turned inwards and a few weeks later a woman found the dead animal on her farm in Heapey, near . Chorley, Lancashire, after it had been seen by neighbours hanging around . the area, looking gaunt. Omen: Only one other black fox has been spotted in Britain before in Preston, Lancashire in 2008 in a graveyard - but it was found dead weeks later . Kevin Hehir, 48, from Ribbleton in Preston, spotted the animal on September 8 whilst he was out walking and managed to take pictures and record footage. At the time, he said: 'I thought it was the Devil looking at me. Then I thought, ""It's a myth, there's no such thing"". But I managed to get right up to it and it's definitely a young black fox.' On hearing it had died, he added: 'What a shame. At the time it looked weary and like it was on its last legs. I'm pleased that I managed to get a picture of it. Far from being unlucky for me it brought the sunshine and dry weather for the harvest.'","John Moore from Bassingbourn, near .

A young nurse has hit out at a remorseless driver after he killed her brother while ploughing through a red light at double the speed limit. Painting a heartrending picture of her family's pain, Hollie Butcher, 20, told 40-year-old Michael Moore: 'You've ruined my perfect family.' Her brother, Jamie, 22, was hurled more than 40 metres when Moore's . powerful Chrysler Cruiser hit him on a pedestrian crossing while traveling at 58mph in a 30mph zone. He died instantly. Perfect family: (Left to right) Hollie Butcher, brother Jamie, their mother Tina and stepfather Stephen Green were 'the perfect family'. Jamie was killed when crossing a pedestrian crossing in February 2011 . Moore, who had previous convictions . for speeding and burglary, showed no emotion as he was jailed for just 43 months. Moore, of Parson Drove, near Wisbech, Cambs, admitted causing death by dangerous driving after the horrific crash in Wisbech in February 2011. Devastated Hollie said after he was sentenced: 'Mr Moore has ruined the most perfect family he could have ruined. 'Jamie was my big brother. I'm never going to have that again, I haven't got a brother, he's taken that from me through his recklessness. 'Sitting at home, seeing your parents crying all the time. He doesn't realise we've got to go through this forever, there's only so much moving on you can do. Killer driver: Michael Moore, 40, who had previous convictions for speeding and burglary, showed no emotion as he was jailed for just 43 months . 'It's impossible for us, it's not going to happen.' Choking back tears, the distraught veterinary nurse added: 'Mr Moore's going to come out of prison and we're still going to be sitting here grieving. 'We have got to live with this for the rest of our lives because we knew him. 'When I have children they'll never get to meet the best uncle they could have known. 'We knew his laugh, we knew his voice and that man has destroyed that. 'He has destroyed a lovely person.' As impassive Moore was led away to start his sentence Jamie's outraged stepfather, Stephen Green, screamed at him: 'Do you understand what you have done?' Mr Green, of Wisbech, said last night: 'I did lose control a bit at the end of the case because he just showed a blank expression. There was no remorse. 'We had been warned that it was likely to be three or four years. 'I know nothing's going to bring Jamie back but Mr Moore could be out in a few months.' 'Christmases, birthdays, family holidays - we're never going to have that again, every Christmas there's going to be an empty chair.' Jamie's shattered mum, Tina Butcher, said outside court: 'I have often said that Jamie was too good for this world. Our loss is heaven's gain.' Moore changed his plea to guilty on the eve of his trial at Cambridge Crown Court. David Matthew, prosecuting, said Jamie was 'a happy, friendly man', who had been accepted by Manchester University for a post-graduate course just the day before he died. Mr Matthew said he was the son of a close, hard-working family who had left home at 4pm to walk into Wisbech town centre to withdraw £20 from a cash machine. Popular Jamie was killed instantly. CCTV showed that the crossing lights had turned to amber 3.2 seconds, and red 0.2 seconds, before the crash, the court heard. Moore had been 82 metres from the crossing when the lights turned amber but he had not braked until after he hit his tragic victim. Sentencing Moore, Judge Gareth Hawkesworth told him: 'This is indeed a tragic case. 'It's tragic in one sense for you because you will, I have no doubt, have this on your conscience and memory for the rest of your life. 'But it's even more tragic for the family of the deceased whose lives have been shattered. 'Nothing I can do, in terms of the sentence, can bring him back.' Jamie graduated from De Montfort University, Leicester, last summer with a degree in psychology. The former Neale Wade College student's great ambition was to work for highly-respected human rights organisation Amnesty International, his grieving family said.","Jamie Butcher, 22, was killed as he crossed a pedestrian crossing in Wisbech, Cambs .

Having just been released from prison, you might have expected prolific burglar David Stedman to try to keep on the straight and narrow. But not only did the drug addict break into another house almost straight away, he then admitted the crime to police officers who called at his home to check the conditions of his licence. 'Are you here about the burglary,' he asked them, then proceeded to tell the stunned officers the address of his victim and show them what he had stolen. Jailed: Judge Patrick Hooton, left, sentenced career criminal David Stedman, right, to three years in prison after he confessed to a burglary to police who had come to his home on an unrelated matter . Stedman, 43, was on parole from a . 42-month sentence imposed for ten burglaries when he decided to break . into a house on a whim as he walked past. He stole a computer, jewellery box and cash after breaking through a fence and smashing a window at the back of the property. The next day police called at his home . in Gosport, Hampshire, to discuss an issue over his release on licence. But as soon as he saw the officers, who knew nothing about the . burglary, Stedman started talking. Daniel Reilly, defending him at . Portsmouth Crown Court, explained: 'When the police attended in relation . to his licence situation he was heard to immediately ask “Is this about . the burglary?”. 'They replied “No, what burglary?”. He told them about the burglary he had committed and provided all the information.' Stedman had a string of more than 100 previous convictions, 27 of which were for burglary, and had only just been released from prison when he committed this latest offence, Portsmouth Crown Court, pictured, heard . Prosecutor Eileen Sproson said: 'The police asked Mr Stedman details of the home he burgled and he told them the address. 'They attended the address and the occupant confirmed they had been burgled.

Olympics chief Sebastian Coe has launched an out­spoken attack on reality TV, warning that it could wreck Britain's hopes of producing future Olympic champions. Lord Coe, who won his first Olympic gold in 1980, said shows such as The X Factor encourage young people to think they can become 'famous for nothing'. The chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (Locog) said: 'I don't decry all reality TV. It identifies talent, but it encourages people to think you can be a celebrity in six hours. 'I joined an athletics club when I was 11 years old and didn't get to the Olympics until I was 23. 'We have to be careful we don't create a celebrity-driven culture where young people think it is better to be famous for nothing than be anonymous for doing something creative.' In an exclusive and wide-ranging interview with The Mail on Sunday, Lord Coe - who remains the only man to win gold in the 1500m at successive Olympics - also spoke candidly about his 'tough' school days and the extra­ordinary influence of his late father and coach. Sleek and slim as ever at the age of 55, wearing a pink shirt with the top two buttons open and reclining in his 23rd-floor office in London's Canary Wharf, Lord Coe looks the archetypal, well-groomed City slicker. Fame: Simon Cowell with fellow celebrity judge Cheryl Cole on The X Factor . Yet he failed his 11-plus and his was no gilded upbringing. 'If you were brought up in Sheffield in the Seventies, went to an inner-city secondary modern and your name was Sebastian, you learned how to survive. It was tough. You learn to handle yourself.' His steely core comes as much from his formidable father Peter as it does from his native city. During the Second World War, Peter Coe survived his ship being torpedoed. Picked up by a German boat, he later escaped en route to a prisoner-of-war camp by leaping off a train and walking across the Pyrenees to Spain. But there he was jailed for six months for having the wrong papers. Years later, he had a blazing row with a bolshie athletics official and his son commented: 'You don't scare easily.' Peter, who died in 2008, replied: 'I don't scare at all. The last 43 years have been a f****** bonus.' When Coe lost the 800m Olympic final to his great rival Steve Ovett in 1980, his father told him - and the world's media - he had 'run like a ****'. Unlike modern budding Olym­pians, Lord Coe's only sponsors were his hard-up parents. Gold rush: Lord Coe leads the 1500m semi-final, followed by Spain's Jose Abascal, at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, where he won gold . 'It bred a hardier competitor,' he says. 'No athlete is going to under­perform in London because of lack of funding. The National Lottery has changed the landscape.' The words are said with feeling. However, he admits today's youngsters have more distractions. 'When I first joined an athletics club, it was the focus of my world. There was little TV and no computer games.' Lord Coe also touched on the possibility that sprinter Dwain Chambers, whose ban on competing because of a drugs offence was overturned earlier this year, could wear a GB vest at the 2012 Games. 'I am unreconstructed on this,' he says. 'I would like to see a life ban. If you take drugs to artificially enhance your performance, you are stepping out of the moral framework of sport.' Athletes on drugs who competed for the Soviet Union in Lord Coe's heyday had an excuse, he says. 'They had no idea they were being given drugs at the breakfast table.' Of Chambers, Lord Coe says: 'If he competes he should receive every courtesy.' But he warns: 'Drugs cheats should think very carefully before coming to London: we have the most advanced tests in any Games. You run a serious risk of getting caught.' Overturned: Dwain Chambers runs the 4x100 Relay in Rome last month . Turning to Britain's chances this summer, Lord Coe is far from confident about achieving the target of finishing fourth in the medals table, as in Beijing, when we nudged Australia into fifth place by a single bronze medal. 'You don't have to give the Aussies much of an excuse to get back at you. It's in their DNA.' He says the Germans, French, Japanese and South Koreans pose the biggest threat. Lord Coe's steely core is again evident in his defence of his £357,000-a-year salary as Locog chairman. Lord Coe, who travels in a chauffeur-driven BMW 7 Series, says he is worth it: on a typical day, he starts work at 7am and finishes at midnight. He also defends the ruthless way 'Olympic police' have stopped anyone else exploiting the Games' commercial potential. An East End kebab shop called 'Olympic' was forced to change to 'Lympic'. 'I am unashamedly protective of it,' he avows. 'I have to protect the people who have put a lot of money into this. I am going to get this project across the line with a balanced budget so the public won't have to pick up the bill.' Rumours: Lord Coe's judo sessions with William Hague fuelled bogus rumours they were gay . Lord Coe was a Tory MP from 1992 to 1997 and William Hague's chief of staff when the former Conservative Party leader was defeated in the 2001 General Election. He became a peer in 2000. His spell with Hague is best remembered for their lunchtime judo sessions, which fuelled bogus rumours that they were gay. 'Gay?' splutters Lord Coe, in fits of laughter. 'There was nothing weird about it. When William became leader, he said to me, 'I know how hard this job is going to be. I need to be in shape. What do I do?' I said, 'What sports do you like?' He said, 'Martial arts.'' Lord Coe arranged for them to wrestle on the judo mat, supervised by Olympic silver medallist Ray Stevens. 'William got up to a blue belt.' Lord Coe has four children by ex-wife, equestrian Nicola McIrvine, and had an affair with fashion designer Vanessa Lander in the Nineties. He married magazine editor Carole Annett, ten years his junior, last July. His friends say his ambition is to be president of the International Olympic Committee. Lord Coe plays it down but, like the canny politician he is, does not rule it out. If London 2012 goes well, his credentials will be as unbeatable as he was on the track.","Games chief attacks reality TV for encouraging young people to think it is better to be famous for nothing than be anonymous for doing something creative .

Being at the cutting edge of technology comes at a price - and in the TV world, it turns out to be £20,000. Sony today took the wraps of the biggest ever 4K TV ever made, with an 84inch screen. 4K, currently only widely used in cinemas, has four times as many pixels as a normal HD TV. Sony's snappily named KD-84X9005 TV, which boasts an 85 inch screen that can show pictures four times sharper than HD - if you can find anything in the new format to watch . It has yet to catch on as so far, there is very little in the new format to watch. The 84-inch TV represents a ""major step forward,"" said Kaz Hirai, CEO of Sony, speaking at a news conference. 'It's an unprecedented and revolutionary viewing experience,' Hirai said. 'The experience is so immersive, you want to touch everything in front of you.' David Fincher's The Social Network was one of the first to be shot and screened in 4K, and an increasing number of cinema films use the format. However, it is widely expected to eventually replace HD as the standard for films and other entertainment. Sony's new TV is one of the first, and the biggest, to hit the market. Sony boasts that, like the iPhone's display, is it so clear individual pixels are impossible to distinguish. 'With its beautiful, large high-resolution screen and high-quality powerful sound, viewers can enjoy immersive experiences unlike anything offered by existing televisions, as if they were at a live entertainment venue or in a movie theater,' the firm said. It also comes with ten speakers, and can show pictures as well as video. The TV also boasts ten speakers, and will be on sale later this year . However, as with all technology, there is always something better around the corner - and the BBC has already filmed test content at the Olympics using a 'super hi-def' 8K format even better than Sony's. The Japanese firm is the first to show if its products at the IFA technology show in Berlin, Sony also unveiled a new tablet computer called the Experia Tablet S designed to take on the iPad and Microsoft's new Surface tablet. It runs Google's Android software, as it expected to be available within weeks. Sony also showed off a touchscreen computer called the Tap 20, which is a 20 inch touchscreen that can either be used a normal PC or laid flat to be used as a touchscreen for multiplayer games. The firm showed off the tablet with a range of software including a painting game. It will run Microsoft's new Windows 8 software.

A social worker has been arrested during a major investigation into an alleged child foster care prostitution ring. Jean LaCroix, 46, who has been suspended as an investigator for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF), is accused of five counts of having sex with a vulnerable 17-year-old he was supposed to be protecting from abuse. LaCroix is the fifth man to be arrested as part of an ongoing probe into claims a ring of human traffickers was targeting and abusing neglected children in foster care in Miami. Four other men have been accused of using a child as a 'recruiter' to lure young vulnerable girls from the care system into becoming prostitutes. The 17-year-old is said to have told Miami-Dade Police . that she and the case worker had 'consensual sexual . intercourse on numerous occasions'. According to a search warrant obtained by CBS Miami, LaCroix would pick the alleged victim up from school and take her to his home where they . would have sex. The warrant also states the alleged victim was placed in the care of LaCroix for a month between September and October 2011, but phone records indicate that they had been engaged in a relationship for much longer - even after LaCroix was told to cut all contact by his supervisor. Secretary of DCF Secretary David Wilkins released a statement which said: 'This alleged behaviour is absolutely appalling and betrays the trust and confidence that all Floridians have in our Department's employees. 'Mr Lacroix's actions in no way reflect the expectations we and all Floridians have for our investigators or any of our employees.' LaCroix is also accused of trying to flee the country. He is alleged to have booked flights . to the Dominican Republic, but been turned back to the U.S. by customs . and arrested when he returned to New York on Saturday. Esther . Jacobo, DCF's regional supervisor, told CBS Miami that the agency took . swift action, placing LaCroix on paid administrative leave, confiscating . his state-issued cell phone, and limiting his access to files and . children.

A fifth person - a 17-year-old foster child who is identified only by the initials S.S. - is listed in a 13-page sworn statement as a ‘recruiter’ for the ring, though she is not charged with any crimes. Using a teenage foster child as a recruiter, police say, the four men plied underage girls with cash, affection and gifts. The alleged pimps would then charge men $100 to have sex with the girls - who would be paid a fraction of that money.","Jean LaCroix, 46, is accused of five counts of unlawful sex with 17-year-old who had been placed in his care ."

Parents Mike and Laura Canahuati received heart-wrenching news only weeks ago - that their five-month-old daughter Avery has only months to live. Doctors diagnosed their baby girl with Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy, the most severe kind, and gave her only 18 months to live. Rather than bemoan their tragic circumstances, the young couple decided to make a blog called Avery’s Bucket List, in which Mr Canahuati writes in his daughter’s voice and chronicles everything she’s done on her so-called bucket list. Scroll down for video and bucket list . Bucket list: Little Avery Canahuati was diagnosed with Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy on Good Friday and given only 18 months to live . Avery's list: The child's father Mike has been keeping a lengthy list of all the things Avery wants to do before she dies - including eating junk food, left, and wearing a big bow, right . Happier days: Avery was born on November 11, 2011, one of many 11-11-11 babies; she's pictured with proud parents Laura and Mike . The blog, written in Avery’s voice, contains milestones that most every American child will pass in the time they’re growing up – including meeting Santa, . Avery’s blog has become something of an internet sensation – the website alone has garnered more than half a million page views, and her Facebook page has more than 12,000 ‘likes.’ Avery ‘wrote’ on her blog: ‘I have a lot of living to do in just a little bit of time and I’m going to need all of the help I can get from my parents and anyone else who wants to help. ‘Keep in mind in everything I do, the two most important things are that I’m spending time with my mommy & daddy, while at the same time spreading awareness for SMA.’ Four-legged friend: Some of the readers of Avery's Bucket List suggested the smiling girl play with a newborn puppy . Nearly there: One of Avery's things to do includes meeting Santa. With this outfit, she's on the right track . Fun with mom: Another reader suggested sliding down a slide; in another, Avery is pictured with a plush giraffe stuffed toy . The initial bucket list includes several childhood milestones, such as going swimming, going on a road trip, sit on daddy’s shoulders, have a birthday party, and stay up past my bedtime watching TV with mommy and daddy. One of goals on the list was a little more salacious: Get a tattoo. The cheery blog has struck a chord with parents across the world. Mrs Canahuati told Good Morning America that’s when the couple knew they had a powerful platform on which to speak. The mother said: ‘When we saw how many people it was reaching in a few days, that’s when we realised we could really get the word out on SMA and spread the word as much as we could.’ The disease is the number one killer of U.S. children under two, she said, though the disease is largely unknown. She urged possible parents to get tested for the genetic disease before conceiving. ‘Our goal for Avery is to be the face of SMA,’ she said.

A gangster made a rap video vowing to avenge his brother's murder hours before an innocent man was gunned down outside a takeaway after being mistaken for a rival linked to the bloody feud, a court heard. Members of the South Kilburn Gang also known as ‘Family About Cash’ recorded the rap in which Kervin Kavuala pointed to a tattoo of his dead brother Tyno Kavuala while another member sang ‘This all started when my brother died...it won’t end till I see another homicide’, a jury was told. Later that same day, a rival from the Kensal Green Gang - blamed for Tyno Kavuala’s murder - was spotted in a KFC on the Harrow Road in west London and Kervin Kavuala was tipped off, it is alleged. Pose: Kervin Kavuala vowed to avenge his brother's murder in a rap video posted on YouTube just hours before he is accused of shooting electrician Daniel Smith, the court heard . 'Revenge': A court heard that just hours after this video of Kevin Kavuala was uploaded he and two others were told a rival gang member linked to his brother's murder had been spotted in a nearby KFC . Vow: Jury shown video of Kevin Kavuala pointing to a tattoo of his dead brother Tyno while another member sang 'This all started when my brother died...it won't end till I see another homicide'. But the killers mistook electrician . Daniel Smith, 22, for their . intended target, the court was told. He was  shot dead as he left the . restaurant after returning home from a first date. He staggered back inside, but collapsed and died despite efforts by air ambulance doctors to save his life. Prosecutor Richard Whittam QC told the . jury: ‘This case involves the murder of an innocent man committed . against a background of gangs. Murdered: Daniel, 22, was shot dead at just after midnight on Saturday 22 May, 2010 outside the KFC on Harrow Road, Paddington . ‘He was no part of that. What had been . and should have remained a pleasant evening for Daniel Smith and those . who knew him ended in tragedy. ‘After taking a young woman out for . the first time, and resisting the temptation to stay with her a little . while longer because he had to work the following day, he decided to go . home. ‘On the way home he decided to go to . the KFC to get some chicken. 'He spoke to his sister on the phone both . before and whilst he was at the KFC. That was the last time she spoke to . him. ‘He was murdered because he was a . victim of mistaken identity. 'The murder was intended to be a revenge . killing for a previous murder - the murder of Tyno Kavuala, Kervin . Kavuala’s brother in 2007. ‘His life was taken all too easily. He . was shot barely a quarter of an hour after a phone call was made from . the area of the KFC and the man for whom he was mistaken had entered the . shop. ‘In that short time a loaded forearm was obtained and taken to outside the KFC where it was used to kill him.’ The Old Bailey jury was told in 2007 . crack and heroin dealer Tyno Kavuala, known as Tank, was shot dead as he . sat in his car allegedly by rivals from the Mozart/Kensal Green gang. No-one has been charged with the murder. In May 2010 his brother Kavuala, 27, . Zeleke Forde, 30, and Jonathan Yeboah, 25, - who had recorded the rap . video entitled ‘Cowboy Freestyle’ uploaded onto YouTube – were tipped . off that rival Stacey Theophane, who was linked to the murder, was . inside the KFC, it was claimed. Investigation: Police probing the murder of electrician Daniel Smith issued these CCTV images showing three men seen in the area just moments before the killing . Tears: The weeping mother of Daniel Smith, Winnie broke down as she appealed for help to catch her son's killers . Kavaula is said to have told Yeboah to get him a gun. Police do not know who pulled the trigger but all three men are charged because they are said to be connected by phone calls. Kavuala’s fingerprint was also found on the outside of Mr Smith’s car. Kavuala, Forde and Lewis deny murder. Yeboah denies trying to get a gun to use in a murder or to endanger life. Whittam QC told the jury the . prosecution could not say who shot Mr Smith but said all three were . guilty of murder because they had acted together by tipping each other . off. He said: ‘Kervin Kavuala would not . have know of the presence of Stacey Theophane in the KFC had it not been . for the action of Shane Lewis and Zeleke Forde. ‘They made the calls in the clear . knowledge that there was a real risk that, in the context of this case, .

A jobless woman who boasted of spending thousands of pounds of her benefits on a life of luxury - including £4,500 on breast enlargement surgery - has been jailed for persistent shoplifting. Kelly Fannin had managed to escape jail three times in five years for a series of previous thefts but has now been imprisoned for 16 weeks. She admitted a spate of shoplifting in Truro and Falmouth in Cornwall which netted her nearly £3,000 of goods. Jailed: Kelly Fannin had managed to escape jail three times in five years for a series of previous thefts but has now been imprisoned for 16 weeks. Fannin  - a mother-of-five by four different fathers - blamed her children for the latest offence, saying they had damaged their rented home and she was struggling to pay the cost of the repairs and the rent. Fannin became notorious in October 2010 when she boasted that she splurged much of her £29,000-a-year benefits on luxury items, running up £10,000 debts on credit cards. She told Closer magazine, using the name Kelly Marshall: ‘Some people might think I'm a scrounger but I don't think me or my children should miss out on nice things just because I have never worked. ‘I've wanted a boob job since I was a teen but it wasn't until I had the five kids that I could afford it with the extra benefits I get. 'I really do want to have liposuction, a tummy tuck and Botox and the kids agree Mummy should have the best. ‘All mums should be able to have cosmetic surgery. I don't care that it's at taxpayers' expense.’ In the last five years the 34-year-old had been given two suspended jail terms and a curfew. She is well known to store staff and detectives and has been caught on CCTV de-tagging items before leaving shops without paying. Shameless: Kelly Fannin, who gave a notorious interview under the alias Kelly Marshall, boasted about how her benefits were used to fund a luxury lifestyle and her expensive taste in clothes . She carried out some of the offences with another adult - and others with some of her children in tow. The children aged between four and 18 are now being looked after by another member of the wider family. Fannin . appeared at Truro Magistrates Court where she admitted stealing shaver . equipment and an electric toothbrush worth £640 from Boots in Truro and . cosmetics worth £150 from the same store in Falmouth. She asked for four other offences including stealing perfume worth £1,200 to be taken into consideration. Sergeant Gary Watts, of Devon and Cornwall police, welcomed the jail term and hoped it would serve as a deterrent to others. He . said: ‘We have to ensure persistent offenders are brought to justice . and it is good the courts have taken justice and the impact on the . community into consideration. ‘She . is well known to us and at particular times of the year can be one of . our worst offenders. Shoplifting should never be a lifestyle choice and . this is a warning to others who choose to do it.’ Her . lawyer Jeremy Leaning told the court that she was struggling to make . rent payments and pay money for repairs to the family home in Falmouth, . Cornwall. He argued before that her children would suffer if she was jailed but she was told that had been her 'last chance'. A judge previously told her that she was a 'near professional shoplifter' and said she had been 'perilously close to prison'.","Kelly Fannin admitted stealing cosmetics products worth nearly £3,000 to pay for damage done by her children to their rented home .

A former Marine who murdered his neighbour was twice turned away by police after handing himself in and confessing to the crime, a court heard. Killer Thomas Puxty had to demand an interview after officers refused to believe him when walked into a police station to admit to brutally torturing and murdering his neighbour five years earlier, it was said. Last year, Puxty, 31, was sentenced to life, with a minimum of 28 years, for the savage killing of Lee Clement at his home in Woolwich, south London, in March 2006. However, the details of his confession have only just been heard during an appeal to reduce his sentence. Appeal: Killer Thomas Puxty, left, had his sentence for murdering neighbour Lee Clement, right, cut by two years because he had 'solved his own crime' The judge ruled that his sentence should be cut by two years after hearing Puxty had ‘put himself behind bars'. Kerim Fuad QC, defending, told the court: ‘The police thought he (Puxty) was wasting their time. ‘He was allowed to smoke outside for an hour or two before coming back inside but was sent away twice. ‘He could have walked away. ‘It was his sheer persistence in demanding an interview which led to him taking the police down to where he had buried Mr Clement some years earlier.’ Lord Justice Elias told the court that Puxty had ‘fallen into alcoholism’ because of his guilt. The judge said: ‘The confession suggests an acceptance by the appellant of what he has done. ‘It demonstrates a wish to come to terms with his own conscience and to be willing to pay the price that society requires. ‘There is no doubt at all that the confession in this case resulted in a conviction which never otherwise would have happened. Confession: Killer Thomas Puxty walked into Plumstead Police Station, pictured, to demand officers arrest him for the brutal murder of his neighbour . ‘Only the defendant knew the deceased was dead, only the defendant knew he had been killed and only the defendant knew where he was buried.’, . Puxty had targeted Mr Clement after finding out he had £93,000 in his bank account. After tying the dad-of-three up Puxty then used a ‘pressure point technique’ he learned in the Marines to kill him before dumping his body in woodland in Kent. The 31-year-old former Royal Marine then went on a spending spree, spending more than £50,000 on motorbikes, TVs and flash watches, before becoming ‘overcome with guilt’ and handing himself into Plumstead Police station in March 2010. The killer, who admitted manslaughter claiming he didn’t mean to kill his victim, then took police to a remote spot in woods near Ashford, Kent, where he had buried his 60-year-old victim’s body in a shallow grave. He was jailed for life at Kingston Crown Court in December last year after being found guilty of murdering dad-of-three Mr Clements - who had never been reported missing - and told he would serve a minimum of 28 years behind bars. When contacted by MailOnline, the Metropolitan Police were unable to comment on the latest details to emerge about Puxty's arrest. But in a statement from the Met released after Puxty was found guilty of murder in December last year it made no reference to Puxty being turned away from Plumstead police station. It stated: ‘In March 2010 following his release from prison on other matters, Puxty attended Plumstead police station and confessed to killing Lee. ’Following his arrest, the investigation was referred to the Homicide and Serious Crime Command and a murder investigation was launched. ‘Detailed and extensive enquiries revealed that following the disposal of the body, Puxty withdrew money from Lee’s bank account, taking approximately £50,000 over a three month period in order to fuel his drugs and alcohol addiction, as well his liking for luxury goods and motorbikes.’","Killer Thomas Puxty has sentence cut when Appeal Court judge hears how he 'effectively solved his own crime'

Suri's adventures with her daddy hit new heights today as Tom whisked her off on a helicopter ride. The six-year-old - who reunited with her action hero father yesterday for the first time since his split from Katie Holmes - looked a little sleepy as the pair ventured out this morning in New York. They were pictured leaving the Greenwich Hotel before making their way to Chelsea Piers to board the aircraft. Up, up and away: Suri Cruise was taken on a helicopter ride by her father Tom Cruise today in New York . Doting daddy: The actor is making the most of his time with Suri after . being away from her for the past few weeks while filming his movie . Oblivion . Suri was wearing her favourite orange dress, which she has been sporting for the past three days. She was also carrying a cuddly toy and . a doll, while Tom - who was once again carrying his daughter, wrapped . her up in a pink blanket. Their outing came as Tom's lawyer Bert Field sent out an angry email to Life&Style magazine over it's cover story today saying Suri had been 'Abandoned by her dad'. Fields told TMZ: 'That, as anyone knows who saw their photos together yesterday and today, is a disgusting, vicious lie.' 'Until this week, Tom was shooting a film on location, but he spoke to Suri every day.' 'He's with Suri right now; and he was with her the day before Life & Style trumpeted their cruelly false accusation.  Tom dearly loves Suri and the last thing he would ever do is abandoned her.' Yesterday marked the first time the . father and daughter had spent time together in recent weeks as he had . filming commitments with his new movie, Oblivion. Tom, 50, took Suri to her gymnastics class yesterday, before heading back to his hotel with her.

Won't put her down: Tom carried Suri in his arms as he left their hotel this morning, as he was the night before as he arrived back at the hotel after taking her to gymnastics class .

"By . Jack Doyle . CREATED: . 11:59 EST, 6 March 2012 . Legal high: Methoxetamine was linked to two deaths in Leicestershire at the weekend . A dangerous new ‘legal high’  drug is set to be banned within weeks after two people died after taking it. Home Office advisers are considering a ‘fast track’ ban on Methoxetamine – known as Mexxy or MXE – after a woman and man died last month. The powder, which is available on the internet for £17 a gram, is often sold as a ‘safe’ alternative to ketamine, a horse tranquilliser used as a party drug. Campaigner Maryon Stewart, whose daughter Hester, a medical student, died after taking a legal high called GBL before it was banned, said users should not assume MXE is safe. Mrs Stewart, who founded campaign group the Angelus Foundation, added: ‘What is so scary is it’s promoted as a safe substance, unlike ketamine. Party drug: Methoxetamine has been billed as a safe alternative to ketamine - although there is no evidence the claims are true . ‘But there is no evidence whatsoever . that this is safe. The chemists behind this are filling their pockets . while users are playing Russian roulette with their lives and . wellbeing.’ The Advisory Council on the Misuse of . Drugs can approve a temporary ban for 12 months, which would allow MXE . to be examined to see whether a  permanent ban is needed. Experts estimate more than 40 new . legal highs hit Britain last year, up from just 13 in 2008. Last month . the deaths of a woman, 59, and a man, 32, in Leicestershire were linked . to MXE. Home Office Minister Lord Henley said: . ‘We have become increasingly concerned at  the potential harms of . Methoxetamine, and continue to work with our drug experts on the ACMD to . decide on the best way to protect public health. ‘It is important for those considering . using these drugs  to understand that just because a substance is . legal, it does not mean it is safe.’ The Angelus Foundation petition for drugs education can be found here: http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/30280 . This article has been amended to remove the erroneous statement that the drug is used for feeding plants. Methoxetamine is just the latest legal high to appear on Britain's streets. Many of the concoctions are dangerous - but because the authorities know so little about them they can be taken without fear of prosecution. The number of legal highs on sale hit 40 last year, up from just 13 in 2008. Doctors believe that these drugs could lead to psychosis, liver damage and even death — warnings which are going unheeded by ­consumers, and the Government. As these drugs are legal, it means premium prices - and profits. For instance, a small packet of Blast Off - a herbal marijuana substitute - costs £30, more than four times the price of the same amount of marijuana. However, far from being a benign, risk-free way of taking drugs, the growing army of British users are risking their lives by ingesting potentially lethal ­cocktails of chemicals, often concocted by corrupt pharmacists working in China and India. The legal high Mephedrone - or meow meow - was banned in 2010 after being linked to a number of deaths. However, it was rapidly replaced by MDMA. Ivory Cove is another popular 'legal high' which is yet to be banned.","Methoxetamine 'not fit for human consumption'

Lawsuit: John Travolta, pictured with wife Kelly Preston, is facing accusations of inappropriate sexual behaviour towards a SECOND male massage therapist . John Travolta has proof that he wasn't in Los Angeles on the day he was accused of sexually harassing a male masseur, it has emerged . The Pulp Fiction actor, who has described the claim as 'baseless', was photographed in New York on January 16th - the day the incident is alleged to have taken place in LA. As well as being photographed in New York, TMZ.com has . also obtained a receipt from Mr Chow's restaurant in the city, proving . that Travolta dined in the eatery and paid a bill of $382.69 for the . meal, as well as a $100 tip. In a statement, a spokesman for the 58-year-old actor, who fully denies the initial sexual battery lawsuit, said: 'This lawsuit is a complete fiction . and fabrication. None of the events claimed in the suit ever occurred. 'The plaintiff, who refuses to give their name, knows that the suit is a . baseless lie. It is for that reason that the plaintiff hasn't been . identified with a name, even though it is required to do so. 'On . the date when plaintiff claims John met him, John was not in . California, and it can be proved that he was on the East Coast. Plaintiff's attorney has filed this suit to try and get his 15 minutes . of fame. John intends to get this case thrown out, and then he will sue . the attorney and Plaintiff for malicious prosecution.' The proof that Travolta was not in Los Angeles at the time of the alleged incident comes as a second male masseur came forward to accuse the actor of alleged sexual harassment, seeking $2million in damages. Happily married: Travolta with wife Kelly on . April 25th as they left Barbra Streisand's 70th birthday party and two . days before the first alleged incident on January 16th, they appeared at the . G'Day LA event . According to RadarOnline, . the second accuser claims to have 'substantial documentation and . numerous witnesses regarding the substance of Travolta's actions.' However, Travolta's lawyer Marty Singer has branded the accusation just 'as absurd and ridiculous as the first one'. Singer also revealed he will take legal action - not only . against the claimant, but also the claimant's lawyer - for malicious . prosecution. Denial: Travolta, on the set of his latest film Savages in LA last year, will fight the case, according to his lawyer . He told The . Hollywood Reporter: 'There is a heightened standard for a lawyer suing a . celebrity and knowing the media will pick it up. The lawyer can't just . rely on the client. He needs to do an investigation and has an . obligation to do due diligence.' Whispers about John Travolta’s sexuality have plagued his movie career almost from the outset. Various camp roles in films – most notably as a drag queen in the musical Hairspray – have helped fuel rumours he is secretly gay. But there have also been strongly denied accusations he has been living a double life strikingly at odds with his family man image. They include rumours that his 1991 marriage to Kelly Preston was arranged by the shadowy cult-like religion of Scientology, of which he is a leading disciple. Seven years later, the father-of-two Travolta was named as a homosexual in court papers by a former member of the Church. The case never got a hearing, however. And in 2001, Travolta faced unsubstantiated claims that he had tried to pick up a business executive in a health club. However, the rumour mill reached a crescendo in 2006, when the actor was seen apparently kissing a male friend as he prepared to board his own Boeing 707 jet in Canada. Travolta has always maintained he is not worried by rumours surrounding his sexuality, insisting 'I don't think anyone can hurt me.' According to the lawsuit, which was . filed on Tuesday morning in Federal Court in Los Angeles, the second victim . alleges that while working at an unspecified resort in Atlanta, Georgia . on January 28, 2012, he did an in-room massage on Travolta. According . to the documents, Travolta was staying on the 15th floor of the high-end resort, and he was referred to as Mr. White. The documents claim that the plaintiff 'doesn't . normally do in-room massages and asked a co-worker to take the . assignment, but he declined because Travolta has been banned from a spa . that the coworker used to work at in Los Angeles.' On the morning of the massage . Travolta is said to have had 'a strange demeanour, bloodshot eyes and climbed onto the . already setup massage table'. The lawsuit continues: 'Travolta removed the entire sheet from his . body, and he claimed the sheets were sticky and could not tolerate the . heat. Travolta further indicated that he likes a lot of ""Glutes"" work . meaning a massage on his buttocks.' The plaintiff also alleges that . Travolta began masturbating after attempting to get him to touch his . 'scrotum, upper thighs and buttocks'. In the first incident, Travolta allegedly claimed that he got his . first big movie break due to the sexual favours he performed while . starring in the 1975 TV series Welcome Back Kotter. The plaintiff, or accuser - who refuses to be named because his . lawyer claims he is frightened of the Hollywood powerhouse - alleges . that Mr Travolta picked him up in his black Lexus SUV after a anonymous phone . appointment was made instructing the masseur to wait in a specific spot . in a nearby street. 'Fiction' A spokesperson for Travolta has hit out at the claims, even claiming that Travolta was not in LA at the time - though he was pictured at a G'Day LA event with his wife two days earlier . Witness:The plaintiff recalls a chef cooking burgers present for the first half of the massage, which passed without incident . Serious allegations: Travolta is absolutely refuting that he was even in LA at the time of the alleged incident . During the journey, the man noticed condoms alongside chocolate cake wrappers littering the console of the vehicle, . After pulling up outside the Beverley . Hills Hotel, they are then said to have entered one of the business's . annexes opposite the main building, which are known as bungalows. They were then greeted by an . 'overweight' black man who was grilling hamburgers. This chef is then . said to have disappeared when Mr Travolta allegedly tried to have sex . with the male masseur. The masseur is seeking more than $2million in damages. Okorie Okorcha, the lawyer representing the first masseur told RadarOnline.com: 'My client is afraid of John Travolta. He added: 'Mr. Travolta made very explicit threats against my client, which are contained in the lawsuit. 'Specifically, John Travolta told my client that Hollywood is controlled by homosexual Jewish men who expect favors in return for sexual activity. 'Let's face it, John Travolta is an extremely powerful man, and my client absolutely felt threatened by Mr. Travolta. My client was sexually assaulted by Mr. Travolta and he needs to be held accountable for his actions.'","Actor's lawyer Marty Singer has branded the accusation just 'as absurd and ridiculous as the first one'

Colleagues of a respected judge who drowned in floodwater while trying to cross a ford in his car said today they were 'shocked and saddened' by his death. Jonathan Gammon, 52, was swept 200 yards downstream by fast flowing water with his wife and dog in their silver Toyota Yaris yesterday. The Mental Health Tribunal judge's 55-year-old wife, who was driving, managed to swim to safety following the incident at about 9.10am. Deadly: The ford at Headley, North Hampshire. The depth marker at the ford showed the water was six feet deep. Today Judge Phillip Sycamore, President of the First Tier Tribunal, Health, Education, Education and Social Care Chamber, paid tribute to his colleague. Judge Sycamore said: 'I'm greatly saddened and shocked by the tragic death of my colleague Jonathan Gammon. 'Jonathan, who had tremendous talent, . became a full time judge in 2009 having previously had a distinguished . career as both a barrister and a solicitor. Swept away: The couple were in their car attempting to cross this ford when the vehicle was swept away . 'He served as a legal advisor in the magistrates' courts and prior to becoming a full time judge, was Head of Performance and Analysis for Her Majesty's Court Service. 'He was a very well respected and popular colleague. Our thoughts are with his wife and family. Jonathan will be much missed.' Locals said they feared Judge Gammon, . from Teddington, west London, may have been directed to cross the 'notorious' waterway in Headley, Hampshire, by a sat-nav system. The incident happened following torrential rain on Sunday, with localised flooding prompting the Met Office to issue a severe weather warning in the region. Firefighters were called at 9.07am yesterday after reports that a couple and a dog were stuck in a car 5ft underwater. When they arrived at the ford, Judge Gammon's wife had managed to swim free but her husband and dog were still inside. Hampshire Fire and Rescue officers broke the car's window and pulled Judge Gammon free, but he was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. His wife was taken to Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital where she was treated for shock. The dog also died. Locals have labelled the ford 'one of the most notorious in the south of England'. Plumber Simon Hiscock, who was working near to the ford, rushed to the scene after seeing around a dozen emergency vehicles. The 48-year-old said the ford was well known and should be shut for winter. He said: 'Unfortunately, a lot of satellite navigation systems direct people along the road as a shortcut between Basingstoke and Thatcham. 'It may save people a couple of minutes but in this instance their choice of route has had tragic consequences.' Sergeant Paul Plews, of Hampshire police, said: 'Our thoughts are with his wife and family who are understandably very distressed by what has happened. 'Our investigation is focused on establishing the events leading up to Mr Gammon's death and we will be preparing a file for the coroner.' The man's death came on the day the .

MI6 spy Gareth Williams (above) confided to a friend that he was being followed in the days before his death . The MI6 spy found dead in a holdall feared he was the target of hostile surveillance in the days before he died, detectives have revealed. In a disclosure that further deepens the mystery surrounding the fate of GCHQ codebreaker Gareth Williams, it has emerged he confided in a friend that he was being followed. His naked and decomposing body was later found in the bath of his home in Pimlico, central London, in August 2010. The discovery sparked a painstaking investigation, worldwide media frenzy and several outlandish conspiracy theories. Elizabeth Guthrie, the daughter of a New York stockbroker, told Scotland Yard detectives early in their inquiries of Mr Williams' concerns, it was reported in The Sunday Times. She is due to give evidence at his inquest this week, which will attempt to unravel the circumstances that led to the brilliant mathematician's demise. Relatives of the 31-year-old will demand to find out if he was killed in a sinister cover-up by secret services. Police and security services are convinced his demise was linked to his personal life. But police sources have hinted that MI6 and GCHQ have been reluctant to reveal what Williams was working on at the time and whether it may have provoked a foreign intelligence service or crime syndicate to come after him. A coroner will hear from fellow agents, police and friends of Mr Williams this week a bid to solve the 21-month mystery. Family members fear 'some agency specialising in the dark arts' leaves them with no way of knowing how and why he died. Scotland Yard has drawn a blank in its bid to explain whether he died at the hands of a third party. Being tracked? Mr Williams is caught on CCTV in Holland Park on August 14, 2010, just over a week before his naked and decomposing body was found locked in a bag in his Pimlico flat . Suspicions: Mr Williams' body is taken out of his flat. Relatives believe a third party was either present when Gareth Williams died or broke into his home afterwards to destroy evidence . Relatives believe someone was either present when he died or broke into his home afterwards to destroy evidence. Coroner Fiona Wilcox, who has expressed frustration at police over a DNA 'error', is expected to hear from about 30 witnesses over at least five days. She says that whether Mr Williams was alive inside the bag and locked it himself 'was at the very heart of this inquiry'. Mr Williams, of Anglesey, North Wales, was found in a large North Face holdall, sealed by a padlock, at his top-floor flat in Alderney Street. Wanting answers: Mother Ellen (centre) and sister Ceri (right) at his funeral. They will be demanding to know at this week's inquest if he killed in a sinister cover-up . Mystery: Mr Williams was found dead locked inside a holdall in the bath of his flat (above). his family want to know why the alarm was not raised when he failed to turn up to work . Unsolved: Coroner Fiona Wilcox said that whether Mr Williams was alive inside the North Face bag like this one and locked it himself 'was at the very heart of this inquiry' A battery of post-mortem tests failed to determine how he died and police originally found it would have been impossible for him to have locked himself inside. Family lawyer Anthony O'Toole has said the inquest at Westminster Coroner's Court must establish why there was no evidence of another person in his London apartment. He told a pre-inquest review: 'The impression of the family is that the unknown third party was a member of some agency specialising in the dark arts of the secret services, or evidence has been removed post-mortem by experts in those dark arts.' Brilliant: Mr Williams, a mathematics prodigy and codes expert for GCHQ, had been on secondment with MI6 since March 2010 . The mathematics prodigy worked as a cipher and codes expert for GCHQ, the Government listening station, but had been on secondment with MI6 since March 2010. Mr O'Toole added: 'In our submission, to properly explore the circumstances of the death, we need to establish the deceased's work.' Relatives want to know why the alarm was not raised when Mr Williams initially failed to turn up to work. By the time officers arrived at his flat, his body was so decomposed that evidence had been lost. It emerged last month that two areas of investigation were red herrings. Forensic teams mistakenly flagged up a spot of DNA on Mr Williams's hand in 2010, before realising just six weeks ago that it matched a scientist on the crime scene. It also emerged that a Mediterranean couple police wanted to speak to were irrelevant to Mr Williams's death. Dr Wilcox has indicated she may want to see a practical demonstration of how Mr Williams might have got into the bag and locked it himself. Experts agree that locking the bag from the inside 'would have been very difficult, if not impossible', Metropolitan Police lawyer Vincent Williams said. The inquest will hear that Mr Williams may have died after breathing too much carbon dioxide. There were no signs of struggle on his body and blood tests have not shown any drugs in his system. Were secret agents specialising in the 'dark arts' responsible for Mr Williams's death in his Pimlico home? Is it physically possible that he was able to get inside a North Face holdall in his bathtub before padlocking himself in? Could a third party have been present when he died despite no trace of DNA or fingerprints? Why did police remove the front door to his flat if there were no signs of a break-in? Why was there no sign of struggle on his body? Could he have been drugged despite normal blood tests? What exactly did Mr Williams do for the GCHQ listening station - was he an active MI6 agent when he died? Why had he been placed on secondment in London? Why did it take colleagues eight days to realise he was missing? What happened to Mr Williams's possessions that he kept in a shared locker at the MI6 headquarters? Why have letters gone missing between the coroner and police in recent months? Has information been withheld because shedding light on Mr Williams's death could jeopardise secret security operations? Why did he fail to tell his employer that he was undertaking a series of part-time fashion courses at Central St Martins College? Why did it take forensic teams more than a year to realise a spot of DNA on Mr Williams's hand matched a scientist on the crime scene? 2001: Mr Williams joins GCHQ, the British national security agency responsible for intercepting and decoding signals intelligence. 2009: He is seconded from GCHQ to MI6, the UK's foreign intelligence service. 2010:August 11 - Mr Williams returns to Britain from a fly-drive holiday in the United States.

Five TSA workers are out of the job and another 38 have been suspended after they reportedly failed to conduct random security screenings on passengers and their luggage. The employees were all based out of Southwest Florida International Airport in Fort Myers, and have been replaced by agents from other locations. The affected workers were employed in different capacities at the airport, including supervisors and front-line security screeners, the News-Press reported. Scroll down for video . TSA trouble: The affected employees were all based out of Southwest Florida International Airport in Fort Myers, and have been replaced by agents from other locations . TSA spokesman David Castelveter told the paper that the move is one of the largest punishments handed out by the TSA since it was created in 2002. Mr Castelveter added that the internal probe spanning two months last year found that some 400 passengers who underwent routine screening at the airport never received extra random checks. Despite the findings, the TSA claims the nearly 4 million passengers who travelled to and from the airport last year were not put at risk. Republican Congressman John Mica, of Florida, the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, demanded answers from the TSA. Critic: Florida Rep John Mica, the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is demanding answers from the TSA . Rep Mica said in a statement to the News-Press: 'Whether TSA is trying to protect administrative bureaucrats from congressional and public scrutiny, or just trying to sweep this breach under the rug, TSA must come clean and provide a full accounting of this incident.' The news comes about a month after it was revealed that TSA agents and other U.S. law enforcement and Homeland Security personnel face an average of 55 daily encounters with 'known or suspected terrorists' named on government watchlists. The first: Underwear bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, is pictured in his 2009 mugshot after his failed Christmas Day bomb attempt . The figure - which equals more than 20,000 contacts per year - underscores the growing sweep of watchlists, which have expanded significantly since the failed Christmas Day 2009 'underwear' bombing attempt - and officials noted that very few of those daily contacts lead to arrests. Civil liberties groups question the use of watchlists, and they have been ridiculed for ensnaring innocent citizens. Rep Mica said the disciplined workers are the latest in a series of mishaps within the agency designed to protect air travellers. He said: 'Recent meltdowns such as those in New York, Newark, Palm Beach, Honolulu, Charlotte and Los Angeles have become familiar. 'For example, TSA recommended firing 36 employees in Honolulu for improperly screening luggage, and 12 others in Charlotte [North Carolina] for similar reasons. In Newark, a total of 10 workers were fired or suspended for theft or sleeping on the job.' The TSA has come under intense scrutiny for the pat-down and body scanner policy in recent years, especially in the age of YouTube. In March, a clip on the video-sharing site showed a terrified eight-year-old boy confined to a wheelchair, trembling with fear as he was subjected to an invasive TSA pat-down. Check: A suspect's name is put on the 'no fly' list if they are deemed by government experts to be a threat to aviation . That same month, a new mom was forced . to show security her freshly pumped breast milk before she could board a . plane with a breast pump. In February, a mother claimed she was . subjected to repeated body scans after being told by agency employees . that she 'had a cute figure'. These followed incidents last year, where TSA agents allegedly helped themselves to cake in a flier's bag, and confiscated another's cupcake. In December, Indiana rapper Freddie Gibbs was flying to a gig in Denver with two large bags of marijuana in his bag. Extra eyes: The TSA has come under scrutiny in the age of the internet over several incidents, some of which have been caught on tape and spread via sites like YouTube . But instead of confiscating it, the agent who inspected the bag instead left a note saying, 'C'mon son'. That same month, not one but two grandmothers came forward to say that they were mortified when they were ordered to be strip-searched during a security screening. A TSA agent was fired in October after New York writer and lawyer Jill Filipovic found a note in her luggage (which contained a vibrator) that said: 'Get your freak on girl'. In May 2011, a bizarre photograph showing a baby being frisked by airport security caused outrage after it was posted online.

A British holidaymaker suffered a fatal heart attack after climbing to the top of a famous Italian volcano. Thomas Maley, 64, was with his wife and a group of other holidaymakers when he collapsed after reaching the summit of Mount Vesuvius. Police and local tour guides rushed to help him and a paramedic crew was also dispatched. Dead: Thomas Maley, 64, suffered a fatal heart attack after climbing to the top of Mt Vesuvius, pictured . But despite battling for 35 minutes to save him, there was nothing they could do, and he was declared dead at the scene yesterday. The tragedy happened after the tour party had arrived at Mt Vesuvius following a coach journey from their hotel the La Badia at nearby Sorrento. Mr Maley, who was born in Sheffield, and his wife were due to return to England on Friday. The tragedy happened just days after an elderly British holidaymaker died in Gran Canaria after being overcome on a hike in warm temperatures. A police spokesman in Ercolano said: 'The victim was taken ill by the crater after arriving on a coach with other holidaymakers including his wife. It looks like he had a heart attack, the altitude could have something to do with it, as where it happened was around 1,200 metres. 'One of our patrols was already at the scene as their is a protest going on there at the moment by Vesuvius park staff so they also called for an ambulance and in total they spent 35 minutes trying to revive him but there was nothing that could be done for him.' Taken ill: The tragedy happened after the tour party had arrived at Mt Vesuvius following a coach journey from their hotel at nearby Sorrento, pictured . The spokesman added that as there were no suspicious circumstances the body had already been authorised for release and the British Consulate in Naples had not been informed. A receptionist at the La Badia hotel said: 'The party were here with Riviera Travel but they have gone out again. 'The poor gentleman was staying here with his wife. I really don't know anything else.' Mt Vesuvius erupted spectacularly in AD79 burying the city of Pompeii and the party had visited the museum and site there in the morning before heading off to visit the crater of the volcano which last erupted in 1944. The tour company's website advertises the eight day £699 trip with a picture of Mt Vesuvius and adds: 'Wherever you travel in the Bay of Naples, the skyline is dominated by the majestic and still active volcano Vesuvius, rising loftily to over 4000 ft. 'No doubt you will be aware, it has erupted in spectacular fashion several times in its history - the most famous, of course, being in 79AD when the Roman city of Pompeii, together with many of its inhabitants, were entombed and whose state of preservation today is little short of remarkable.' No-one from the tour party was available to comment. A spokesman from the Foreign & Commonwealth Office said: 'We can confirm the death of British National Thomas Maley in Italy on May 16. 'We are providing consular assistance to the family.' Earlier this week, Wendy Richardson, 78, collapsed with a suspected heart attack after walking in temperatures of more than 100f. Six other pensioners also suffered health problems on the guided tour on Gran Canaria. The Canary Island’s tourist board said the outing should never have taken place.","Thomas Maley, 64, was with his wife when he collapsed after reaching the summit of Mount Vesuvius .

The fully-clothed body of amateur footballer Luke Griffin was found by a dog walker in Newquay on Saturday morning . Two people have been arrested on suspicion of assault after the body of a 'charming' 20-year-old was washed up on a Cornish beach. The fully-clothed body of amateur footballer Luke Griffin, who had been on an end-of-season tour with his club, was found by a dog walker in Newquay on Saturday morning. It is believed he may have plunged over a nearby cliff in the notorious party town. Police said Luke, who was also known as Luke Harrisonn, was involved in an 'incident' earlier in the evening at a pay-and-display car park just above an access road for nearby Towan Beach. They have arrested two 41-year-old men from Bedford on suspicion of assault and today both men were bailed until September. Officers still don't know how Luke ended up in the sea and are appealing to anyone who may have seen him in the Crescent and Tram Tracks area of Newquay between 10.30pm and 11pm on Friday. Luke’s aunt, Debbie Harrison, paid tribute to her nephew on the social networking website Facebook after hearing the shock news. She said: 'We are all totally devastated. Why does it happen to the good guys? He is and always will be a legend. 'My handsome nephew. RIP hunny.' Luke's body was found by dog walkers on Newquay’s Great Western Beach on Saturday morning. Locals claimed Luke, from Stroud, Gloucestershire, who was on tour with Leonard Stanley AFC and 19 other club members, fell into the water from a cliff top. One nearby hotel worker, who did not want to be named, said: 'One of our staff walked past the private ambulance as it arrived. 'Somebody said this morning that a lad had fallen over the cliff.' A local restaurant worker, who also asked not to be named, added: 'The forensics were there for about 30 to 45 minutes then they took away the body. It’s such a tragedy.' A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman said today: 'Officers are keen to ascertain the male’s movements prior to him being found on the beach. 'He is described as a 20 year old white male with pale skin, of thin build with short black hair and was wearing a black polo shirt, blue denim jeans and white trainers. 'Officers are particularly interested if anyone saw this male around the Crescent and Tram Tracks area of Newquay between 10.30 and 11pm on Friday 1st June.' Speaking before yesterday’s arrests, the spokesman said: 'The family of the man have since been informed of his death. 'Our thoughts are clearly with his friends and family at this time. Great Western Beach in Newquay, Cornwall where Luke's body was found. Police said he had been earlier involved in an 'incident' in a car park in the resort . 'We have established that he was involved in an incident in the town earlier in the evening and are speaking to two individuals with regard to this incident. 'There are also a number of other lines of inquiry at this time and we would urge anyone with any further information that they feel may assist us.' Yesterday soccer club friend Ken Roberts said Luke was last seen talking to who girls in the Sailors Bar in the town. He said the trip to Newquay had been planned for some time and the group went down in a mini bus on Friday and were staying in a surfing lodge. Police said Luke was involved in an 'incident' earlier in the evening at a pay-and-display car park just above an access road for nearby Towan Beach (pictured) He said: 'When we got there some of the boys . went for a swim, but not Luke. We spent the day in Newquay and then got . together around 7.45pm to go on a pub crawl. We started in the Sailors . Bar and that’s where we left Luke. 'He was chatting up a couple of girls. He was a charmer. We all went different ways because six lads drove . down later on Friday. It was mostly the younger lads in our teams. We . then met up again at 10pm and Luke was not there. 'The next morning Luke was still not . back. One of our team is a teacher and got in touch with the police.

'I don’t think it had anything to do . with the girls he had been chatting up. We arrived at the resort in our Leonard Stanley football shirts but changed in the evening. I think Luke . was wearing blue trousers but I don't know what else. 'He was a very popular member of our . group.

Further tributes to builder and carpenter Luke on Facebook . included one from friend Charlotte Jones who said: 'What a waste. Can’t . believe this brilliant, charming, sweet kid was taken.' Newquay has become a mecca for students who descend on the town for alcohol-fuelled weekends away to celebrate the end of their GCSEs and A Levels. Officials have been battling to improve the town’s reputation following several deaths and near fatalities in recent years. In the summer of 2009 Andrew Curwell, 19, and Paddy Higgins, 16, fell to their deaths from cliffs in separate incidents whilst celebrating the end of their exams. The deaths led to the introduction of a security plan for the resort, including the confiscation of alcohol carried by under-age drinkers and police patrols on trains. Since then dozens of teenagers have been sent home after arriving drunk and an alcohol-free zone has been set up in the town centre. But in January this year the body of university graduate Oliver Doy, 26, was found on Newquay beach after he vanished during a night out in the town. He was last seen leaving Sailors nightclub in the early hours of Saturday January 7 after previously boasting on Facebook that he was planning 'six days of mayhem'.","Two 41-year-old men arrested on suspicion of assault and have been bailed .

Grave charges: Danny Coston, 36, is accused of gunning down 17-year-old Jessica Evans and killing her 22-year-old boyfriend last weekend . An Illinois man has been arrested and charged with murdering a young couple whose bodies were found days apart after the two went missing last weekend, according to police. Jessica Evans, 17, and her boyfriend, 22-year-old Jacob Wheeler, disappeared while on a camping and fishing trip near the Little Wabash River. On Monday afternoon, police found Evans dead in the bed of her boyfriend’s pickup truck, setting off a manhunt for Wheeler, who became a person of interest in the investigation. According to White County Sheriff Doug Maier, officials had a break in the investigation on Friday after coming across evidence of a second vehicle at the scene of the couple’s disappearance, according to the station KFVS. Pieces of a wrecked car were linked to 36-year-old Danny Coston, of Carmi, who confessed to killing the couple when questioned by police. Early Saturday morning, Maier has confirmed that the 22-year-old’s remains were discovered in a rural area of Wayne County based on information provided by the suspect. Coston has been preliminarily charged with two counts of first-degree murder. Tragedy: Evans, left, was found shot in the head three times in Wheeler's, right, pickup truck after the couple went missing while on a camping and fishing trip . Sheriff Maier called the crime a ‘random type situation’ that turned into a horrible event. Coston was apparently an acquaintance of Wheeler's father, but did not know the 22-year-old man or his girlfriend. ‘We hope this brings some closure to the families of Jessica and Jacob,’ said Sheriff Maier.  ‘Our thoughts are with them.’ Wheeler and Evans, a popular senior at Norris City-Omaha-Enfield High School, were reported missing Sunday after the 17-year-old girl failed to show up for work at 5am, according to the Evansville Courier & Press. Body found: Wheeler's remains were discovered early Saturday morning in a wooded area north of Interstate 64 . Sheriff Maier told The Southern that the couple had been ‘dating only a short time, just a matter of a few months.’ Wheeler, a U.S. Army veteran who had served in Iraq, was married but amicably separated from his wife, according to police. Norris City-Omaha-Enfield School Superintendent Cliff Karnes has described Evans as a ‘good kid’ who loved art. The 17-year-old was discovered with three gunshot wounds to the head in Wheeler’s truck on Monday. The vehicle had rolled down an embankment and over a large tree before coming to rest in a heavily wooded area. No weapon was found in the pickup or nearby, and the keys were missing. Link: Police said Coston knew Wheeler's father, but not the Iraq War veteran himself (pictured) or his girlfriend . The sheriff’s department and other law enforcement agencies launched a search by foot, all-terrain vehicles, horseback and air in an attempt to find Wheeler, but it was not until Coston’s arrest that his body was finally recovered north of Interstate 64. Authorities said they believe they know the motive behind the killings, but would not release the details just yet. Coston is being held on $3million in the White County Jail. Formal charges will be filed against him after the Labor Day weekend.","Danny Coston, 36, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder .

The onslaught which took place in 13 Iraqi . cities and towns appeared coordinated: The blasts all happened within . a few hours of each other and they struck mostly at security forces and . government officials - two of al-Qaida's favorite targets in Iraq. 'It was a thunderous explosion,' said Mohammed Munim, 35, who was working at an Interior Ministry office that issues government ID cards to residents in Baghdad's Shiite Sadr City neighborhood when a car exploded outside. Sixteen people were killed in the single attack. 'The only thing I remember was the smoke and fire, which was everywhere, said Munim from his bed in the emergency room at Sadr City hospital. He was hit by shrapnel in his neck and back. The worst attack happened in the town of Taji, about 12 miles north of the capital. Police said bombs planted around five houses in the Sunni town exploded an hour after dawn, killing 17. Officers who rushed to the scene to help were hit by a suicide bomber in the crowd, killing another 11. And in a brazen attack on Iraq's . military, three carloads of gunmen pulled up at an army base near the . northeast town of town of Udaim and started firing at forces.

A 400-pound black bear named Meatball has inspired his very own Twitter following, after he fearlessly broke into the same California home three times to snack on his namesake treat. But it was on his third visit to the same Los Angeles garage that he was captured and sent to the Lions Tigers & Bears Sanctuary in San Diego County, but not before he established himself as a bit of a social media guru. Using the pen name 'Glen Bearian', he often shares his thoughts and adventures with his audience, posting such pearls of wisdom as, 'I'm BBB = Big, Black & Beautiful!' The hilarious feed has amassed more than 28,000 followers, each eagerly awaiting whatever he thinks of next. 'Ummm, yes. Front desk? My jacuzzi seems to be malfunctioning. Someone left a lot of hair in it. Please have housekeeping up right away!' he shares. Mr Bearian is surely enjoying his stay at the sanctuary, but before long he'll be taken to his permanent home, the Wild Animal Sanctuary in Colorado. 'I hope this isnt one of those timeshare scams...Wanna move out to Colorado with me? I'll let you have the top bunk!' he joked. Still another Tweet goes as follows: 'After all these tranquilizer shots, they may need to drop me off at Celebrity Rehab...' But unlike the Bronx Zoo Cobra Tweeter, who is yet to be unmasked, there is no mystery who is behind Glen Bearian. Words of Wisdom: Meatball often muses on his day to day .

'He needs a place where he … can have all the food and facilities for him to have a happy life,'  Sarah Aujero, 29, told the Los Angeles Times. Aujero, who has proved an ambitious sort, has not only taken to Twitter to give voice to Meatball, but is hawking T-shirts and buttons on a webpage dedicated to the meandering bear. But it's her Twitter feed that had become her bread-and-butter. 'This . dude's my hero! ...Bear With Sweet Tooth Breaks Into Rocky Mountain . Chocolate Factory,'  Glen Bearian once Tweeted. 'Shake! Shake! Shake! Mmmm... shake'n bake =)' Of late, Meatball was taken to the rescue facility, Lions Tigers & Bears, in San Diego County. It is there that she'll reportedly stay before being ultimately taken to his permanent home, the Wild Animal Sanctuary in Colorado . Despite its success, the stunt, however, is lacking a bit in originality. A still-anonymous Tweeter humorously captivated the nation more than a year ago when he assumed the digital identity of a cobra who absconded from his captors at The Bronx Zoo.

Britain has blocked political asylum applications by two top Russian bankers amid suspicions the government wants to mend fences with strongman Vladimir Putin who returns to the Kremlin as president on Monday. The former head of the Bank of Moscow Andrei Borodin, 45, and his deputy Dmitry Akulinin, 46, both exiled in London, are being denied asylum status by the Home Office, say sources close to the men. The move is being seen in Russia as a significant shift by Britain coming as Putin begins a new stint in the Kremlin which could last 12 years. Russia's Prime Minister and President-elect Vladimir Putin (centre) is just days away from returning to the Kremlin . Borodin - who fled Moscow for London - faces at least four charges of theft and embezzlement in Moscow and the Russian authorities have formally asked for his extradition. The pair are accused of improperly loaning £285million to shell companies which then transferred the cash to holdings of Yelena Baturina, 48, Russia richest woman who is now also living in exile in London. They claim they were forced out of the bank for political reasons and blame outgoing president Dmitry Medvedev who next week will become prime minister in a job swap with Putin. The move is likely to be welcomed by the Kremlin which claims the case is purely about corruption. One Moscow newspaper said the Home Office rejection is a 'break with a tradition of providing refuge for Russian exiles'. Britain's relations with Russia have been in the deep freeze since 2006 with the death of Putin foe Alexander Litvinenko in London from radioactive poisoning. Dozens of exiles have been given asylum or permission to stay in Britain since Putin came to power in 2000. Borodin - who has a fortune of £500million - yesterday refused to comment citing advice by his lawyer.","Sources say Home Office is refusing to allow Andrei Borodin and Dmitry Akulinin political asylum .

Shatner in his heyday: Captain Kirk (right, with Leonard Nimoy) narrates NASA's mini-documentary about the Mars mission . Next week, one of the most daring missions in space will take place as Nasa pushes the final frontier with a trip to Mars. The Curiosity vehicle, which is the size of a car, will use a combination of parachutes, thrusters, and even a 'sky crane' to navigate its way through the thin Martian atmosphere and land in a crater. The mission will culminate in 'seven minutes of terror' as Curiosity relies on a complex series of instructions being executed perfectly. Despite the intellectual skills and clever technological tricks employed by Nasa, this may all sound a little quaint to Star Trek fans more used to galaxy-sprawling adventures in the 23rd century. So perhaps that is why Nasa asked William Shatner - aka Captain James T. Kirk - to narrate their documentary of those seven minutes. The Shatner presented video will be used at events around the country and shared on the web and social media. Also providing an alternative version of Shatner is Will Wheaton, who joined the Next Generation to play 'Wesley Crusher'. Each provided their own unique narration to the video, which Nasa hopes will make the videos more appealing to a wide range of audiences.

"Childrens' nanny says Jackson would hate media attention focusing on his precious children . Says Paris was the 'apple of her father's eye' and needs understanding . By . Amelia Proud . PUBLISHED: . 18:06 EST, 31 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 22:58 EST, 31 July 2012 . The new custody agreement for Michael Jackson’s children is expected to be signed off by superstar Diana Ross. Jackson named the 68-year-old legend as back up guardian to his three children in his will, after his mother Katherine. She had been the sole carer of Prince Michael, 15, Paris, 14 and 10-year-old Blanket but in the new agreement will share custody of the children with her grandson Tito Joe 'TJ' Jackson.' Close: Michael Jackson appointed Diana Ross as the back up guardian for his three children in the event of his death so she has to sign off custody arrangements . A source told RadarOnline: 'Diana has no qualms whatsoever about the new custody agreement, she only wants what is best for the children. Diana knows that the children are old enough to decide who they want to live with and she defers to what they want. 'While Diana hasn't been a big part of their lives because she lives on the East Coast, she is very fond of them.' Katherine was stripped of her guardianship last week with temporary custody going to TJ before they worked out a new arrangement. Sharing the load: TJ Jackson will share guardianship of his young cousins with his grandmother, and Ross is happy about that . Way back when: Michael and Diana were friends for years, and he trusted the doyenne of Motown - here they sing together on her TV special in '81 . The judge ordered both Diana and Prince Michael and Paris’ mother Debbie Rowe be informed. The paperwork is expected to be submitted this week for shared custody and the judge will have to sign off the proposed agreement before it becomes official. Meanwhile, Katherine’s attorney Perry Sanders says Prince Michael is happy with the new arrangement after discussing it with TJ. He told X17online: 'There's a close bond there and a definite sense of unity. Contrary to what people think, there was absolutely zero animosity between those two. I felt nothing but love in the room.' Rift: Jermaine, Janet and Randy Jackson are believed to have been . banned from the home shared by their mother and brother Michael's . children . Meanwhile, the childrens' former nanny, Grace Rwaramba told Radar that Michael would be horrified by his children being in the public eye so much, and asks that the public be fair to Paris Jackson and 'give her a chance to make and learn from her mistakes without demonizing her. 'She is a spirited, very expressive and dramatic young girl. The traits that made her the apple of her father's eye are the same traits that she must learn to control as she matures into adulthood.' Michael's children Prince, Paris and Blanket live with their grandmother Katherine Jackson in a gated community in suburban Calabasas that is more private than the family's longtime home in Encino, which is on a public street. During bizarre scenes Randy, Janet and Jermaine apparently burst into the home, demanding that the children come with . them. Police were called and ‘two male adults became violent’, according . to police officers. Need to be safe: Katherine and her grandchildren live at the home . The angry confrontation last Monday, caught on . security camera, included Janet Jackson confronting Paris and allegedly . calling her ‘a spoiled little bitch’. The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department is investigating the scuffle as a possible battery. TJ . Jackson had previously been helping his grandmother care for his cousins, to whom he is close. Confusion: Katherine Jackson is seen making a statement as she resurfaced last week after ten days without any contact with her grandchildren; her children Janet and Jermaine are stood behind her . Blocked: Jermaine and Janet are believed to have been blocked from the family home, along with brother Randy; Janet and Jermaine are seen arguing with Michael's children on surveillance footage . Katherine Jackson's attorney Perry Sanders J. said last week that TJ Jackson would take over day-to-day operations and staff oversight at the Calabasas home. The move will free Katherine Jackson to focus on the upbringing of the children, who range in ages from 10 to 15, Sanders said. Siblings Randy, Janet, Rebbie and Jermaine Jackson have signed a letter calling on the executors of Jackson's estate to resign. Randy Jackson has accused the executors, attorney John Branca and music executive John McClain, of trying to isolate Katherine Jackson from relatives who are critical of them. 'It is my fear and belief, that they are trying to take my mother's life,' Randy Jackson wrote last week. Randy Jackson has also claimed his brother's will is a fake, a claim the estate denies.","Childrens' nanny says Jackson would hate media attention focusing on his precious children .

Kylie, who was openly admitted to being a huge fan of the Material Girl, posed with designer Stella McCartney backstage ahead of the Hyde Park concert.

Also spotted in the 'golden circle' in front of the stage was George Michael, Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and U2 rocker Adam Clayton. The open-air concert was the latest date of Madonna's 87-date tour, which started in Israel in May. What an opening: Madonna kicked off the show in her tight black outfit to her new track Gang Bang . Action sequence: Madonna fights a villain in an action-packed skit . Still got it: The singer showed no sign of her 53 years in the full-on routines . The 53-year-old singer repeated her controversial performances that had been seen in other countries, including her gun-toting fight with a male dancer to the song Gang Bang.

Katherine Jackson and her nephew TJ Jackson will move to share guardianship of Michael Jackson's three children, Prince, Paris and Blanket, her lawyer said today. The pair met last night in the company of lawyers to hash out an agreement over the care of the siblings, aged 10 to 15. A judge granted Tito . Jackson's son TJ temporary guardianship on Wednesday, citing . concerns that Katherine was being prevented from fulfilling her role as guardian 'by a third party' following her days-long absence from the California home she shares with the children. Scroll down for video . She's back: Katherine Jackson is seeking joint guardianship of her late son's three children . The 82-year-old had been at a Tucson, Arizona spa since . July 15 with her daughter Rebbie and other relatives and had not spoken . to her grandchildren during that time. TJ Jackson and numerous others said that was unusual and when she did call, several days into her trip, she sounded 'strange.' While appointing TJ temporary guardian of the children, Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff said there were no indications . Mrs Jackson had done anything wrong, and he would likely re-instate her . as guardian upon her return. However, Katherine's lawyer, Perry Sanders, released a statement today indicating TJ and Mrs Jackson had reached an agreement to share guardianship of the children that could be presented to a judge next week. Sharing responsibilities: TJ Jackson, pictured on January 27, was appointed temporary guardian of Michael Jackson's three minor children during Katherine Jackson's absence . Before the judge: A court sketch shows TJ going before a judge this week to request temporary guardianship . A statement from Mr Sanders reads: 'Later this morning, TJ Jackson's attorney, Charles Shultz, will be filing a petition for TJ to be appointed permanent guardian of Michael Jackson's three children. 'The court ordered that this petition be filed pursuant to the temporary guardianship he granted TJ on Wednesday of this week. 'However, after a very productive meeting yesterday, first between Mrs. Jackson and me, and then joined by Prince Jackson, TJ Jackson and Mr. Shultz, it was agreed by all that it is in the best interest of Mrs. Jackson and the children to file a modified joint pleading at the beginning of next week.' Caught in the middle: (L-R) Blanket, ten, Paris, 14, and Prince Jackson, 15, are said to be behind the move of shared guardianship . Under the plan, responsibility for managing staff and . security at the home would shift to TJ Jackson. Katherine Jackson would keep . control of a family allowance worth tens of thousands of dollars a month, according to the lawyer. Mr Sanders said Michael Jackson's eldest son has told attorneys he approves of the arrangement, which will relieve the matriarch of some of the day-to-day stresses of managing a famous family. He continued: 'Mrs. Jackson is extremely pleased with the prospect of enjoying the pleasure of raising Michael's children without the day-to-day tedium of items such as managing the large staff that goes with such a high-profile family and focus her attention on being a grandmother and raising Michael's children,"" Sanders wrote in a statement. Speaking out: Katherine Jackson's lawyer, Perry Sanders, gave a press conference on Wednesday after the Michael Jackson family conservancy hearing in Los Angeles . Moving ahead: Sanders, released a statement today indicating TJ and Mrs Jackson had reached an agreement to share guardianship of the children that could be presented to a judge next week . 'She . is eager to simply enjoy her great relationship with these children, . while deeding over some of the stressors that go hand in hand with being . a guardian,' he wrote. Court filings: A document shows TJ's appointment was approved by a judge on Wednesday . Katherine's . lawyer said last night that she is doing fine despite family squabbling . that forced a judge to temporarily suspend her guardianship. Sanders Jr said: 'I am pleased to . report that she is fine and she laughed at the widely publicised report . that she had suffered a stroke.' The description of Jackson suffering a . stroke was included in a letter signed by five of her children calling . on executors of Michael Jackson's estate to step down. The letter was leaked last week and was an early sign of turmoil that was to come for the Jackson clan. Since late Saturday when a relative reported Katherine Jackson missing, speculation has swirled about her whereabouts, her health and why she hadn't called her grandchildren for nearly 10 days. Rival factions in the family released duelling statements on Twitter and family members tussled in the driveway of her home in an incident that remains under investigation. The Jackson family turmoil rumbled . yesterday, with Prince Jackson blasting family members for allegedly . refusing him contact with his grandmother during her Arizona stay. Caretaker: Katherine Jackson was a shoulder for Paris, left, and Blanket, right, to lean on during their father Michael Jackson's public memorial service in Los Angeles on July 7, 2009 . 'Although I am happy my grandma was . returned, after speaking with her I realized how misguided and how badly . she was lied to,' Prince, 15, wrote in a posting on his Twitter . account. 'I'm really angry and hurt.' Legend: Michael Jackson, pictured in May 2005, left a reported billion-dollar legacy to his children . Hours later the post was deleted, but re-emerged by late afternoon, with the eldest son of Michael Jackson wondering if his account had been hacked. The post was the first time Prince Jackson had publicly commented on his grandmother's absence. The judge overseeing the guardianship of Prince, his sister Paris, 14, and brother blanket, ten, meanwhile said today he wants an independent investigation into their well-being. Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff ordered an investigator to interview the three children independently and prepare a report that will be reviewed solely by him. The order does not spell out a reason for the investigation, but it is likely intended to give the judge another perspective on how Jackson's children are coping after a week of family turmoil that has included the absence of their grandmother amid a feud over the estate of the pop superstar. The court investigator was ordered to interview the children at school at a time to remain undisclosed. Watch video here . Watch More News Videos at ABC . 2012 Presidential Election .

Beaten his demons: Gareth Malone, pictured at the BAFTAs in London this week, says at school he was 'always on the verge of exploding into violence' Gareth Malone has revealed his regret that he never fought back against the bullies who tormented him at school. The mild-mannered star of BBC hit show The Choir was targeted with taunts that he was gay but said that although he was always on the edge of taking violent revenge he always suppressed the urge. Now, however, he is left wondering if that was the right decision. And he spoke of his disappointment that similar jibes followed him into the world of television. Bespectacled Malone, 36, a married father of one, grew up in Bournemouth. Talking about his days as a freckle-faced schoolboy he admitted that being bullied was ‘ghastly’. He added: ‘You have those moments where you don’t want to get up and go to school. ‘I was always on the edge of exploding into violence. I definitely have a temper – but I never did because I always somehow didn’t want to lose my dignity. ‘It never quite got to ‘‘I’m just going to lamp them’’, but looking back I kind of wish I had because it would have solved it. ‘I am not endorsing violence, but maybe it would have been better to just have a bit of a scrap in the playground.’ The bullies may well have had a lucky escape. No one who watched Malone propel the Military Wives to the number one spot last Christmas with Wherever You Are could doubt the steel within his slight build. He said the real key was to give people the tools to deal with the problem themselves, which for him was in music and the arts. He is married to Becky, an English teacher in an inner-city school, and they have a baby daughter, Esther. But Malone – who ten years ago was an out-of-work music graduate – has still suffered jokes about his sexuality. The star, who is on protein drinks to bulk up his muscles and goes to the gym, told Radio Times: ‘It was slightly disappointing, after leaving school and leaving all that behind me from the age of about 15 to 30, to come into television and discover ‘‘Oh right, everyone is just as juvenile as the kids at school were!’’ ‘I mean, I am fairly flamboyant and expressive, but I know plenty of gay people who are incredibly repressed and aren’t showy and don’t like Judy Garland, you know.’ However, he said he had now ‘exorcised his demons’. Expressive: Gareth Malone with members of the Military Wives choir, which he created himself . Malone, who taught music to underprivileged children before dreaming up the idea for The Choir, said it was difficult to get men to sing because they don’t want to make ‘idiots’ of themselves and generally believe singing is only acceptable at football or in the bath. He added that he had often heard it said that singing ‘is a bit gay’ or ‘makes you gay’ or ‘gay-ifies you’. The Military Wives choir – created by Malone – is made up of partners of service personnel who have been away at war. He is now filming another series of The Choir to air later this year and has also shot a pilot for a new show in America, where The Choir is being shown on BBC America.","BBC star says taunts at school almost pushed him to violence .

"By . Chris Hanlon . PUBLISHED: . 18:33 EST, 7 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:37 EST, 7 May 2012 . Even his famously gruff ­detective may not have put it quite so bluntly. Colin Dexter, the creator of Inspector Morse, has delivered what appears to be the death-knell for the show’s popular spin-off, Lewis, saying it will end soon as the character cannot go on ‘much longer’. He also criticised the first two series of the Oxford-based detective drama, which stars Kevin Whately, saying they were ‘ridiculously complex’. Death knell: Colin Dexter says the next series of Morse spin-off Lewis is likely to be the last as the show has become too complicated and has run its course . The 81-year-old novelist works on Lewis as a consultant ‘on all aspects of the production’. Around half a dozen different screenwriters have written episodes over the years. The drama was first broadcast on ITV1 in 2006. It follows on from the much-loved Inspector Morse series,  with Morse’s former sidekick, Robbie Lewis, becoming the main character. Dexter made his comments ahead of the sixth series of the successful drama, which will be broadcast later this month. He told Radio Times: ‘I don’t think he [Lewis] can go on much longer. They’ll probably do one more series. The first two were ridiculously complex.’ But he did concede: ‘They’ve got better.’ Classic drama: Morse was one of the most popular TV series in British history . Dexter’s first Morse novel was published in 1975, and in 1987 ITV began adapting the books for the hit drama, starring the late John Thaw as Chief Inspector Morse with Whately as the then Sergeant Lewis. It ended in 2000 after 33 episodes. Its successor, Lewis, has become one of ITV1’s most consistent ­performers in recent years, often ­pulling in audiences of more than seven million. It also stars Laurence Fox as Detective Sergeant James Hathaway, Lewis’s sidekick. Earlier this year the Morse brand was extended further with a one-off prequel, Endeavour, which was a ratings success. Dexter said: ‘One reason Endeavour did well is because everyone could understand it. People said to me, “Brilliant. Typical Dexter”. Well, I didn’t write it. I wish I had. The agreement is they won’t put anything on telly without me seeing it. Sometimes we have to say it’s not up to scratch.’ Dexter, who gave up alcohol because of ‘over-consumption’, said he is often asked why he killed off Morse. He explained that the character’s death would have been inevitable because of his unhealthy lifestyle and famous fondness for whisky. Partners in solving crime: Inspector Morse and his partner Sergeant Lewis . The novelist added: ‘I was asked if I thought of an epitaph for him [Morse], and remembered “Under this sod lies another”.’ He told how everyone praised him, telling him what a ‘clever chap’ he was, when really he had taken the quote from Spike Milligan. Whately has also recently hinted that the drama might not last much longer. ‘I’m now police retirement age this year, so the time is coming quite soon, I think,’ he said. Around 13million viewers tuned in to watch the last episode of Morse in 2000, and there was a huge outpouring of sadness for the detective’s demise. But Lewis fans can take some solace. Following its success earlier in the year, a full series of Endeavour, starring Shaun Evans as the young Morse, has now been commissioned. Evans won over critics and viewers alike with his portrayal of the young detective. Ratings for the one-off film, which was broadcast in January to mark the 25th anniversary of the very first episode of Morse, were 8.2million.","Colin Dexter predicts next series of Lewis will be last .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:19 EST, 27 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:37 EST, 27 July 2012 . A feud over the validity of Michael Jackson's will has escalated into open warfare with the late singer's brother Randy accusing estate executors of trying to kill their mother. Turmoil has roiled the Jackson family very publicly since the days-long 'disappearance' of Katherine Jackson, whose guardianship of Michael's three children was temporarily assigned to her nephew after a judge determined she was prevented from fulfilling her duties 'by a third party'. But Randy claims the whole charade is all a guise by John Branca, John McClain and their attorney, Howard Weitzman, to manipulate and control the family after allegedly falsifying Jackson's will. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Randy Jackson, pictured in February 2010, has accused Michael Jackson's estate executors of forging his late brother's will and manipulating his family members for their own gain . The public battle was revealed early . Sunday after a relative reported 82-year-old Katherine Jackson missing, . but she was later located safely with other family members in Arizona. Jermaine Jackson has said his mother . was following doctor's orders to cut off communications with the . children, who range in age from 10 to 15. He didn't provide further . details. Now, in a numbered statement posted to . his verified Twitter account on Friday afternoon, Randy has voiced his . disapproval for guardianship of Prince, 15, Paris, 14, and Blanket, ten, . to be placed in the care of TJ Jackson, son of his brother, Tito. Randy explained: 'When TJ asked my mother if he should ask for temporary guardianship, my Mother told TJ NO – twice.' Explosive: An tweet posted on Randy's verified Twitter account on Friday afternoon outlines his disputes with family members and third parties . In control: Executors John McClain, not pictured, John Branca, back left, and their attorney Howard Weitzman, front left and far right, have strenuously denied allegations Jackson's will is a fake . The singer then continued with allegations directed at the executors of his late brother's estate. 'It is clear that anyone who stands up . against the Executors of the Estate - John Branca, John McClain and . their attorney Howard Weitzman - is denied access to my mother. 'It is my fear and belief, that they are trying to take my mother’s life,' he wrote. Randy's claims came as Katherine . Jackson's lawyer on Friday confirmed she would move to share . guardianship of her minor grandchildren with TJ Jackson, two days after . he was granted temporary guardianship. Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff . said there were no indications Mrs Jackson had done anything wrong but . seemed to have been prevented from fulfilling her duties 'by a third . party'. Under fire: Randy also slammed TJ Jackson for seeking guardianship over Michael Jackson's three minor children . Sharing responsibilities: TJ Jackson, pictured on January 27, was appointed temporary guardian of Prince, Paris and Blanket during Katherine Jackson's sudden absence this week . Rival factions in the family have . released duelling statements on Twitter and family members tussled in . the driveway of her home in an incident that remains under . investigation. Referencing the latter incident, Randy . continued: 'The Estate denied Rebbie, Janet and Jermaine access to the . house when they returned to home to Calabasas with a letter written by . Howard Weitzman, attorney for the Estate, who is not a resident of the . home. He continued: 'The Estate is trying to . isolate my Mother from her family JUST LIKE THEY DID TO MICHAEL, in . order to propagate their lies, financial agendas and to protect a . fraudulent will. 'The same people that are trying to manipulate my mother are the same people that were involved with my brother when he died. Caught in the middle: (L-R) Blanket, ten, Paris, 14, and Prince Jackson, 15, are said to be behind the move of shared guardianship . 'In order to obtain temporary . guardianship, TJ lied to the court. Rebbie, Janet, Jermaine and I would . never harm our mother and we are doing our best to protect her and the . Estate knows that. I want to know why Perry Sanders would consider a . negotiation based on lies.' Randy Jackson appeared Tuesday on Al . Sharpton's MSNBC show PoliticsNation and said he believes his brother's . will is a fake and that the executors have engaged in criminal activity. The estate, which recently reported it . saw $475million in gross earnings since Jackson's death in June 2009, . has denied wrongdoing and called the accusations 'false and defamatory'. Superior Court Judge Mitchell . Beckloff, who also oversees financial issues affecting Jackson's estate, . was initially reluctant to appoint a temporary guardian but changed his . mind after hearing from several attorneys who expressed concern about . the family's problems. Bizarre: Katherine was surrounded by  Janet, Jermaine, Rebbie and Rebbie's daughter, along with the marketing manager for the Tuscon resort . where was staying, to quell rumours she was held against her will . Emotional: Mrs Jackson read a statement claiming she was 'devastated' to lose custody and said she had been . on a 'short vacation' - but today confirmed through a lawyer she will . seek joint guardianship with TJ . He made the ruling after hearing TJ . Jackson's description of a 'strange' conversation he had with Katherine . Jackson on Tuesday evening. Legend: Michael Jackson, pictured in May 2005, left a reported billion-dollar legacy to his children . 'I've never heard my grandmother talk like that,' he said reluctantly. 'In every way. The sound in her voice. The pauses.' He said some of her speech sounded slurred and she used words that made him wonder if she was speaking in code. In her statement to ABC News, . Katherine Jackson said she didn't want any calls during her vacation and . thought she had made appropriate arrangements for her grandchildren. In a bizarre showing of unity, seated . with children Randy, Janet and Rebbie, Rebbie's daughter and the . marketing manager of the resort in which she stayed, Mrs Jackson read a . written statement and denied being held against her will. The latest feud between the Jacksons is said to have been stemmed from a dispute over Michael Jackson's $500million will. Jackson died in June 2009 at age 50 and left his estate to care for his mother and three children. He left nothing to his father or siblings, who have repeatedly tried to intervene in the estate. Several have expressed doubts about the validity of his will, although the courts have rejected this. And now it has been revealed that Randy . 'pressured' his sister Janet to join others family members in an attempt . to eradicate the executors of Michael's will. Several people were shocked to learn that Janet had signed a letter sent to the executors of the Thriller singer's estate demanding their resignation, as she had been against the motion. But now it has been reported that Randy who Janet is close to 'wore' the songstress down as he believed her signature on the letter would give it more ground due to her fame. A source close to the family told RadarOnline: 'The public has seen a very different side of Janet this past week, and she has to be regretting following Randy's advice. Janet is very much like Katherine in that she likes to keep a low profile, and not have family drama play out in the press'. La Toya Jackson has meanwhile been noticeably absent from the public family squabbling. According to TMZ, the singer has urged her siblings to suspend their attacks and 'stop making a public spectacle of themselves' in effort not to damage the family name. Watch video here .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:43 EST, 28 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:07 EST, 29 August 2012 . An Alaska couple pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to kill a federal judge in what prosecutors said was a revenge plot over income-tax rulings against them. Lonnie and Karen Vernon, followers of jailed Alaska militia leader Schaeffer Cox, reached a deal with prosecutors to avoid the need for a trial that had been set to begin next month. The Vernons and Cox were active in the 'sovereign citizen' movement, whose adherents believe individuals are sovereign nations and federal, state and local laws do not apply to them. Lonnie and Karen Vernon, pictured at a previous trial,  pleaded guilty to charges of . conspiring to kill a federal judge . The Vernons each entered a guilty plea to a single count of conspiracy to commit murder for their plan to kill Alaska-based U.S. District Judge Ralph Beistline, who presided over a federal income tax case that ultimately cost the couple their home. The Vernons also admitted in their plea agreement to planning to kill an Internal Revenue Service official and Beistline's daughter and grandchildren. The Vernons bought a silencer-equipped pistol and grenades in March 2011 and told the seller of the weapons about their intentions, according to the plea agreement. The Vernons entered guilty pleas to . charges of conspiracy to commit murder for their plan to kill . Alaska-based U.S. District Judge Ralph Beistline (pictured) But the seller turned out to be a confidential government informant, and the Vernons were arrested immediately after the transaction took place. Despite entering his guilty plea, Lonnie Vernon disrupted Monday's court proceedings with a number of defiant outbursts. 'If I'm accused of doing anything, I'm accused of freely exercising my First Amendment rights to the max,' he told Judge Robert Bryan, who was brought in from Tacoma, Washington, to preside over the case. But Bryan told the defendant that he and others with similar political views are mistaken about their responsibilities to obey the law. 'You can't decide, on your own, that you won't be part of what the government rules are,' Bryan said. In exchange for the guilty pleas, prosecutors agreed to drop related charges concerning murder threats and illegal weapons, according to the agreement filed on Monday. The group aimed to acquire a frightening array of military grade weaponry (not pictured) Under the plea deal, Lonnie Vernon, 56, faces a prison term of 21 to 27 years when the couple is sentenced on November 14. Agreement on a specific sentence for Karen Vernon, 66, was not reached, but prosecutors pledged to recommend a sentence of no longer than 15 years and eight months. Lonnie Vernon also was a top officer in an organization called the Alaska Peacekeepers Militia, founded and led by Cox, 28. In a separate case, Cox and Lonnie Vernon were convicted in June of conspiring to murder federal and state government officials and of acquiring illegal weapons to use against their targets. Karen Vernon was not a defendant in that case. Sentencing for Cox and Lonnie Vernon on the militia-conspiracy case is set for September 14. Both men, along with Karen Vernon, have been jailed since they were arrested last year.","Lonnie and Karen Vernon plotted to kill Alaska-based U.S. District Judge Ralph Beistline .

Opening up: Paris Jackson took to Twitter again this morning to share her latest feelings and posted a cheery-looking picture of herself . Paris Jackson turned to Twitter again early this morning to share her latest feelings amid her family crisis. The 14-year-old, who has used to . social networking site to express her worries and anger in recent days, . today appeared to seek solace in her late father's lyrics. Paris, who says she has been cut off . from her grandmother Katherine for more than a week, tweeted some words . from Michael Jackson's 1993 song Will You Be There. Posting a cheery-looking picture of herself, she wrote: 'everyones taking control of me, it seems that the worlds got a role for . me .. im so confused will u show to me you'll be there for me.' The lyrics appear to sum up how vulnerable Paris is feeling - although she did look happier in a snap she posted shortly afterwards. Her latest tweet came just hours before her cousin TJ Jackson, 34, was awarded temporary guardianship of her, along with her siblings Prince, 15, and Blanket, 10. The order was made by a judge in LA today - just as Randy Jackson claimed Katherine is on her way back to California. Randy told Good Morning America in a . phone interview that his mother is returning from Arizona - and insisted . she had gone there on her doctor's orders and is now in 'much better . health'. Paris made no mention of her grandmother's expected return today. But last night she did post an . apologetic message following a series of angry tweets concerning reports . of her grandmother's well-being. Paris fumed on the micro-blogging website about being blocked from speaking to her legal guardian, Michael's mother, Katherine. Seeking solace: The teenager quoted lyrics from her father Michael Jackson's 1993 Will You Be There . TJ's in, Katherine's out: Katherine Jackson has . had her guardianship of her three grandchildren suspended while their . cousin TJ has been awarded temporary custody . But after a flurry of posts - . including threats to the person responsible for the matriarch's sudden . departure from their shared Los Angeles home - Paris had seemingly . calmed and took a more sombre tone last night. 'a lot of ppl have been saying that i ""changed"", she wrote. 'i wanna apologize for the attitude... there's just a lot going on... i promise: the ego = gone(:'. Paris earlier in the day promised to . 'make whoever did this pay' after not being able to contact her . grandmother Katherine for nine days. The teenager and her two brothers, .

Outspoken: The teenager took to Twitter again last night with this message that appeared to be directed at friends . Anger: Paris Jackson hadn't had any contact with . her grandmother Katherine for nine days as of Tuesday afternoon; Katherine is the guardian of . the teen and her brothers . But a dispute over their father's $500m will has sparked a family feud, with their grandmother caught in the middle. Katherine stayed at a spa in Arizona, . arranged by daughter Janet, after spending a few days with her daughter . Rebbie and other family members in the state. But she has not contacted Michael's . three children during this time, with her son Jermiane admitting in a . statement that she has been denied access to phones or computers to . ensure her 'well being'. After a series of increasingly . worried and angry tweets about the situation, Paris yesterday wrote: '9 days . and counting… so help me god i will make whoever did this pay.' Previously she had written: 'something is really off , this isn't like her at all .. i wanna talk . directly to my grandmother!!< 3.' Her . cousin TJ Jackson replied: 'I know it's completely unfair for them to . do this to you and your brothers. We will keep trying. I love you.' Katherine . was reported missing by nephew Trent Jackson over the weekend, sparking . a welfare check by the state's Pima County Sheriff's Department. She was found to be safe and well with her children. Family ties: Paris leaned on her grandmother, . Katherine, while her younger brother, Prince Michael II, holds a . doll in the image of his father during Michael Jackson's public memorial in Los Angeles in 2009 . On Monday, Michael's siblings responded . to rumours their mother Katherine was missing by publishing a . photograph of her playing cards. As . a result of the controversy the executors of Michael Jackson's estate . are drafting papers to apply for emergency guardianship of his three . children. TMZ reports they fear the siblings are in danger without their grandmother's supervision. In a further twist on Monday Jermaine, Randy and Janet Jackson were barred from their mother's .

Speaking out:  Paris said 'something is off' about the way in which Katherine Jackson 'disappeared' Call for help: Paris asked her 500,000-plus followers to call authorities if they saw Katherine Jackson before it was revealled the 82-year-old matriarch was in Arizona with daughter Rebbie . On Sunday night, a fretting Paris sent a . concerned tweet about her 'missing' grandmother , saying the matriarch . had not been in contact in over a week.

However, a former nanny has defended the 14-year-old saying she is simply 'spirited and dramatic'.

'It breaks my . heart to think that Paris and her brothers could become the subject of . endless criticism for simply being kids. Michael loved his children very . much. 'He gave them tools that they will need to become good and decent . individuals. 'I am confident that in time, Paris and her brothers will . learn that their family loves and wants what's best for them.' Grace, who began working for the Thriller star in 1997, also stressed that having 700,000 followers on Twitter is unconventional for any teenager and people should grant Paris room to make mistakes. The social networking site provided a . canvas for Paris to ink her fury when Katherine went 'missing' and was . uncontactable for 10 days. It later transpired that the 82-year-old . was in fact at a spa in Tucson, Arizona. Grace . continued: 'Everyone knows that Michael went to great lengths to . protect his children... 'While the use of veils and masks was . unconventional, it only highlights how important this issue was to him.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 16:46 EST, 4 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:47 EST, 4 September 2012 . The U.S. Open tennis referee accused of beating her 80-year-old husband to death with a coffee mug is out on bail after paying the reduced $500,000 fine. The Los Angeles native Lois Ann Goodman, 70, was in New York at the time of her August 21 arrest because she was due to work at the famed tennis tournament, and she was released from the authorities on Sunday in lieu of bail. After granting her a bail reduction from $1million to $500,000, the Van Nuys, California superior court commissioner Mitchell Block ruled that she could be released to home confinement when electronic monitoring is set up. Day in court: U.S. Open referee Lois Ann Goodman pleaded not guilty on Wednesday in Los Angeles and won a bail reduction . 'Ailments': Lois Goodman, center, with her attorney, Allison Triessl, who claimed the 70-year-old tennis referee could not have murdered her husband as she has arthritis and needs a shoulder replacement . The commissioner cited her ties to the community and lack of criminal record in making that decision. Goodman entered a plea of not guilty and her daughter calls the allegations 'completely ridiculous'. Prosecutor Sharon Ranson paints a different pictures of Goodman, telling the judge that she went to get a manicure as her husband lay dying, according to the Los Angeles Times. In arguing for reduced bail, Treissl . argued that there was no chance Goodman would flee as she does not have a . passport and has strong ties to the San Fernando Valley where she was . born and raised. She . added that Goodman cooperated with the police investigation and . submitted to three interviews, even driving herself to the police . station when she was summoned. 'She arrived on time and was utterly forthcoming,' Triessl said. Given . Goodman's cooperation, she said the Los Angeles Police Department . should have waited to arrest her; they could have asked her to turn . herself in in California and she would have obliged. About two dozen supporters filled the courtroom. Goodman, . who has refereed matches between many tennis greats, was arrested last . week in New York just before she was to referee at the U.S. Open. Plea: She was extradited back to Los Angeles for her trial, but her lawyer has asked for her bail to be reduced . 'Victim': Her husband of nearly 50 years, Alan . (left), was found covered in blood next to a broken coffee mug. Lois . Goodman told cops she found him after coming home and believed he had . fallen . Her husband, 80-year-old Alan Goodman, died in April. Authorities initially believed he likely fell down stairs at home while she was away, but later decided it was murder. Goodman, who is well-known in . professional tennis circles, stands accused of murdering her husband, . Alan, at their condominium in Los Angeles, California, on April 17 by . smashing a coffee mug over his head and stabbing him to death with the . sharp, broken handle. The prosecution asserted Wednesday that the victim was struck 10 times on the head and there was evidence of Lois Goodman’s premeditation and no remorse. Defense attorney Alison Triessl has claimed her client was physically incapable of committing the crime, saying that she suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, . hearing loss and constant spinal pain that's controlled by an electronic . device implanted in her spine. She has also had two knee replacements, Triessl said. Triessl wrote in a previous filing that Goodman has many infirmities, including knee and shoulder replacements, and couldn't have bludgeoned her husband to death. She had also submitted 40 . testimonial letters from colleagues, neighbours, family and friends, . lauding Goodman as a beloved friend, mother and grandmother who treated . her husband like a king and was never violent. Questions: Goodman, right, features in a sketch in a Manhattan court last Friday before she was sent to L.A. The mother of three told authorities she had arrived home to find the blood-covered coffee mug and her husband lying in bed not breathing after apparently falling down the stairs. But after paramedics and investigators became suspicious of the man's grisly injuries - including deep wounds to his head - Goodman was arrested on a murder charge. She was arrested last week in New York, . where she was preparing for this week's U.S. Open - just one . of many high-profile tournaments she had worked since 1979. Claims have also emerged that she was . having an affair, after police found emails and handwritten letters to . another man during a search of the house. 'Lois minimised what she had seen,' Detective Jeffrey Briscoe of the Los Angeles Police Department said . of an interview four days after the death. 'Lois’ emotional reaction to . what she had seen and the loss of her husband was not typical of a . grieving spouse.' She . had told detectives that she arrived home and found a trail of blood leading . upstairs to a broken mug covered in blood. Arrest: Goodman was arrested for murder by NYPD last week while still wearing her U.S. Open uniform . She followed the blood to her . bedroom, where she found her husband not breathing, according to the . affidavit. She then called 911. Investigators . also deemed the large stain of blood near the stairs suggested he had . suffered an injury and stayed there for some time, court documents said. When . she was questioned again, Goodman said the body looked as if it had . been positioned by an intruder. Despite these conflicting accounts, . Goodman has protested her innocence. She . has refereed at the U.S. and Australian Opens for years and has umpired . with some of the world's top tennis players, including matches with . Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe and Martina Navratilova. In . a 1994 interview with the L.A. Times, she said: 'It's exciting. This is . my favorite sport and I'm out there rubbing shoulders with the best . players. There's no real way to describe it.'
