"Three students have been charged with beating a woman during hazing rituals for a university marching band just three weeks before a drummer was killed in similar circumstances. The assault by members of the Florida A&M University band was so severe that the victim's thigh bone was broken, police said today. Sean Hobson, 23, Aaron Golson, 19, and James Harris, 22, are accused of punching Bria Shante Hunter and attacking her with a ruler. Charged: Aaron Golson (left), James Harris (centre) and Sean Hobson are accused of beating a woman during hazing rituals for a university marching band . Tragic: Florida A&M University band member Robert Thompson (pictured) died last month after being subjected to a hazing ritual . Their actions were part of an . initiation ritual to 'welcome' the 18-year-old into the 'Red Dawg . Order', a band clique for students who come from Georgia. Tallahassee . police claim the assaults took place on October 31 and November 1 - . less than three weeks before drummer Robert Champion collapsed outside . an Orlando hotel and died. Investigators have linked his death to . hazing. Miss Hunter told . police that days later the pain became so unbearable that she went to . the hospital. Besides her broken thigh bone, she had suffered blood . clots in her legs. Hobson and Golson were yesterday charged with hazing and battery, and Harris was charged with hazing. Champion's death and the latest charges have exposed a hazing tradition that has long haunted the university. Former clarinet player Ivery Luckey was hospitalised after he said he was 'paddled' - or spanked around the buttocks - around 300 times in 1998. Three years later, band member Marcus Parker suffered kidney damage because of a beating with a paddle. After Mr Champion died, the university . indefinitely suspended performances by the famed Marching 100 and school . president James Ammons has vowed to break what he calls a 'code of . silence' on the hazing rituals. Probe: The charges are the latest hazing controversy to hit Florida A&M University's marching band (file picture) Unsafe: Band director Julian White was fired for being unable to stop the alleged hazing events. He has since been reinstated and placed on administrative leave after a request by police . All three arrested men were last night in jail. A university spokeswoman confirmed they were students. Police . claim that the hazing took place at Harris' off-campus apartment in . Tallahassee and that at one point he stopped Golson and Hobson from . hitting Miss Hunter further. Miss Hunter was targeted by the other members of the Red Dawg Order because she tried to get out of going to a group meeting, officers said in their arresting documents. She was repeatedly punched on the tops of her thighs by Golson and Hobson, according to information the police obtained from others who witnessed the incident. The second beating came when Hunter and other pledges could not recite information about the Red Dawg Order properly. It was during that one that a metal ruler was used on Miss Hunter's legs. Police say that Hobson sent Miss . Hunter a text message on November 5 that stated 'I apologise for the . hurt I put you through. I apologise for the mental and physical strain . you have endured.' Violence: Former bandmates and police recently told reporters that Mr Champion had walked through a line of band members who punched him before his death . When . interviewed later by police, Hobson acknowledged he was a member of the . Red Dawg Order but denied harming Miss Hunter or sending her a text . message. Harris also denied to police that he . allowed his apartment to be used to hold the meetings and he denied . seeing Miss Hunter getting hit. After . Mr Champion's death, the school fired band director Julian White, who . contends he tried to report problems with hazing to his superiors. He has since been reinstated and placed on administrative leave at the request of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which asked the university to halt all disciplinary actions until the criminal investigation is finished. Four students connected to Mr Champion's death were expelled, but then reinstated at the request of the law enforcement agency. Last week, the Board of Trustees reprimanded Ammons over his job performance, including how the university has dealt with hazing. The panel that oversees the state university system has also called for a probe into whether school officials ignored past warnings about hazing. 'The Board of Trustees and President Ammons hope that through these arrests all involved in perpetuating this culture will really begin to view hazing as a serious matter,' said university spokeswoman Sharon Saunders.","Bria Shia Hunter was punched and hit with metal ruler .

"How training on his days off, a pep talk from Gary Neville and the stability of still living at home with mum and dad have turned Tyler Blackett into great hope at the heart of Manchester United’s defence . Manchester United are ready to give Tyler Blackett a new contract. The 20-year-old defender is currently earning just £2,000 a week at Old Trafford. Blackett has been playing alongside the likes of Wayne Rooney and Angel di Maria this season — who both earn three times more per week than he does in a year.

"Her career as an author took off – and various debts were settled – thanks to the success of her books and TV cartoons about Budgie The Little Helicopter. Now, 25 years after Budgie's last adventure, Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, has revived her writing career in another attempt to improve her finances. She has written a new book, Fergie's Farm, based on her childhood in the Hampshire countryside, featuring a band of friendly farmyard characters. Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, (left) has written a new book, Fergie's Farm, based on her childhood, pictured with her sister Jane and their parents Susan and Ronald at Dummer Down Farm . The Duchess, 55, first had the idea for Fergie's Farm three years ago when she was trying to pay off debt accumulated in the 1990s. The incomplete book was shelved, but the Duchess has finally finished the manuscript. Her spokesman said: 'It's now at a very advanced stage and the book is written. She has set up a company to deal with all of the formats needed for children's books today, including e-books, apps and games.' The Duchess spent some of her childhood on 480-acre Dummer Down Farm in Hampshire – and stayed on with her father, Major Ronald Ferguson, after her parents divorced when she was eight. Her children's books about Budgie the Little Helicopter were the inspiration for a popular animated TV series . The Duchess, 55, first had the idea for Fergie's Farm three years ago when she was trying to pay off debt accumulated in the 1990s . Sarah's daughters Beatrice and Eugenie and her ex-husband Prince Andrew, with whom she remains close, are said to be fully behind her in the new business venture. The Duchess has yet to find a publisher but it is possible she will strike a deal with Simon and Schuster, who have published six other titles by her. Her children's books about Budgie the Little Helicopter were the inspiration for a popular animated television series. On release of the first book, the Duchess was forced to deny she had copied the idea for the series from the earlier Hector the Helicopter book by A.W. Baldwin.

"A collection of around 500 fairytales left forgotten in an archive for more than 150 years have been discovered in Germany. The stories - written around the same time as the Brothers Grimm folk tales - offer a new selection of entrapped princesses, evil witches and dashing young princes. Historian Franz Xaver von Schönwerth gathered the unique collection of stories in the 1800s from across the Bavarian region of Oberpfalz in Germany. The fairytales were collected by historian Franz Xaver von Schonwerth in the 1800s - around the same time the Brothers Grimm were writing tales such as the Town Musicians of Bremen, shown in a sketch by Carl Offterdinger in 1829 . Many of the tales were told to him by local country folk, labourers and servants which had previously only been passed on through the generations by word of mouth. He completed a book on his findings called Aus der Oberpfalz – Sitten und Sagen, which came out in three volumes in 1857, 1858 and 1859, which included the fairy tales and historical background on them. In 1885, Jacob Grimm said this about him: 'Nowhere in the whole of Germany is anyone collecting [folklore] so accurately, thoroughly and with such a sensitive ear.' But his book never gained prominence and faded into obscurity. It was only when Oberpfalz cultural curator Erika Eichenseer was sifting through his work which had been stored in an archive in Regensburg, Germany, for 150 years, that his work re-emerged into the public domain. Ms Eichenseer has now published a selection of fairytales from Von Schönwerth's collection, the Guardian reports. The book is called Prinz Roßzwifl - meaning 'scarab beetle' which is better known in English as a 'dung beetle'. Legends: Von Schonwerth's collection has never-heard-before tales but also more well-known stories like Brothers Grimm's Little Red Riding Hood, depicted in a drawing by Ludwig Pietsch . Ms Eichenseer chose the beetle because it buries its most treasured possession - its eggs - which she says is symbolic of the hidden knowledge and wisdom to be found in fairytales. Many of the fairytales in the collection had been completely lost to the public consciousness until now. One story tells of a maiden who escapes a witch by transforming herself into a pond. The witch then lies on her stomach and drinks all the water, swallowing the young girl. But once she has drunk the pond, the girl uses a knife to cut her way out of the witch. Ther are also more well-known but local examples of tales such as Cinderella and Rumpelstiltskin. Ms Eichenseer says the fairytales were invented for people of all ages. She said: 'Their main purpose was to help young adults on their path to adulthood, showing them that dangers and challenges can be overcome through virtue, prudence and courage.' Ms Eichenseer helped to found the Franz Xaver von Schönwerth Society, an interdisciplinary committee devoted to analysing his work and publicising it.","Historian Franz Xaver von Schönwerth .

"A theme park was forced to shut its gates to visitors when a mass brawl broke out after Muslim women were banned from rides unless they removed their headscarves. Two park rangers were injured and 15 people, including three women, were arrested in the scuffle at Rye Playland in New York yesterday. They have since been charged with disorderly conduct and assault. Muslim visitors involved in the fight accused police of brutality and claimed they were treated 'like animals'. One said: 'It's clear, this all happened because we're Muslim.' Scroll down for video . Huge response: New York state troopers, Westchester County police and city cruisers line up near the entrance to Playland Park . Rye Playland: A ban on wearing head coverings on rides at a theme park sparked a mass brawl that saw two park rangers hospitalised and 15 people arrested . '[The guards] were beating down the . girls, then they started beating down the guys as they came to their . aid,' Lola Ali, 16, of Queens, told the Journal News. The incident started at around 2pm when the theme park was crowded with around 6,000 visitors. Roughly 3,000 were in a Muslim tour group celebrating a holiday at the end of Ramadan. Trouble reportedly flared when women wearing Muslim hijab scarves tried to get on rides banning any head coverings. The . women were refused entry and offered refunds - but then male and female visitors started . to argue among themselves, Westchester County officials said. That apparently led to park guards stepping in, sparking the huge brawl. The . park entrance was closed for two hours as the fighting escalated. Ola Salem, 17, of Brooklyn, New York, . was wearing a headscarf and said she was denied entry onto a ride with . her eight-year-old sister. 'They said no because my of my ""headgear"",' she told the New York Times. 'I said: ""It’s not my headgear, it’s my religion"".' Unhappy: The brawl reportedly started when women wearing Muslim hijab scarves tried to get on rides banning any head coverings for safety reasons . Prayer: As a news conference takes place behind them, Muslim visitors to Playland Park pray together after the brawl within the park . Dena Meawad, 18, told the New York Daily News her friend Entisai Ali, was pushed to the ground and arrested when she began arguing with cops over the head scarf policy. Her cousin, Kareem Meawad, 17, went to try to protect the woman and was beaten by cops and also arrested, she added. Her brother, Issam Meawad, 20, was . pushed to the ground and taken into custody when he tried to help his . cousin, she told the New York Daily News. 'She just wanted to get on a ride. That was it,' Dena Meawad said of the initial confrontation. 'It's . clear, this all happened because we're Muslim.' Ayman Alrabah, 24, of Brooklyn said her husband, brother and father were all tackled by cops and put into handcuffs when they tried to intervene. She told the New York Daily News she was unaware of the head-scarf rule until after she and her sister tried to get on the park's Dragon Coasters. 'We requested a refund and all of a sudden an argument became a riot,' Alrabah said. 'Cops came. They were hitting my brother, my dad. My husband was on the floor and they were handcuffing him.' Brawl: The Rye Playland Boardwalk in which a massive fight broke out after Muslim women were told to take off their headscarves . She told the New York Daily News her four-year-old son was left 'traumatised' by seeing his father arrested. 'They treated us like animals, like we were nothing,' Alrabah said. 'They came with their dogs and sticks. We came to have fun.' Amr Khater, of Brooklyn, told The Journal News: 'Everybody got mad, everybody got upset. It’s our holiday. Why . would you do this to us?' Park officials insisted the ban was for safety reasons and said they respect their customers' religious beliefs. John Hodges, chief inspector of Westchester County Public Safety, insisted that police did not use excessive force. Two intervening park rangers were injured . and hospitalised. A huge police response then saw 60 patrol cars and 100 police arrive . from nine departments. The Muslim American Society of New . York had been 'painstakingly' advised of the rule many times before its tour took place, . parks official Peter Tartaglia said. Official line: Police said the women were offered refunds - but then visitors started to argue among themselves and that's when the fight started . He . defended the policy against head coverings on rides for safety reasons . and faulted the group for not ensuring visitors understood the policy. Mr Tartaglia said the policy is for . safety, as scarves can become entangled in mechanical parts, choke . riders or fly off and land in a ride's tracks. 'We respect the religious purpose of . wearing it, but we have several rides that you cannot go on with any . sort of headgear,' he said. 'The misunderstanding was very unfortunate,' Mr Tartaglia told Fox News. The park entrance was closed for two . hours as police responded to the scene, where more than 6,000 people . were inside at the time - half of whom were with the Muslim group. Mr Tartaglia said all the people arrested were later released. 'In this heightened state of Islamaphobia, a woman wearing a hajib is an easy target these days,' Zead Ramadan, president of the Council on American-Islamic Relations - New York, told the New York Daily News. 'Unfortunately, this turned ugly due to a lot of miscommunication.' He added, according to The Journal News: 'The people feel like victims, and the police feel like they were just doing their jobs. Personally I think things got a little out of control on both sides.' The celebration at the theme park, located just north of New York City, was for Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Islam's holy month of fasting, Ramadan. Rye Playland, owned and run by Westchester County, is America's only government-owned amusement park, reported Fox News. A spokesman for the Muslim American Society of New York said it plans to investigate what happened. See video here .

"For any woman who adores wearing heels, Hofit Golan, the Israeli-born socialite who has graced countless red carpets from Cannes to New York, offers a cautionary tale. Bizarre as it may sound, the 33-year-old’s partying came to an abrupt halt after an accident in a nightclub involving her stilettos. And Hofit’s recovery is just as remarkable. After a year of sticking to conventional treatment with only limited success, it took a controversial holistic therapy to see her back on track – and in heels again. Hofit Golan broke her tibia in three places and suffered a broken foot when a man landed on her in a nightclub . Hofit, wearing her customary designer clothes and Louboutin shoes, was enjoying a night out at risque London club The Box in November 2011 when an admirer tapped her on the shoulder. Hofit turned awkwardly and the man suddenly lost his footing, sending them both crashing to the floor. ‘It was pretty horrendous,’ recalls Hofit. ‘All I remember was having most of his weight on my knee and hearing something tear. I knew immediately I was in serious trouble.’ She was rushed to University College Hospital where it was revealed she had broken her tibia in three places, suffered a broken foot and torn ligaments in her arm. She spent the next three months with her leg in a cast. ‘I was in a wheelchair at first, and then on crutches with a moon boot. It wasn’t a great Christmas,’ Hofit recalls. In fact, 2012 wasn’t great either. Despite physiotherapy, Hofit’s foot would not heal completely. ‘The bone was out of alignment and I was experiencing shoulder and neck pain,’ she says. With her right foot still swollen, the socialite had to buy her favourite Louboutins in the next size up. ‘Shoes have always been an expensive habit, but I didn’t expect to have to buy second pairs,’ she laughs. It was only when she visited little-known clinic Villa Medica that her health improved rapidly . It was only when she visited a little-known clinic in Germany that spring that Hofit’s health improved rapidly. Villa Medica is one of the few centres in the world to offer Fresh Cell Therapy (FCT), a controversial technique that uses injections of embryonic stem cells from animals. The clinic claims success with diseases such as Parkinson’s. While human stem cells have been used in conventional treatments such as bone marrow transplants since the 1960s, the use of animal cells is unregulated. There is no scientific evidence to prove they are either safe or effective. Sam Oussedik, consultant orthopaedic surgeon at University College Hospital London, says: ‘The length of time it takes for a serious fracture to heal depends on many factors but you are looking at three to four months rather than weeks. ‘Treatments using anything other than human stem cells have no scientific evidence of working. It is difficult to say what may make a subject feel better. If I were to inject 100 patients with water, 50 would say they felt better afterwards.’ However, Hofit says the £15,000 FCT treatment enabled her to make a full recovery. On the first day she was given blood tests, then a bespoke vitamin drip for an hour alongside oxygen therapy. The next day she was given a series of FCT injections in her lower back, right foot and affected joints. One side effect was extreme tiredness and she says she slept afterwards for ‘a day and a half.’ When she awoke, Hofit conducted her own test – involving her old shoes. ‘They were the same Louboutins I wore on the night of the accident. I kept them on for two days without any pain or swelling to my right foot or leg – that’s when I knew the treatment had worked.’ A year on she remains pain-free and has resumed her party lifestyle. Has any doubt crept in the treatment might be harmful? ‘Never,’ she says. ‘It felt an instinctive way for the body to heal and the results I’ve had are proof of how well FCT works.’","Hofit Golan broke her tibia and foot in a nightclub accident in 2011 .

"Skin scare: Chemical methylisothiazolinone, a common ingredient in beauty products, has been found to cause severe allergic reactions . A chemical used in hundreds of beauty products is being blamed for a massive rise in dangerous allergic reactions. Cosmetic giant Johnson & Johnson says it is so concerned, it is taking the chemical out of its best-selling Piz Buin sun cream and other products. Molton Brown is doing the same and big brands such as Nivea, L’Oreal, Clarins and Sanctuary are under pressure to take action as doctors say adverse reactions to the chemical have reached ‘epidemic proportions’. Skin experts say manufacturers should urgently remove the chemical, a preservative called methylisothiazolinone (MI), from products that are left on the skin. It can cause rashes, lumps, blisters, itchy eyes and facial swelling. In one case, a woman’s head and face swelled up so much that doctors feared she would have trouble breathing without urgent treatment. In another, a British holidaymaker’s skin became so inflamed that she spent two days in a Spanish hospital and needed steroids and antihistamines to calm the allergic reaction. MI is a preservative designed to extend shelf life, and has no useful properties for users of the products. Experts say the scale of the allergic reactions to the chemical, which has been used increasingly since 2005, is alarming. Dermatologists expect an allergic reaction to a cosmetic product of 1 or 2 per cent, but clinics say the rate for MI has been more than 10 per cent. Leading dermatologist Dr Ian White, from St Thomas’ Hospital in London, said: ‘The frequency of reactions to MI is unprecedented in my experience. 'We’ve never seen anything quite like it. Contact allergy to this permitted preservative is now of epidemic proportions. Immediate action needs to be taken by industry.’ Sophie Holmes, a 26-year-old marketing executive from South London, said she needed steroids to reduce the swelling and inflammation that flared up after using Piz Buin sun cream. Miss Holmes began to feel unwell as she drove back from a skiing holiday in the French Alps. ‘It started to swell in my face and in my neck, and so I went straight to A&E in London,’ she said. ‘They prescribed me with steroids to reduce the swelling as it was a worry it was restricting my airways . . . and could become fatal.’ Tests later revealed that she had an allergy to MI. Still available on the high street . Concerns about the chemical will be highlighted tonight by the BBC Watchdog programme, which has been contacted by more than 150 people who have suffered skin reactions to the Piz Buin product. Johnson & Johnson insists that Piz Buin 1 Day Long is safe and effective and it will not be recalling bottles from the high street, but it will be changing the ingredients. The firm said the product ‘contains only permitted ingredients at levels well within EU standards set by regulators’. A spokesman said: ‘Many substances in our daily life, including ingredients in cosmetic products, may cause irritation in some people with a particular sensitivity. ‘This applies to MI, a preservative used to protect products from spoiling, which is found in many consumer and household products. We are continuously seeking to improve the effectiveness and consumer experience of our products. ‘As part of this process we are currently updating Piz Buin 1 Day Long and, from summer 2014, a new formulation that does not contain MI will be available in the UK. ‘We have stopped using MI in new leave-on products, and existing leave-on products are being reformulated over time.’ Molton Brown is removing the chemical from its products from this month. A Nivea spokesman said MI was an approved preservative in the  EU for use in cosmetic products, and that all of its products containing the preservative have been ‘subject to an expert safety assessment and release by our company toxicologists’. Clarins said: ‘Our customers and their safety is our No 1 priority. All of the ingredients used in our formulas are approved by the European Commission and their safety has been carefully reviewed by the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety, which consists of European Commission toxicologists, dermatologists and experts. ‘However, it is inevitable that someone, somewhere will be unable to tolerate a particular ingredient or combination of ingredients. Clarins is committed to providing the safest products with the highest quality ingredients.’ A spokesman for L’Oreal said: ‘Methylisothiazolinone (MI) is a preservative widely used in various industries and in cosmetic products to ensure their safety. ‘Preservatives play a vital role in the protection against contamination by microorganisms. Without preservatives, bacteria, yeast, mould and other organisms could develop, leading to product deterioration, spoilage and potential health and safety issues. ‘Preservatives are regulated by cosmetics legislation in Europe and a list of permitted preservatives is followed to ensure preservatives used in cosmetics are safe. Consumer safety is our first priority and we are working with the industry to better understand the concerns raised about MI.’ Watchdog, BBC One, tonight at 8pm .","Chemical methylisothiazolinone (MI) can cause severe skin reactions .

"A man in Las Vegas who signed up for a state-approved health insurance plan in November has now been told that he didn’t have coverage for the first two months of this year even though he was paying premiums for that time. Larry Basich’s ordeal that has landed him with $407,000 in hospital bills is the latest example of the problems facing Nevada residents due to the state’s problem-riddled exchange system. On Tuesday, a state panel approved a $1.5million consulting contract in an effort to have a private firm fix the state’s exchange. Outraged: Larry Basich's heart surgery on January 3 has led to $407,000-worth of bills that his health insurance will not cover because the state exchange claims he is on another plan . Missing pieces: The Nevada 'Silver State' heath insurance exchange has listed Larry Basich, who had triple bypass surgery in January, that he was signed up with a different plan than the one he has been paying since November . Mr Basich comes as a clear example of crossed wires resulting in six-figure bills. After spending weeks trying to sign up for ‘Obamacare’ when the buggy national website first launched on October I, he purchased a plan with UnitedHealthcare in mid-November. ‘It was like reaching the third level of Doom,’ he told The Las Vegas Review Journal. He made his first premium payment for $160.77 on November 21 and because that was before the December 23 deadline that the Obama administration put into place, that meant his care was due to be activated on January 1. Addressing the issue: Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval has inquired specifically about Mr Basich's case multiple times and used hm as an example of the problems with the state system . For Mr Basich, 62, health insurance couldn’t have come at a better time because on December 31 he had a heart attack. He had a triple bypass surgery on January 3 and the operation combined with its ensuing care led to a total of $407,000 bills for January and February. Even though he has only ever been signed up for- and been paying bills for- UnitedHealthcare’s MyHPNSilver1, the state exchange somehow lists him as being an enrollee for an alternative plan, run by Nevada Health Co-Op. 'If he had picked our health plan, we would be advocating for a solution. But he didn’t pick us,' Nevada Health Co-Op CEO Tom Zumtobel told the state's exchange board. The state exchange, which has Xerox as it’s contractor, attempted to right the wrong by saying that they would list Mr Basich as a client of Nevada Health Co-Op for January and February before switching him to UnitedHealthcare in March, but that still wouldn’t solve the issue of addressing the bills from his heart attack. All the while, Basich continued paying the monthly bills for his insurance premiums in January and February. 'Xerox is truly out of their league. They need to understand they are an administrator, they are not an . insurance company,' Mr Basich's insurance broker Tamar Burch of Branch . Benefits Consultants said. 'They . need to understand their boundaries. They don’t understand this world. Everybody is at the mercy of Xerox, and they are not doing this right. 'I . believe Xerox is covering themselves because of a huge system error. They don’t want the accountability of saying, ""Yes, we did mess this up, . and here’s the plan you selected."" It’s like, ""What did he pay for?"" That’s it. They are making this more complicated than it has to be.’ Working through the issues: The Nevada exchange is now being revamped after the governor approved a $1.5million consulting contract to have their system reworked as a result of the thousands of crossed wires . Mr Basich is not alone, as Ms Burch estimates that more than 20 of her clients have faced the same problem, and other estimates suggest that 22,000 Nevadans have faced various problems enrolling in the federally-mandated insurance plans. The Las Vegas Review Journal reports that Governor Brian Sandoval has been told by Xerox that they plan to work with Deloitte Consulting, the consulting firm elected to fix their state exchange. 'We should never be here today for this but we are,' he said when Mr Sandoval approved the $1.5million contract. 'We, being the state of Nevada, cannot go through this again.' Mr Sandoval specifically mentioned Mr Basich's case when he announced the consulting hire on Tuesday, and he wasn't thrilled when Xerox spokesman Greg Vitiello said that they are 'much closer' to finding a solution. The Governor asked for further clarification 'because that's the same answer that I've gotten for the past three months'.","Larry Basich now faces six-figure hospital bills because the state exchange says he is signed up for a different plan than he actually is .
Basich signed up for a UnitedHealthcare plan in mid-November and because that was ahead of the White House's December 23 deadline, his coverage was supposed to start on January 1 .
He had a heart attack on December 31 and had a triple bypass on January 3 .
Even though he had been paying for his UnitedHealthcare plan since November, the state exchange says their records place him with a different company, Nevada Health Co-Op .
Governor Brian Sandoval just approved a $1.5million consulting contract so that Deloitte can come in and fix the state's exchange program ."
"Over 300,000 Americans have already been infected with the potentially fatal 'kissing bug disease' called Chagas but U.S. healthcare workers lack of knowledge about the illness is letting many cases of the parasite unnoticed. Some doctors are calling it the 'new AIDS' because of the way it develops. Researchers who gathered on Tuesday at the annual American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene meeting in New Orleans said that if caught early the disease can be cured however sometimes the disease can be asymptomatic and there is a dearth in medication for the condition. The CDC reports that the initial symptoms of the disease caused by a parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, which is spread through the feces of kissing bugs includes fever, fatigue, body aches, rash, diarrhea and vomiting. One of the first visual signs can be a skin lesion or a purplish swelling of the lid of one eye. The disease can develop in the body causing eventual heart failure and other deadly complications that by the time they are realized cannot be helped with medicine. Scroll down for video . Symptoms: One of the  first visible signs can be a skin lesion or a purplish swelling of the lids of one eye . Chagas is being called the new AIDS because of its asymptomatic beginnings that can turn to a fatal end if the disease progresses. 'We were astonished to not only find such a high rate of individuals testing positive for Chagas in their blood, but also high rates of heart disease that appear to be Chagas-related,' said Nolan Garcia, an epidemiologist at the Baylor College of Medicine. The CDC has said that they believe most of the people infected with Chagas got the parasite in Mexico or South America before coming to the U.S. The Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved two medicines called nifurtimox and benznidazole that are currently used to treat. The medications also put people at risk for the disease nerve damage, nausea and weight loss, reports Aljazeera. The CDC only makes the drugs available when no alternatives exist. 'The disease can be fatal if not treated,' said Melissa Nolan Garcia, a research associate at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and co-author of a separate study on Chagas disease in Texas published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene on Tuesday. 'You are normally asymptomatic until disease has progressed at which time treatment is not helpful. We call this the silent disease,' Garcia said. 'The concerning thing is that majority of the patients [I spoke to] are going to physicians, and the physicians are telling them, ‘No you don’t have the disease,’ she said. Kissing bug: Chagas is caused by a parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, which is spread through the feces of kissing bugs(pictured) and is making its way into the U.S.","Over 300,000 Americans have already been infected with the potentially fatal 'kissing bug disease' called Chagas .

"High rates of tuberculosis, HIV and hepatitis B are found in migrants coming to live as long-term residents in Britain, according to a report. Three-quarters of tuberculosis cases reported in Britain last year were born abroad, with many diagnosed two or more years after their arrival. Almost two-thirds of newly diagnosed cases of HIV and 80 per cent of hepatitis B infected blood donors in 2010 were born abroad. High rates of tuberculosis, HIV and hepatitis B are found in migrants coming to live as long-term residents in Britain, according to the Health Protection Agency . The Health Protection Agency (HPA) report says 12 per cent of people living in Britain in 2010 were born abroad - up from 8 per cent in 2001. 'A small proportion of the non-UK born residents bear the greatest burden of infectious disease reported in the UK,’ it says. The report found that half of migrants with newly diagnosed HIV had probably become infected in Britain. Migrants going back to visit family and . friends are the ‘main risk group’ for infections such as malaria and . enteric fever diagnosed in Britain, it reports. Almost two-thirds of malaria cases reported here last year and 87 per cent of enteric fever cases were among migrants who travelled abroad to visit friends and relatives, said the agency. Dr Jane Jones, head of the travel and migrant section at HPA, said: ‘The  majority of non-UK born residents do not have infectious disease but some are at higher risk than UK-born residents because of their exposures and their life experiences prior to, during and after migration. ‘It is important to remember that risk to non-UK born residents does not end on arrival in the UK,’ she added.","75% of TB cases reported last year were born abroad .

"Geranium plants could hold the key to a new generation of HIV treatments, research suggests. Extracts of the geranium plant Pelargonium sidoides inactivate HIV-1 and prevent the virus invading human cells. HIV is divided into two types – HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is responsible for the majority of cases. A compound found in geranium plants can be used to treat HIV-1, the most common form of the virus . Researchers at the German Research Centre for Environmental Health, in Munich, say extracts from the geranium plants could represent a potential new class of anti-HIV-1 drugs for the treatment of AIDS. They found that root extracts from the plants contain a compound that attacks HIV-1 and prevents the virus replicating inside the human body. They found it also protects blood and immune cells from infection by the virus. It blocks the attachment of HIV particles to human cells and, thus, effectively prevents the virus invading the cells. Several clinical trials have already demonstrated that the geranium extracts are safe for human use and in Germany they are already licenced for use as a herbal medicine. Research group leader Professor Ruth Brack-Werner said: ‘[Geranium] extracts are a very promising lead for the development of the first scientifically validated phytomedicine against HIV-1. ‘[The] extracts attack HIV-1 with a mode of action that is different from all anti-HIV-1 drugs in clinical use. ‘Therefore [they] may be a valuable supplement for established anti-HIV therapies. The plant extract prevents the virus invading human cells and replicating inside the human body . ‘Furthermore, [the] extracts are attractive candidates for increasing anti-HIV-1 therapy options in resource-limited settings, since they are easy to produce and do not require refrigeration. ‘The results of our study and the proven safety of [the] extracts encourages their testing in HIV-1 infected individuals as a next step.’ According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), more than 35 million people in the world are infected with HIV, the majority with HIV-1. Without treatment, HIV destroys the immune system and causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is a life-threatening disease. HIV/AIDS is one of the 10 leading causes of death worldwide.","The root extract can help treat HIV-1, the most common form of the virus .

"A German construction company has come under fire after fitting a supposedly random set of bricks in the shape of a swastika in a public walkway. Their mistake was swiftly spotted by shoppers in the town of Goslar, northwest Germany, who called the police. Any use of Nazi symbols is illegal in Germany, and police were called to the scene, but the builders claim the shape of the bricks was an accident. Scroll down for video . Shoppers in Goslar, Lower Saxony called police after spotting the swastika in the newly fitted walkway, but builders claim it was an accident . The new pathway had just been officially unveiled in the pedestrian zone of one of the main shopping streets in Goslar, Lower Saxony. Police confirmed that there was indeed a swastika in the middle of the newly laid walkway, but said they could not determine that it had been done deliberately. City Council officials however said that deliberate or not, they ordered it covered and got the builders back in to rearrange the brickwork and eradicate the Nazi symbol. A spokesman for the city council Christian Burgart said: ‘We do not tolerate such behaviour here. 'It is inexcusable, therefore we ordered it to be removed straight away.’ 'Not deliberate': Police were called to the scene in Goslar, Lower Saxony, but the builders claim the shape of the bricks was an accident (stock image) He added: ‘This symbol has nothing to do with our town and has no place whatsoever here.’ A police spokesman said: ‘We have no leads, we are keeping our options open and investigating. ’We are speaking to the building firm responsible for the new footpath. They claim it was not deliberate but just an innocent mistake, and have already changed it.’ German law prohibits ‘use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations,’ encompassing all Nazi symbolism and, as a result, the swastika. The German Strafgesetzbuch (Criminal Code) section 86a bans any form of display of a swastika, even if used in ‘innocent’ situations.","Builders accidentally lay bricks in the shape of a swastika in German town .

"An Afghan 'international serial rapist' is facing life in jail after being convicted of sexually assaulting three Californian women. Ali Achekzai, 33, attacked a 21-year-old woman in her car near a nightclub in Laguna Beach, Orange County, and another on a hike near Mount Soledad in San Diego. He later fled to Canada and Austria where he was accused of rape in a separate 2009 case before being captured and extradited to California last year. Wanted: Ali Achekzai was being sought by authorities in Canada, Austria and the U.S. before his arrest in 2009 . He has since been convicted on six charges, including forcible rape and aggravated assault. Achekzai was formerly one of the most wanted men in the U.S. after being sought by Interpol, the FBI, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Marshals Service, Canadian police, Austrian Police, San Diego police, Tustin police and the Orange County Sheriff's Department. He was featured for years on Orange County District Attorney's 'Most Wanted' list before his arrest last year in Austria, when detectives from Tustin submitted DNA samples from their case to Interpol. The federal police agency then completed a successful DNA match to Achekzai, who was at that time living under an assumed name in Salzburg, Austria. He has now been convicted of sexually assaulting a 21-year-old woman in her car in a Tustin parking lot after following her as she drove away from a nightclub in Laguna Beach in 2004. Achekzai also raped a 21-year-old woman on a hike near Mount Soledad in San Diego County in 2004 after he isolated her from her friends. The Afghan now faces up to 80 years in prison when he is jailed on January 27 by Superior Court Judge Daniel Didier. Achezkai had argued when he testified that the rapes were consensual sex acts. A jury in Orange County heard Achekzai attacked a woman in a car near a nightclub in Laguna Beach, California . But a jury in Orange County, California, took less than three hours to convict him of the sex attacks. His three victims, who did not know each other, all testified  to 'eerily similar' conduct by Achekzai, according to Deputy District Attorney Robert Mestman. Mr Mestman said that when Achekzai attacked the woman in San Diego in 2004, he  repeatedly hit and punched the woman and told her he would kill her if she screamed. He then sexually assaulted her on the ground, and later punched her in the mouth – knocking out a front tooth - when she told her friend what happened. Attack: Achekzai was also convicted of assaulting a female hiker on Mount Soledad in San Diego . Achekzai was also accused of fondling a 24-year-old woman and removing her pants during a limousine ride from Laguna Beach to Costa Mesa after a night of drinking at a nightclub in 2002 as her friend slept. But Achekzai fled the country prior to being charged for the rapes. Authorities said he changed his name several times and is suspected of living at various times in Afghanistan, Germany, San Francisco, Canada, Austria and England. He was arrested Jan. 26, 2010, at the Hotel Unterbrunn in the Austrian town of Neukirchen am Grossvenediger by the Salzburg Criminal Investigative Division in cooperation with the FBI and extradited to California . The case was the first international DNA hit for California law enforcement, authorities said.","Afghan Ali Achekzai formally arraigned after extradition to California .

"Frank Lampard is flourishing at Manchester City — but it would be a great deal harder for Chelsea to swallow were they not six points clear at the top of the Barclays Premier League. Attitudes may change, however, if this goal trend goes on, if his loan is extended and if the title rivals are neck-and-neck by the time City visit Stamford Bridge at the end of next month. No-one at Chelsea thought when he departed in June to embark on a career in the MLS that Lampard would appear on loan at the Etihad Stadium. Even if they had, there was nothing they could have done. Manchester City's Frank Lampard celebrates after scoring his side's second goal against Southampton . Despite his move to City, Chelsea fans show their appreciation for Lampard at the Etihad in September . Lampard scored 208 goals in 626 matches for Chelsea before departing in July . His contract was up and manager Jose Mourinho wanted Cesc Fabregas. Lampard was told through negotiations that his playing time would be greatly reduced and that the time might be right for a new challenge if he wanted to play regularly. There was no formal contract offer and Lampard described the split as ‘very mutual’, although it is hard to escape a lingering feeling that he would have preferred to stay. Having reached that point, Chelsea had no right to dictate where he went, so they wished him well as he selected New York City from his many options, although it was unclear how links between this new MLS franchise and City, its parent club, would work. By the time they were preparing to face him in City colours in September, it was clear the mood at Chelsea had already started to shift. Lampard came off the bench to score the equaliser as Manchester City rescued a point against Chelsea . Lampard (second left) is mobbed by his City team-mates after his 85th minute equaliser against the Blues . Lampard refused to celebrate his late strike at the Etihad during the emotional 1-1 draw in September . Lampard (right) shakes hands with his Chelsea team-mate John Terry after the September showdown . ‘I was not expecting this,’ said Mourinho. ‘But it was his decision. It’s his life. When he left for New York, I thought he was going there. But it is his life, his decision and he has my respect for that.’ As Arsene Wenger noted, the easiest way from London to Manchester is not via New York. Wenger sniffed a Financial Fair Play dodge, which City denied. Mourinho, too, seemed increasingly irritated. ‘When he decided to become a direct competitor of Chelsea then love stories are over,’ said Mourinho after Lampard’s equaliser against Chelsea. The open offer from Roman Abramovich for Lampard to return in some capacity in the future is apparently still there — but the longer this goes on and the more successful he is at City, the more it will feel akin to the ambush of Patrick Vieira from Arsenal’s history. Mourinho was irked when Chelsea supporters sang Lampard’s name, although those chants have since faded. Why support a direct rival? Lampard has gone from strength to strength at City during the past few months . The arrival of Cesc Fabregas (right) during the summer heralded the end of Lampard's Chelsea career . Lampard’s enduring ability to influence any game in which he features, however briefly, prompts more questions about why he was allowed to leave. Mourinho values experience in the dressing room. He re-signed Didier Drogba to be a positive influence and to use tactically, mostly from the bench. Lampard has started four games for his new club, two in the Premier League. He has come on seven times as a substitute and scored five. Drogba has started four games, made 12 appearances from the bench and has scored four. Mourinho required cover up front and a mentor for Diego Costa, so it has proved a successful move. Didier Drogba (left) was re-signed by Mourinho to add experience to his new-look Chelsea side . In midfield, it was slightly different since Fabregas has formed an excellent partnership with Nemanja Matic. Fabregas and Lampard never got on as opponents, so who knows how that would have panned out? There is also a theory that to enable the younger players to thrive, they had to dilute the old dressing-room power base. Ashley Cole and Lampard went. Petr Cech could be next. For Chelsea fans, all of this will be easier to take if they hold off City and win the title.

"Chelsea have agreed to cash in on Andre Schurrle to free up the funds to sign Juan Cuadrado.

Jose Mourinho is not a fan of the Germany international but recognises his value in the transfer market . Chelsea have not been in a rush to sell, although they have been actively looking for a replacement. Both Cuadrado and Douglas Costa have been at the top of their scouting list, but Costa is cup tied for the Champions League and was always a second choice; not least because dealing with his club, Shakhtar Donetsk, is always complicated and the transfer window closes on Monday night.

"FIFA are employing the international PR agency — Weber Shandwick — used by England 2018’s doomed World Cup bid to crisis manage the build-up to the next global tournament in Russia in 2018. The choice of Weber Shandwick after a beauty parade of PR companies in London comes despite England 2018’s bid campaign still being under scrutiny. It was singled out for breaching bid regulations in FIFA ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert’s botched summary of Michael Garcia’s World Cup bid corruption report.

Russia deputy Prime Minister (left) Igor Shuvalov and Alexei Sorokin (right) celebrate the moment when they were awarded the rights to the 2018 World Cup back in December 2010 . With their offices around the globe, Weber Shandwick personnel are likely to have contributed heavily to the England intelligence database. Department for Culture Media and Sport select committee chairman John Whittingdale has asked the FA to answer ‘serious’ questions about the intelligence. But FIFA have no qualms employing Weber Shandwick, who were willing to take on the difficult brief — especially with the Russia-Ukraine situation — after some rivals pulled out. FIFA fancifully first described their outside-agency recruitment as purely involving brand assistance. But it is all about damage limitation around the World Cup in Russia. World champion Lewis Hamilton, who has split with Simon Fuller’s XIX agency, is not expected to sign for another F1 management team.

The Lawn Tennis Association like to look after their own, judging by their £280,000 funding of a new, three-court indoor tennis facility at exclusive Surrey public school Reed’s in leafy Cobham — hardly an inner-city area deprived of tennis facilities.

Current pupil Jack Draper — 12-year-old son of former LTA chief executive Roger and a highly promising British junior — had a hit with the two stars. The LTA say the investment in further improving Reed’s high-performance tennis centre was made during Draper’s regime. They add there is now a new strategy in place under Michael Downey that scrutinises every facility spend in far more detail.

"Michael Carrick has warned Manchester United's rivals that their 'scary' strikeforce is starting to fire on all cylinders. Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie were both on target in Saturday's 3-0 win over Hull City, and Radamel Falcao came off the bench to make his first appearance in almost six weeks following a calf injury. Rooney is a doubt for Tuesday's clash with Stoke at Old Trafford after suffering a knock on his knee at the weekend, and Angel di Maria definitely misses out due to a hamstring strain. Robin van Persie smashes the ball into the top corner for Manchester United's third goal against Hull . Wayne Rooney celebrates putting Louis van Gaal's men 2-0 ahead at Old Trafford on Saturday . Radamel Falcao made his return from injury against Steve Bruce's men after six weeks out with a calf problem . But the signs are there that United's stars are starting to align, according to Carrick. 'When you have got Robin and Wayne scoring, and Falcao coming off the bench and nearly scoring, we'll be a threat to anyone,' said the England midfielder. 'You want those boys when they're flying and it's scary to play against. 'What Robin and Wayne did against Hull, we've seen that happen so often in the past and hopefully we'll see that in the coming weeks again. When you've got those lads scoring goals and creating chances it gives the whole team huge confidence and belief.' United face Stoke having won five of their seven home games this season, and Carrick believes that Louis van Gaal is gradually restoring the air of invincibility around Old Trafford that disappeared under David Moyes. Midfielder Michael Carrick (left) believes United's attacking trio make them a threat against any side . Rooney celebrates with Van Persie after the Dutchman's stunning strike from outside Hull's area . 'That's the sort of standard we want to be at, dominating teams and winning,' he added. 'Hopefully we can carry on like this and that fear factor will creep back.' Meanwhile, Victor Valdes was back at Carrington on Monday despite reports that the Spanish goalkeeper had stopped training with United. Mark Hughes believes Manchester United have fallen too far behind Chelsea to stand a chance in the title race – but senses danger that Van Gaal's team are building up a run of form. He will take his Stoke players to Old Trafford more confident of getting a result than in recent years however, and plans on using the same attacking style that beat Manchester City. 'Retention of the ball is key for us, you need to show bravery on it,' Hughes said. 'We have shown that at City and at the weekend against Liverpool. A lot more teams are going to Old Trafford and really testing themselves and see how far it takes them. Stoke players Steven N'Zonzi (second from right) and Mark Wilson look glum after Liverpool's late winner . Stoke boss Mark Hughes is keen to attack Manchester United at Old Trafford on Tuesday night . 'United seem to be hitting a bit of form which is a bit unfortunate from our point of view. They suffered at the start of the season with injuries but you do feel once they have everyone back they are going to have a say in whoever wins the league this year. It's beyond them I think but you never know.' Stoke's preparations have been hampered by two injuries to Steve Sidwell and Glenn Whelan, picked up during the 1-0 defeat at Anfield on Saturday. Whelan suffered a thigh problem, Sidwell tore his medial knee ligament and will be out for up to six weeks – but that is a shorter period than initially feared.

"Jamie Vardy once nearly caused a riot in Luton. Three years later and four leagues higher, his presence sparks crowds into a frenzy in the Far East. Having ascended from Fleetwood Town to Leicester City, this summer he was flown to Bangkok by the club’s Thai owners to celebrate promotion and meet hundreds of fans. ‘The attention is mad over there,’ says Vardy. ‘Loads of people welcome us and give us Thai bracelets and stuff like that. They have dancers, everything.’ Quite different from a memorable occasion in non-League football in November 2011 when the crowd had more hostile intentions. Jamie Vardy scores Leicester's fourth goal during their demolition of Manchester United in September . Vardy was in sensational form during his side's 5-3 victory over Louis van Gaal's side . The Leicester City striker bagged four assists on top of his goal on a memorable day for the Foxes . ‘In my year at Fleetwood, we played at Luton and that was just carnage,’ recalls the 27-year-old striker. ‘We were winning 1-0 at half-time, I’d dinked the keeper and obviously celebrated a bit madly. ‘Their fans were rocking the tunnel and all their players were trying to get hold of one of our strikers. The police came into the dressing room and told us if we were going to start a riot they’d lock us up.’ Such events explain why Vardy says he pinches himself every day to believe he has risen so far, so fast. He sprung to attention in late September by bullying Manchester United in a display that earned him four assists and a first Premier League goal. ‘Madness,’ he reflects. Buddhist monks were at the King Power Stadium for Leicester's 5-3 win against Manchester United . Foxes manager Nigel Pearson, back in April, embraces a monk at the King Power Stadium . But now that 5-3 win is a distant memory. Not another goal for him, and no more wins for his team. The Srivaddhanaprabha family, who own Leicester, have called back the Buddhist monks who blessed the players prior to the remarkable rout of Louis van Gaal’s side. Liverpool provide the opposition at the King Power Stadium tonight and any good karma would be welcome. The players are familiar with the religious ceremony by now and are on friendly terms with the monks. ‘They come with little sticks, dip them in holy water and then slap you over the head as hard as they can,’ Vardy says. ‘Before the United game it was like I’d had a bath — heads, shoulders, legs. It worked though, didn’t it! They need to come back more often.’ Ultimately, though, Vardy knows it is up to the players and boss Nigel Pearson to turn it around. Leicester are on a run of two points from 24, and have slid to the bottom of the table, but he is positive. Vardy on the ball in training on Monday as Leicester prepare to face Liverpool in the Premier League . Vardy (right) and his Leicester side have struggled for form since their incredible victory over United . ‘After the start we had, we know we’re capable of beating teams and we’ve just had a little dip,’ he says. Vardy has come back from greater adversity. As a teenager at Stocksbridge Park Steels, on the eighth rung of the football ladder, he wore an electronic tag having been convicted of assault. He claimed he was protecting a friend being attacked by a group outside a pub. ‘It wasn’t nice wearing the tag and having to be in at 6pm every night. I learned from that and things started looking up. ‘Now we have to make sure we put 100 per cent effort in, run ourselves into the ground if we have to.’ Vardy celebrates scoring for Fleetwood Town against Blackpool in a 2012 FA Cup third round tie .

Vardy leads from the front in that respect. ‘I’m just a pest,’ he smiles. ‘That’s all I’ve ever been. I don’t know how to play any different.There is no sitting off, I just go straight at them.’ Liverpool present a serious challenge tonight but you sense Vardy is eager to run at a defence that has not been at its best this season. And come the end of the campaign, 17th in the table will do. ‘We would just be happy if we stay up,’ he says. ‘We want to stay in this league and then kick on again. Any finish will do.’","Jamie Vardy signed for Leicester City from Fleetwood Town in 2012 .

Other prisoners are shown being hit with rifle butts and shoes whilst they march blindfolded. Unable to see, they hold the shoulder of the man in front. The chain of men is led down some stairs to a small jetty, covered in blood. One by one, they are taken by one of the jihadists to the edge of the jetty, where they are shot in the head with a pistol and their body tossed into the water. The despicable video was quickly removed by You Tube, although it later re-emerged via social media. One analyst likened the scenes to the killing fields of Cambodia, under the communist Khymer Rouge regime in the 1970s. Deluded: The video also features a North African jihadist named Abu Ayyub al-Maghribi (above) talking about his dreams of becoming a martyr before climbing into an armoured car packed with explosives . The slickly produced video is edited to highlight the jihadist's vehicle driving down a street under heavy fire . Terrorist: Al-Maghribi drives towards a large concrete building, which is shown in a slow motion action replay . Dreams of being a martyr: Al-Maghribi detonates the armoured car when he reaches the base of the building . The video also shows footage of battles and Isis rallies as well as the destruction of holy sites in Iraq. The slickly made video is extremely graphic, repeatedly showing the dead bodies of the Iraqi army with no signs of humility. It also includes night vision footage of battles as well as close up action replays of jihadists firing rocket-propelled grenades in a battle to take an Iraqi checkpoint. In between the fighting scenes, the film shows a North African jihadist with the non de guerre Abu Ayyub al-Maghribi talking about his dreams of becoming a martyr. It then shows him climbing into an armoured personnel carrier and driving down a street under heavy gunfire. Marched to their deaths: A chain of men is led down stairs to a small jetty, where they will be executed . He proceeds to detonate the vehicle near a large concrete building, which is then shown in a slow motion action replay. In others, Iraqi men are killed in what appear to be drive-by shootings. The scenes are then edited to show the sights from a sniper's rifle over the victim before they are gunned down. ISIS . has become known for imposing strict Sharia law, mass summary . executions and growing numbers of foreign fighters in its ranks. It is . understood the prisoners are referred to in the video description as . rafidas, a derogatory term used by some Sunnis to describe Shi'ites who reject the authority of the first three Muslim rulers after Mohamed. Shocking brutality: In other scenes, the film shows hundreds of men with their hands bound, waiting to be shot or lying dead . Targeted: The video also shows Iraqis being killed in what appear to be drive-by shootings. Here, the video is edited to show the victim in the sights of a sniper's rifle as he is gunned down . In late June, the group announced it had changed its name to the Islamic State and had formed a caliphate across Syria and Iraq, under the leadership of its caliph, Ibrahim Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Many Iraqi Christians have fled the Isis-held city of Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, following threats of execution if they did not convert to Islam. Isis has made considerable advancements in north-eastern Syria and Iraq, recently seizing a strategic military base near the ISIS stronghold city of Raqqa. The Sunni extremists celebrated their victory over the 17th division of the Syrian national army by beheading many of their prisoners and parading their severed heads around Raqqa. ISIS also briefly captured the Al-Shaar gas field in Homs province, killing at least 200 Syrian army soldiers before it was recaptured yesterday by President Bashar al-Assad’s forces.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Cleared: Anarchist Malcolm Blackman, was accused of rape in a tent outside St Paul's . A PROMINENT anti-capitalist  activist last night claimed his career  is ‘in ruins’ after he was cleared of  raping a woman at a protest camp outside St Paul’s Cathedral. Malcolm Blackman, 46, was found not guilty of two counts of rape at the Old  Bailey yesterday, following a high-profile eight-day case. He was alleged to have raped a fellow  protester – with whom he was in a ‘casual’ sexual relationship – inside her tent as they took part in the Occupy London protest in January last year. On one occasion, the jury had been told, he attacked her when she had passed out drunk. He was accused on another occasion of tying a belt around her neck and ‘throttling’ her while he forced her to perform a sex act. The self-styled leader of the Anonymous UK group visibly shook and closed his eyes as the jury returned a not guilty verdict after 11 hours and 14 minutes. Afterwards Mr Blackman, a street entertainer, claimed he was a ‘victim’ of the legal system and called for anonymity for those accused of sexual assault. Speaking outside court, he said: ‘Everybody’s a victim. Twelve months my life’s been on hold, I’ve not eaten, I’ve not slept. ‘I’ve been vilified – my career is in ruins. I’m a street performer – a magician. But there’ll always be doubts – there’ll always be those who say, “Oh, he got away with it”.’ Criticising the Crown Prosecution Service for bringing the case to court, he said: ‘I feel it was never in the public interest. ‘There was never any evidence of a crime. To have to stand in the dock as long as I have with my life in limbo has had a serious effect on my health. ‘I now wish to slide back into anonymity from where I came.’ The former court security guard said he would dedicate his time to campaigning for anonymity for rape defendants. He said: ‘I feel very strongly that the law needs to be reviewed with regard to anonymity to both parties with cases like this.’ The woman who claimed she had been . raped was not in court to hear the verdict, but afterwards, the City of . London Police expressed their disappointment. Detective Sergeant Marcos Gilson, the . officer who led the investigation, said: ‘Today’s outcome is obviously a . disappointing one for both myself and the victim. ‘The bravery and tenacity of the . victim has been key to bringing this matter to trial and I can only . commend her on doing it with such strength and integrity under what . were, and have been, very difficult circumstances. ‘Her willingness to cooperate fully . with the police should be heartening to those in a similar situation and . I hope this will encourage others to come forward, regardless of the . decision of the jury today.’ Protest: Mr Blackman shakes the hand of another activist outside St Paul's in February 2012 . Well known: Malcolm Blackman being interviewed on the eve of the camp's eviction by the authorities . Camp: Blackman frequently spoke to the media on behalf of Anonymous UK during the Occupy London protest . Protest site: The woman claimed she was attacked twice by Blackman, 45, inside the central London camp . Mr Blackman, of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, was accused of raping the woman on January 21 and 28 last year. Jurors heard that he was alleged to have used rape to ‘punish her’ when she became too clingy and a ‘nuisance’. The woman said she did not go to the police until June because she felt ‘ashamed and embarrassed’. But Mr Blackman insisted the . allegations were a ‘complete fabrication’ and that she had invented the . attacks to get back at him after discovering he had slept with another . activist on January 25. The court heard that Mr Blackman had . three sexual relationships during the four-month protest camp outside St . Paul’s, between October 2011 and February 2012. He kept a tally of his sexual . ‘conquests’ on the outside of his tent, something he dismissed as ‘a . lads’ joke’ and an attempt to ‘boost morale’ in the camp. The Occupy London protest, which campaigned against corporate greed, was finally removed by bailiffs in February. His barrister, Gordon Ross, told the . court during the trial: ‘He may be, in old-fashioned terminology, a cad, . a bounder, a womaniser. ‘He may be a four-letter word starting in ‘S’ and ending in ‘T’, but that doesn’t make him a rapist.’","Malcolm Blackman, 46, thanked the judge after he was discharged .

"Where are the Liverpool of last season? It is a question that has been asked of Brendan Rodgers almost every week since this campaign began. Having seen their team come within a whisker of winning the Barclays Premier League, the anticipation supporters would have felt during the summer has, after three defeats in five matches, started to be replaced by apprehension. They feel like they have been here before. In some respects, they have. Given the changes that have taken place since last May, it is impossible not to draw parallels with what happened in 2009, when Liverpool finished runners-up to Manchester United but failed to take the final step. Dejan Lovren (left) has failed to impress since signing for Liverpool from Southampton . Brendan Rodgers has struggled to get Liverpool playing the way they were last season . For the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona this summer, you had the departure of Xabi Alonso to Real Madrid back then. No matter how brave a face you try to put on the situation, you cannot under-estimate how damaging it is to lose part of the spine of your team. Suarez, with his 31 goals, was clearly more vital to what Liverpool achieved last season than Alonso was in 2008-09 but the perception around both transfers is the same: you know you are losing a world-class talent and the team no longer looks right. Our problem in 2009 was the fact Alonso’s replacement, Alberto Aquilani, arrived injured and struggled to make an impact. This year Rodgers has seen his band’s lead singer move on and, so far, it seems as if Suarez has been replaced with backing singers. Liverpool, however, have spent more than £100million. With nine new faces arriving, there will be a period of adjustment and we have heard how they will need time to settle. I used to feel, though, that you could gauge within a couple of months about whether a signing would be successful. Liverpool have suffered three defeats from their opening five Premier League games . The departures of Luis Suarez in the summer and Xabi Alonso in 2009 have had an impact on the team . The Uruguayan forward scored an astonishing 31 goals for Liverpool last season . Mamadou Sakho has failed to hit the ground running at Liverpool since joining from PSG last year . Fernando Torres (above) didn't need any time to settle into his career at Anfield . Think about it: Sami Hyypia and Didi Hamann on to Alonso, Fernando Torres, Javier Mascherano, Suarez and even Daniel Sturridge — they were all doing the business almost as soon as they walked through the door. Those who struggled in their first season very rarely turned it around in their second year. I know it’s early days but, when you have spent £38m on defenders like Dejan Lovren and Mamadou Sakho, you don’t want to be hearing about settling in. You want instant results but Liverpool are shipping goals. Lovren was brought in to add leadership at the back but Liverpool actually look worse defensively than they did last season. Sakho doesn’t fill you with confidence when you watch him and nor does the goalkeeper, Simon Mignolet. They need to step it up urgently. Rodgers had the good fortune last season of injuries not making much impact on his team but, with a bigger fixture list, he had to invest to bring in numbers and quality. Of those who have come in only Alberto Moreno, the young Spanish left back, has impressed me so far. Reds striker Daniel Sturridge hit the ground running after his move from Chelsea . Mario Balotelli (left) has a tendency to walk around and must work harder to get into the box . Simon Mignolet (pictured) needs to step up and put in better performances for Liverpool . It must be emphasised it is still early days but the one thing that I associate with Rodgers’ Liverpool is absent: intensity. With and without the ball, Liverpool wouldn’t let the opposition settle, blitzing them with whirlwind starts. Everton, who cross Stanley Park on Saturday, felt that force in January. Suarez set the tone, harrying and hassling. He defended from the front and is the best in the world at creating that relentless energy that swamped teams. If intensity is the word you associate with Rodgers’ Liverpool, you would not use it to describe Mario Balotelli, Suarez’s replacement. When he played for Manchester City, I wasn't a fan and what I've seen so far hasn't persuaded me to change my mind. He has a tendency to walk around, which I don’t like to see. He has to bust a gut more often to get in the box. Suarez hit the ground running at Liverpool and played a key role during his time at Anfield . Lucas (left) and Steven Gerrard do not play at their best when they are in the same side . Liverpool were beaten 3-1 at Upton Park in their last Premier League outing . Another issue troubling Rodgers is that Liverpool haven’t been creating chances with the same frequency either. Teams have targeted Steven Gerrard to stop him launching attacks from deep, with Gabby Agbonlahor and Stewart Downing stifling him in the defeats by Aston Villa and West Ham. When Suarez, Sturridge and Raheem Sterling were at their devastating best last season, it suited Gerrard to sit deep and pull the strings but with Suarez gone and Sturridge injured, who is there to score and create? There has been a lot of talk about his form in the holding-midfield role. If he continues to be targeted is there an option for him to play further forward and give teams something different to think about? Gerrard is at his best when he is able to sit deep in midfield, but has been exposed this season . Brazilian midfielder Philippe Coutinho (centre) has struggled for form so far this season . No other midfielder in the squad has the ability to score from outside the box or create like the captain. Of the others who can create, Philippe Coutinho is struggling for form and Adam Lallana has only just returned from injury. One thing that is certain is Gerrard and Lucas struggle to play together. Lucas should come in for the games when Stevie is rested. Gerrard is used to such scrutiny but maybe some of the others have not experienced the criticism that has come their way this week. Yet if Liverpool do not improve in the next two games against Everton and Basle in the Champions League, they won’t know what has hit them. Do not mistake how important a win in the Mersey derby would be for Liverpool. This could be exactly what the team needs as a springboard. With Everton chasing a first win at Anfield since 1999, there could be no better time for last season’s Liverpool to reappear. Liverpool were beaten 3-1 by Premier League champions Manchester City in August . Koeman is piling pressure on Pochettino . It's a big weekend for a number of managers, not least Mauricio Pochettino, who takes Tottenham into the north London derby. If Tottenham were to lose at the Emirates Stadium today following last week’s disappointing performance against West Bromwich, Pochettino would be considered to have had a poor start to his reign at White Hart Lane. In contrast, Southampton — the side he left behind — have been going from strength to strength and it will not have gone unnoticed by him that Ronald Koeman, his replacement, delivered a win at Arsenal in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday. Mauricio Pochettino would be considered to have had a poor start should Spurs lose at Arsenal . Southampton’s flying start will have heaped a little bit of pressure on Pochettino, as they look as if they are improving without him. David Moyes faced this problem 12 months ago, when Manchester United struggled and Roberto Martinez, his replacement, began to improve Everton. I am a big fan of Pochettino and I thought his work at Southampton was excellent. His teams were aggressive, well organised — he reminded me at times of how Rafa Benitez used to set up Liverpool — but he has gone to a club where expectations are greater and results are demanded. Tottenham’s ambition is to make it back into the Champions League and while it will be difficult to get into the top four, Pochettino will be expected to oversee a better challenge for those places. There could be no better place to launch his reign than the Emirates. Ronald Koeman is doing a good job at Southampton and saw his side beat Arsenal in midweek . Emmanuel Adebayor (left) and Erik Lamela look frustrated as Spurs lose at home to West Brom . This week I'm looking forward to... Seeing Jamie Vardy build on last week’s heroics. Watching Vardy’s jet-heeled performance against Manchester United from the safety of a TV studio made me feel relieved to be retired! He was bursting with energy and enthusiasm and tormented United’s defenders, stealing the show in a remarkable game. To see Vardy thriving on the big stage set a great example to young footballers of how they should never give up on their dream. Jamie Vardy had a day to remember as he helped Leicester beat Manchester United last weekend . Vardy deserves great credit for forcing his way through the ranks, from non-league Stocksbridge Park Steels to Leicester via Fleetwood and Halifax Town, and he will remember the day he took United apart for the rest of his life. The thing about the Premier League, though, is that it does not allow you a moment to sit back and think you’ve cracked it. You constantly face new challenges and you cannot dwell on what has gone before. So, to take his game forward, Vardy must produce in lesser matches, such as today’s clash with Crystal Palace. If he can do that consistently, he will ensure his name stays in the headlines. He has certainly given himself a fantastic base to build from. Vardy has battled his way up from non-League football all the way up to the top flight with Leicester .","Liverpool have endured a difficult start to the Premier League season .

"Vaclav Havel, pictured in 2005, died at his weekend this morning, according to his assistant . Vaclav Havel, who became the first Czech president after leading the bloodless Velvet Revolution against communist rule, died yesterday aged 75. The dissident playwright was instrumental in opening the door to democracy in Eastern Europe by loosening the Soviet grip. Tributes flooded in from world leaders who hailed him as ‘the greatest European of our age’. Havel was invited by Margaret Thatcher to 10 Downing Street  during his first official visit to the UK after the collapse of communism in 1989. As well as steering his country towards freedom, he also oversaw the peaceful 1993 split of Czechoslovakia into two separate countries – the Czech Republic and Slovakia. David Cameron said he was ‘deeply saddened’ at his death. ‘Havel devoted his life to the cause of human freedom,’ said the Prime Minister. ‘For years, communism tried to crush him and to extinguish his voice. But Havel, the playwright and the dissident, could not be silenced. ‘No one of my generation will ever forget those powerful scenes from Wenceslas Square two decades ago. Havel led the Czech people out of tyranny. And he helped bring freedom and democracy to our entire continent. ‘Europe owes Vaclav Havel a profound debt. Today his voice has fallen silent. But his example and the cause to which he devoted his life will live on.’ Thousands of people gather in Venceslaw's Square in Prague as a flag is passed over the crowd of mourners . Soldiers stand guard next to a portrait of Havel, set in his memory at the Prague Castle today . A man takes in the news from a commemorative issue of DNES that was handed out to mourners . Hundreds of candles have been lit this evening in tribute to Havel at Wenceslas Square in Prague this evening . Foreign Secretary William Hague said: ‘Cold War hero, playwright and president. He opened the door to democracy in Eastern Europe and will always be remembered.’ He added: ‘He played a pivotal role in the development of freedom in Europe.’Havel never won the Nobel Peace prize despite being nominated several times for the honour. But he was bestowed with America’s highest civilian award by then President George W. Bush who called him ‘one of liberty’s great heroes’. Revolutionary: Havel waves to massive crowds of demonstrators in Prague's Wenceslas Square in 1989, following the collapse of communism and introduction of a new government . National hero: President Havel and his wife Dagmar wave from the balcony of Prague Castle after Havel was sworn in for a second term as president in 1998 . The former chain smoker, who survived several operations for lung cancer and a burst intestine that nearly killed him, died at his country home north-east of the Czech capital Prague. He had a history of chronic respiratory problems dating back to his years locked in dank communist prisons. In recent public appearances recently he appeared thin and drawn. Born in 1936 to a wealthy family  in Czechoslovakia, he began co-writing plays during his military service in the 1950s. His first  solo play, The Garden Party, was staged in 1963. Respected: Havel in discussion with former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in April 2002 .

"PC Matthew Dan Fisher has been jailed for 15 months for his string of charges . A 'sex pest' police officer who used the national police computer system to target women has been jailed for 15 months. Matthew Daniel Fisher, 37, was found guilty last month of sexual assaults on two women he was supposed to be helping when he served with North Yorkshire Police. He also admitted two misconduct in a public office charges after engaging in sexual activity with a woman in a police van outside Selby bus station and having sexual contact with another woman who was on a night out while he was on duty. Today Judge Michael Mettyear said he accepted that married father-of-two Fisher had done good, even brave, work as police officer. But he told him: 'You let yourself down, let your family down and let the police force down.' The judge told Hull Crown Court: 'You clearly have a high sexual appetite and you found it difficult to resist feeding that whenever you could.' He added: 'Anybody who took your eye and attracted you, you wanted to make contact with in the hope that sexual activity would follow.' Jurors heard the twice-married officer would meet women while he was on patrol in the Selby area and flirt with them, often offering his sexual services in their own homes. Some of the sexual contact was consensual while other acts were not, the judge was told. The court heard how one of the sex assaults Fisher carried out involved him putting a woman’s hand on his penis when she asked for a lift from him during a call-out. The woman was an alcoholic drug user and the judge said she was clearly vulnerable. Judge Mettyear said: 'You couldn’t resist trying it on with her.' He said: 'In the context of your role and in the context of her vulnerability it was extremely bad conduct by you.' he court heard how one of the sex assaults Fisher carried out involved him putting a woman's hand on his penis when she asked for a lift from him during a call-out . Fisher was also convicted by the jury of assaulting a woman by pulling up her top to look at her breasts and putting her hand on his groin. The judge said the woman had got fed up with Fisher’s constant suggestive and inappropriate behaviour whenever he came in contact with her. He told him he was making a nuisance of himself 'as a sex pest'. The judge said he regarded Fisher’s misuse of the police computer system as a serious offence but accepted there had been much worse examples which had led to officers derailing whole investigations. He said: 'Using a public resource like that, for that reason, in that hope, is absolutely unacceptable.' The court was told Fisher has offered his resignation as a police officer but this has not yet been accepted for procedural reasons. But the judge said he accepted the defendant’s career in the force was over. He was also told how Fisher had been commended during his career in the police - for talking down someone who was threatening to jump from a bridge in Selby in 2007. His barrister, Steven Crossley, said he was also likely to have received another commendation for grabbing someone threatening to jump from the Ouse Bridge, near Goole, in 2011, but these proceedings intervened. Mr Crossley said his client was also praised in 2010 for an incident in which he followed three men into a dark building 'despite the obvious risks of that'. He told the judge: 'He’s brought disgrace and shame upon himself but demonstrated that, on occasions, he was a brave police officer and, on occasions, he was prepared to put himself at risk for others.' Fisher, of Selby, was found guilty of three counts of sexual assault against two women and one misconduct charge relating to using a police computer to look up personal details. He admitted charges of misconduct in relation to having consensual sex while on duty. Fisher stood in dock today wearing a black suit, a white open-neck shirt and sporting a closely shaved hair cut. He showed no emotion as he was jailed.","Matthew Daniel Fisher found guilty last month of sexual assaults on two women he was supposed to be helping .

"The Union Jack will have to be dumped as Britain’s national flag if Scotland votes to separate, the Government’s official advisers warn today. One leading expert described Whitehall as ‘terrified’ and ‘woefully unprepared’ for the risk of losing an iconic UK emblem. Another key adviser, Lord West, said it was ‘a nonsense’ to suggest Scotland’s saltire cross could remain part of the design. The Government’s main advisers on flag policy are the Parliamentary Flags and Heraldry Committee, and the Flag Institute. Lord West, deputy chairman of the committee, said: ‘In the event of a Yes vote I cannot see how you can save the flag of the United Kingdom.’ Charles Ashburner, of the Flag Institute, described Whitehall as ‘woefully unprepared for the flag-related consequences’ of the Scottish poll. ‘Everyone in Government seems terrified of taking this on,’ he said. Pictured below are four flags which Mr Ashburner said might, with some possible tweaks, be suitable replacements for the Union Flag.

"Scott and Bailey, now in its third series, is a traditional detective show but also one about women with stressful jobs and imperfect home lives . Funny thing about severed heads: they’re more-ish, like Easter eggs. No sooner had we enjoyed Nigel Planer’s disembodied bonce, staring from underneath frosty eyebrows amid bags of frozen peas in Jonathan Creek on Monday night, than we were treated to another, on Scott And Bailey. This was murder most foul-smelling. The police who discovered the body came reeling out of the house with their hands over their faces. ‘Body at the top of the stairs, head at the bottom, blood everywhere,’ choked one. It was an old-fashioned whodunnit. The . old lady, a heavy drinker, had not been alone when she died — but her . husband Joe was bedridden, and apparently senile. ‘Joe couldn’t knock . the skin off a rice pudding,’ insisted Sergeant Janet Scott (Lesley . Sharp). There were other . suspects — and powerful motives. The couple’s four children had suffered . years of sexual abuse — and one of them had been driving around her . childhood streets on the night of the killing. Nicola . Walker stole the show as one of the daughters, a department store . make-up saleswoman, who heard the news of her mother’s death with an . impassive stare, but scene by scene dissolved into a dishevelled wreck. It was an award-worthy performance, made more striking by the fact that we saw Walker on Tuesday as a daffy airhead in Sue Perkins’s sitcom Heading Out and last week as the cool-headed, gang-busting policewoman in Prisoners’ Wives. Scott And Bailey, back for a third series, is a traditional detective show that can trace its heritage back to Dixon Of Dock Green: there’s even a blue ‘Police’ lamp in a station doorway during the opening credits. But it’s also a show about ordinary women with stressful jobs and imperfect home lives. This wasn’t feminist, it was simply female: it even started with a good gossip in the ladies’ loo. Later, DC Rachel Bailey (Suranne Jones) was coming to terms with how boring her husband was, after the honeymoon had fizzled out. She knew he loved her, but he loved his Xbox, too . . . and he was so shallow there wasn’t much difference between the two emotions. ‘Women really are from Venus,’ Scott consoled her, ‘and men are from the planet Zog.’ As the new series of Coast, a celebration . of this island race, began on BBC2, my prize for a woman who beat the . men at their own game went to Rose Hanks. Rose was the first woman ever . to ascend the podium of the Isle of Man TT motorbike races after riding . to a sidecar victory beside husband Norman in 1968. Coast presenter Nick Crane traced the history of the Napoleonic privateers on Guernsey in last night's programme . Coast is a 'celebration of this island race' The camera recreated the bone-rattling circuit Rose and Norman had taken around the island’s winding moorland roads, and we saw archive stills of Rose, leaning so far out of the sidecar that she was almost surfing the Tarmac. Here she was — a true heroine. Daredevilry was the order of the night. On Guernsey, presenter Nick Crane traced the history of the Napoleonic privateers, legalised pirates awarded a royal charter by George III to plunder French ships. ‘Privateering was a middle-class occupation,’ Crane explained, ‘whereas the Navy was for the upper classes.’ The pirate spirit lived on, during the Nazi occupation of the Channel Islands after 1940. One survivor, Stanley Bochard, recalled how he and his schoolmates used to lob fistfuls of turf, like throwing hand grenades, out of a roadside ditch at the passing cars. One sailed through an open window and hit a German officer full in the face. Brutal reprisals were avoided when Stanley’s headmaster ordered him to write a letter of apology to the Kommandant. Heroism came to the fore again off the Norfolk coast during World War I, when Sopwith Camel biplanes were launched from boats at night. These were the earliest sort of aircraft carriers. The captain would steer into a headwind, the pilot would rev his engine, and if there was enough breeze to lift the wings, the ropes securing the aeroplane to the boat would be cut. Sometimes the plane would flip into the sea, sometimes the pilot would be aloft, reading his instrument panels by torchlight and hunting for Zeppelin airships. I suspect Rose Hanks, Queen of the TT, would have loved it.","Scott and Bailey is a traditional detective show but .

"Desserts like Angel Delight and Instant Whip have been blamed by the government for the decline of English apples. Environment Secretary Liz Truss lamented that the orchard was 'a rare sight' with two-thirds of apples imported from overseas. She claimed families had turned to 'newfangled' desserts instead of making an old-fashioned apple crumble, and took a swipe at the EU for encouraging farmers to rip out orchards.

Official figures show that Britain produced 416,200 tonnes of apples 25 years ago but by 2012 it has more than halved to 202,900. Writing in The Times, Miss Truss said the apple had 'always been a part of Britain' but two-thirds are now imported. 'The orchard is a rare sight,' she warned. 'Various malefactors have been involved. The EU gave out grants in the 1970s and 1980s, encouraging farmers to rip out orchards. 'Consumers reached for easily made, newfangled products such as Angel Delight or Instant Whip rather than make an apple crumble. 'Shoppers were tempted by imports of the heavily marketed Pink Lady from Australia or Golden Delicious from France.' Miss Truss said the decline of apples had in part been cause by the popularity of easy desserts like Angel Delight, instead of making traditional crumbles . However, she has pinned her hopes of a revival on the popularity of the Great British Bake-Off, with people taking more interest in the food they cook, and eat. She added: 'More can be done. I will not rest until the British apple is back at the top of the tree.' A spokesman for Premier Foods, which owns Angel Delight, said: 'We're delighted that Angel Delight is so popular; however, we're not sure Angel Delight and similar desserts are solely responsible for a decline in British apple consumption. 'Premier Foods is fully committed to supporting British agriculture and every year we alone buy around 3,000 tonnes of British apples for Mr Kipling's Exceedingly Good Apple Pies.'","Liz Truss warns the apple orchard is now a 'rare sight' in the countryside .

"The message from Brendan Rodgers was simple. Amid all the chatter about contracts, playing time and the future, his thoughts on Steven Gerrard could be boiled down to two words: don’t go. Liverpool’s captain might not be the rampaging, goalscoring force of nature of 10 years ago but, to his manager, Gerrard’s importance to the club, the help he provides and the example he sets every day at Melwood cannot be stressed enough. Theirs is not the kind of relationship Manuel Pellegrini and Frank Lampard share at Manchester City. Gerrard isn’t having an unexpected Indian summer like his old England colleague and doesn’t have the assistance of an assortment of World Cup, Champions League and Premier League winners. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers left Steven Gerrard on the bench for Saturday's game against Stoke . The captain was on the pitch when the winner was scored by Glen Johnson five minutes from time . Gerrard applauds the fans as they chant his name after his side's 1-0 win over Stoke City . Glen Johnson strikes late with a header to give his side a much-needed 1-0 victory at Anfield . Many comparisons have been made recently about how Gerrard could do for Liverpool what Lampard has been doing for City but when the subject was broached yesterday morning at Melwood, Rodgers’ answer was as robust as it was significant. For Pellegrini, Lampard flourishing is a bonus. By contrast, Gerrard remains Rodgers’ most trusted lieutenant. If he does not take up the offer of extending what has been a lifelong association with Liverpool, the issues will not be easily solved. ‘Steven Gerrard is a man in his own right and incomparable with most,’ said Rodgers. ‘Liverpool and Manchester City are different. They have totally different squads and different ideas of working. Steven’s own situation is also different. Rodgers (left) has a frank discussion with Gerrard during Liverpool's clash with West Ham in September . Rodgers. however, is keen to retain the 34-year-old Liverpool veteran as a central figure at the club . Manuel Pellegrini (right) has been boosted by Frank Lampard's superb form since his loan move . Fomer Chelsea legend Lampard (left) is having an Indian summer since his short-term move to Man City . ‘I certainly won’t be retiring this summer. I will play beyond this season. We will have to wait and see whether that’s at Liverpool or somewhere else. That’s Liverpool’s decision. If they don’t come then I will see what’s out there.’- From Ian Ladyman's exclusive interview . ‘He’s had 16 incredible years here and I believe he can continue to work at this level for the next couple of years. But there are other factors involved that are as much about life as they are about football. One thing I know absolutely is that it is not about money. ‘I’m sure in time Steven will talk through the things he had to consider. But, for me, there is no drama. It is about managing a player who I have always admired and admire even more after having the chance to work with him, as a player and a person. I’ll manage that to the best of my ability and the calls I make will always be for the best of the team. I have a huge respect for Steven in terms of what he has done as a player and what he has done for me in my time here.’ Rodgers, undoubtedly, believes Liverpool are a better team when Gerrard is included and his keenness for the 34-year-old to stay on beyond this campaign needs little explanation: where else would he find a player on the open market to slip straight into his boots? Gerrard was instrumental in Liverpool's late charge in last season's title race but his costly slip against Chelsea allowed Demba Ba to score and steal victory at Anfield, from which they never recovered . Gerrard (left) was left on the bench by Rodgers for Liverpool's clash with Real Madrid at the Bernabeu . ‘To captain this club for the length of time he has and to take on the ambassadorial role like he has, is incredible,’ said Rodgers. ‘For me, there will always be a position for Steven here as a player. If he ever went away, I’m sure there will be a time later on where there will be a role for him back here. ‘He is a unique guy who is a proper legend of this football club. I am categorical. I want him to be here, but there is thinking time needed.’ Contrary to some reports circling at the weekend, the bond between Rodgers and Gerrard, who started on the bench for the 1-0 win over Stoke on Saturday, is strong. Gerrard (left) is no longer the player that drove Liverpool to Champions League glory in Istanbul in 2005 . The Liverpool midfielder is no longer able to run himself to a standstill as a he did in the 2006 FA Cup final . The 2014 version of Gerrard does not run himself to a standstill like the buccaneer who lit up Istanbul (2005) and Cardiff (2006) but that does not mean he isn’t as effective. There will have to be some tweaks to how he is deployed but Rodgers is in no mood to dispense with him. ‘For any player that (mental adjustment) is something that needs to be considered,’ said Rodgers. ‘You get to a stage where you can’t play every minute of every game. It is interesting when we have three games in a week I get asked: “Is he capable of playing three games?” ‘But the minute he is not played in one game I am asked: “Why isn’t he playing?” With Steven, he is getting to that point of his career and he will speak about the adjustments he needs to make. In time he will make the decision for his career.’","Steven Gerrard was benched for Liverpool's recent 1-0 win over Stoke .

"The judge in the Casey Anthony trial has been branded by a former mistress as big a liar as Casey! Judge Perry was praised for his cool, methodical handling of the controversial Casey trial but a source close to alleged mistress Janis Williamson paints an entirely different picture. The 61-year-jurist was a cheating cad who relentlessly pursued Miss Williamson and then dumped her to protect his career, claims the source. Shocking allegations: Healthcare consultant Janis Williamson says Judge Perry is a big lair . Father-of-two Judge Perry repeatedly lied to federal investigators after she brought their relationship out into the open and slapped him with a lawsuit, The National Enquirer quotes the source as saying. 'Judge Belvin Perry is as big a lair as Casey Anthony!' the source told the National Enquirer. 'Janis told me, ""The main is a flat-out liar who tried to destroy my life. It sickens me to hear people praising him. They don't know him like I do. He's a hypocrite"".' Mr Perry began pursuing Miss Williamson when she was a deputy court administrator for Florida's Ninth Judicial Circuit in 1989, the source said. Mr Perry was a circuit judge in Florida's Osceola County at the time. The source said: 'Janis said Judge Perry kept coming into her room and flirting with her. 'They played chess together and he kept asking her to lunch. Branded a womaniser: Judge Perry is accused of seeing other women while he's cheating on his wife with Janis . Convicted liar: Casey Anthony was kept behind bars for misleading police . 'Janis told me ""I'm a white woman from the South. The last thing I'd ever consider is having an affair with a black man. But Belvin persisted and one day he gave me a $250 JVC CD player"".' When asked what she had done to deserve such a gift, according to Janis the judge allegedly answered: 'Why don't you just give me a kiss.' The alleged affair began soon after, the source said. To set up their trysts, the judge would call to say he would be dropping off or leaving notes on her door with the code letter 'J', the source said. 'Janis told me that Belvin also invited her to parties at his home with his wife LaDrean and their two children. 'She said, ""He seemed to get a thrill out of taking the risk"",' the source added. It is also claimed that Mr Perry took Janis, now 62, to his house while his wife was out of town. According to the source, Mr Perry even juggled other women while he was cheating with Williamson. 'Janis told me that a woman called his hotel room when they were at a conference together, and Belvin admitted that he was seeing her,' the source said. Mr Perry often talked about leaving his wife and children - Belvin III is a 35-year-old insurance agent and Kimberly, 31, is an investments adviser - for Miss Williamson, said the source. 'Belvin told Janis that he loved her and talked about marrying her,' said the source. 'But she told me, ""I cared about Belvin, but I never loved him"".' Miss Williamson now works as a consultant for the Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration in Tallahassee. She claims that Mr Perry ordered her to deny their affair if it became public, said the source. After he was elected Chief Judge of the Ninth Judicial Circuit Court in 1995, Mr allegedly arranged for Miss Williamson to be fired. She filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 'Janis thinks Belvin had her terminated because it was too risky to continue their affair,' said the source. When EEOC investigators questioned Mr Perry about Miss Williamson, he initially denied the affair before confessing they had a one-year dalliance and then eventually coming clean, the source said. 'Belvin didn't admit the truth until he realised Janis had proof,' the source added. The proof included a calendar Miss Williamson kept, marking each sexually intimate tryst with a hand-drawn heart. The source said other evidence included a monogrammed leather toiletry kit that he kept in his office which she still had the receipt for. 'She also had what she called her ""Monica Lewinsky"" evidence - used condoms that he left on her nightstand,' the source said. In the wake of the scandal, Mr Perry stepped down as Chief Judge for two years, The Enquirer reports. The EEOC case ended in 1999, when Miss Williamson received a $65,000 settlement. The source said: 'Janis told me, ""What Belvis did was no different from what he sentenced Casey Anthony to jail for doing - he lied to investigators and got caught"".'","He fired me to further his career, says Janis Williamson .

"Hollywood may like to boast of its liberal ideals but it is still a man's world in many ways, a new study has shown. Not only are women dramatically under-represented on screen and behind the scenes, but even the most successful female stars are paid significantly less than men. Last year, of the 10 biggest payments to actors per film, not one went to a woman, according to research cited by the U.S. campaign group Women’s Media Centre. Angelina Jolie was the top earning actress last year after taking home a pay packet of $33 million. That figure was dwarfed however by the highest-earning man – Robert Downey Jr – who earned $75 million . Quoting analysis by the New York Film . Academy of the 2013 earnings of Hollywood’s best paid 10 male and 10 . female stars, the study found that while Angelina Jolie was the . top-earning actress, she lagged behind all but two of the men in the . list. And while, at $33 million, her pay packet was enormous, it was dwarfed by the highest-earning man – Robert Downey Jr – who earned $75 million. At the same time, the study found that age appeared to be far more of a dominant factor in women’s earning potential. Like Downey, star of the Iron Man films, most of the men are at least in their 40s, with two – Tom Cruise and Denzel Washington – in their 50s and Liam Neeson aged 61. In contrast, most of the women are in their 20s and 30s while the oldest, Sandra Bullock, is just 49. The gender inequality continues on-screen, said the report. At aged 23, Jennifer Lawrence (pictured in American Hustle) was the youngest female on the list, also coming just behind Jolie earning $26 million. Channing Tatum (right) came second behind Downey on the men's list earning $60 million last year . Hugh Jackman was the third highest Hollywood earner in 2013, according to the New York Film Academy, after earning $55m . Kristen Stewart, 23 (left), earned $21.5 million in 2013, while Jennifer Aniston bucked the trend of younger actresses making the most money. The 45-year-old earned $20 million . Only six per cent of the top 100 films made in 2012 cast the sexes in roughly equal numbers. Women accounted for only 29 percent of the speaking roles and all too often, they were primarily there to look decorative - roughly a third involved wearing sexually revealing clothes or being partially naked. Indeed, female characters were four times more likely to wear sexually revealing clothes or have to strip off than men. The survey also noted a disturbing rise in younger women actors being asked to shed their clothes on screen – the percentage of teenage girls depicted with some nudity has increased a third since 2007.

Of last year’s 250 top-grossing films, women accounted for 16 percent of directors and other senior roles. The study also looked at the representation of ethnic minorities and found they, too, are woefully under-represented. A majority of films had casts where fewer than one in 10 of the actors were black. ‘We know that what we see on screen is in direct proportion to who’s calling the shots,’ said Prof Stacy Smith, who led the study. ‘We were able to look across 500 films and see who was the director…and what we have is a representational road block.’","Of the 10-biggest payments to actors per film, not one went to a woman .

"Paul Scholes has moved to further stoke the festering Raheem Sterling row by stating he hopes Brendan Rodgers didn't put the winger under pressure to pull out of the England starting XI. The Liverpool man told Roy Hodgson that he was feeling tired just 24 hours before the win away in Estonia at the weekend - stirring a national debate on the legitimacy of ducking out.

Wayne Rooney 758 mins . Fabian Delph 741 mins . Adam Lallana 538 mins . But Scholes, writing in his Independent column, chose to question whether or not Rodgers had any influence over the weekend’s personnel changes. 'I really hope that there has been no pressure placed on him by Rodgers or anyone at his club to say that he was feeling tired or heavy-legged on Saturday,’ Scholes said. 'I really hope that his decision to tell Hodgson that he was not at his best was his, and his alone.' Sterling – who replaced club team-mate Jordan Henderson in the 64th minute in Tallinn - trained with Liverpool at Melwood on Tuesday and is set to form part of the squad to travel down to Queens Park Rangers on Sunday. And while the Reds clearly want their players fit and ready for the rigours of the Premier League, Scholes is insistent they shouldn’t hold the national side to account if they are not. Out of the players on international duty last week, only Chelsea’s Gary Cahill had played more minutes for his club this season. The dark mood has intensified over the last month thanks to the stand-off between Hodgson and Rodgers over the fitness of striker Daniel Sturridge, who picked up an injury in training. Sterling came on in the second half and made an impact, winning the free-kick for Wayne Rooney's winner . Roy Hodgson elected to use Sterling off the bench in Tallinn in an attempt to keep the midfielder fresh .

"Plastic bank-notes will arrive in Britain within three years, ending 160 years of tradition. The Bank of England has this morning announced that the next £5 and £10 notes will be printed on polymer. Since 1853, bank-notes have been made from cotton paper but the Bank has carried out three years of research on switching to polymer notes. Scroll down for video . Polymer: The current cotton paper notes will be replaced with more resilient plastic versions, such as the one shown here . Tough: The new notes can survive a wash at 90 degrees and are more difficult to counterfeit . These can be wiped clean and survive a hot washing machine cycle at 90 degrees. The new polymer notes will retain the familiar look of Bank of England banknotes, including the portrait of Her Majesty the Queen and a historical character. The first polymer note will be the £5 note featuring Sir Winston Churchill and will be issued in 2016. It will be followed around a year later by a polymer £10 note featuring Jane Austen. Announcing the decision Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, said: 'Ensuring trust and confidence in money is at the heart of what central banks do. 'Polymer notes are the next step in the evolution of banknote design to meet that objective. 'The quality of polymer notes is higher, they are more secure from counterfeiting, and they can be produced at lower cost to the taxpayer and the environment.' Echoing the sentiment John Sheridan, who leads on counterfeit currency for the National Crime Agency, welcomed the move. First up: The earliest plastic note to be issued will be the £5, featuring Winston Churchill, in 2016 . He said while no banknote is ever completely safe from counterfeiting, polymer notes will make life harder for those those trying to fake it. Polymer notes allow for security features including transparent windows. Criminals trying to replicate plastic banknotes will also face challenges copying the metallic strip on the notes. Mr Sheridan, added: 'The NCA welcomes the introduction of polymer banks notes which represent a significant improvement over cotton based technologies, with improved options for countermeasures and intervention opportunities for law enforcement.' Announcement: Bank of England governor Mark Carney made a speech introducing the new breed of bank note . In September, the Bank said it would . initially look only at changing the £5 and £10 notes, with the first one . being the new £5 featuring Sir Winston Churchill in 2016. At the time, . it promised to do nothing unless the public approved. If the feedback was overwhelmingly . negative, the Bank promised to scrap the idea. But the response to that consultation was overwhelmingly supportive of polymer notes. Over the course of two months, the Bank hosted events across the country to give the public the opportunity to learn more about polymer banknotes, to handle the notes, and to provide feedback. Nearly 13,000 individuals gave their views during the public consultation programme, with 87per cent of those who responded, being in favour of polymer, and only six per cent were opposed with seven per cent remaining were neutral. The decision follows a three-year research programme by the Bank looking at the materials on which banknotes are printed, and which concluded that there were compelling reasons to move to printing on polymer. The Bank's research found the plastic notes are resistant to dirt and moisture so stay cleaner for longer than the traditional paper notes. Current bank-notes are made from ‘cotton paper’, produced using tough, long-lasting cotton fibres rather than wood pulp. Polymer bank-notes would be made from a transparent, flexible polypropylene film coated with layers of special ink, usually white. This would be cut into sheets, with notes printed using standard equipment. The notes are very difficult to tear at first, but will rip easily once they have a nick in them. More than 20 countries use polymer notes, none of them in Europe. The Bank of New Zealand claims they last four times as long as paper notes. They can cope with going through a washing machine, but not being ironed at high temperatures. They start to ‘shrink and melt’ at 120C, the Bank’s report found. The Bank of England has accepted notes in some form – originally hand-written –  since its creation in 1694. The polymer bank-notes are secure and incorporate advanced security features making them harder to copy. And . the notes are more durable, lasting at least 2.5 times longer than . paper banknotes currently in circulation. As such the notes are more . environmentally friendly, and because they last longer, over time they . are cheater than paper notes. The switch is expected to save the Bank more than £100million over a ten-year period. A typical £5 note currently lasts for . just two years. The new ones would last for just under six years, . according to its research published in the autumn. Polymer notes are already . used in more than 20 countries, including Australia, New Zealand, . Mexico, Singapore and Mauritius as well as Canada. They can also be recycled, a move . which is likely to please the Governor of the Bank of England Mark . Carney's wife Diana, a committed environmentalist. The mother-of-four is well known as a green activist with a pet hate of individually-wrapped tea bags and as an advocate of pencils which last a lifetime. The polymer notes could be recycled in different ways, from producing household energy to being used to create garden furniture and plant pots. The new notes will be smaller than those already in circulation and while cash machines will be largely unaffected, the cassettes which hold £5 notes will have to be changed. A spokesman for LINK, which operates the UK cash machine network, said it is not known at this stage what the cost of adapting the country's cash machines will be. CEO John Howells welcomed the move to plastic, adding it proves 'cash still plays a vital role in our lives'. He said LINK will work closely with the Bank of England and the cash services industry to ensure a smooth transition to polymer notes, adding they will liase with counterparts in Canada and other countries where plastic notes are already in circulation. 'We are . always working hard to ensure the UK’s estate of ATMs is fit for the . 21st century and beyond, but this will also give our bank notes the . chance to continue to play their part in the future,' he said. 'While . the detailed planning is in the early stages and the full specification . of the new notes has still has to be announced LINK understand that the . changes required will involve at least modification of the cash . cassettes to accommodate the new note size and in some cases at least, . an engineer visit to each affected ATM to adjust various sensors. (L - R) Mary Macleod, Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, Stella Creasy and Caroline Criado-Perez, co-founder of the Women's Room, at the presentation of the concept design for the new Bank of England ten pound note, featuring Jane Austen . New notes: The new £5 and £10 notes which will be introduced in 2016 and will feature Winston Churchill and Jane Austen respectively will be the first to be transferred to the plastic polymer . 'Experience from other countries suggests that in most cases ATMs will be . able to cope with new polymer note denominations (£5s and in time £10s) and older style paper denominations (£20 notess) at the same time however . both paper and polymer of the same denomination are unlikely. 'Therefore . once an individual machine has been swapped to polymer for that . denomination then it will dispense them from that point onwards.' The Bank has said it understands the importance of notes in ‘everyone’s day-to-day lives’ and has held meetings in shopping centres and focus groups to test opinion. Consultation ended on November 15. The new notes would still feature the Queen as well as a famous person, such as the naturalist Charles Darwin. However, they would be slightly smaller than the cotton paper version. The current £5 note is 135mm by 70mm. If the switch to plastic goes ahead, the new one will be 125mm by 65mm. But they would continue ‘the existing format of tiered-sizing’, that is, the higher the denomination, the bigger the note. For those who frequently forget to take cash out of their pockets before washing their clothes, a shift to plastic would be a big benefit. Tests on the polymer notes in a 90-degree cycle had only ‘a minimal effect’ but paper notes  can be  ‘substantially degraded’. The Bank also tested the polymer notes by submerging them in liquids, including red wine, and found they could be ‘wiped clean’. Normal notes stain or disintegrate. In Canada, some users detected an aroma of maple on the plastic version, forcing the national bank to deny that any scent was added.","Since 1853, Britain's bank-notes have been made from cotton paper .

"Scientists in Cameroon have warned that eating monkeys and apes could cause the next HIV. They are already tracking a HIV-like virus called simian foamy virus, and fear more viruses could spread and lead to a global health crisis. 80 per cent of the meat eaten in Cameroon is killed in the wild and is known as ‘bushmeat’,with gorilla, chimpanzee or monkey favourites. Chimps in Cameroon: 80 per cent of the meat eaten in Cameroon is killed in the wild and is known as 'bushmeat', with gorilla, chimpanzee or monkey favourites . Tonkin snub-nosed monkey: Monkeys and apes are targets for bushmeat - and scientists worry viruses could spread to humans . According to oneestimate, up to 3,000 gorillas are slaughtered in southern Cameroon every year. Elsewhere, the Washington-based Bush Meat Crisis Task Force estimates that up to five milliontons of wild animals are being ‘harvested’ in the Congo Basin every year – the equivalent of 10 million cattle. A study earlier this year by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), identified evidence of viruses,including simian foamy virus, in illegally imported wildlife products confiscated at several U.S. international airports, including John F. Kennedy International Airport, George Bush Intercontinental-Houston and Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International. Babila Tafon, headvet at the primate sanctuary Ape Action Africa (AAA), in Mefou, just outside the Cameroon capital Yaounde, has spotted the virus in animals brought to his sanctuary. The AAA cares for22 gorillas and more than one hundred chimps which are orphans of the bush meat trade. Mr Tafon tests the blood of all apes arriving at the sanctuary. He says he has recently detected the simian foamy virus, which is closely related to HIV, in the apes. A dish prepared with bushmeat: Scientists worry that HIV-like viruses could jump between species due to the trade in the meat . ‘A recent surveyc onfirmed this is now in humans, especially in some of those who are huntersand cutting up the apes in the south-east of the country,’ he said. He also believes that ebola may be present, and caused a recent mass death in a nearby village. ‘In the village of Bakaklion our brothers found a dead gorilla in the forest,’ said Felix Biango,a village elder. ‘They took it back to the village and ate the meat. Almost immediately, everyone died – 25 men, women and children – the only person whodidn't was a woman who didn't eat the meat.’ Professor Dominique Baudon, the director of the Pasteur Centre in Yaounde, Cameroon’s capital, says he is concerned  viruses could quickly spread. He says that the deeper poachers go in to the forest, and the more that primates are consumed,the more exposed people become to new unknown viruses and the more potential there is for the viruses to mutate into potentially aggressive forms. Government researchers admit they do not know what the long term effects of SFV in humansare, and the Canadian government recently said they are not even sure how it is transmitted. ‘The exact method of transmission hasn't been confirmed, but there are indications that the virus may be transmitted through exposure to blood, saliva and other bodily fluids from affected animals,’ it said.","80% of meat eaten in Cameroon is bushmeat including gorilla and chimp .

"Arsenal are willing to open the bidding for Everton midfielder James McCarthy at £16million. The Republic of Ireland international has been pinpointed by Arsene Wenger and his coaching staff as a player who is ready made for their team and who will provide the defensive discipline they are lacking. McCarthy only joined Everton from Wigan last year in a £13m deal and has continually caught the eye with the way he has marshalled their midfield alongside Gareth Barry and maintained a high level of consistency. Everton and Republic of Ireland midfield player James McCarthy (left) is a transfer target for Arsenal . McCarthy's performances have caught the eye of Arsene Wenger, who feels McCarthy would fit in his team . McCarthy (left) only signed for Everton last year but immediately became an important first team player . Everton are reluctant to sell any of their stars with pressure already coming from Chelsea for Seamus Coleman and several clubs monitoring Ross Barkley. McCarthy is very much part of their plans and Arsenal’s offer is likely to be rejected but they are willing to go higher to test Everton’s resolve. The 24-year-old McCarthy injured his hamstring against Wolfsburg on Thursday night and is out for at least around three weeks with a Grade One tear but that won’t deter Arsenal’s attempt.","Arsene Wenger has identified James McCarthy as a potential new addition .

"You can tell Manchester United are on the brink of being very special again. How? Easy - people have started clutching at straws just lately, desperate to criticise Louis van Gaal’s side. After Wayne Rooney was sent off against West Ham earlier this season a Twitter rumour started that the Manchester United and England captain had got himself red carded deliberately because he had a private plane waiting, and he needed to depart early for some sort of celebrity social event that evening. Another rumour started that Rooney had fallen out with Robin van Persie, and that’s why they weren’t playing well together for United. Wayne Rooney lashed out at Stewart Downing at Old Trafford to earn himself an early bath . Rooney was shown the a red card for kicking out at Downing but United held on to beat West Ham 2-1 . Rumours that Rooney and Robin van Persie (centre) had fallen out were quickly dispelled . Well I was at Old Trafford that day when United beat the Hammers 2-1, and at around 6pm, long after the final whistle, both Rooney and van Persie were suited up, on the pitch, playing football with their children and seemingly having a great time together. So that killed both of those nonsense rumours at once. It’s interesting that people seem desperate to criticise and bring down Manchester United. Another example: I’m forever being told that Radamel Falcao was a bad signing. If United had paid £50m for him and given him a six-year contract then the critics might have a point. But his injury record isn’t great so that’s why United only signed him on loan; a shrewd move. Despite not arriving at the club until the World Cup was over, and despite an injury list that would leave Florence Nightingale in pieces, Van Gaal put together a team that faltered for the first couple of months of the season, but entertained us royally in flashes. Radamel Falcao has played a bit-part role since joining United on loan from Monaco this summer . Falcao has struggled with injury and sat out the Manchester derby last month which United lost 1-0 . It was never going to be smooth. Think about the wreckage of last season. Backroom staff decimated, morale low, players left, others struggled for confidence and form, and United were awful to watch. I always speak to fans when I go to games up and down the country, and the general consensus at United is that this season, despite a few poor results, the football under van Gaal is a significant improvement from last season, and the fans are happy with that. There are two results that United’s critics seem to be living off – the 5-3 defeat at Leicester and the 4-0 reverse at MK Dons. United were brilliant at Leicester until an inexplicable decision from Mark Clattenburg gave Leicester a penalty and United crumbled. But people read way too much into that game; they even said it showed Leicester will be fine in the Premier League this season. As I write this they are bottom and haven’t won a game since they beat United. The problems United suffered that day are easily rectified, but critics were too quick to forget how spectacular the football was that took them into a 3-1 lead. United slumped to defeat against MK Dons in the Capital One Cup with an experimental side . Louis van Gaal used the MK Dons defeat to analyse his side and subsequently, three senior players left . Jamie Vardy turns away to celebrate after putting Leicester 4-3 up against United earlier in the season . But until they collapsed, United played well against Leicester with Angel di Maria scoring this stunner . As for the defeat in Milton Keynes, of the five senior players who started that game, three have left (Javier Hernandez, Danny Welbeck and Shinji Kagawa) and Anderson hasn’t started a game since. It was a game van Gaal used to find out more about some of his senior professionals. He probably wasn’t expecting such a beating, but the Capital One Cup wasn’t high on his priority list this season. So United now find themselves in the top four despite so many people saying they have wasted a load of money and are poor. The worrying thing for the United haters is that they keep improving. I’m sure there will be dips and they will come unstuck in some matches but just take a look at the last two games. Van Gaal totally out-coached Arsene Wenger with a game plan that earned three points at Arsenal, and then destroyed inferior opposition with some breathtaking football against Hull. Wayne Rooney and Angel di Maria are in brilliant form; Michael Carrick’s control and passing are being trusted again; David de Gea is currently the best keeper in the Premier League. United look to have turned the corner and were impressive in their narrow victory over Arsenal . Rooney was on target on Saturday as United strolled to victory over Hull at Old Trafford . With even more improvement, and maybe more signings to come in January, the Premier League has a lot to fear from Manchester United. Van Gaal is a man who looks you in the eye when he talks to you and answers your questions. His press conferences are informative and entertaining – he speaks to the fans through the media, which is exactly what should happen. I admire his sincerity. And I even like the way he approached his criticism of the festive schedule in England. He said it isn’t good for players who have families, but then added: ‘I have to adapt, and I shall adapt.’ As much as the United-haters loved last season, they are beginning to dislike this campaign, with United showing signs they are on their way back. They are a joy to watch at times, and if they can get the injury list down and add consistency to their undoubted quality, Van Gaal may be on the brink of producing something extra special at Old Trafford. This manager is even making Chris Smalling look good, so anything is possible. Even Chris Smalling, who has had his struggles at United, has improved under the guidance of Van Gaal .","Manchester United's critics have been out in force this season .
But they are living off two results -  defeats to Leicester and MK Dons .
United's start was never going to be smooth after the troubles last season .

"Diego Godin has emerged as a target for Manchester United when the transfer window re-opens next month. The Atletico Madrid star is one of several players being considered by Louis van Gaal as he looks to ease the defensive crisis at Old Trafford. United are keen on Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels and have also watched Basle's Fabian Schar, Real Madrid youngster Raphael Varane and Dynamo Kiev star Aleksandar Dragovic. Scroll down for video .

Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels (left) and Real Madrid's Raphael Varane have been watched by United . Basle's Fabian Schar (left), pictured tackling Cristiano Ronaldo, has also been watched by United this season . Van Gaal is determined to bolster his options  after   injuries to key defenders have left him unable to name a settled back four this season. United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward will find out who is available in January, although the club could choose to meet Godin's £28million buy-out clause. The 28-year-old, who helped Atletico win La Liga in May and reach the Champions League final, has played every minute of every league game for Diego Simeone's side this season. The Spanish side are currently four points behind league leaders Real Madrid but they would be unable to stop Godin moving to Manchester if United meet his release clause. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal is keen to strengthen his defence during the January transfer window . Aston Villa defender Ron Vlaar (right) is also under consideration by the Old Trafford club . Dortmund are struggling at the bottom of the Bundesliga and are unlikely to cash in on Hummels, while Van Gaal is also considering a move for compatriot Ron Vlaar at Aston Villa. The Red Devils have been boosted by the return to fitness of Jonny Evans, who turned out for the club's Under 21 side against Southampton on Monday night. The 26-year-old has made just three top-flight appearances this season after picking up a serious ankle injury against Leicester in September.","Louis van Gaal wants to sign a new central defender next month .

"The bowl was set on the table in front of me next to the bottle of beer with a metallic clink. My mind did not even bother to process what it was that had been set in front of me; I was looking out over the Gulf of Thailand, talking, drinking and having fun. Besides, who would set anything other than peanuts in front of someone at a bar? My hand goes into the bowl to pick up one small object to send it hurtling into my mouth with the unerring aim of a man who has spent much of his life throwing food down his gullet. As it hits my tongue, something seems off. Scroll down for video . Jason Brink stumbled across insects as a snack after mistaking a bowl of crickets for peanuts . He maintains there are few snacks that are better tasting and more healthy than crispy crickets dusted with salt and chilli pepper or giant locusts - 'you just need to remember to remove the legs and head' The peanut seems too soft somehow, and has a strange metallic flavour to it. I wash it down with a swig of beer and pick up the bowl. Crickets… . This was my introduction to the art of eating insects, or entomophagy. In some areas of Thailand, insects are an extremely popular snack, and are sold from street carts and in restaurants. To be completely honest, there are few snacks you can eat at a bar that are better tasting and more healthy than crispy crickets dusted with salt and chilli pepper or giant locusts; you just need to remember to remove the legs and head. Since that first introduction, I have continued to eat insects at least occasionally, and found that they are a healthy, tasty, and high-protein addition to my diet. With only 121 calories per 100 grams of crickets (vs 567 calories for a comparable snack food, peanuts), it is clear to see how they are a good addition to the diet for a man waging a personal war against fat. Also, unlike peanuts or crisps (for all my British MAN v FAT friends), it is almost impossible to eat crickets non-stop. Mr Brink, who lives in Thailand, claims insects are a 'healthy, tasty, and high-protein addition' to his diet . Recently, I was introduced to an excellent Thai delicacy from Northern Thailand that is essentially young wasps and termites with a few giant ants, cooked with lemongrass and chilli peppers and served over rice, you can see that particular dish below. In addition to being delicious, it was far and away healthier than the alternative stir-fried chicken or beef. Available seasonally, this delicacy is something I would happily eat any day of the year. Many of us coming from Western cultures have been raised on steady diets of 'meat and potatoes', and have been told that they are healthy, balanced diets. While there is nothing intrinsically wrong with these things, other cultures around the world live with radically different diets and lifestyles that we can learn from. While eating insects is seen by us as a strange thing to do, they are, gram for gram, some of the best protein available. While eating insects is seen by many in the West as strange thing to do, they are, gram for gram, some of the best protein available . Companies such as Bitty Foodsin San Francisco have been pioneering a baked-goods industry in which cricket flour is substituted for grain flour, making cookies which are protein rich, sustainable, gluten-free and far better for you than their alternative. Over the past century, the food choices available in the Western world have exploded in a decidedly negative way. We have the ability to transform our diets from the steady stream of junk food, to which so many are accustomed, to an entirely different and decidedly broader global culinary adventure. It is up to us to make decisions about the future of our waistlines and our planet, and the best option might be a little more creepy-crawly than we initially suspected. Read more at www.manvfat.com . The World Health Organisation says insects are a more sustainable protein source than other more commonly eaten meats. The UN's Food and Agricultural Agency says that more than two billion people - 30 per cent of the planet's population - already supplement their diet with insects. Insects are 'extremely efficient' in converting feed into edible meat, according to the WHO report. On average, they can convert 2 kilograms (4.4lb) of feed into 1 kilogram (2.2lb) of insect mass. In comparison, cattle require 8 kilograms (17.6lb) of feed to produce a kilo of meat. Currently, most edible insects are gathered in forests and what insect farming does take place is often family-run and serves niche markets. The World Health Organisation says insects are a more sustainable protein source than other more commonly eaten meats . But the U.N. says mechanisation can ratchet up insect farming production. The fish bait industry, for example, has long farmed insects. Insect farming is 'one of the many ways to address food and feed security,' the food agency said. 'Insects are everywhere and they reproduce quickly,' the agency said, adding they leave a 'low environmental footprint.' They provide high-quality protein and nutrients when compared with meat and fish and are 'particularly important as a food supplement for undernourished children,' it said. Insects can also be rich in copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, selenium and zinc, and are a source of fibre. The agency noted that its Edible Insect Program is also examining the potential of arachnids, such as spiders and scorpions, although they are not strictly speaking insects. University biologists have analysed the nutritional value of edible insects, and some of them, such as certain beetles, ants, crickets and grasshoppers, come close to lean red meat or broiled fish in terms of protein per gram. Last year, Selfridges reported an increase in sales of insect delicacies after the World Health Organisation suggested eating bugs could be the solution to worldwide food shortages. The department store recorded an 11 per cent increase in sales of Edible's insect-based snacks including Thai Green Curry Crickets, Dark Chocolate Covered Scorpions and BBQ Flavour Worm Crisps.","American Jason Brink, 29, lives in Thailand and regularly feasts on insects .

"Chelsea are 20 games without defeat this season but Nemanja Matic will never again be deceived by the illusion of a long unbeaten run. The pain remains fresh from the time when Benfica did not lose until the 29th and penultimate game of the Portuguese season — and still did not emerge with the title. Porto finished one point better off in a season when Benfica were also beaten in the Portuguese Cup final and lost to Chelsea in the Europa League final. Nemanja Matic (right) fights for the ball with Connor Wickham during Chelsea's game against Sunderland . Matic has received plaudits for his impressive performances in holding midfield for Chelsea this season . ‘We lost three titles in two weeks,’ recalled Matic. ‘It was very hard to take. These things happen only one season in a thousand years. We played well the whole season and were unbeaten for so long. It shows you can never be certain of anything. ‘If we want to win the league we must continue like this until the end. Even if we’re top and unbeaten with two games to go we must not believe we’ve won it. We must not stop until the title is ours. We must fight and at Chelsea I believe we are ready for that.’ Having dropped two points at Sunderland on Saturday, the Barclays Premier League leaders are now six clear of champions Manchester City as they move into a congested December fixture list, starting at home to Tottenham on Wednesday. Diego Costa, Eden Hazard and Cesc Fabregas have taken so much of the credit for Chelsea’s best-ever start but those inside the camp know the contribution of Matic has been immense. His midfield power provides the platform for others to sparkle and it is a role he relishes, even though he was a creative No 10 before being converted by Benfica boss Jorge Jesus into the position made famous at Stamford Bridge by Claude Makelele. Matic (centre left) appears with Tottenham's Harry Kane (centre right) ahead of the release of game 'The Crew' Matic (top) vies for the ball with West Brom's Saido Berahino during a Premier League match in November . ‘I’m happy to be asked about Makelele,’ said Matic. ‘That means I must be doing something right. Makelele is just a legend; one of the best players in the history of Chelsea. I know what I can do. I work really hard and the people will have to decide if we compare. This is my job. ‘The defensive midfielder has to win the ball and give it to the attacking players to create the game. We all do what we have to do in the game. We are happy like this. ‘I used to play as a No 10 before I was tall like this. But in this team? No, the others are better than me. I will stay where I am, in defensive midfield.’ Matic has travelled far since he was released by the academy at Red Star Belgrade. ‘I was there almost five years and one day they said there was no space for me and I had to move,’ he said. Matic (right) was a No 10 before Jorge Jesus turned him into a holding midfielder at Benfica . Matic is flattered by the comparisons between himself and former Chelsea holding midfielder Claude Makelele . From Serbia’s most famous club he dipped briefly into Serbia’s lower leagues and, six months later, at 18, signed for Kosice in Slovakia. ‘I was young and alone there,’ said Matic. ‘I didn’t know the language. I didn’t have friends and family and things like this have made me stronger.’ Legend has it, Red Star thought he was too frail, but Matic has filled out his 6ft 4in frame to become a muscular force to match his father Dragan, once a combative central midfielder in the Yugoslav second division. ‘I have seen some of his games on video cassettes but I’ve told him it was not good football, you can (pass) the ball back to the goalkeeper,’ smiled Matic. ‘I cannot speak to him about football because he is never happy with my game. If I do something great, he doesn’t see this. He only picks up on my mistakes. ‘He watches all my games on TV in Serbia, with his friends and after the game he will send me a message if we win: “Congratulations, but…”.’ Matic (right) not only lost out on the Portuguese title after 28 games unbeaten at Benfica, but they also lost to Chelsea in the Europa League final in the same season (pictured) Matic is comforted by now team-mate Branislav Ivanovic after the Europa League final in May 2013 . Tough-love roles change when it comes to his younger brother Uros, who has followed a similar path via Kosice and Benfica and now plays for NAC Breda in Holland. ‘He has quality but he needs to work a lot,’ said Matic. ‘I tell him to work hard and fight for his position. He needs to do better if he wants to go to a better level.’ Hard knocks have made Matic the midfield warrior he is. He faced rejection at youth level and again when Chelsea signed him in 2009, only to let him leave for Benfica 18 months later as a makeweight in the David Luiz deal. ‘To be honest it was not easy,’ he said. ‘Everybody was asking why I was back, but I wanted to show I had quality to play for Chelsea in the Premier League. When I first came, I was very young, and now I’m 26 and it is a big difference. I have lots of experience. ‘At Benfica, I played in the Champions League, I fought every year for the title and these things have made me stronger. I did good work in Benfica. I always fought for a position with the big players and this has made me better.’ Since his return to Chelsea in January, he has become one of the pillars of a team comfortable with the challenge of stretching their unbeaten run into the New Year and beyond. ‘You can say the record is putting pressure on us but I would rather have it this way than lose,’ said Matic, who has only lost four times in 42 Chelsea appearances. ‘I want to win every game. We are only interested in winning. It will be difficult to go through the whole season — we have many games to play against very good teams — but anything is possible. We know our qualities and what we can do. Maybe we can lose. Maybe we can remain unbeaten. ‘Let’s see. It depends only on us. If we win every game we are going to be champions. We know that is going to be hard but we are ready to fight.’ Nemanja Matic was appearing at a photo-shoot with a crew of fans to celebrate the launch of The Crew, a revolutionary new action-driving game from Ubisoft, out now on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox 360 and Windows PC.","Nemanja Matic was at Benfica when they missed out on the title .

"Sex Pistols front-man Johnny Rotten - real name John Lydon - urged voters to ignore Russell Brand . Veteran punk front-man Johnny Rotten has urged youngsters to ignore  Russell Brand – and make sure they get out and use their vote. The Sex Pistols lead singer, who once claimed to be the antichrist who wanted to ‘destroy passers-by’, said Brand was a 'b**hole'. Rotten, also known by his real name John Lydon, said: ‘If you don’t vote, you don’t count. It’s only a century ago that none of us had the right to vote and we don’t want to go back to that route.’ The 58-year-old refused to say who he supported, adding: ‘I’m very wary of tagging my name on to supporting any of those phoney b*****ds, but don’t be like Russell Brand.’ The remarks, to the Cheltenham Literature Festival, come after Mr Brand sparked controversy after calling on voters to ignore the upcoming election. The Hollywood star and comedian told the BBC: 'Don't bother voting. Stop voting stop pretending, wake up, be in reality now. Why vote? We know it's not going to make any difference.' He added: ‘It is not that I am not voting out of apathy. I am not voting out of absolute indifference and weariness and exhaustion from the lies, treachery and deceit of the political class that has been going on for generations.’ Brand said Mr Lydon's experience at state school ‘seemed to primarily be the installation of a belief system that placed his generation and class at the bottom of an immovable hierarchical structure’. But Mr Lydon urged people dissatisfied with politics to take their grievances to their local council. ‘Go to town hall meetings and give them f***ing hell,’ he said. ‘I’m not being flippant. If you don’t start locally you’re not going to change the world.’ It is not the first time Mr Brand’s comments have been criticised in public. Former Home Secretary David Blunkett said the comments were likely to further entrench people’s anger with politicians. He pointed to figures showing that ‘older people, wealthier people, better educated people, engaged people’ are most likely to vote, which ‘young people, poor people, badly educated people’ are the least. As a result politicians of all parties ‘fear alienating’ the more engaged, while choosing to ‘ignore’ those who do not bother voting, placing them instead in the ‘firing line’ for spending cuts. ‘Paradoxically the more those who are not engaged are ignored, targeted under the austerity programme and dismissed, the more alienated and disillusioned they become. Politicians they say ""don’t give a damn about us"".’ The Commons anti-sleaze watchdog has warned that the under-30s are particularly disenchanted, raising fears for the voter turnout in the future. But Mr Brand is not the only public figure to reveal that they had lost faith in the political process. Veteran former BBC presenter Jeremy Paxman revealed he failed to cast a ballot in a recent election because he was unable to choose between rival candidates. Comedian Russell Brand said people should not bother voting because there was a revolution coming . Former Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman said he once decided not to vote because the choice was so 'unappetising' Writing in the Radio Times, Mr Paxman said: ‘In one recent election, I decided not to vote, because I thought the choice so unappetising. ‘By the time the polls had closed and it was too late to take part, I was feeling really uncomfortable: the person who chooses not to vote – cannot even be bothered to write ‘none of the above’ on a ballot paper - disqualifies himself from passing any comment at all.’ But Paxman was heavily criticised by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg for setting a bad example. Mr Clegg said: ‘He’s a guy who gets paid £1million or thereabouts, paid for by taxpayers, he lives off politics and he spends all his time sneering at politics.’","Punk frontman once claimed to be antichrist who would 'destroy passers-by'

"Dr Charlotte Jones said the erotic Fifty Shades of Grey novels have led to older couples being more adventurous in bed . A rise in sexually transmitted diseases among older couples could have been caused by the ‘Fifty Shades of Grey effect’, a top doctor has warned. Dr Charlotte Jones said the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy has led to older couples being more adventurous in bed and could explain a rise in sexually transmitted infections among the over-50s. The film based on the best-selling erotic novels is due for release on Valentine's Day next year with Jamie Dornan in the role of billionaire Christian Grey. Dr Jones, chairwoman of the British Medical Association's GP Committee, said the novels' success is giving couples more sexual confidence but warned that there was a risk they were failing to use protection. She said: ‘When it comes to forgetting about safe sex we always think of the vulnerability of young people. ‘But there's the Fifty Shades of Grey effect where older people are being more explorative, but not necessarily remembering to use a condom. ‘Anyone, of any age, going into new relationships should be thinking about safe sex and particularly the role of condoms. 'People need to take care.’ Dr Jones revealed doctors are starting to see more cases of gonorrhoea and syphilis along with more common thrush and chlamydia. She said: ‘I would always advise anyone who has got any symptoms to get them checked out, whether at a GUM clinic where they can be anonymous or with their GP. ‘Do not be embarrassed, we have seen it all before, it cannot come as a surprise to us.’ Dr Jones revealed doctors are starting to see more cases of gonorrhoea and syphilis along with more common thrush and chlamydia .","Dr Charlotte Jones said older couples are being more adventurous in bed .

"Pfc. Naser Jason Abdo is shown here in his police mugshot after he was arrested in July 2011 . An HIV-positive soldier who was forced to wear a surgical mask in court to prevent him from trying to infect others was today found guilty of involvement in a plot to blow up a Texas restaurant full of soldiers. Jurors in the U.S. District Court in Waco deliberated for around an hour before finding Naser Jason Abdo guilty of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction, attempted murder of U.S. officers or employees, and four counts of possessing a weapon in furtherance of a federal crime of violence. Abdo, 22, did not stand with his attorneys when jurors and the judge entered the room, and showed no emotion when each of the six 'guilty' verdicts was read by the court clerk. He faces up to life in prison. His sentencing was set for July. Earlier Private First Class Abdo was flanked by courtroom security who wore protective glasses after an incident in which the soldier bit his lip and spat blood at police. He is believed to have been in contact with the influential U.S born cleric Anwar al-Awlaqi who was killed in a drone strike last year. Prosecutors called the first of 43 witnesses to the stand in a bid to demonstrate that Abdo, who went AWOL from his post at Fort Campbell in Kentucky to allegedly construct his bomb and gather weapons did intend to kill troops last summer. Opening statements began on Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Waco, about 50 miles northeast of Killeen. Abdo is not being tried in a military court. His lead defense attorney, Zachary Boyd, referred to the mask while questioning potential jurors on Monday. 'I have a concern. My client looks a little different today because he has a mask on,' said Boyd then asking if they had a problem with Abdo's mask. Nobody raised a hand. Naser Jason Abdo (left) wearing a mask appeared in court (right) at U.S District Court in Waco . A Department of Homeland Security officer stands guard outside the federal court building, in Waco, Texas where Naser Jason Abdo is on trial . The soldier has been accused of biting through his lip and spitting blood on a deputy U.S. marshal and a sheriff's deputy who were escorting him after a court hearing last month. Officials reported a previous blood-spitting incident on a jailer. McLennan County Sheriff Larry Lynch said he couldn't comment on why Abdo was wearing a mask in court, and a gag order prevents attorneys from discussing anything about the case publicly. Boyd also asked potential jurors if they would 'hold it against my client for being a Muslim,' and no hands were raised. Killeen police began investigating Abdo after an employee from Guns Galore, in Dallas called July 26, saying a young man bought six pounds of smokeless gunpowder, shotgun ammunition and a magazine for a semiautomatic pistol – while seeming to know little about his purchases, according to previous court testimony and documents. Naser Jason Abdo is accused of planning to bomb troops from Fort Hood in a restaurant near to the army base last summer . Officers also learned that he bought a U.S. Army uniform and a 'Smith' name patch from another store but didn't know his unit, according to testimony. After officers tracked Abdo to a motel near one of the Army post's gates, they detained him July 27. Authorities who searched his backpack and motel room say they found a handgun, ingredients for an explosive device and an article titled, 'Make a bomb in the kitchen of your Mom.' An article with that title appears in an al-Qaida magazine published by Anwar al-Awlaqi. 'I was planning an attack here in the Fort Hood community because I don't appreciate what my unit did in Afghanistan,' he can be heard telling a detective in a patrol car recording, played at a court hearing last month. Fort Campbell: Where Naser Jason Abdo was stationed before he went AWOL and traveled to Texas where he was apprehended by police . It is alleged by prosecutors that Naser Jason Abdo was in contact with al-Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaqi (left) and was inspired to attack Fort Hood soldiers by the massacre of 13 people at the hands of Army Major Nidal Malik Hasan (right) Abdo told authorities he planned to make two bombs and detonate them in a restaurant frequented by Fort Hood soldiers, according to documents in the case. While jailed in Waco last fall, Abdo told a Nashville television station that he originally planned to kidnap and videotape the 'execution' of a high-ranking Fort Campbell official 'who participated in the Afghan mission' – but fled after military police learned he was visiting nearby gun stores. He went AWOL from the Kentucky Army post over the Fourth of July weekend, about two months after he was charged with possessing child pornography, which put his conscientious objector status on hold. Abdo was absent-without-leave from Fort Campbell, Kentucky when he was arrested in Killeen. He told investigators he went to Texas to 'martyr himself' for the people of Iraq and Afghanistan, said FBI special agent C. Michael Owens, the first prosecution witness. A van exits the federal court building in August 2011, in Waco, Texas carrying Naser Jason Abdo . Owens testified that Abdo told investigators he planned to put a bomb in what looked like a gift box, leave it a Chinese buffet frequented by Fort Hood soldiers, wait outside and shoot any survivors. Owens testified earlier that Abdo said he had planned to offer a Fort Campbell soldier a ride, kill him and videotape it while reciting the names of people he felt had been wronged by the U.S. military — including Abeer Qassim al-Janabi, a 14-year-old Iraqi girl who was raped before she and her family were killed in 2006. Five current or former U.S. soldiers went to prison, one for a life term, for their roles in that attack. Speaking in court, defence attorney Boyb implored the court to understand that they could not prove that his client intended to kill not was any explosive device constructed. Greg Ebert called the police to report a suspicious transaction with Pfc. Naser Abdo, an AWOL soldier who was later arrested with bomb making materials in his nearby motel room for a planned attack on Fort Hood soldiers . 'I want the jury to focus not just on the evidence,but the law,' said Boyd. Abdo, who was born in Texas and grew up in a Dallas suburb, became a Muslim when he was 17. He enlisted in the military in 2009, thinking that the service wouldn't conflict with his religious beliefs. But according to his essay that was part of his conscientious objector status application, Abdo reconsidered as he explored Islam further. In that essay, which he sent to the Associated Press in 2010, Abdo said acts like the 2009 Fort Hood shootings 'run counter to what I believe in as a Muslim' and were 'an act of aggression by a man and not by Islam.'",Naser Jason Abdo could face life in prison over Texas bomb threat .
"Portugal has the highest percentage of female millionaires in the world, a report has found. Women make up less than a quarter of the country's fat cats (23 per cent), but it's still way above the Netherlands, which boasts only 5.9 per cent. While Britain fares better than some, with 11.4 per cent of UK millionaires being female, it . still comes in behind countries such as Thailand, Spain, Italy and . Singapore. Portugal has the highest percentage of female millionaires compared to men - 23 per cent . The USA is revealed to have just 9.4 per cent, Canada 9.2 per cent, Australia 8.8 per cent, while France has 8.5 per cent. The league table, compiled by Spears Magazine and wealth consultancy company WealthInsight, . shines a light on gender inequality in terms of individual wealth. Liberal countries, such as the Belgium . 6 per cent, Netherlands 5.9 per cent and New Zealand on 6.3 per cent, fare surprisingly badly. Saudi Arabia and Japan take the two bottom places, with 3.8 per cent and on 3.7 per cent respectively. Portugal - 23.8 per cent . Philippines - 21.0 per cent . Peru - 18.3 per cent . Hong Kong - 18.0 per cent . Turkey - 17.4 per cent . Netherlands - 5.9 per cent . Russia - 5.7 per cent . Mexico - 5.3 per cent . Saudi Arabia - 3.8 per cent . Japan - 3.7 per cent . Josh Spero, editor of SPEAR's magazine, says: 'The top ten most equal countries for multimillionaires are a diverse bunch and almost certainly not the ones you would have predicted. 'It certainly seems that Asia is leading the way in gender equality, perhaps reflecting emerging markets whose developing, increasingly wealthy economies are not bound by old forms of gender discrimination in business.' He adds: 'There are also surprises about the least equal countries for multimillionaires, although some are obvious: In Saudi Arabia, women can only work in jobs which don't bring them into contact with men, which obviously stifles economic opportunity. Asia is leading the way in gender equality, perhaps reflecting emerging markets whose developing, increasingly wealthy, economies are not bound by old forms of gender discrimination . 'Countries like the Netherlands, Belgium and New Zealand we might well assume had a fairer distribution of wealth with their liberal politics and diversified economies, so it is surprising to find otherwise. 'It is worth remembering, of course, that women make up over half the global population, so we can't really say any country is gender-equal until its wealth is divided much more along those lines. What is shocking is that no country is anywhere near that yet.' According to Oliver Williams of WealthInsight: 'There seems to be no correlation between emerging and developed countries in the top 10 female multimillionaire countries. 'However, if you consider that Hong Kong and Singapore are home to many of emerging Asia's multimillionaires, it appears that most of the top 10 countries are in fact emerging markets. This is a startling realisation when you think that it is Western countries leading the way in promoting gender equality.' The research also shows that the UK sits 15th in the world and 10th in Europe in terms of its percentage of female multimillionaires (11.4 per cent). Spero adds: ' According to the Harvard Business Review, female entrepreneurs make 20 per cent more revenue with 50 per cent less investment, so helping women into business is good for us all.'","Survey reveals gender divide among millionaires across the world .

"Cate Blanchett, who won an Oscar for her role in Blue Jasmine, pointed out the male domination in her Oscar speech, saying that women were not at the center of most stories in cinema . Despite this year's Oscar successes of films about women, or films starring women in protagonist roles, there are still only as many women in speaking roles as there were in the 1940s. A recent study from San Diego State University's school of Journalism, Media and Film reveals that speaking roles for women of all ages accounted for around only 33 per cent of characters in the top 100 grossing films last year. This figure is only slightly higher than the amount of women in major roles back in the 1940s when women played a secondary or minor role in only 78 per cent of the top 100 films of the decade. The study, conducted by Dr. Martha Lauzen, finds that there has been a 5 per cent increase in women characters in films since 2002, when women represented only 28 per cent of all characters. However, while the amount of women in movies has increased, those taking a protagonist or starring role has decreased, from 16 per cent to 11 per cent over the last ten years. Women are also likely to be younger than men when playing protagonists, and are more likely to be identified as married or single. While recent box office hits like Gravity and Blue Jasmine were both incredibly financially and critically successful, they are only a couple in the face of overwhelmingly male dominated films like The Wolf of Wall Street and Dallas Buyers Club. Gravity featured Sandra Bullock in a starring role, with her having almost all the screen time. But the film is only one of a few in 2013 to focus on women rather than men . Compared to the 1940s films like Citizen Kane and Casablanca, which focused mainly around men,  one would think that the amount of women in films has increased. But the study suggests the even though more women are directing films today, the portrayal of characters and protagonists are still masculine at the same ratio as the 40s. Dr. Lauzen, the study's author, says that the problem is not enough women are working in film behind the scenes. She said: 'Women comprise one-third to more than one-half of students in top film schools around the country. The study showed that women protagonists were younger more often than not, which could explain the popularity and marketability of stars like Jennifer Lawrence (left). It also showed that women had to have an identifiable profession more than men, such as Sandra Bullock (right) in the film Gravity . Even though there were many women victors at the Oscars, Matthew McConaughey was still an actor that got a lot of credit and will likely go on to get many more speaking roles than his women counterparts . 'In genres and venues that are more welcoming of women, their numbers skyrocket. 'Women account for 39% of directors working on documentaries screening at high-profile film festivals around the country, according to the latest Independent Women study, a far cry from the paltry 6% working on top grossing films' The graph shows the portrayal of different character types in the top grossing movies over the last year. The disparity is massive, and has changed very little from the 1940s . The study also shows the disparity in the different portrayals of characters that could be played by men or women, such as politicians or scientists. The study found that these sorts of careers are almost always played by men. Despite Oscar successes for films featuring women in starring roles, many of the films, like The Wolf of Wall Street (pictured) were very male dominated, which had almost no women protagonists and very few in secondary roles . Films like the 1941 film Citizen Kane, which features almost no women, shows how cinema has not statistically changed in the amount of women in speaking roles since the 1940s . Out of politician characters, 93 per cent were played by men, with only 7 per cent played by women, and men played 70 per cent of scientific or intellectual leaders while women only played 30 per cent. The disparity also extends to race, with the study finding that the percentage of African-American female protagonists fell hugely in ten years, from 15 per cent to 8 per cent.","Women are still taking only minor roles in the majority of top films .

"Smiling as they pose for Facebook photographs, these two men have charged with murdering two Chinese students. Pictures of Bryan Barnes, 20, and Javier Bolden, 19, emerged as they appeared in court accused of killing electrical engineering students Ming Qu and Ying Wu, both 23. The second-year graduate students were allegedly gunned down during a botched robbery near the University of Southern California campus last month. Smiling: Bryan Barnes, 20, and Javier Bolden, 19, have been charged with the murder of two Chinese students . Barnes and Bolden, who are also charged with the attempted murder of another man, could face the death penalty if convicted. Photographs posted on Facebook show Bolden and Barnes dancing and showing off their tattoos and muscles. The pair, who were arrested last Friday, are said to have been members of a 'party crew' called No RespectInc. Party crews organize underground parties and raves, and No Respect was implicated in a FOX 11 investigation into nitrous oxide-dealing groups, the LA Weekly reported. Salute: The two men appeared in court accused of killing electrical engineering students Ming Qu and Ying Wu . Pictures from the crew's Facebook page show large groups of people gesturing for the camera. Messages posted on its Facebook wall frequently contain swearing and the crew claims to be fluent in 'Profanity in American Sign Language'. Barnes and Bolden made a brief court appearance in Foltz Criminal Justice Center in Los Angeles, but their arraignment was postponed until June 25. Sources from the court said the defendants' lawyer argued that he had no time to go over all the information. Tragic: USC students Ming Qu, 23, left, and Ying Wu, 23, right, were killed in a suspected botched robbery . Deputy District Attorney Deborah Brazil with the major crimes division is prosecuting the case, according to a statement from the district attorney's office. Barnes and Bolden, both from Los Angeles, are charged with the April 11 murder of the students - a crime which sent shockwaves through the university community. The men wore street clothes and answered, 'Yes sir,' when Superior Court Judge Upinder Kalra asked if they understood the charges against them. Their cases were assigned to the public defender's office. Accused: Murder suspect Bryan Barnes shows off his tattoos in a Facebook photograph . The two men also were charged with attempted murder in unrelated shootings of three people at parties in South Los Angeles a few months earlier. Authorities believe the killings occurred during a robbery, leading to special circumstance allegations that make Barnes and Bolden eligible for the death penalty if convicted. The judge noted these were capital crimes in denying bail. The district attorney's office will decide later whether to seek the death penalty. Police said shell casings tied the suspects to the shooting of the Chinese students and the other attacks. Gesturing: Barnes and Bolden are said to have been members of a 'party crew' called No RespectInc . Group: Messages posted on the party crew's Facebook wall frequently contain swearing . In addition to the killing of the students, Barnes and Bolden were charged with the attempted murder of a 20-year-old man who was shot and wounded at a party on December 3. Barnes also was charged with one count each of attempted murder and assault with a semiautomatic firearm at another party on February 12. Barnes was arrested at a home near campus last Friday afternoon, and Bolden was arrested a few hours later in Palmdale. Both are being held without bail. Ming Qu, of Jilin, and Ying Wu, of Hunan, were shot April 11 while sitting in a BMW about a mile away from the USC campus. Both students were 23 years old. Evidence: The smashed window of the BMW car in which the students were allegedly shot . USC has the largest number of international students of any U.S. university. Roughly 19 percent of its 38,000 students are from overseas, including 2,500 from China. After the shooting, Wu was found in the BMW's passenger seat and Qu was on the steps of a nearby house where he collapsed while trying to summon help, police said. On Friday, USC's president C L Max Nikias released a statement, thanking the city's mayor and police force behind the arrests. 'The arrest of the suspects in the tragic deaths of our graduate students, Ying Wu and Ming Qu, begins the process of healing and of closing a painful chapter in the life of our community,' Mr Nikias wrote. 'We will always mourn the loss of Ying and Ming, but find comfort in the hope of achieving justice.' Blown out: Ying Wu was found slumped over in her seat, and Qu tried to get out for help . USC's campus is located in an urban centre a few miles south of downtown Los Angeles. It is across the street from county museums and not far from the Staples Center arena and a gentrifying area of Victorian homes. Yet it is also known as an area that had faced high crime and gang activity. The victims' parents filed a lawsuit last week alleging the university made false claims about safety in the 'frequently asked questions' section of its online application. The 15-page lawsuit accuses USC of hiding behind the word 'urban' and not saying the school is in a high-crime residential area. Prestigious: About 19 per cent of USC's international student population are foreign nationals . USC lawyer Debra Wong Yang said the university was deeply saddened by the deaths but found the lawsuit to be baseless. The school and city police announced new security measures after the slayings and promised more video cameras, escorts and patrols. The additional security will include sending over 30 more officers to the department division that handles the USC area, and the university will pay for four additional officers to patrol the student residential neighborhoods.

The veteran 20/20 presenter was back in the office Monday, and she is expected to begin hosting the show again Friday. Vargas, 51, first sought help for her alcohol dependency in early November, admitting in a statement that she was 'dealing with addiction.' Back to work: ABC's 20/20 host Elizabeth Vargas is expected to be back in the anchor chair this Friday after three months off the air . Battling her demons: Vargas, 51, has been off air since October, and the following month she announced that she had completed a second stint in rehab for her alcohol dependency . A friend of the TV personality and mother of two has revealed to New York Post's Page Six that Vargas realized that had not 'conquered' her problem with alcohol the first time around and decided to return to rehab. An ABC News spokesperson told the paper, 'Everyone is pulling for Elizabeth and looking forward to her return to 20/20.' The anchor herself has stayed out of the limelight over the past three months. Her most recent Twitter message was posted in mid-November announcing her return from the treatment facility where she had been staying. 'Hello everyone!  I am home, and so grateful for all your support and well wishes. I am so much better and taking it one day at a time,' she wrote to her 40,000 followers. According to the New York Daily News, senior staff at ABC were told last October Vargas was on 'medical leave', but many suspected she was being treated for alcoholism. Wife and mother: Vargas is married to Grammy Award-winning musician Marc Cohn (left), and the couple her two sons (right) 'We are proud of the steps Elizabeth has taken and are pulling for her recovery,' an ABC spokesperson said at the time. Vargas is married to Grammy . Award-winning musician Marc Cohn, best known for his song Walking In . Memphis, and the couple have two sons, 10-year-old Zachary and . seven-year-old Samuel. Vargas is also stepmother to Maxwell and Emily, Cohn's children from his first marriage. In 2005, Cohn was shot in the head during a carjacking attempt in Denver, Colorado. The musican survived and made a full recovery, but the traumatic event has left its mark on their family. 'Long after the physical wounds are healed, I think my husband's going to really be struggling with the psychological effects of what happened,' Vargas said in an ABC News interview. Vargas is a well-respected television journalist, getting her start at Chicago's WBBM before joining NBC News in 1993 as a correspondent for Dateline. She was named co-anchor alongside David Muir of ABC's investigative news program 20/20 in 2004. The New Jersey native won an Emmy in 1999 for her coverage of the Elian Gonzalez immigration case.","Vargas, 51, announced in mid-November that she had done a couple of weeks in rehab to address her alcoholism .

"Adrenaline junkies might have mastered skiing downhill at mind-boggling speeds, but a new invention could challenge them to ski uphill too. A group of skiing enthusiasts from Colorado have come up with a parachute-like contraption that lets people ski uphill with the help of wind, in an activity they have dubbed ‘wind mountaineering’. UpSki’s device, which includes a large round sail measuring 194 sq ft (18 sq m), enables skiers and snowboarders wearing a specially-designed harness to power up mountains. It weighs just four-and-a-half kilos and can be packed away into a backpack. Scroll down for video .

"Tourists in Times Square were not tickled when a man dressed as the innocent, giggly red Muppet Elmo was arrested after apparently going on an anti-Semitic rant. The man, identified as Adam Sandler, was standing in front of the Toys 'R' Us at the Crossroads of the World yesterday, yelling at passers-by and blocking traffic, according to police. Sandler had a similar episode over the summer and was taken to a local hospital after people in Central Park found him calling out obscenities and racial epithets. Not tickled: A man later identified as Adam Sandler (no relation to the actor), dressed as the Muppet character Elmo, is arrested in New York's Times Square yesterday . According to the New York Times, Sandler is a 48-year-old from Ashland Oregon who then moved to Cambodia and founded a pornographic website called Welcome To Rape Camp, and was later deported because of it. He was arrested today after going on yet another anti-Semitic rant, according to police. Sandler is not related to the actor and comedian of the same name. A Reuters photographer caught Sanders being hauled off by two NYPD officers while a crowd of tourists looked on. Some appeared bemused, others couldn’t seem to make heads or tails out of the strange arrest. Don't hug me: Sandler has been captured across the city in his furry Elmo suit; a passer-by in Central Park captured this particular rant this past June . Elmo in chains: Sandler, still dressed in his getup, was taken away in handcuffs to receive a psychiatric evaluation . One woman, Sarah Fosom, witnessed Elmo’s arrest. She tweeted: ‘Just watched Elmo go on an anti-Semitic rant, get taken down by cops and arrested in Times Square. You stay classy, New York!’ Ms Fosom followed up with the hashtag #crazytown. According to the Times, Sandler’s summer rant led to him being taken to Metropolitan Hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. He told Times crime scene reporter Michael Wilson, in so many words, that he drew suspicion from anyone who took a picture with him and then refused to tip. He wears a blue denim messenger bag around his neck to hold his profits. The Times reported that he bought an Elmo costume online for $300, going to Times Square to make a quick buck. Within a day, he said, the costume paid for itself.","Man, 48, identified as Adam Sandler (no relation to actor of the same name)

"A best-selling author who has based her literary career on writing about the Royal family has launched a bitter attack on the Duchess of Cambridge. Hilary Mantel used her position among the novel-writing elite to make an astonishing and venomous critique of Kate. Mantel, whose latest books are set in England's Tudor court and have appeared on the New York Times bestsellers' list, dismissed Kate as a ‘machine-made’ princess, ‘designed by committee’. Attack: Author Hilary Mantel called the Duchess of Cambridge a 'shop window mannequin' who was 'designed by a committee' with a plastic smile . Mantel, 60, also scorned her as a personality-free ‘shop window mannequin’ with a ‘plastic smile’. She . compared Kate unfavorably to both Anne Boleyn – one of her historical . heroines – and to Princess Diana, insisting both had more personality. She . said Kate had gone from being a ‘jointed doll on which certain rags are . hung’ to a woman whose ‘only point and purpose’ was to give birth. Mantel . said Kate ‘appeared to have been designed by a committee and built by . craftsmen, with a perfect plastic smile and the spindles of her limbs . hand-turned and gloss-varnished’. She said the Duchess was quite unlike Anne Boleyn, who was ‘a power player, a clever and determined woman'. Mantel . contrasted her appearance to Prince William’s mother, Diana, ‘whose . human awkwardness and emotional incontinence showed in her every . gesture’. Pretty as a picture: The Duchess of Cambridge pictured at a viewing of her portrait, in which Hilary Mantel said she has 'dead eyes' and looked 'strained' Mantel, the author of Wolf Hall and Bring Up . The Bodies, the acclaimed novels . which detail the failure of Henry VIII’s wives to produce an heir, used a lecture to examine the prospects for the future queen consort. Mantel . said that when she first saw Kate Middleton, she struck her as ‘a . shop-window mannequin, with no personality of her own, entirely defined . by what she wore'. Writer Hilary Mantel was born in Glossop in Derbyshire, England in 1952. She . is the first woman to receive the prestigious British literary award, the Man Booker Prize, twice. She bagged . the first of the awards in 2009 for Wolf Hall, part one of her trilogy . about Henry VIII’s adviser Thomas Cromwell. The . second installment of the trilogy, Bring Up The Bodies won both the . Booker Prize and the Costa Book Of The Year Award last year. Ms Mantel’s comments on the Duchess of Cambridge’s appearance comes shortly after she spoke about having body issues of her own. Ms Mantel went from a size ten to a size 20 in nine months after she was diagnosed with severe endometrosis at the age of 27. The treatment, which included surgery removing her womb leaving her infertile, caused her to gain four stone. The 60-year-old author said she sometimes dreams of being thin again. Prince . William’s wife-to-be was as ‘painfully thin as anyone could wish, . without quirks, without oddities, without the risk of the emergence of . character’. She added: ‘Presumably Kate was designed to breed in some manners. ‘She looks like a nicely brought up young lady, with “please” and “thank you” part of her vocabulary.’ Mantel . spoke of Kate’s appearance in her first official portrait since . marrying William, painted by Paul Emsley, which was unveiled last month. She said: ‘Her eyes are dead and she wears the strained smile of a woman who really wants to tell the painter to bugger off.’ Mantel went on to say that female Royals were ‘at the most basic... breeding stock, collections of organs.’ St James’s Palace last week criticized . a magazine for printing pictures of Kate’s baby bump taken during a . break on the Caribbean island of Mustique. And . they were furious last year when pictures of her topless on holiday . were printed in Italy – saying ‘a red line had been crossed'. But . Mantel suggested Kate could have few complaints about private pictures . of her being taken on holiday – observing: ‘The royal body exists to be . looked at.’ ‘Some people . find them endearing; some pity them for their precarious situation; . everybody stares at them, and however airy the enclosure they inhabit, . it’s still a cage.’ Mantel gave the London Review of Books lecture ‘Undressing Anne Boleyn’ at the British Museum on the February 4. The full version of her speech is to be published in the latest edition of the London Review of Books, out on February 21. Official bodies: Hilary Mantel said the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge should not complain about invasion of privacy when pictures are taken of them on private holidays as a 'royal body exists to be looked at' Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, said Mantel’s comments were unfair. She . said that although Diana had at first seemed ‘bland’, later ‘we learned . about all the troubles of her marriage and her personality began to . shine through. Kate might yet come into her own.’ - Hilary Mantel on Kate Middleton . She added that Kate’s duties meant she ‘can’t do anything that might reveal (her) personality. ‘They . have to be nice to everyone. They are probably stupefyingly bored but . they can’t appear to be having anything other than a nice time.’ The . Duchess chose yesterday to give an insight into the causes that she . will support, hailing the start of a project which will see one of her . charities receive a huge financial boost from a philanthropic . organization. Harsh: In her vicious attack on the Duchess, award winning author Hilary Mantel called her a 'doll to hang rags on' Prize winners: Hilary Mantel's Bring Up The Bodies, which won the Man Booker Prize last year, and Wolf Hall, which scooped the award in 2009, are the first two parts of her Thomas Cromwell trilogy . She described . her delight at Action On Addiction – which she backs as patron – . becoming the beneficiary of the fundraising efforts of 100 Women in . Hedge Funds during 2013. - Hilary Mantel's first impression of Kate . ‘Those . affected by addiction are in desperate need of the highest level of . care and treatment; Action On Addiction delivers this brilliantly,’ she . wrote in a letter to mark the launch of the fundraising project. ‘Whether . direct or indirect, the impact of addiction can be devastating.’ The Duchess, 31, will visit the addiction charity’s Hope House treatment . centre, in Clapham, south London on Tuesday to meet women recovering from alcohol . and drug dependency. Mantel, 60, studied law at LSE and Sheffield University, before becoming a novelist. She . is author of more than a dozen books, including Wolf Hall and Bring Up .

"Former Fox News television host Glenn Beck has revealed that he has regrets about his time on the network, saying that he could have had a more positive impact on the country if he took a different tone. During a taped interview for Megyn Kelly's primetime Fox News show on Tuesday night, the radio host and media personality reflected on his eponymous show that aired on the network until he left for other projects in 2011. 'I remember it as an awful lot of fun and that I made an awful lot of mistakes, and I wish I could go back and be more uniting in my language because I think I played a role, unfortunately, in helping tear the country apart,' he said. Looking back: Glenn Beck stopped hosting his eponymous show on Fox News in 2011 but said that he now feels partly responsible for the country's political problems . 'I didn’t realize how really fragile the people were. I thought we were kind of more in it together. 'And now I look back and I realize if we could've talked about the uniting principles a little more instead of just the problems, I think I would look back on it a little more fondly.' The unusually reserved pundit- who made a name for himself in the cable programming world for his outlandish skits and willingness to sing, dance, or provoke to make a point- was visibly reflective and almost emotional. Megyn Kelly entered the interview with a big smile, laughing and reflecting on the good times and his funny antics on set. Different dispositions: Megyn Kelly praised Beck, which made him visibly uncomfortable, with her saying 'what a phenom you became while you were here at Fox and now you're King of the Airwaves' Antics: Beck's on-air skits made his show a hit (seen during two different shows in 2009) One that was highlighted was a show where he challenged then-white House communications director Anita Dunn to call him on a red phone on his set in order to correct him on a story where he played a clip that appeared to have her praising Mao Tse Tung. He held a dead fish on air to make a point about a 'stinky' policy and wore lederhosen as he compared Americorps to Nazi brownshirts. As soon as the brief interview turned over to Beck, however, his tone was visibly more sombre, looking like the clips made him disappointed with the highlighted behavior. Beck’s show left the Fox News Channel in 2011 but he continued to espouse his love of the Constitution and his feelings on conservative politics through his own subscription-based cable network, Blaze TV, and matching radio show.","Conservative pundit speaks of his regrets about his eponymous show that last aired on Fox in 2011 .

"Half of Britons have experienced feelings of depression, a new study shows . Half of us say we have felt the despair of depression – twice as many as official statistics suggest. A survey by a leading charity found that almost one in two Britons report having experienced feelings of depression. The usual estimate given is one in four. The poll, by the Depression Alliance, asked thousands of adults whether they had ever experienced depression, and 45 per cent said yes. Almost nine out of ten of these also said they had suffered loneliness as a result of depression, with many struggling to find others to talk to about the condition. The survey comes amid a major push by the Government to put mental wellbeing on the NHS map. Officials have warned that some sufferers of mental illness have the same life expectancy as people living in the 1950s. Many patients with mental health problems die early because of other physical conditions that are not managed well enough, including heart disease and cancer. Patients with schizophrenia will, on average, die 14.6 years earlier than the general population, while those with bipolar disorder generally die 10.1 years earlier. Yet some of the 40,000 deaths among people with serious mental illness each year could be cut if they received the same healthcare checks as the general population, according to NHS England. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said yesterday: ‘We are still not doing enough to address the often serious physical health problems of those with mental health difficulties. For example, on average the life expectancy of men with severe mental illness is 20 years less than the rest of the population. For women it’s 15 years.’ However, the Depression Alliance said many people are still failing to acknowledge their depression, leading to its impact being seriously under-estimated. Its survey of 2,000 adults, carried out by pollsters ICM Research, found just over a third of men (37 per cent) and half of women (53 per cent) said they had been affected by depression at some stage. But it seems men may be less likely to get help. Separate figures show nearly two-thirds of patients seeking treatment for depression are women, with almost 475,000 women referred for counselling or behavioural therapy last year, compared to only 274,000 men. Nick Clegg pictured today delivering a speech on mental health. He said not enough was being done about tackling the illness . Figures released last week also showed that women under 50, and especially those in their 20s, are most likely to seek help using so-called ‘talking treatments’. The charity’s survey found that seven in ten men who reported suffering from depression found talking to someone close about things was helpful in maintaining their recovery, compared with almost eight in ten women. But 86 per cent of those who had been depressed said they were often lonely and unable to share their experiences with others. Emer O’Neill, the charity’s  chief executive, said: ‘This survey clearly demonstrates that to maintain recovery from depression  people need to have access to other people with the condition. The loneliness and isolation that come with depression can have a devastating impact on people from all walks of life. ‘This can be a particular problem for men who often do not have the same social support networks that women have.’ Former footballer Stan Collymore, who has helped the charity raise funds for its website and support community Friends in Need, said: ‘Depression is a very isolating illness. You can be around friends, you can be around family, and if they don’t understand exactly what you’re going through it can actually exacerbate issues and matters and make them worse.’ Mental illness costs the economy more than £105billion every year, with depression and anxiety alone costing £16.4billion through NHS treatment and lost earnings.","Thousands of adults asked if they've felt depressed - with 45% saying yes .

Judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood were visibly shocked when grandmother Nancy Birtwhistle, 60, popped her dough in for a five-minute blitz at ten per cent power. The idea behind Mrs Birtwhistle’s shortcut was to help the enriched sweet dough for her Lincolnshire plum bread rise faster, thereby stealing a march on her fellow competitors. But baking experts also expressed dismay at the trick, saying microwaves have no place in any self-respecting baker’s kitchen. Contestants on last night’s quarter-final were given only two-and-a-half hours to produce a perfect loaf, which Mrs Birtwhistle’s rivals complained was barely enough time to prove and cook their dough. On hearing about the mircrowave quick-fix, Miss Berry turned indignantly to her fellow judge and said: ‘You never use a microwave do you?’ Hollywood said he did not, adding: ‘It destroys the protein structure, because you force in heat. It tends to break down, so it can destabilise the dough.’ Baking experts also criticised Mrs Birtwhistle. Mike Holling, executive director of the Craft Bakers Association, said: ‘All it will have done is cook the dough while it is rising, instead of allowing it to rise at its own pace. You can’t rush these things. I never thought I’d see a microwave on Bake Off.’ Mrs Birtwhistle, from Barton-upon-Humber in Lincolnshire, admitted she was ‘a bit scared’ that her plan would backfire. She added: ‘This could be my death knell. It should be all right. It’s been all right when I’ve tried it.’ Thanks to the extra heat provided by the microwave, her dough rose to an impressive size. However, Hollywood was unconvinced. ‘What you’ve got is something that is under-proved, or the proteins have indeed been damaged and then it rips and falls,’ he said, adding: ‘It’s got a good structure. I think it’s slightly underdone.’ He said Mrs Birtwhistle should have made her dough longer and thinner instead, to allow it to rise of its own accord. Miss Berry was more positive, saying she thought the fruity loaf was ‘absolutely scrumptious’. Yesterday’s star baker was builder Richard Burr, 38, the fourth time he has scooped the accolade, while 17-year-old Martha Collison, the show’s youngest-ever contestant, was eliminated.

"Warning: Charity Save the Children has said that formula milk should carry 'cigarette-style' warnings saying that breast is best . Formula milk should carry much larger ‘cigarette-style’ warnings that breast is best, a leading charity says today. Save the Children wants the messages to be big enough to cover at least a third of the packaging. Its proposal would apply to the UK and other European nations as well as the developing world. Campaigners claim, however, that the advice will only pile guilt on mothers who want to breastfeed but are unable to do so. The Department of Health recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months with optional further breastfeeding when the baby moves on to solids. But a report, Superfood for Babies, released today by Save the Children, says the lives of 95 babies could be saved every hour worldwide – 830,000 a year – if new mothers breastfed immediately after giving birth. It points out the benefits of babies receiving colostrum – the mother’s first milk – within an hour of birth. This kickstarts children’s immune systems, making them three times more likely to survive. However, the report says marketing practices by some breast milk substitute companies can result in mothers believing formula is the best way to feed their baby even if they are unable to afford it. The aid agency is launching a petition to get breast milk substitute companies ‘to increase health warnings that formula is inferior to breast milk to cover a third of its packaging’. At present, all formula milks in the UK have to carry mandatory advice – under the heading ‘Important Notice’ – that says breast feeding is best for babies. The message ‘breastfeeding is best’ is carried on an advice panel the size of two postage stamps and hidden among information about ingredients and how to make it. Mothers are advised that the ‘product be used only on the advice of a doctor, midwife, health visitor, public health nurse, dietitian, pharmacist, or other professional responsible for maternal and child care’. Brendan Cox, director of policy at Save the Children, said changes to warnings would have to apply in the UK and other developed countries because the packs might be exported to the Third World. He said: ‘It’s about having a standard measure of packaging information saying that breastfeeding is the most effective way of protecting the health of the child. 'We have lots of examples of formula products where the information is illegible or very small.’ Healthier: A Save the Children report released today claims that 95 babies could be saved every hour worldwide if new mothers breastfed immediately after birth (file picture) But Clare Byam-Cook, former nurse, midwife and breast feeding counsellor, said the report was ‘emotive’ and ignored the fact that feeding babies in the UK was different to the Third World. ‘The saving of 95 babies applies to developing countries, not Britain,’ she added. ‘I’m concerned that cigarette-style warnings will increase the guilt felt by mums who need or want to use formula feed – when all women are aware that breastfeeding is good for the baby and the mother. 'These mothers already feel a failure because they have to use formula feed and then they are treated like bad people when buying it.’ The author of Top Tips For Breast Feeding and Top Tips For Bottle Feeding added: ‘Ask any sheep farmer if animals can always produce enough milk and the answer is no. The same principle applies in humans.’ Research shows breast milk protects babies against stomach bugs, chest infections, asthma, eczema, and allergies, and confers health advantages in later life. Survey findings show around two thirds of women and parents of under-fives think large warning labels would be a ‘step too far’. Only one in four people thought it would be a ‘reasonable move to discourage parents from using infant formula milks’, says the Populus survey of 2,000 Britons. Helen Messenger, of Danone Baby Nutrition, which makes Cow & Gate and Aptamil, said: ‘Infant formula is the only safe, legal alternative to breast feeding and we believe an increase in the size of the warning label is counterproductive in that it would send mixed messages to parents and potentially confuse them about which milks can be used safely for babies. ‘Our products are safe and popular with parents because they meet a real need for mums who choose to bottle feed. All of our infant formulas carry warning labels and meet strict legislative rules.’","Save the Children wants warnings to cover a third of milk's packaging .

"Apple is preparing to launch an 'iWallet' app allowing customers to easily for with theit mobile phone, it has been claimed. The project is believed the already have Visa on board, and is expected to use the firm's Touch ID fingerprint sensor to verify a customer's identity. The app could launch in the Autumn alongside Apple's new iPhone 6. Put away the credit card! Apple is believed to be working on an iWallet app to allow users to easily pay with their phone . Apple will unveil the iPhone 6 in mid-September - but may hold back the larger of the two expected models. The handset will be available in two sizes - a 4.7inch and 5.5inch version. The event will showcase at least the new iPhone 6 with a 4.7-inch screen, but a final decision on debuting the larger, 5.5-inch 'phablet' model at the event has not been made, according to 9to5mac. According to tech blog The Information, 'conversations between Apple and payments-industry companies have heated up in recent months.' It claims 'several people briefed on the talks say that Apple executives have discussed launching a mobile “wallet” as soon as this fall for people to use their iPhones to pay for goods in physical stores.' According to the report, new phones will include a ‘secure element’ to store such sensitive data. The service will also run without any intervention by mobile phone firms. Apple has told some partners its system would involve a so-called secured element in the phones—a piece of hardware where sensitive information such as a phone owner’s financial credentials can be stored. This expected to be the same secure system currently used to store fingerprint information, which is also set to store health data. Earlier this month Visa launched a new service called Visa Checkout that eliminates a few steps in online payment. The company and its retailing partners, including Neiman Marcus, Pizza Hut, Staples and others, hope a quicker payout will lead to fewer abandoned shopping carts online. Apple has told some partners its system would involve a so-called secured element in the phones¿a piece of hardware where sensitive information such as a phone owner¿s financial credentials can be stored.

Visa Checkout joins similar services like eBay's PayPal, MasterCard's MasterPass, Amazon's one-click checkout and others. Visa has been working to expand its reach into the payments processing business with new products like Visa Checkout.

"The decent thing for the Spanish league to do would be crafting a medal and a trophy for the club which finishes fourth next May. Despite more than a dozen different Spanish teams having qualified for the Champions League during the last 12 years — with Sevilla, Atletico, Valencia, Athletic and Espanyol all having either reached or won European finals during that span — and particularly with Atletico having broken the duopoly by winning the title last term, this is the season when there will most certainly only be one Champions League slot up for grabs. Big money: Barcelona paid £75m to sign Luis Suarez from Liverpool . Certain one-eyed critics got stuck in such a rut talking about a two-horse race in Spain that they were soundly exposed by Diego Simeone’s title-winning side last season. However, just in case anyone should be sufficiently effervescent to imagine that Los Rojiblancos were, vicariously, trampling down the door to the hegemony on behalf of other aspiring ‘could have been a contender’ clubs — think again. Atletico’s spend this summer simply confirms that they have attacked the duopoly not on behalf of liberté, fraternité and égalité but in order to create a triumvirate at the top of Spanish soccer. Right now the champions have invested close to €100 million, against which their accountants can balance the sales of Diego Costa, Adrian and Filipe Luis. But it’s jaw-dropping that between Atletico, Real Madrid and Barcelona, the total gross expenditure on new players supersedes €350m. Wild though it seems, there are rumours abounding that Atletico will add the purchase of the exceptional Marco Reus to their tally. And even before you examine how that would push the three clubs’ spending close to the €400m mark, the key to that deal — should they pull it off — is how a club which still had to pre-qualify for the Europa League when they signed Diego Forlan and which was flirting with relegation when they recruited Simeone as manager two-and-a-half years ago could now fight off all of Europe’s premier clubs to sign this utter gem of a German footballer? Right now these are reports, not hard facts, so let’s leave it at that. But the idea of Reus being snapped up by Atletico fits with the theme which Real Madrid and Barcelona have established. Enough, already, with the ‘which league is better?’, despite the repeated claims by those who receive the Premier League pound that it is the best in the world. Value the product you watch (or participate in) precisely as you wish but something intriguing happened in Spain this summer. Like him or loathe him, Luis Suarez can play a bit. When he abandoned Liverpool, it was to Barcelona he was determined to go. Not Arsenal, Chelsea or Manchester City. Prime mover: Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kross boasts talent and experience . Arguably, Toni Kroos was the player of the World Cup. A fabulous technical and creative talent just approaching the prime years of his career and now world champion to go with his Bundesliga and Champions League titles. Prime beef, but when he was on the hoof it was to Madrid he went — and remarkably cheaply as well. How did England’s leading clubs miss out on him? Why on earth did he choose to leave the ‘football nirvana’ which Pep Guardiola is attempting to create in Bavaria — a process which has notably improved Kroos in the space of one season? Then, James Rodríguez. A special talent and one who illuminated the World Cup. There’s no doubt that the special nature of his performance there will have over-inflated people’s expectations of him. This is a kid who has all the weaponry but needs some time on the firing range. Some battle experience. He didn’t dominate French football at Monaco — but with maturity and exceptional team-mates around him, it’s predictable that we are about to see the blossoming of a special footballer. Just right for Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea, City, Liverpool — but, just like Gareth Bale, who turned United down last summer, he actively wanted to join Madrid. None of this is part of the ‘our league is better than yours’ argument. But it is significant that the incredible buying power of the Premier League, television money, crowds and petrodollars combined, wasn’t enough to secure any of the three best talents to move this summer — with Reus still pending. Prodigious talent: Koke of Atletico Madrid is Spain's young pass master . In terms of the title it’s a mini-league of three this term — and Madrid start with major advantages. Last season they lacked depth of quality and stamina at the killer moments of the title race, but that’s been adequately addressed this summer with the market not yet closed. Just as he was asked to do last season, manager Carlo Ancelotti, Champions League and Copa Del Rey winner in his first season at the club, will be asked to forge some sort of equilibrium in his starting XI despite the fact that Rodríguez in midfield gives nowhere near the work rate, tackling and pressing of the deposed Angel di Maria. When Ancelotti faced similarly tough tactical questions a year ago due to incorporating Bale, it took him a beat or two but, when the tempo was sorted, with an adventurous 4-3-3, they made sweet music. If Lionel Messi, Neymar and Suarez all find a prolonged spell of fitness, energy and synchronisation under a new, brutally demanding, manager, and if Ivan Rakitic can add some of the youth and athleticism which Xavi now cannot, then Barcelona look interesting. The reigning champions, fortified by Mario Mandzukic, Antoine Griezmann, Guilherme Siqueira and Jan Oblak, retain the ‘feel’ of a team you’d not like to meet down a dark alley on a Saturday night. Potential trophy winners again — but it’s to Madrid that all eyes will turn. Six trophies lay in front of them and, after the Super Cup, it’s one down. This squad is in shape to add the majority of the rest of them. Intelligent and sharp: Bilbao coach Ernesto Valverde .","Atletico, Real Madrid and Barcelona have spent more than £300m .

"Ten days ago Manuel Pellegrini’s grey hair was going even greyer. Out came the Grecian 2000, mixed in with some jet black boot polish, and all of a sudden the City boss and his team are looking lively again! He’s proved his critics, including me, wrong. Well, sort of. It could all be temporary, of course. Manuel Pellegrini (right) speaks to Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola before their Champions League clash . Sergio Aguero scored a hat-trick to save City and take them through to the knockout stages in Europe . The top four of the Premier League shows Manchester City six points behind leaders Chelsea after 13 games . Honestly, ask yourself this: should Mancheser City with the players they have, the recent years of success and the resources at the disposal be winning the three games they’ve just won? Yes of course! It’s no shock that City beat Swansea, Bayern Munich’s 10-man reserve team, and Southampton. By now, City should be standing tall alongside the very best in Europe. Pellegrini’s great escape from Champions League Group E will be looked on as something special. But they shouldn’t have got themselves into this mess in the first place. The best defenders aren’t those who always end up making last-ditch tackles, they’re the ones who don’t get themselves into trouble at all. And at the very top level the same applies to managers. But what Pellegrini has proved this week is that he can deliver under pressure. A City-supporting friend of mine spoke with me before the Swansea fixture, and said if they lost two of the forthcoming three games then the manager should go. Pellegrini knew that two defeats would almost certainly mean City were out of the only competitions Sheikh Mansour is interested in winning – the Champions League and the Premier League. Pellegrini deserves credit for delivering under pressure... but three wins does not mean he's done enough . Samir Nasri, Aguero and Yaya Toure celebrate after the latter put City 1-0 up against Southampton on Sunday . Things couldn’t have gone better: Roma drew in Russia, Bayern played a weakened side and had a man sent off, Sergio Aguero turned it on at just the right time, City won all three games, and even Chelsea dropped points. It could be the week that transforms City’s season. In fact it should be. But they still have a tough task in the Champions League, and they are still six points behind Chelsea at the top of the table. And that’s the problem for Pellegrini. He’s had a terrific week, but he can hardly wave it in the faces of us critics because City are still some way off where they should be this season. A tough week for Pellegrini to come through and he deserves credit, but let’s not get carried away – he’s got a lot of work to do before he proves he is the right manager to take Manchester City to where the owners want them to be – dominating domestically and in Europe.","Man City should have won their last three games given their resources .

"Luis Suarez has admitted he is undergoing psychological help to prevent him from biting more opponents. The striker was presented at the Nou Camp on Tuesday after making his debut on Monday night in a friendly, but is banned from competitive fixtures until October 25 after biting Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup. Asked about how he was tackling his problem, Suarez said: 'That is a private matter, but I am speaking to professionals. The right professionals.

'I spoke to my psychologist, he said I had to face reality and say I was sorry.' Suarez was insistent that he has forgotten about the bite and dispelled rumours that there was a bite clause in his contract. 'I am trying to forget this game and this situation,' he said. 'It was a difficult moment for me. I say to the fans, ""Don't worry about that (happening again). 'I'm here to do important things for Barcelona. Everything in the past needs to be forgotten. 'If I start thinking about everything I have had to go through I wouldn't be able to sleep. 'This is a club I have dreamed of playing for since I was a boy and I want to make the most of it.' Suarez admitted he had worried that biting Chiellini, adding to his assaults on Otman Bakkal and Branislav Ivanovic, may have scuppered his Barcelona move.

All I can do is accept it and try to forget and give my support from outside.' Questions continued to flood in about his suspension and Suarez said he has accepted FIFA's punishment and is just trying to get ready to make his debut against Real Madrid. The four-month ban from competitive matches ends by October 25, the weekend which features the first Clasico of the season. 'You're asking me about the suspension, I have to accept that and get ready to play against Real Madrid. The ban is what it is. 'I don't see any problems with arriving in good shape (for the Clasico). But it all depends on the manager to say if I can play or not.' Sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta confirmed that he was hoping that Uruguay would play Suarez in their two friendlies shortly before that match, to get him up to speed. Suarez recalled being at the Nou Camp when Barcelona thrashed Real Madrid 5-0 and said he has always had the Catalan giants in his heart. 'For years I've been dreaming of playing for Barca. Every little boy knows, this is something that they want, and my family was here as well. 'To come here and watch Barca play and that one day I would be able to play here, I didn't think it was going to happen. 'When the opportunity arose I didn't think twice.

Ouch: The Uruguayan was then slapped with his ban following the incident . Past incidents: Suarez had been banned previously for biting Branislav Ivanovic . At Barcelona Suarez will form part of a devastating front trio featuring Neymar and Lionel Messi. But the Uruguayan balked at the idea that he was the star signing of the summer. 'Stars are in the sky,' said Suarez. 'If one person thinks they are the only person on the field, we can't win titles.' He also confirmed that he was happy to play anywhere manager Luis Enrique wanted to play him, whether that be on the left, the right, or in a central role. Although he didn't get to play with either of his South American strike partners on Monday night, he was thrilled to make his debut. 'Obviously it was very exciting, spectacular for me. It was a dream for me. 'I've never played at the Nou Camp. To come out and see the fans was interesting for me, I loved it. 'It hasn't sunk in yet, I can't believe it.

"An Afghan woman has been arrested for 'helping strangle her daughter-in-law to death because she gave birth to an 'undesired' third daughter'. Mother-in-law Wali Hazrata is said to have tied the feet of 22-year-old Stori, which allowed the victim's local militia member husband Sher Mohammad to strangle her. The two-month-old baby girl was not hurt in the incident, in the village of Mahfalay, in the north eastern Kunduz province's Khanabad district, on Saturday. Accused: Wali Hazrata (pictured) is said to have helped tie up her daughter-in-law while her son choked her to death . Contradictory reports have emerged of the incident, with some media saying it was the woman's second daughter that sparked her murder. But Khanabad's police chief, Sufi Habib, told the BBC: 'The mother gave birth to a third girl two months ago. 'The husband and mother-in-law strangled her for giving birth to a third daughter.' The murdered woman's husband has since fled, and Hazrata remains in custody. Police believe the murder took place because Stori gave birth to another girl, who are generally seen as a burden in Afghan society. The husband is believed to be a fighter with an illegal armed militia, and local villagers said Stori often asked her him to lay down his weapons. Chaos: It may be a decade since U.S.-led troops brought down the Taliban regime, but ancient traditions still take place in Afghanistan (stock picture) One neighbour said: 'She lived in a hell . not a house. But then she also asked her husband to stay home and avoid . going out with these thugs.' Afghan women's rights activists highlighted the incident. Nadira Gya, director for Kunduz Women's affairs, said: 'It was a brutal crime committed against an innocent woman.' Local religious and tribal elders in the district also condemned the killing, saying it was an act of ignorance, and calling it a crime against Islam, humanity and women. They called for immediate punishment. Wali Hazrata appears to have made no public comment as yet. Violence and abuse against women continues to be a major problem in Afghanistan, a decade after U.S.-led troops brought down the Taliban regime. Last month, police found a teen bride who had been locked in a toilet for six months at her husband’s house in neighboring Baghlan province. She was burned and beaten, and had her fingernails pulled out.

"The first weekend of the Premier League is done and dusted and, largely true to form, the usual suspects of Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool already occupy the top four spots. And with the opening games come debuts, and plenty of them, as every club in the top flight featured at least one summer acquisition in their starting line-up. But how did did they all get on? Here, Sportsmail ranks the top 10 who impressed on their first Premier League appearances for their new clubs... 10 . Brede Hangeland . Team: Crystal Palace . Cost: Free . His Eagles debut ended in defeat against Arsenal. But his performance at the Emirates Stadium made for encouraging viewing for Palace fans. Not only his goal, but the way he handled Arsenal's lively attacking unit bodes well for Palace's attempts to stay in the Barclays Premier League. Big man: Brede Hangeland was an imposing presence in the heart of Crystal Palace's defence against Arsenal . 9 . Leonardo Ulloa . Team: Leicester . Cost: £8m . Foxes boss Nigel Adkins has decided to put his faith in the Argentinian striker - a man who has no Premier League experience - in Leicester's top-flight return. His capture has raised a few eyebrows but what better way to answer your critics than a debut goal. And the striker did just that, scoring his new side's first goal of the season in the draw against Everton. Could be a snip at £8m. Joy: Leonardo Ulloa celebrates scoring on his Leicester and Premier League debut against Everton . 8 . Andrew Robertson . Team: Hull . Cost: £2.85m . Perhaps the player with the lowest profile on this list, but if he puts in more performances like his one against Queens Park Rangers on Saturday then that won't last long. The young Scot was playing for Queens Park two years ago, on Saturday he was lining up against Rio Ferdinand. And the occasion didn't get to the left-wing back one little bit. Understated: Andrew Robertson (right) had an impressive debut during Hull's win at QPR on Saturday . 7 . Fernando . Team: Manchester City . Cost: £12m . Not the most explosive of debuts but he was extremely effective in the Barclays Premier League champions' win over Newcastle on Sunday. He showed a great understanding of the game, sniffing out danger in front of his back-four. Manuel Pellegrini has been on Fernando's case since the back end of last year, on Sunday we caught a glimpse of why. Power player: Fernando was a force in midfield for Manchester City as they outplayed Newcastle . 6 . Dusan Tadic . Team: Southampton . Cost: £10.9m . The Serbian is essentially Adam Lallana's replacement at St Mary's and maybe, just maybe, the Saints will not miss the England midfielder as much as they thought they might. Technically Tadic looks on point. He also looks to have the X-factor, too - his back heel to set up Nathaniel Clyne's goal against Liverpool was one of the highlights of the weekend. Nice tough: Dusan Tadic showed glimpses of being the player who could replace Adam Lallana at Southampton . 5 . Calum Chambers . Team: Arsenal . Cost: £16m . The 19-year-old looked like he'd been a Premier League centre-back for 10 years against Crystal Palace on Saturday. Composed, comfortable on the ball and strong in the tackle, the teenager has all the hallmarks of an England regular in the making. The fact he broke through at Southampton as right-back makes his rapid transition inside even more impressive. Composed: Calum Chambers started at the heart of Arsenal's defence against Crystal Palace . 4 . Diego Costa . Team: Chelsea . Cost: £32m . When you cost as much as Diego Costa does then you have no option but to hit the ground running. And the Spain international showed exactly why Jose Mourinho splashed so much on him by scoring on his debut. There'll be tougher opponents for Costa this season, but he's already off to a flier. Impact: Diego Costa may prove to be the missing link in Chelsea's attack this season following his arrival . 3 . Cesc Fabregas . Team: Chelsea . Cost: £30m . Arsenal and Manchester United supporters look away now. Yes, it is just one game. Yes, it's against Burnley (no disrespect!) but Fabregas was sensational at Turf Moor. He knows exactly what the Premier League is all about so there'll be no problems with him adapting. Remains one of the world's best centre-midfielders despite his struggles at Barcelona. Class touch: Cesc Fabregas assisted two goals on his return to the Premier League against Burnley . 2 . Eric Dier . Team: Tottenham . Cost: £4m . Perhaps not the most glamorous of summer signings but he is already a fans favourite amongst the White Hart Lane faithful following his injury time winner against arch-rivals West Ham. His versatility will be huge asset for Spurs this season. Looks a shrewd signing by Mauricio Pochettino. Announcement: Eric Dier scored a last-gaps winner for Tottenham as they beat West Ham on Saturday . 1 . Gylfi Sigurdsson . Team: Swansea . Cost: Undisclosed . Okay, he's played for Swansea before, but what a way to re-announce yourself to the club's fans. It doesn't get much better than scoring on your (second) debut, but not only that, scoring the winner at Old Trafford in Louis van Gaal's first game in charge. Swans boss Garry Monk was desperate to bring the Icelandic midfielder back to the club, it's not hard to see why. Return: Gylfi Sigurdsson scored the winner at Old Trafford in his first game back for Swansea .","Costa and Dier to impress on their Premier League debuts .

"A full 30 years after the original Back To The Future film debuted, the time-traveling adventure is set to return, this time as a stage musical. Producers have confirmed that a show adapted from the sci-fi comedy franchise starring Michael J. Fox will open in London's West End in 2015, the 30th anniversary of the film. A Broadway run is a possibility if the new musical flies as well as the film's specially equipped DeLorean. The new musical will have a book by the film's director Rober Zemeckis, Bob Gale and Jamie Lloyd, along with new music and lyrics by composer Alan Silvestri and songwriter and record producer Glen Ballard. Lloyd also will direct. Back in time: The West End looks set to rock around the clock: Back to the Future is to become a West End musical in time for the film's 30th anniversary next year . Hit: The movie, a huge hit in 1985, starred Michael J Fox as Marty McFly, the California teenager who jeopardizes his parents' high-school relationship after accidentally time-travelling back to 1955 . Long-term project: The film's director, Robert Zemeckis (pictured) and co-writer Bob Gale have reunited for the musical, a project they've been considering for a decade. Their script reportedly follows the original plot, but makes some changes . 'The production will include . illusions, skateboarding and many other surprises that will capture the . spirit of the film but freshly interpret it for a new audience,' Lloyd . said in a statement Friday. Bob . Gale commented, ""The Back to the Future musical is a project that Bob . Zemeckis and I have been exploring for almost ten years. We're . thrilled to be at last in partnership with a creative and producing . team that will create a show that is true to the spirit of the film . without being a slavish remake. Director . Jamie Lloyd is full of passion, energy and imaginative ideas and we are . overjoyed to have the film's composer Alan Silvestri composing the . music. Reunion: Actors Mary Steenburgen, Christopher Lloyd, Robert Zemeckis, Michael J. Fox and Lea Thompson attend the Back To The Future 25th anniversary. In 2015, the film will be 30 years and a new musical is the perfect way to celebrate . In safe hands: British director Jamie Lloyd will take charge of the DeLorean time machine after running two separate workshops for the musical later this year, one in Los Angeles, another in London . Headcase: Christopher Lloyd in a scene from the movie Back to The Future. The musical will feature a number of songs from the original soundtrack and its composer Alan Silvestri, who worked on the original film, is creating some new material . With all of us working together, we know the integrity of the material will be preserved in a production that will be a wonderful companion to the Trilogy. We intend to use music from the movie along with brand new songs to make a version of Back to the Future that is fresh, entertaining, and takes advantage of all the amazing things that can now be done on stage.  We can't think of a better way to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the film.' In the 1985 film, Marty McFly becomes a human guinea pig who travels back to his hometown in 1955. Once there, he gets caught up in the soap opera lives of his own teenage parents, including his mom who develops a crush on her future son. The film was written by Zemeckis and Gale and had plenty of music, including the Huey Lewis and the News theme tune 'The Power of Love' and Marty McFly's futuristic rendition of 'Johnny B. Goode.' The film, which co-starred Christopher Lloyd, Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson, was so successful that it spawned two more sequels, 'Back to the Future Part II' in 1989 and 'Back to the Future Part III' in 1990. On stage: Marty McFly and Doc Brown will storm onto the West End stage in their DeLorean for a musical based on Robert Zemeckis's and Bob Gale's cherished '80s classic . Gotta get back in time! With Gale, Zemeckis and Silvestri on board, the Back to the Future stage musical is something to look forward to... The new musical will join such recent Gen X screen-to-stage remakes as 'Ghost,' ''Little Shop of Horrors,' ''Flashdance,' ''Dirty Dancing,' ''Big,' ''Legally Blonde,' ''The Wedding Singer,' ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' and 'Elf.' Oscar-winner Zemeckis has directed all 'Back to the Future' films, as well as 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit,' ''Forrest Gump,' 'The Polar Express' and 'Flight.' Silvestri has scored many of Zemeckis' films, including 'Romancing the Stone,' ''Forrest Gump' and 'Cast Away.' Ballard, a six-time Grammy Award winner, co-wrote and produced 'Jagged Little Pill' for Alanis Morissette and co-wrote the music for the stage musical adaptation of 'Ghost.' Lloyd's credits include 'Cyrano de Bergerac' on Broadway, 'The Duchess of Malfi' at the Old Vic and 'She Stoops to Conquer' at the National Theatre. Gale, a frequent Zemeckis collaborator, has also written comic books, including issues of 'Batman.' Set and costume designs will be by Soutra Gilmour, illusions by Paul Kieve, lighting design by Jon Clark, and musical supervision by Alan Williams. Andrew Willis will be skateboard consultant. Remember?Fox, famously, plays Marty McFly: a high school wannabe guitarist who lives in suburban Twin Pines a sort of everytown USA with a father (Crispin Glover) who has no backbone and a mother (Lea Thompson) who is a lush . The movie opens with The Power Of Love by Huey Lewis And The News. That song will be in the show, along with Johnny B. Goode, Earth Angel and Mr Sandman. Alan Silvestri, who wrote the original score for the films, will collaborate with Glen Ballard on some  original songs. Ingram said the show will stick to the same time periods as the first film. ‘You can’t mess with history,’ he joked. Andrew Willis, who designed the Hackney Wick skateboarding park, has signed on as a consultant and will help the cast with their skateboarding skills. The creative team will also include set designer Soutra Gilmour, lighting expert Jon Clark, and illusionist Paul Kieve. ‘Now all we have to find is a young man to play Marty,’ Ingram said. ‘He needs to be a guitarist, a singer, an actor — and good looking. We’ll provide the time machine.’","The musical will open in London next year .

"Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton returned to England for a night of glamour at the British Fashion Awards with girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger. Hamilton is still riding high after picking up his second World Championship in Abu Dhabi just over a week ago. The 29-year-old has been part-taking in an array of media commitments since being crowned champion and is clearly enjoying more time with Scherzinger, who is normally based in America.

"Justin Bieber may have millions of fans worldwide, but Russia's bears don't appear to admire the pop brat's music - which proved fortunate for one lucky fisherman. Igor Vorozhbitsyn had his life saved by a Justin Bieber ringtone, when his mobile phone went off during a potentially fatal attack by a brown bear. The 42-year-old was pounced on as he was walking to a favourite fishing spot in northern Russia's Yakutia Republic and firmly believed that he was going to be killed. Scroll down for video . Attack: Igor Vorozhbitsyn, 42, was pounced on as he was walking to a favourite fishing spot - but Justin Bieber came to the rescue . But as the bear began to claw at him, Igor's mobile went off. The singer's hit Baby rang out and the bear turned tail and fled back into the forest. Wildlife experts believe the ringtone must have startled the bear into halting its attack. 'Sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear,' explained one. Dangerous: Brown bears are easily capable of killing humans, but as the incident with Mr Vorozhbitsyn showed, can easily be frightened away . Bear-ly believable: Justin Bieber's music isn't very popular with brown bears, it seems . Mr Vorozhbitsyn suffered from cuts and severe bruises to his face and chest and was rescued when he was found by other fishermen after using the phone to call for help. Mr Vorozhbitsyn - now recovering from his mauling - explained: 'I had parked my car and was walking towards the spot I'd marked out when there was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me.' 'I couldn't believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled. 'I know that sort of ringtone isn't to everyone's taste but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke,' he added. Adult brown bears can weigh as much as 600kg and have been known to kill wolves and even Siberian tigers in confrontations.","A fisherman in Russia had his life saved by a Justin Bieber ringtone .

"Silverstone has come to the aid of Circuit of Wales and will stage the British round of MotoGP for the next two years. The Northamptonshire venue ran the event from 2010 to 2014 until CoW negotiated a deal with rights holders Dorna to stage the race for five years from this season. That was despite the fact construction work had yet to commence on the troubled facility at Ebbw Vale. The British Grand Prix in the MotoGP championship was left in turmoil after Donington Park pulled out of hosting the 2015 race. Above is the start of the 2014 Grand Prix which took place at Silverstone . With ongoing difficulties regarding planning, CoW bosses turned to Donington Park initially to host the 2015 GP, much to Silverstone's dismay. But on Tuesday, Donington Park chiefs withdrew from the opportunity to play host after neither party could agree terms to form a legal contract. Donington, which last hosted MotoGP in 2009, claimed difficulties arose with CoW regarding funding arrangements to help them stage the event. In a catch-22 situation, CoW countered by stating it was unwilling to provide the funding without a signed contractual agreement in place. CoW has now turned to Silverstone, whose new management team led by Patrick Allen has welcomed the approach. To accommodate the August 28-30 race, Silverstone has been forced to switch the World Series by Renault event scheduled for those dates to September 5-6. Donington Park had previously held the British Grand Prix from 1987 through to 2009, with Australia's Casey Stoner (above) winning on a Ducati in 2008 . Silverstone managing director Allen said: 'A lot of work has been done over recent years to ensure MotoGP fans enjoy what Silverstone has to offer, and it was devastating for the venue to lose the event last autumn. 'I welcomed the opportunity to meet with both Dorna and the Circuit of Wales recently so we could try and find a way to keep MotoGP in the UK and racing at Silverstone. 'Two-wheel racing is as much a part of Silverstone's heritage as four-wheel racing and I am obviously delighted to be in a position to announce we are hosting both the F1 and MotoGP Grands Prix in 2015. 'We have recently introduced a family-friendly pricing policy for the Formula One British Grand Prix which is proving extremely popular. 'Over the next two weeks I will be working closely with my team at Silverstone to launch a ticket model for MotoGP I hope will be equally well received by fans.' Regarding the two-year deal, CoW chief executive Michael Carrick has expressed his gratitude to Silverstone for stepping into the breach. The British round of the MotoGP calendar for the next two years will be held at Silverstone . 'We want to thank the new management at Silverstone, our partners at Dorna and our investors for the rapid response needed to support the 2015 event when it became clear we would be unlikely to conclude the contractual arrangements at Donington,' said Carrick. 'We are delighted to secure the future of the event for the next two years while our circuit in Wales is under construction.' CoW first faces a detailed public inquiry before construction can be allowed to begin, with Carrick confident it will be the final hurdle. Carrick added: 'We continue to advance our development activity on the Circuit of Wales and are focused on the upcoming public inquiry into the deregistration of the common land. 'We expect construction to commence once this inquiry has concluded.'","Donington Park was set to hold British Grand Prix in 2015 .

"A Mississippi man believes that a hairless, dog-like animal he shot on his property isn't a dog at all - according to Matthew Harrell, the animal he killed is the legendary Chupacabra, a ferocious creature that most animal experts agree is a nothing more than an urban legend. Mr. Harrell was 'coon hunting' at his home in Leake County when he first was confronted by the four-legged beast. At first, he thought the animal was a raccoon, or coyote - his neighbor reported that the animal already had killed three of his chickens. His opinion quickly changed when - according to Mr. Harrell - he noticed that the animal had glowing red eyes and that it appeared aggressive. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Legend: A Mississippi man says this animal killed on his property is a legendary Chupacabra . Convinced: Hunter Matt Hewharrell is certain that the animal he killed is a Chupacabra . 'This one just wasn't lunging. He was down like a cat,' Harrell told . WJTV-TV. 'When I was standing right yonder, he hit right here. And I was . seeing the teeth and red eyes. It looked like he was going to jump down . there and I didn't give him the chance.' Mr. Harrell shot the animal with a .22-calibur rifle. He then shot it again to make sure he'd killed it. The animal, Mr. Harrell noticed, is nearly hairless and has nails much longer than a dog's. He's convinced the animal is a Chupacabra. 'My dog, even when it’s dead, my dog’s been scared of it,' Mr. Harrell says of the animal. Chupacabra translates from Spanish to 'goat-sucker,' in reference to the legendary animal's affinity for sucking the blood of live animals, particularly domesticated goats. The legend of the Chupacabra date back to 1995 in Puerto Rico, where many local farmers claimed to have seen the animal after finding their livestock had been killed. Myth: This illustration shows how the Chupacabra is depicted in modern mythology . Claws: Hewharrell insists that the animal's claws are much longer than that of a dog or coyote . Sightings of the animal have been reported throughout Mexico and much of the United States, particularly in the Southwest, where it is usually determined that suspected Chupacabras are just emaciated, sickly coyotes. The description of the Chupacabra varies, but typically those who claim to see the animal describe it as being about the size of a small bear, with a row of spines along its back. In 2004, a rancher near San Antonio killed a supposed Chupacabra that he claimed had been killing his livestock. DNA from the animal later revealed that it was a coyote with demodectic or sarcoptic mange. Fangs: Harrell insists that the animal's teeth are also indicative of a Chupacabra . In nearly a dozen other cases where the suspected Chupacabra's body has been discovered, DNA testing showed that the animal was some sort of wild canine with severe skin disorders, particularly mange. Harrell - who is defiant in his belief that the animal he killed is in fact a Chupacabra - has disposed of much of the animal. However, he says he's saved some of the animal for science. 'Auburn University called up wanting a sample,' he told the Huffington Post. 'I saved a jawbone with teeth, and cut off the ears and toenails. That's all I could stomach.'","The hairless, dog-like animal was shot near a farm in Leake County, Mississippi .

"A Japanese electronics company has unveiled a 13ft super-robot which can be controlled by an iPhone. But be careful with the jokes if you are on the phone to the pilot as the robot, made by Suidobashi Heavy . Industry in Tokyo, brings a whole new meaning to ‘trigger-happy’. 'Kuratas' is fitted with a futuristic weapons system, including a gatling gun capable of shooting 6,000 BB bullets a minute, which fires when the pilot smiles. Transformers assemble: The 13ft, four ton, super-robot is going on sale for £900,000 - but you have to pay extra for the cup holder . Kuratas, made by Suidobashi Heavy . Industry, can be controlled either through the one-man cockpit or from . the outside using any smartphone connected to the 3G network. The robot, which is set will go on sale for £900,000, has around 30 hydraulic joints which the pilot moves using motion control. As it is made to order the style conscious buyer will not have to worry about sticking to the grey exterior - it comes in 16 colours, including black and pink, and for an extra £60 they will sort you out with a cup holder. Simple touch: All you need to remote control the robot is a 3G connection and works particularly well with iPhone's touchscreen . You can also use the MasterSlave control system where you move a tiny version of the Kuratas - with an iPhone strapped to its back - to get the life-sized one to follow your bidding . Engineers Wataru Yoshizaki and Kogoro Kurata were saluted in front of Kuratas together with their pilot Anna when they showcased the robot at the Wonder Festival in Chiba, suburban Tokyo earlier today. The team have been working on the robot since 2010. The company also released a video where very attractive Anna gives step by step instructions of how to operate the Kuratas. Rush hour: If you have grown weary of a traditional commute Kuratas is fully functioning on the road - but will not get you to work any faster as its top speed barely hits 7 mph . The video reminds the viewer of the security instructions on an airplane with Anna taking on the role as futuristic airhostess. If . you are not the piloting kind of millionaire, Kuratas can be operated . using what Suidobashi calls the ‘Master-Slave system’ where you control . the robot’s movements from outside using any device with a 3G network . such as an iPhone. ‘Automatic alignment allows you to . lock on your enemy target. Kuratas will not allow any targets to escape. 'With the alignment set appropriately the system will fire BBs when the . pilot smiles.’ Pilot Anna is set to enter the robot's cockpit and poses with the two men behind it: Wataru Yoshizaki, left and Kogoro Kurata after whom the robot has been named . Female 'pilot' Anna looks out the cockpit of Kuratas - with onlookers breathing a sigh of relief at the stern look on her face as the trigger for the heavy artillery is a smile . Realising . that there may be a flaw with this system of opening fire, the video . warns the pilot against smiling too much whilst operating . the Kuratas weaponry. Kurayas is 13ft tall and weighs four tons – not including the pilot. The . four wheeled legs ensures that it is easy to transport and the pilot . will be able to drive it at a top speed of just under 6.5 mph.

The new Chapel of Saint Albert the Great, . in Edinburgh, received an award for its pristine arc roof and 'steel trees.' Four tree-like Steel columns support a curved, oak-lined timber roof over the altar and sanctuary spaces. There are 13 prize-winning buildings in London from swimming baths in Islington, a community nursery in Camden and a West End office. Other projects include an open-plan . primary school in Hartlepool with rooms divided only by acoustic . curtains, a North London day-care hospice modeled on an over-sized house . to 'appeal sensitively' to patients, and a primary school in Blackburn . with a playground on the roof. Located in a dense grid of Victorian workers' terraced houses, the school accommodates 420 pupils in a thriving community of which a large proportion are Indian and Pakistani. It has a rooftop play deck linked to the ground with a tube slide . Open plan: The Forum is the centerpiece for the University of Exeter's famously hilly Streatham campus. It creates a 'green corridor' with an undulating timber gridshell roof . Restored:  Chedworth Roman Villa was accidentally discovered in 1864 by a gamekeeper  digging for a ferret. In 1924 the villa was acquired by the National Trust who started 2011 construction work in 2011 to provide a new cover building for the mosaics to ensure their lasting quality . Winner: The masterplan for London's Olympic Park covered an area of 242 hectares and was the focus of activities during the Olympic and Paralympic Games . Picturesque: After being awarded a £22.3 million grant in November 2007, Heartlands redeveloped the Pool area of West Cornwall which was left largely untouched following the demise of the tin mining industry . Futuristic: Pupils at Jesmond Gardens Primary School enjoy the open plan and circular facilities at the school in Hartlepool where classrooms are separated by acoustic curtains . 'Risk-taking is not for the faint-hearted in recessionary times,'  said Riba president Angela Brady told the BBC. 'But amongst this year's crop of truly exceptional buildings I am delighted to see such a variety of projects doing just that. 'It is good to see that sustainability is at the heart of so many of these winners - most clearly perhaps where, encouragingly, a major client has championed it.' The Riba Awards have been running since 1966 and are judged and presented locally. Last year's Stirling Prize was won by the Sainsbury Laboratory, an £82m plant research centre at the University of Cambridge.

"Thirteen years ago, photographer Miyoko Ihara began snapping pictures of the budding relationship between her now 88-year-old grandmother, Misa, and her tiny kitten, Fukumaru. The odd-eyed white cat is always in Misa's shadow whether she is farming the land, cooking, relaxing or even having a bath. Now their images have been published in a photo book, the pair have stormed to popularity in Japan with the unlikely bestseller flying off the shelves and becoming a viral sensation in the United States.

"Most people will have experienced that horrible moment when they realise they've just stepped in dog mess left strewn over the pavement. Now councils across the country are using a controversial health and safety poster depicting a toddler eating dog waste next to the words 'children will put anything in their mouths' to get owners to clean up their act. To ram home the message, a second picture of a dog turd is also shown next to a warning for dog owners to pick up their pet's mess or face a £1,000 fine. Bristol City Council has defended its use of the advert - claiming it has helped to reduce incidents of dog owners failing to clean up after their animals. Controversial: A posted used by Bristol City Council appears to show a child eating dog mess next to the words 'children will put anything in their mouths' A spokeswoman said: 'The idea behind the poster is to shock because dog owners not cleaning up after their animals is a shocking thing. Residents have found dog mess, which is very harmful to children, in playgrounds. 'We have several different posters which local councils and resident associations can pick from to use in their areas. 'People were very happy with this poster and the impact it made. We've never received any complaints.' TV illusionist Derren Brown was one of the first people to bring the unusual poster to light. Reaction by members of the public has been mixed - with some praising the shocking nature of the picture, while others thought it irresponsible. James Rhodes, @jrhodespionist, tweeted the council asking: 'What were you thinking?' Matt Crocker, @mfcrocker, tweeted: 'I really, really don't like this campaign. Pretty embarrassing that it's council run'. While Richard Littler, @richard_littler, added: Bristol City Council park poster is pretty wrong.' But Caroline Finucane tweeted: 'Nice. That's one way to get a message across, Bristol City Council.' Criticism: Many people took to Twitter to complain about the poster and the image of a child eating dog mess . Mixed opinions: But other members of the public loved the poster and commended the council for using it . But other members of the public commended the council for the 'brave' poster - arguing it would encourage dog owners to clean up after their pets. The poster was first used by Torbay Council in 2009 and was picked up by Bristol City Council for its own campaign in 2011. Other councils around the country have also incorporated the images in to clean-up campaigns. Speaking back in 2009, local councillor Dave Butt said dog mess on the streets had fallen by more than half from 400 reported incidents in April to 185 in June that year. He said: 'Dog poo on our streets, parks and beaches looks bad, smells bad, and is offensive to local people and visitors. 'The visual image chosen for our campaign is as disgusting as dog fouling itself and serves as a reminder that only by working together can we take action against offenders. 'The poster was rather unpleasant, but helped drive the message home very forcibly. 'We did not have any complaints, but we did have people ringing us to say it was about time and they were pleased we went in so hard.' In the spotlight: Derren Brown was one of the first people to highlight the poster on Twitter . Bristol City Council defended its use of the poster - claiming it will encourage dog owners to do 'the right thing'","Poster is part of campaign to get dog owners cleaning up after their pets .

"Lawyers for a man who pleaded guilty Thursday in the first ever federal conviction for illegal organ trafficking say he was performing life-saving services for severely ill people. Levy Izhak Rosenbaum, from New York, admitted in a Trenton federal court to brokering three illegal kidney transplants for desperate New Jersey-based customers in exchange for payments of $120,000 or more. He also pleaded guilty to a conspiracy count for brokering an illegal kidney sale. Convicted trafficker: Levy Izhak Rosenbaum , 60, before entering the courthouse in Trenton, New Jersey, on Thursday . Attorneys Ronald Kleinberg and Richard Finkel say Rosenbaum never solicited clients. He simply agreed to help desperately ill people by finding them kidney donors, they said. The lawyers claim the surgeries occurred in prestigious American hospitals and were performed by experienced transplant experts. They did not, however, name the hospitals involved, the Associated Press reports. The lawyers claimed that the donors he arranged to give up kidneys were fully aware of what they were doing. But anthropologist and organ trade expert Nancy Scheper-Hughes, who described Israel as a 'pariah' in the organ transplant world, has said in the past that many of the donors were desperately poor immigrants from eastern European countries such as Moldova, Romania and Russia. They say the recipients are leading healthy lives thanks to Rosenbaum. The 60-year-old was arrested two years ago following a huge investigation into corruption in New Jersey. The probe led to 46 arrests, including several rabbis, the New York Daily News reports. He was nabbed after an FBI informant who was pretending to be a businessman told him he was looking for a new kidney for a sick uncle . Rosenbaum was caught on tape boasting that he had brokered 'quite a lot' of illegal transplants. He told the informant: 'I am what you call a matchmaker.' 'I bring a guy what I believe, he's suitable for your uncle ... I've never had a failure.' Prosecutors said he bought the organs from vulnerable people in Israel for as little as $10,000, then sold them here for a minimum of $120,000. New Jersey's U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said: 'A black market in human organs is not only a grave threat to public health, it reserves lifesaving treatment for those who can best afford it at the expense of those who cannot. We will not tolerate such an affront to human dignity.' Caught in a sting: Rosenbaum is handcuffed and arrested in 2009 after a huge probe intro corruption in New Jersey . Rosenbaum faces a maximum five-year prison sentence on each count, plus a fine of up to $250,000. He also agreed to forfeit $420,000 in property that came from the kidney sales. He is a member of the Orthodox Jewish community in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn, where he had told neighbors he was in the construction business. Under 1984 federal law, it is illegal for anyone to knowingly buy or sell organs for transplant. The practice is illegal just about everywhere else in the world, too.But demand for kidneys far outstrips the supply, with 4,540 people dying in the U.S. last year while waiting for a kidney, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. Evil plan: Rosenbaum's home in Brooklyn where the matchmaking was masterminded . As a result, there is a thriving black market for kidneys around the world. Art Caplan, the director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania and a co-chairman of a United Nations task force on organ trafficking, said kidneys are the most common of all trafficked organs because they can be harvested from live donors, unlike other organs. He said Rosenbaum had pleaded guilty to one of the 'most heinous crimes against another human being.' Mr Caplan said: 'Internationally, about one quarter of all kidneys appear to be trafficked. 'But until this case, it had not been a crime recognized as reaching the United States.'","First ever U.S. federal conviction for organ trafficking .

"A private intelligence outfit which helps defence firms and paid for Adam Werritty’s jet-set lifestyle has doubled its profits since Liam Fox became a minister. G3 Good Governance Group gave £15,000 to Pargav Ltd, the company set up by Dr Fox’s best man and former flatmate, which helped fund his globetrotting and extravagant spending. The revelations prove a direct link between the defence industry and Mr Werritty’s globetrotting with the Defence Secretary. Dr Fox’s allies tried to say that Mr Werritty’s backers were ideological allies of the Defence Secretary. Proof: Intelligence firms invested in the company of Liam Fox's best friend Adam Werritty (front red tie), financing his trips with the Defence Secretary like this one to Dubai . But it is another example of  how some of them had commercial interests in the defence industries – a fact which made his position untenable. G3’s accounts show that the firm has enjoyed huge commercial success over the last two years. After making a loss of £33,026 in 2009, between 2010 and 2011 it doubled its turnover from £6million to £12million and raised its profits from £1.3million to £2.4million. G3 works hand in glove with a firm named C5 Capital, which describes itself as ‘an independent investment company, focusing on the global security sector’. One of C5’s employees is Lt General Sir Graeme Lamb, the former director of UK Special Forces. On C5’s website the firm reveals: ‘We are closely associated with the Good Governance Group, which includes G3, a leading strategic advisory consultancy. ‘Through G3, we have unparalleled access to in-depth sector knowledge and to an extensive network of specialist advisers.’ Funded by tycoons: Jet-set spending of friend who was always at minister's side . G3 and C5 work so closely together that they are based in the same London premises, 40 George Street in Marylebone. The two companies also share a director, Andries Pienaar, a South Africa-born security expert, who was once a managing director of the secretive private intelligence company Kroll. Eric Morris, G3’s geopolitics specialist, once taught at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. G3 said it gave money to Mr Werritty’s company because it had believed the donation of £15,000 was ‘intended to go towards charitable work’. But it ended up paying towards Mr Werritty’s stays in  five-star hotels around the world, first-class flights, lavish meals and even £2,000 suits. G3 also funds what it describes as a ‘charitable organisation’ – Universal Exports Charity Foundation, which is named after the company used as a cover for MI6 in the James Bond films. Universal Exports Charity Foundation is administered and run by Laura Tantum, who Sky News reported to be the daughter of Geoffrey Tantum, a former MI6 Middle East director. In a further twist, it emerged that the address at 40 George Street was formerly used by the Sri Lanka Development Trust, a group which Dr Fox helped to set up. The trust, along with the Sri Lankan government, paid for Dr  Fox to fly to Sri Lanka on three occasions. Its chairman is Chester Crocker, a former assistant secretary of state under Ronald Reagan. The trust was designed to help Sri Lanka rebuild its infrastructure following the civil war, using private finance and charitable projects. But Dr Fox’s involvement led to irritation in the Foreign Office, which has tried to keep its distance from the regime in Colombo accused of brutality against the Tamil minority. Despite this collection of security and defence groups using the same address, G3 has categorically denied any involvement with the Sri Lanka Development Trust or Liam Fox. On Thursday, a spokesman explained away the connection as a ‘coincidence’ and claimed to have no knowledge of who operated from the premises before G3. The Mail attempted to contact G3 yesterday but no one was available for comment. Other Pargav sponsors appear to include Michael Lewis, a millionaire with close links to Israel who helped fund Dr Fox’s Tory leadership campaign in 2005. The 52-year-old investor was  vice-chairman of Bicom until 2007, and last night insisted he was ‘not connected with globetrotting by Fox and Werritty’. Disappointed: Poju Zabludowicz says he was tricked into funding Werrity's globetrotting . One of Adam Werritty’s billionaire backers claimed yesterday that he was tricked into funding his globetrotting with Liam Fox. London-based Poju Zabludowicz – a former arms dealer who owns much of Las Vegas and helped bankroll David Cameron’s campaign to become Tory leader – was said to be ‘extremely disappointed’ to discover the truth about Mr Werritty. Mr Zabludowicz, 58, heads the Tamares Group of investment companies, based in Liechtenstein. The firm paid £3,000 to Mr Werritty’s company Pargav Ltd, which funded his first-class travel to meet Dr Fox on lavish foreign trips. Jonathan Hawker, a spokesman for Mr Zabludowicz, said: ‘He is just extremely disappointed. He is now learning that his money was not all used in the way he thought it was. ‘He is passionate about promoting dialogue to promote the Middle East peace process, and he donated £3,000 a year to [Mr Werritty’s  other company] Security Futures  for that purpose. ‘Then his office had a call from Werritty saying his annual contribution was due, and that the invoice would be from Pargav Ltd but that it was effectively the same thing. He took it at face value.’ In 2005, Mr Zabludowicz’s firm paid £15,000 to Mr Cameron’s campaign to lead the Conservative Party, and last year donated £131,805 to the party itself. Tamares is said to own approximately 40 per cent of the property in downtown Las Vegas, including numerous casinos, plus property in Washington DC and New York’s Times Square. Mr Zabludowicz fiercely guards his privacy and does so with much success despite counting Madonna and other A-list celebrities among his close friends. His wife Anita, 50, is a  renowned art collector, . The billionaire’s father Shlomo was an Auschwitz survivor who moved to Finland and built up the Israeli arms company Soltam. After Shlomo’s death in 1994, his son took over the business and sold most of the defence interests in favour of property. However, he is still chairman of a U.S. firm which manufactures ammunition for the military. Mr Zabludowicz, worth an estimated £2billion, is also a key  figure in Bicom, the British Israel Communications and Research  Centre, which is the UK’s major pro-Israel lobby and one of the common threads running through Mr Werritty’s network of political friendships. Mr Hawker added: ‘For many  years, Poju Zabludowicz has helped fund not-for-profit organisations, not individuals... [to] promote  peace and understanding  between the U.S., Europe and the Middle East.’","Investor G3 Good Governance Group gave £15,000 to the company set up by Adam Werritty and between 2010 and 2011 it raised its profits from £1.3million to £2.4million ."
"Drunkenly clutching AK47s, 2,000 Congolese soldiers descended on Minova with one objective. 'Go and rape women,' their commanding officer said. And they did. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Horrific: A young soldier describes the night in the Congolese village of Minova in November 2012 . Chilling: The unprecedented interviews show the challenge faced by the global summit against rape . In one night, a village of a few hundred people lost 79 women and children to the manic brutality of these men. That figure doubled in the days that followed. Now, in an unprecedented documentary Seeds Of Hope - to be unveiled tonight by Angelina Jolie and William Hague at this week's global summit against rape - two of the perpetrators from the November 2012 atrocities defend their actions. 'When we rape we feel free,' a young soldier explains. 'It is true we raped here. We found women because they can't escape. 'You see her, you catch her, you take her away, and you have your way with her. 'Sometimes you kill her. When you finish raping, then you kill her child.' Chillingly, he goes on, undeterred: 'We met other people, and we killed just for the sake of it. 'We raped, we destroyed everything. 'Everything that was in our path. 'I raped because my Commander started to rape first.' 'Pathetic': Film director Fiona Lloyd-Davies said this interviewee, an older soldier, was clutching a Bible and shaking as he described the night in Minova . Explanation? He claims he was acting under orders. In May, just two of the thousands of soldiers were found guilty . Support: Multiple rape survivor Masika was there and supported the women as soldiers swarmed . Brutal: In the Democratic Republic of Congo, 12 per cent of the female population have been raped at least once, according to official figures. These women (pictured in the Seeds Of Hope documentary) are survivors . Holding a Bible, shaking with remorse, an older soldier describes the same scene and claims they were acting under instructions. 'The Commander gave us an order and he was the one who started to do it,' he says. 'There was shooting everywhere. 'He told us to surround him so he wouldn't get shot. Then he started raping. 'He told us to go and rape women.' The attack was nothing new to the women of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Every hour, 48 women are raped, according to research from the American Journal of Public Health. That amounts to 1,152 women a day. Shockingly, 12 per cent of the nation's female population has been raped at least once. Sexual violence surged during the nation's five-year civil war between 1998 and 2003. Challenge: Angelina Jolie and William Hague have arrived at London's ExCel centre for the first day in a three-day summit challenging rape in war zones . But despite declaring peace, fighting has continued and brutal sexual assaults are commonplace. Masika, a multiple rape survivor who has helped more than 6,000 women and children in eastern Congo who have suffered physical and sexual violence, was there that night in Minova. Candidly, she says: 'There were so many soldiers, with tanks everywhere. 'The women were afraid... they asked me if we were going to die. 'I stayed calm and told the women not to be afraid - ""if I have to die, I'll die here with you, I will not run"".' Masika was first raped by a schoolteacher at the age of 15. Militia raped her and her two daughter before killing her husband. She is now a 'rape target' for other attackers. She introduced the crew to one of the many women to be attacked in Minova - one of the few to survive. The woman said: 'I didn't see their faces, I don't know them. 'How can you see someone who is hitting you in the eyes? 'How will you know someone who's inserting a gun barrel in your mouth and then another one in between your legs? 'Then he leaves and another one enters.' The chilling accounts are a snapshot into the enormous challenge Angelina Jolie and William Hague have vowed to tackle with 84 hours of action starting today. The Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict (ESVC) in London is the largest meeting ever held on ending sexual violence in conflict. 'I didn't see their faces. How can you see someone who is hitting you in the eyes, inserting a gun barrel in your mouth and another between your legs?' - A victim of the Minova rapes in November 2012 . It will bring together government delegations, NGOs, experts and sexual and gender-based violence survivors from over 145 countries. The event comes just a month after 37 of the soldiers arrested for the Minova rapes were acquitted of rape as a war crime. Just two of the defendants were found guilty. BAFTA-winning . Fiona Lloyd-Davies, director of the documentary, said: 'What kind of . message does that send out to the army? That they can get away with it. 'Speaking to the soldiers was very unnerving. The young one showed no remorse. He was particularly chilling. 'He was boastful, inflating numbers. 'Older, more educated soldiers have been . taught that rape is an abuse of human rights, that it is a crime. So the . older soldier was more of a pathetic character - in the real sense of . the word pathetic. 'He was clutching the Bible and kept saying how bad he felt. 'They had been ordered from on-high to withdraw, that was kind of how they tried to justify it. Prevalent: Sexual violence became prevalent during the 1998-2003 war - but has continued ever since . Fight for human rights: Masika, who has supported 6,000 rape victims and orphaned babies, was first raped at the age of 15 by a teacher, and later by soldiers who killed her husband and raped her daughters . 'They were angry, drunk, very aggressive. They described it as a chain of events. 'This happens. So really, we need solutions for what can be put into action; specific ideas. 'We need teams of experts on the ground. 'It is a huge missed opportunity that Minova was not used as a turning point to really call for changes. We'll see what this summit can bring about.' The summit, which is being held at ExCeL London, will run until Thursday and includes dozens of free events which will be open to the public.","135 women and children were raped and killed in Minova, Congo, in 2012 .

"An insurance giant is appealing against paying up to £5million compensation to a schoolgirl left brain damaged in a car accident – because she wasn’t wearing a high-visibility jacket at the time. Bethany Probert was 13 when she was hit by a car while was walking home from riding stables along a country lane on a December evening. The schoolgirl, now 16, suffered a broken collarbone, lung damage, and devastating head injuries which have caused permanent brain damage. Hit: Bethany Probert was hit when walking home from a horse-riding lesson - and left brain damaged . A High Court judge found the driver . 100 per cent liable for the crash but his insurers, Churchill, have . appealed, claiming it was partly Bethany’s fault. Yesterday her mother, Joanna, hit out . at the insurers. ‘I think it’s disgraceful that they have appealed,’ she . said. ‘Our lives have all been ruined. We had to sell a house to afford . her care and I had to leave my job to care for Bethany full time. ‘We have run out of money now and even if they lose the appeal, the process is delaying any compensation claims.’ Bethany, of Silverstone, Northamptonshire, had been to see her horse Troy at the stables near her home in December 2009. Devastating: Bethany's family have had to sell their home and her mother Joanna (right) has been forced to quit her job (Left, sister Ceris) Instead of waiting for her mother to . collect her, she decided to walk home down the narrow, bending, unlit . lane. She was listening to music on earphones. Paul Moore, a fitter, who was driving . to work in his Saab 9-3, clipped Bethany as she walked on the grass . verge, knocking her into a hedge. He stopped, found her and alerted the . emergency services. Bethany was left with limited walking . ability, depression and a lack of concentration or spatial awareness. She now requires specialist equipment, a support worker and an open . plan, single-storey home. Mrs Probert, 51, sued Mr Moore for . compensation to sustain care costs for the rest of Bethany’s life. Last . August, at the High Court in London Bethany was cleared of any . contributory negligence and Churchill was held to be fully liable. Mr Moore was found to be driving at about 50mph – which the judge considered to be too fast for such a road in darkness. But the Court of Appeal has allowed . the insurers to appeal against the original ruling. The test case will . decide to what extent children can be held responsible for their . injuries in road accidents. Trauma: Bethany, now 16, suffered a broken collarbone, lung damage and head injuries in the accident . 'Disgraceful': Churchill is trying to avoid paying the cash - claiming the accident was Bethany's fault . Churchill’s lawyers plan to tell the . court Bethany should have known to wear reflective clothing because she . was an experienced horse rider. But Mrs Probert said: ‘It is . ridiculous. They are saying she should have been wearing a . high-visibility jacket because she rode a horse but she only ever rode a . horse in the field. You don’t expect three years down the line to be . still waiting for closure.’ Bethany’s solicitor, Richard Langton, . said the size of the payout was due to be set at a separate hearing, . which has been delayed by Churchill’s appeal. ‘The final amount due is decided once . the future costs for the victim are known,’ he said. ‘The likely value . of this claim was due to be between £3million and £5million.’ Churchill said: ‘While we accept that . our insured was liable in part for the accident, we are appealing . [against] the decision that he was entirely to blame.’","High Court cleared Bethany Probert of any contributory negligence .

"President Nicolas Maduro has been accused of shifting the blame for remarks which suggest the double murder of two Britons was inspired by a soap opera . The murders of a man and his beauty queen wife in Venezuela were the result of soap operas which 'glamorise' violence, the country's president has said. President Nicolas Maduro claimed the deaths of Thomas Berry and Monica Spear Mootz could have been inspired by 'telenovelas' which feature themes of drugs, violence and crime. Critics have slammed the president's remarks, suggesting he is trying to distract from the real cause of crime in Venezuela which has the fifth highest murder rate in the world. President Maduro highlighted one programme in particular which features a psychopathic former beauty queen who poisons her mother. His comments come after pressure on authorities to crackdown on violent crime was heightened following the couple's deaths. Thomas Berry and Monica Spear Mootz were killed in cold blood after being robbed when their car broke down on the Puerto-Cabello to Valencia highway on Monday . Their five-year-old daughter who was also in the car, was shot in the leg. Police have made five arrests in connection with the case, including those of two minors. Anti-violence groups have estimated that the homicide rate is as high at 79 deaths per 100,000 people, but the government – which hides official crime statistics – claims it's 39 per 100,000, reports ninemsn.com.. The president has previously cited video games and superheroes as causes for crime in the South American country. Thomas Berry and Monica Spear Mootz were attacked by armed men who approached their car as they waited for a repair truck. The terrified couple locked themselves in their . Toyota Corolla. But the robbers opened fire through the windows. Scroll down for video . Heartbreaking: Monica Spear Mootz, 29, and Thomas Berry, 39, had an amicable split a year earlier but took vacations together with their daughter- including the one they were on when they were killed . Horrific: Robbers shot through the car windscreen when the terrified family locked themselves in . Nightmare: A friend of Berry said he had spoken to him on Sunday and was told they were having a great time . The bodies of Mr Berry and Ms Spear, who had American citizenship, were found in the car with their daughter, who had been shot in the leg. Their five-year-old, believed to be called Maya, was taken to hospital where family and friends are helping to care for her. According to Telemundo, the car was already on the back of a tow truck at the time of the attack. Two tow truck drivers who had arrived to help the couple are said to be under 'intense interrogation' by police. All the tires on the couple's car had been punctured after it hit 'a sharp object that had been placed on the highway', director of investigative police, Jose Gregorio Sierralta, said. At least six shots are believed to have been fired, hitting Mr Berry in the chest, his ex-wife in several places and their daughter in the leg. The attack appeared to follow a pattern of recent robberies, where cars are disabled by obstacles left in roads, or drain covers removed. A photo believed to be the couple's car was pictured behind police tape by Gilbert Angustia on Twitter. Monica Spear posted a video on Instagram of her horse riding just hours before she died . New horizons: Monica Spear posted this photo of she and her daughter Maya just days before the fatal attack that left her and her ex-husband dead . A still from a short film showing the actress riding before she blew a kiss to the camera on the day she died . Ms Spear was a famous TV actress following her pageant victory and appeared in a number of telenovelas [South American soap operas], with her roll in 'Forbidden Passions' the most notable. Police believe the couple may have been targeted by bandits who put obstacles in the road to force victims to stop. The ploy is commonly used on the country's highways after dark. Venezuela is one the most violent places in Latin America and armed robberies, carjackings and kidnappings are rife. The annual murder rate in Caracas alone is an average of 80 murders per 100,000 people, the third highest in the world. Most . murders occur in the slums where police presence is minimal. Eastern . Caracas is home to South America’s largest slum, named Petare with more . than two million residents, where the police to public ratio is 1 . officer to every 3,000 people. There . were an estimated 24,000 murders in 2013, one of the world’s highest . homicide rates. It has tripled in the previous decade. Gun ownership is also high, with an estimated 15 million unlicensed weapons in circulation. The University of Central Florida graduate had American citizenship and her parents live in Orlando, Florida. Pictures of the model enjoying the vacation with her young daughter were posted on Ms Spear's Instagram account in the days leading up to her death. In a short video posted on the day she was shot dead, the actress blows a kiss to the camera during a horse riding trip. Another photo shows Ms Spear holding hands with a girl, believed to be her daughter, as they gaze across a lagoon. Her ex-husband, who described himself as an . independent travel consultant in an online profile, lived in the capital . Caracas, reports El Universal. He moved to Florida for a short time after he was shot 15 years ago in a robbery that killed his friend. 'He had already been shot once by robbers trying to steal his car,' close friend Luis Dominguez told The Telegraph. 'His friend died in the incident and although doctors saved his life, they couldn't extract the bullet and he still had it in his stomach.'

It . is understood Mr Berry and his wife had separated last year, but were . still close friends and holidayed together for the sake of their . daughter. Better times: Some friends thought that they were going to announce that they were back together after the January vacation (seen at their wedding in 2008, the same year that their daughter was born) Police tape cordons off the couple's car, which had ground to a halt after the tires were punctured . The former beauty queen's Instagram showed her looking relaxed and happy . Monica Spear was visiting Venezuela so her daughter could learn about the country . His parents are at the hospital with the couple's daughter. It is not known if his sister, Katie, who lives in Scotland, will fly out to be with the family. Ms Spear's parents were flown from Florida to Venezuela by private jet, provided by Venezuela's president, so they could be with their granddaughter. 'It is the deepest pain, the deepest pain. It is unbelievable,' her father, Rafael, told the Orlando Sentinel. 'She was very charismatic, a very good daughter, a very good mother, and she loved Venezuela.' He recalled how his daughter had come to him for advice when she wanted to change from her chemical engineering course to study acting instead. 'I told her she had to decide what she wanted to do to be happy for the rest of her life,' he said. 'When my children were young, I wouldn't let them watch telenovelas, and then she began acting in soap operas, and I began watching all of hers.' Mr Dominguez, who ran an adventure tour company with the actress's ex-husband, told NBC he last spoke to Mr Berry on Sunday. 'They were having the greatest time. He said, I'll see you soon,' Mr Dominguez said. A friend of the family, Carlos Drakkar, 38, a Colombian graphic designer who lives in Caracas, said: 'This is a very difficult moment for all of us to deal with. We are doing all we can to help out friends in this difficult moment. These things happen all too often in this country. Something has to change.' Mr Berry, with his daughter Maya, 5.

Ms Spear's family had asked her to move to the U.S. with them after she was robbed six times, but the model refused. Her brother, Ricardo Spear Mootz, said: 'She loved her country too much. It was her home.' Family friend Marytza Sanz said Miss Spear loved Venezuela and even though she could have remained in the U.S. she chose to return so her daughter could spend time there. The network Miss Spear worked for released a statement describing her as a 'great actress' who had 'extraordinary drive and determination'. Venezuela's public prosecutor has appointed two separate investigators to the case, while the CICPC, Venezuela's SWAT police force unit, has been deployed to nearby slums for answers.

"This is the moment a £120,000-a-week Premier League footballer received an unexpected delivery from above. Manchester United midfielder Ashley Young was ranting at his team’s sloppy defence during their 2-1 defeat to Swansea City yesterday afternoon when bird excrement appeared to land in his mouth. In images captured by BT Sport that quickly spread on Twitter, the bird’s delivery landed right on the inside of the 29-year-old England international's lower lip from quite some distance away. Scroll down for video . Laser aim: As Ashley Young rants at the shaky Manchester United defence, the bird excrement can be seen flying towards his open mouth . Hitting the target: England international Young continues to shout as the 'delivery' lands on his tongue . Among those to spot the incident were Match of the Day presenter and former England footballer Gary Lineker, 53, who retweeted a Vine clip called ‘Bird s*** on Ashley Young’s mouth’. Journalist Rob Dawson said: 'Ashley Young was at fault for a goal, appears to have had bird muck fired in his mouth and has now hurt his shoulder. Not a good day.' Account Pablo Dominguez added: 'The bird pooping in Ashley Young's mouth was definitely today's highlight.' And US cartoonist Rob Torneo said: 'So a bird just pooped in Ashley Young's mouth.

Frustration: Young (left) cut an annoyed figure as lacklustre United slipped to defeat in Van Gaal's first game . New United boss Louis van Gaal's first Premier League game in charge of his team ended in a 2-1 defeat to Swansea, with his side looking well short of title material. Gylfi Sigurdsson, back at Swansea after signing from Tottenham Hotspur, fired in the 72nd minute winner to stun the hosts who had drawn level through Wayne Rooney shortly after halftime. After an encouraging pre-season there was a renewed air of confidence around Old Trafford as fans looked for a winning start from Dutchman Van Gaal and his much heralded 3-5-2 formation. But by half-time the mood had changed with United trailing and the formation abandoned after 45 minutes of slow and shapeless football. United looked little improved on the team that finished seventh last season, although the absence of striker Robin van Persie and several others through injury clearly hampered them. Bad start: The loss to Swansea was not the result Louis Van Gaal envisaged in his first match in charge .

"A former Wickes cashier who became governor of an oil-rich Nigerian state has been jailed jailed for his part in a scam which plundered £157million from some of the poorest people in the world. James Ibori was sentenced to 13 years in prison after he pocketed £50million which he splashed on a life of luxury including his own private jet. But the £50million figure may prove to be 'ludicrously low', said Judge Anthony Pitts as he sentenced Ibori for a series of offences including fraud and money-laundering. 'In the light of other matters, perhaps that is a ludicrously low figure and the figure may be in excess of £200 million, it is difficult to tell,' he told Southwark Crown Court in London. Playboy lifestyle: Former Wickes cashier James Ibori, 49, has admitted a fraud totalling more than £50million which he committed while a former Nigerian state governor . 'The confiscation proceedings may shed some further light on the enormity of the sums involved.' Ibori, 49, an ex-governor of Delta . State with presidential aspirations, stole public funds for a 'lavish . and expensive lifestyle'. His spending included a portfolio of . luxury houses, a £12.6million private jet, a fleet of top-of-the-range . cars, top UK boarding school places for his children, first-class travel . and posh hotels. As his people struggled in poverty, Ibori’s monthly credit card bills alone topped £125,000. It is estimated that the embezzlement . from the Delta state is yet unquantified, but could exceed £157million . which was laundered in London through a number of off-shore companies. The case at Southwark Crown Court was . delayed this morning after a ruckus broke out in the corridor and police . had to be called in to control crowds of his supporters. Luxury: Exclusive home that Ibori bought in Hampstead, north London,  with £2.2million in cash in 2001 . Fleet of cars: The former Nigerian state governor owned a number of cars including this Bentley Continental worth in the region of £150,000 . Extraordinary extravagance: Ibori owned a fleet of armoured Range Rovers - including this one - bought with the proceeds of his £50million fraud . Prosecutor Sasha Wass was thrown to the floor as supporters tried to rush into the tiny courtroom. She told the hearing: 'The defendant . was governor of the Delta State, one of the richest oil producing states . in Nigeria, between November 1999 and May 2007. 'It is the prosecution case that . during his two terms in office he deliberately and systematically . defrauded the people whose interests he had been elected to represent he . went on to launder the money he stole in this country.' He inflated state contracts, took . kickbacks, and through bent employees stole cash straight from the State . accounts and secreted the cash into off-shore accounts across the . globe. Instead of using the money to help his . people, he bought a £2.2 mansion in Hampstead with cash, a house in . Regents Park, a flat in St John's Wood, a £311,000 home in Dorset and a . £3.2million mansion in Johannesburg, as well as a house in Houston. Fraudsters: Solicitor Bhadresh Gohil (left) and Ibori's wife Theresa (right) who have already been convicted of money laundering in the scam . Convicted: Ibori's sister Christine Ibori-Idie (left) and his mistress Udoamaka Oniugbo (right) have also been found guilty of money laundering . His 'greed and acquisitiveness' was . also represented by his fleet of armoured Range Rovers worth £600,000, a . £120,000 Bentley, a Jaguar for his Hampstead home and a Mercedes . Maybach bought for 407,000 Euros that was shipped direct to his mansion . in South Africa, Ms Wass said. At an earlier hearing, Ibori pleaded . guilty to ten offences - eight of money laundering, one of conspiracy to . defraud Delta State and one of conspiracy to forge. Nigerian-born Ibori moved to the UK in . the 1980s where he married his wife, Theresa, and worked as a cashier . at Wickes in Ruislip, Middlesex, earning around £15,000 a year before . the couple were arrested for theft from the store in 1990 and fined . £300. A year later, he had another brush . with the law when he was convicted of handling a stolen credit card and . fined £100 before he moved back to his homeland and started as a ‘policy . consultant’ for President Sani Abacha’s regime before climbing the . ladder of the ruling People’s Democratic Party. After lying to the independent . Nigerian Election Commission by using a fake date of birth gained . through a false passport to hide his previous convictions and financial . status, Ibori was elected as state governor for Delta State from 1999 - . giving him immunity from prosecution for his two terms until 2007. Multiple residences: Homes Ibori owned in Lagos, Nigeria (left) and Kenton, north-west London (right) Homes: An apartment owned by Ibori's sister Christine Ibori-Ibie in Brent, north-west London (left) and a London property (right) owned by his mistress Udoamaka Onuigbo . Ms Wass described it as 'planned . fraud'. She said: 'He didn’t accidentally become involved in a . pre-existing corruption, he changed his date of birth in 1996. 'From the moment he was elected, he set out enriching himself at the expense of some of the poorest people in the world. 'His greed increased exponentially during the course of his governorship as did his arrogance.' It was heard that he tried to pay a $15m bribe to a government official to make the corruption investigation 'go away'. Even after he began to be investigated . in 2005, Ibori involved himself in another 'massive fraud' and tried to . bribe Nigerian officials, interfere with the trial and impugn the . integrity of the officers. Upmarket address: Another of the Nigerian's London properties lies on the capital's famous Abbey Road . Fraud: Another central London flat owned by Ibori's mistress (left) and a property he bought in Shaftesbury, Dorset, for £311,000 in 2005 (right) Lap of luxury: Ibori's mansion in the Nigerian capital of Abuja . He was helped by family members, . including his wife, sister Christine Ibori-Ibie, his mistress Udoamaka . Oniugbo, and a series of corrupt professionals - a London-based lawyer, . Bhadresh Gohil, who acted as his banker and set up a myriad of off-shore . companies, a fiduciary agent, Daniel Benedict McCann, a corporate . financier, Lambertus De Boer - who have all been jailed for a total of . 30 years. His fraud unravelled when the Met . raided the office of 'trusted servant' Gohil, 47, who has since been . jailed for 10 years, and found hard drives containing detailed records . hidden in the wall behind a fire place. A series of trials have taken place . leading to six convictions and sentences totalling 30 years but Ibori . has made a number of attempts to disrupt the course of justice, Ms Wass . said. When he was arrested in Nigeria in . 2007, the High Court froze assets worth £35million despite him only . earning around £4,000 a year. A court later dismissed the charges and he . fled to Dubai where he was arrested by the Met. He was trying to purchase a $20million jet when he was arrested. Ibori, wearing a dark suit and . glasses, is represented by two QCs during his sentencing hearing which . is expected to last two days. The case continues.

"As 'The Chosen One' banner appears amid a darkened, stormy sky, a Scottish voice sounds, 'Football, bloody hell. What the hell was that all about?'. A woman then has her say, 'I was ashamed of them'. The on-screen text is equally damning, 'Following a season of discontent' it reads. The banner, wearing the face of David Moyes, crumples to the backdrop of thunder and lightening. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal and Ryan Giggs in Man United cartoon parody . Remember him? This MUTV advert kicks off with the image of sacked manager David Moyes . Dawning of a new era: The new United, including Wayne Rooney, David de Gea and Danny Welbeck . This, however, is no fan-site illustration or rival taunt – this is MUTV, Manchester United's in-house television station. The trailer continues. 'Trust me, we'll be back,' a foreign voice adds as the United players emerge from the clouds with the message 'A new storm is breaking'. Ryan Giggs then has his say, 'Keep supporting us and the good times will come back soon'. While the statues of Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson stand guard, Giggs and new boss Louis van Gaal are cast in the troubled sky, 'The Master & Apprentice'. The neon, red lettering of 'Manchester United' breaks through the gloom, 'Start to rebuild a dynasty'. The message is clear: Moyes brought down the empire, Van Gaal and Giggs will rebuild it. MUTV makes no attempt to mask its appraisal of Moyes' efforts last season, the use of the word 'ashamed' proving particularly barbed. Statuesque: The promo also features the looming former managers Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Matt Busby . The new regime: The clouds reveal new boss Louis van Gaal and club legend Ryan Giggs . Having succeeded Ferguson – whose decision it was to appoint his compatriot – the Scot led the champions to a sorry seventh in the Premier League, missing out on Champions League football for the first time since 1995. Each passing week saw the collection of another unwanted record; it was United's worst season since the birth of the Premier League in 1992. Moyes paid with his job before the end of the campaign and Holland boss Van Gaal was appointed. Axed: Former Manchester United boss David Moyes is disparaged in the advert on the club's channel . MUTV are evidently keen to get behind the new regime and the trailer is a bold production given its setting on an in-house station. But in an age where we criticise clubs for the propaganda-like offerings from their official websites and TV channels, MUTV should at least be applauded for refusing to ignore their disastrous last campaign. We're not too sure David Moyes will agree with that sentiment, however.","MUTV advert shows a crumpled David Moyes 'Chosen One' banner .

"It is a scene of domestic mayhem you might see at any family home in middle England. With the school day over, five-year-old Dylan can't wait to chase his little sister Mia through their Victorian terraced family home. As the children shriek uproariously, their parents, Jill and Iain Kelly, laugh indulgently at their antics. Yet behind the laughter and the smiles lies a heartbreaking confession. For the truth is that had Jill and Iain understood how desperately ill their little boy would be, they would have opted for a course of action that many still find unthinkable. They would have terminated the pregnancy. 'I love my son. He's changed our lives,' Jill says. 'But if I'd known everything that Dylan would have to go through, and will have to go through, there's no doubt in my mind that, given the correct information, I would have asked for a termination. Dylan Kelly, five, needs round-the-clock care and his parents say they regret not having an abortion because of his problems, pictured with his sister  Mia, three . 'I'm adamant about that. And it makes me feel guilty just saying it because Dylan is my world. I love him, he's an amazing little boy.' Born with severe micrognathia, a condition that causes an undersized jaw and acute breathing difficulties, Dylan needs round-the-clock care. He has a permanent tracheostomy, is fed nutrient-rich milk through his stomach, has slurred speech and a deformed right arm. Sitting at Jill's side, husband Iain nods in agreement. 'We made it clear to the doctors that we didn't want a child who wasn't going to be able to ride a bike and do things that normal children do,' he says. Dylan's parents, Iain and Jill Kelly, were forced to leave their jobs to care for their son and they  have now been declared bankrupt . Jill interrupts. 'It sounds awful, doesn't it? I would hope that people would look at the whole story and the whole situation before they make a judgment. Nobody knows how they will feel until they're in that situation.' The fact is that the Kellys' lives have been shattered. Forced to leave their jobs to care for Dylan, they have been declared bankrupt and have now lost their home. They get through the weeks and months with the help of anti-depressants. They are furious that – as they see it – the Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI) in Newcastle failed to tell them how gravely disabled Dylan would turn out to be, and what consequences would follow. Only now have they abandoned a five-year legal battle to get justice from the NHS. They simply don't have the money to continue. As for Dylan, he suffers constant stress, has endured endless hospital visits and operations, and may have a tracheostomy tube for the rest of his life. Iain, 30, and Jill, 31, from Sunderland, met online in 2005. They married in 2008 and were delighted when Jill became pregnant. During a 20-week ultrasound scan, the sonographer noticed that the baby's long bone in his right arm was on the bottom end of the growth scale. Another scan a few days later revealed Dylan could have radial club hand, a condition that causes the hand to point towards the body, and Jill was referred to the RVI. Micrognathia is a term for a lower jaw that is smaller than normal. In some cases, the jaw is small enough to interfere with the infant's feeding. The problem can be caused by certain inherited disorders and syndromes. Micrognathia is can cause the teeth not to align properly and it can result in breathing problems. Children with this problem should see an orthodontist when the adult teeth come in. Because children may outgrow the condition, it often makes sense to delay treatment until a child is older. She recalls: 'I couldn't sleep or eat. It sounds awful, but I didn't want a baby with disabilities. I was thinking, 'Is he going to be in a wheelchair? Am I going to lose my job and be a stay-in parent?' It wasn't what I wanted for myself at the time.' At the RVI, Jill had a more in-depth scan and an amniocentesis test. One of the consultants mentioned that the baby had a small jaw, but Iain and Jill say micrognathia wasn't mentioned. The main issue was that his arms and wrists appeared to be fixed in position. Jill says: 'When I say it out loud it sounds terrible, but I didn't want to bring a baby into the world that was going to have a sub-standard life.' The couple made the agonising decision to terminate the pregnancy. When they explained their wishes to the consultants, they were advised that it was too early to make a 'rash' decision. During the next two months they had several more scans. The results from the amniocentesis were fine and chromosome tests came back normal. They were told the baby's heart was normal, they were reassured that a kink in Dylan's spine was minor, and that the problems with his arm could be fixed with surgery. The micrognathia had appeared on the scan notes as a potential problem, but Iain and Jill say the consultants never explained verbally to them the condition or what it would mean for Dylan's quality of life. Ultimately it was decided that the chances of Dylan having the condition looked 'less convincing'. Iain and Jill say they were left feeling reassured. 'We knew we were going to have a baby with a bad arm and bad hand, but that was it,' Iain says. Dylan was born at Sunderland Royal Hospital in July 2009 by emergency caesarean section. He was tiny, weighing just 3.4 lb. Doctors discovered he had severe micrognathia and a large tongue, which was tucked down his windpipe, preventing him from breathing. He was blue and floppy and was rushed to theatre for an emergency tracheostomy. 'The surgeon came to get consent to put a tracheostomy in and said it wasn't looking good,' Jill says. 'I thought Dylan was dead. I remember discussing funeral arrangements with my dad.' Dylan pulled through but it was found that as well as the micrognathia he had a cleft palate and a hole in his heart. He was very small and had the deformity in his right arm – and both conditions were deemed signs of Baller-Gerold syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. The couple are furious and claim the Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI) in Newcastle (pictured) failed to tell them how gravely disabled Dylan would turn out to be, and what consequences would follow . Before they could take him home, Iain and Jill had to perfect several procedures to care for Dylan, including learning how to suction-out his tracheostomy several times an hour. Despite the trauma of Dylan's arrival, Jill soon found she was desperate for a second child. 'My body craved a normal child,' she says. 'To give birth, hold the baby and breast-feed – all the stuff I missed out on with Dylan.' I ask if they would have terminated Mia, now three, had she shown abnormalities. They both nod their heads. 'I wouldn't want to put another child through what Dylan has been through,' says Jill. Until Mia was born, Iain worked a 40-hour week as a computer technician for Siemens. But he left the job to help Jill care for Dylan and the new arrival. Jill had already quit her job at Barclays Bank. Before long the debts were piling up – the family had to forfeit their home and are now renting a four-bedroom house. Feeling they had not been given the full picture of Dylan's disabilities, Iain and Jill decided to launch a claim against the NHS. Two weeks before the court date, which had been set for last Monday, their law firm, working on a 'no-win, no-fee' basis, dropped the claim, saying the couple didn't have a strong enough case. Jill says: 'For us, it was never about the money, it was about justice. I've got no idea where we go from here. We have no pensions, no money, no house and no job prospects. But we love our son. He's amazing and we're going to give him the best life we can.' A spokesman for the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said it 'acknowledges the decision of Mr and Mrs Kelly to discontinue their claim. The Trust would like to extend its best wishes to Mr and Mrs Kelly and Dylan for the future.'","Dylan, five, was born with a condition that causes acute breathing difficulties .

Danielle Wolfe, 22, was arrested under a city ordinance in North Augusta, South Carolina, that makes it a crime, punishable by up to 30 days in jail,  to 'utter, while in a state of anger, in the presence of another, any bawdy, lewd or obscene words or epithets.'

"A convicted murderer tried to skip his sentencing hearing because he didn't want to hear his victim's family 'b**** and whine' about what a monster he is, it has emerged. Seth Mazzaglia, who was convicted in June of the 2012 killing of University of New Hampshire student Elizabeth Marriott, dropped his bid to skip the hearing after an appearance in court on Tuesday. Prosecutor Peter Hinckley had argued that Mazzaglia, 31, should be compelled to attend the sentencing hearing, which will be held on Thursday. 'Suffice it to say there are multiple . interests at stake - the court's, the public's, the victim's family and . the defendant's,' Hinckley told Strafford County Superior Court Judge . Steven Horan. Killer: Seth Mazzaglia, pictured leaving court on Tuesday, said he didn't want to listen to the victim's family 'yell and whine' about what a monster he is at his sentencing hearing - but he has now dropped his bid to skip it . On Tuesday, the court heard how Mazzaglia had told his mother in a recorded phone call that he did not want to go and 'have to sit there for an . hour and a half listening to them yell and whine and b**** and moan . about what a monster I am' - referring to Marriott's family and friends. 'I already know what everyone's gonna say there so why the hell do I have to be there,' he said in the call, made on August 6. 'And it's a waste of my time.' He insisted that he should have been found 'innocent of the big stuff'. But his mother, Heather Mazzaglia, told her son that he should face the family. 'They're in misery,' she said. 'I mean they're in agony - their daughter is lost. I would be the same if it were you... You have to sympathize with what they've lost. 'I think you have to be there... I think they have a right to confront you because the jury found you guilty.' Victim: Lizzi Marriott was killed after she rebuffed Mazzaglia's advances in 2012 and her body has never been found. Her mother Melissa, pictursed, called Mazzaglia 'cowardly' for trying to avoid the sentencing hearing . After court on Tuesday, the mother of victim . Lizzi Marriott, Melissa Marriott, said she wasn't surprised by . Mazzaglia's comments to his mother. 'He's just a selfish coward, and he really does not care about anybody else,' she said. She called his motion 'a . self-serving attempt to avoid being held publicly accountable for . Lizzi's murder and rape' and said it was 'a cowardly attempt to avoid . facing us, the victims of his horrific crimes'. Mazzaglia was convicted in June of . first-degree murder and other felonies in the October 2012 death of the 19-year-old student, who was from Westborough, Massachusetts. His ex-girlfriend, Kathryn McDonough, testified he . strangled Marriott from behind with a rope and then raped her motionless . body at his Dover apartment after he rebuffed her advances. Testimony: Kathryn McDonough, Mazzaglia's girlfriend at the time of the killing, is pictured in court in June as she testified that she had brought the teen to their home as a sex offering for her boyfriend . McDonough had lured Marriott to their . apartment as appeasement to him and to join their sexual escapades, . which included bondage and discipline. McDonough first told investigators that Marriott died during rough sex between the two women that involved restraints. After getting immunity from prosecution, McDonough said Mazzaglia strangled Marriott and then raped her. Marriott's body, which prosecutors say was dumped in a river, has never been found. McDonough pleaded guilty to hindering prosecution and is spending 1 1/2 to 3 years in prison. On August 6, Mazzaglia spoke to his mother, Heather Mazzaglia, on the phone from prison and told her he did not want to go to the trial. A transcript of the recorded call was shared in court on Tuesday: . Heather Mazzaglia: Have the lawyers come to visit you at all?Seth Mazzaglia: Um, rarely because it's a bit of a haul for them but they're supposed to come visit me before the fourteenth [the date of the sentencing hearing]. I'm gonna see.HM: Okay.SM: If there's any way I cannot attend the fourteenth.HM: Either what?SM: That I cannot go to the fourteenth. I already know what everyone's gonna say there so why the hell do I have to be there. And it's a waste of my time.HM: Yeah well it's - it's for them.SM: Yeah well I'm not feeling particularly gracious at the moment.HM: I know.SM: Heh. If I had been found innocent of the big stuff like I should have been, and like I am, now then it might be a different story. Then, then I might have some sympathy.HM: Well.SM: But.HM: Yeah all you can do is regret your part in it. And.SM: Yeah but I'm gonna have to sit there for an hour and a half listening to them yell and whine and b**** and moan and scream about how I'm a monster who killed someone when I'm not. That's what I'm literally gonna have to listen to for the whole time.HM: (Unintelligible)SM: It isn't gonna be like, ""Oh you took away our chance of burying her"", it's gonna be, ""You're a monster"" and that's what it's gonna be over and over and over again.SM: Ah.HM: So anyway. Anyway. I'm - I mean you can -, they're in misery. I mean they're in agony. Their daughter is lost. I would be the same if it were you but, you know, you have to sympathize with what they've lost and I, ask, um, ask Jacque and Melissa I mean and the verdict took long I don't see why you, eh, it's you're allowed to say that. I don't know. I don't know what they allow you to do.SM: Well my preference would be not to attend the sentencing hearing on the fourteenth. I can get an after action report that tells me everything that I already knows gonna happen there.HM: I think you have to be there to be sentences so.

"A high-rolling poker player who duped two major banks in a £750million fraud so he could fund a Champagne lifestyle has been ordered to pay back just £3million. Flamboyant fraudster Achilleas Kallakis, 46, conned lenders into advancing enormous loans to buy 16 landmark properties across the UK during the property boom. The buildings included the £225m headquarters of the Daily Telegraph in London and a £100m Home Office building in Croydon. Kallakis - the nephew of a Greek shipping magnate - teamed up with 'prolific forger' Alexander Williams, also 46, to swindle the Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Scotland. Fraudster Achilleas Kallakis, 46, pictured left, team up with Alexander Williams, pictured right, to carry out a £750m fraud during the property boom - but the pair have been ordered to pay back less than £3.5m . The pair operated out of a Mayfair office as the Pacific Group of Companies and duped lenders into advancing loans totalling £766m on the back of forged or false documents. Dubbed 'The Don' after winning $1m in a poker game, Kallakis then blew millions of pounds on an extravagant lifestyle. The father-of-four - who called himself 'his excellency' and claimed to be a San Marino ambassador - bought a private jet for £27m, a helicopter for £5.2m and a luxury yacht which was moored in Monaco. He also owned a fleet of chauffeur driven Bentleys, a villa in Mykonos and a sought-after property in Brompton Square, Chelsea. Last year, Kallakis, from Chelsea, was jailed for seven years after being convicted of two counts of conspiracy to defraud banks. Williams, from Fulham was locked up for five years. But today Kallakis was ordered to pay just £3.25m of the money he obtained during the elaborate scam. Dubbed 'The Don' after winning $1m in a poker game, Kallakis blew millions of pounds on an extravagant lifestyle . He has now been ordered  to pay £3.25m within six months, or serve a default sentence of seven years imprisonment . If he does not pay the money within six months, he will serve a default sentence of seven years in jail the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said. Williams had received a confiscation order of £477,474.25 earlier this month, payable within six months. He will be jailed for three years if the amount is not paid. From 2003 to 2008 the pair used forged documents from fictitious Hong Kong based property developer SHKP, sham legal letters and bogus guarantees to apply for loans on high value commercial property. As well as purchasing the Daily Telegraph building in Buckingham Palace Road for £225m, they also bought a 23-storey building in Vauxhall, south London, for £75million. The property portfolio also included several sought-after properties in Mayfair and Knightsbridge - two of the most affluent areas in London - as well as buildings in Sussex, Liverpool and Reading. St James Square was one of the 16 properties Kallakis acquired during his five-year spending spree . Another property in central London, left,  and the Home Office building in Croydon, south London, right, were another two of the properties Kallakis bought through fraudulent bank loans . The Telegraph Media Group headquarters on Buckingham Palace Road was bought for a reported £225million by Kallakis during the scam . The fake guarantees, said to cover the rental income from the buildings, led to increased valuations and generated a £77m surplus. A further £114m put up by AIB and due to be paid in in reverse premiums - incentives for SHKP - was also plundered by Kallakis and Williams. They also duped the Bank of Scotland into parting with £26million in 2007 for the conversion of a ferry into a luxury yacht. The banks eventually lost nearly £60million when the scam collapsed. Following a retrial lasting almost four months, both were jailed and disqualified from acting as company directors. Kallakis and Williams were convicted in 1995 of selling bogus titles to wealthy Americans including current US congressman for the Louisiana 7th District, Charles Boustany. Their victims were attracted by the ultimate step in upward mobility and believed they would receive priority on the Queen's social list. Kallakis bought a private jet for £27m, pictured right, and also owned a fleet of Bentleys, left (file pics) He owned a villa in Mykonos, pictured, as well as property in Brompton Square, Chelsea, and Monaco, where he is said to have been a member of Prince Albert's charitable foundation (file pic) Police then tracked the pair, who travelled by Concorde, through their BA Airmiles. They were fined and sentenced to 160 hours of community service. Both Kallakis and Williams changed their names after the peerage fraud - Kallakis was formerly known as Stefanos Kollakis, while Alexander was previously called Martin Lewis. Williams had also been convicted in February 1993 of using the names of dead people to obtain British passports. Mark Thompson, head of the SFO's proceeds of crime division, said today: 'The SFO is committed to ensuring that fraudsters do not retain the benefit of their crimes. 'Following a lengthy and challenging confiscation investigation by the proceeds of crime division, the court has made a substantial order against Mr Kallakis. We will take steps to make sure the order is satisfied within the period set by the court but if he does not pay, he faces a further lengthy term of imprisonment.'","Achilleas Kallakis, 46, fooled bankers into giving him loans to buy  properties .

"Britain is to lead the search for a cure for dementia – one of the ‘greatest enemies of humanity’, David Cameron will say today. In tomorrow’s Autumn Statement, Chancellor George Osborne will pledge at least £15million towards a new fund focused on boosting investment into dementia research. It will bring together investors from the private, public and philanthropic sectors to pool their money in a single scheme that will invest in research projects identified by scientists as having the best potential for future success. Harrowing affliction: Britain is to lead the search for a cure for dementia – one of the ‘greatest enemies of humanity’, Prime Minister David Cameron will say today. File picture . Investors from the private, public and philanthropic sectors will pool their money in a single scheme that will invest in research projects identified by scientists as having the best potential. File picture . Experts warn that unless better treatments are found, the number of over-60s living with Alzheimer’s and related conditions will more than double from 800,000 to two million over the next 35 years, putting a huge strain on the NHS and social services. As well as devastating families, dementia already costs the economy up to £21billion a year in treatment costs and lost productivity. Mr Cameron will say: ‘Britain has led the global battle against dementia and last year brought the world’s most powerful nations together in London for a G8 summit on this terrible disease. Chancellor George Osborne will pledge at least £15million towards a new fund focused on boosting investment into dementia research . ‘At that meeting, I made clear there had to be a big global push to find new treatments and a cure for dementia. ‘Tomorrow we will announce new funding to help drive forward the search for new drugs to beat dementia. 'The Government will commit £15million to help kick-start a fund and attract the private sector investment needed for this crucial work. Dementia is one of the greatest enemies of humanity and we must all play our part in defeating it.’ At least five times more is spent on cancer research than dementia worldwide, and only three new dementia drugs have come on to the market in the last 15 years. The new fund is designed to spread potential financial risks evenly – making it a more attractive option for private sector investment. A similar approach has been successful in raising cash in other areas, most notably a scheme to increase children’s access to immunisation that raised £3billion in international markets in just eight years. Dr Dennis Gillings, who was appointed by Mr Cameron as an adviser on dementia earlier this year, said: ‘Dementia is a ticking bomb yet progress with research is achingly slow. ‘Just as the world came together in the fight against HIV/Aids, we need to free up regulation so that we can test groundbreaking new drugs.’ Hilary Evans, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘The treatments available for people with dementia offer scant relief – we need a therapy that acts to slow or stop [the] disease. If we could produce a treatment that delayed onset by five years, a third fewer people would ever experience… dementia.’","Chancellor will pledge at least £15m towards a new research fund .

"President Barack Obama took the unprecedented step last week of using executive authority to protect close to 5 million immigrants residing in the United States illegally, defying the wishes of both Republicans Congress and the American people. Immigration reform advocates are already decrying him, however, saying his expansive actions didn't go far enough. 'This will impact less than half of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living here right now,' Lancaster, Pennsylvania, radio host and immigration activist Wilfredo Seda told a local news publication the day after Obama's announcement. 'By ignoring that many people, we are still leaving most people in the shadows,' Seda continued. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama delivers remarks on his executive action regarding immigration reform at the Copernicus Cultural Center in Chicago, Illinois on Tuesday. At one point he was heckled by three different immigration activists . Obama told the hecklers, one of whom can be seen standing behind him to his left, that he didn't understand why they were mad at him considering he had just acted to save millions of illegals from deporation . 'He’s done good but I wish he had done more,' United Action Connecticut President Steve Volpini told The Record-Journal. 'You’re talking about parents of DREAMers, many of them won’t be eligible, unless they have children born here. That’s going to be hard to take,' he said. The order to defer deportation for select groups of illegal immigrants outlined by Obama in a presidential address last week only covers the parents American citizen children. It does not affect the parents of illegal immigrant children. Also protected by the directive are qualifying immigrants who arrived in the U.S. before the age of 16, also known as DREAMers. All applicants must have been living in the U.S. since Jan. 1, 2010 in order to be eligible for work permits. Immigrants who arrived after that date will still be subjected to removal proceedings. In addition to living in the U.S. for the last five years, immigrants seeking special consideration must pass background and national security checks in order to stay in the country and they must pay their taxes. The president has said on numerous occasions that he would like to have helped more illegal immigrants but he believes that the law prohibits him from expanding his deferred action program any wider than he already has. Only Congress, he's said, can decide to waive deportations for all illegal immigrants. In promoting his executive actions President Obama has played up his decision to remove criminals, not children and families, from the country first. A seemingly positive realignment of government resources, the commentary has angered some immigration activists who believe that minor criminal records shouldn't stand in the way of legal status. 'Many deserving individuals are left out of his announcement like those who are waiting patiently on waiting lists, those with minor criminal offenses, and the parents of DREAMers,' Bill Ong Hing, founder of the Immigrant Legal Resource Center in San Francisco told NBC News last week. Maru Mora Villalpondo, an immigrant who will be saved from deportation by Obama's proclamation, made a similar observation last Friday at a protest in front of a Tacoma, Washington, detention center. In addition to immigrants who have committed petty crimes, Villlalpando told the Associated Press Obama's plan unfairly left out single, childless and LGBT immigrants. 'For those millions and millions that are not going to be protected under the president's executive action, we're here for them. We're going to tell the stories of those that are not going to be protected,' Villalpondo said during the rally. At the same event another illegal immigrant who will be allowed to stay as a result of Obama's order, Claudia Martinez, lamented that her husband may still be deported because he was once arrested from driving under the influence of alcohol. 'I feel sad for my husband because he's the one who works. I'd like him to have a work permit, so we can advance,' she reportedly told AP in Spanish. A young man identified as Angel Fernandez interrupted Obama's Las Vegas, Nevada, speech last Friday to press him to end deportations for more illegal immigrants . In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, activists were also visibly dismayed during Obama's announcement when he said he would target criminals and beef up border security, the city's National Public Radio affiliate reports. 'I can’t accept the first half of the speech, I think it’s still insulting to many who are Mexican,' Gil Amador, a member of the city's immigration group Voces de la Frontera, told the radio station during a watch party the night of Obama's national address. 'Democrats are still scared of Mexicans and there is an implicit racism on this. They are scared of us,' he said. Instead of keeping Mexicans out, he said the U.S. needs to 'build bridges' between the two countries. 'It’s not just deportations, it’s not about dreamers. It’s about connecting our communities,' he said. At public events since his speech Obama has repeatedly been heckled by immigration activists who are upset with him for not instructing immigration officials to stop deporting all illegal residents. During a celebratory speech last Friday in Las Vegas, Nevada, hours after his immigration announcement, two young men from Phoenix, Arizona, interrupted his remarks to share their displeasure. 'That's right, not everybody will qualify under this provision. That's the truth,' Obama said. 'That's why we're still going to have to pass a bill.' 'This is a first step,' he said moments later. 'It's not the only step. We're still gonna have to do more work.' Again on Tuesday Obama was chided during an appearance in his hometown, Chicago, Illinois, by a young female activist who felt he wasn't doing enough for the cause. After Obama noted that deportations of criminals have increased by 80 percent, a young woman began shouting at the president. 'Mr. President, that has been a lie. You have been deporting every...' she said before she was interrupted by the president. Moments later a second young woman, this one sitting in a section directly behind the president that is normally reserved for his most ardent supporters, began yelling at him, as well. She was quickly joined by an unidentified man in the audience. Growing frustrated, Obama turned around to the young woman closest to him and said, 'Can I just say this? All right, I've listened to you. I heard you. Turning back around, he said two the two other hecklers, 'I heard you. I heard you. All right?' 'I've been respectful. I let you holler,' Obama told them. 'But you’ve got to listen to me, too. All right? 'And I understand you may disagree. I understand you may disagree. But we've got to be able to talk honestly about these issues. 'Now, you're absolutely right that there have been significant numbers of deportations. That's true. But what you're not paying attention to is the fact that I just took action to change the law,' he continued. He later told them, amid laughter from the rest of the audience, 'I understand why you might have yelled at me a month ago, although I disagree with some of your characterizations, it doesn’t make much sense to yell at me right now when we're making changes.' Jose Patino of Phoenix, Arizona, also interrupted Obama's speech that afternoon. The text on Patino's shirt indicates that he may be living in the country illegally . On the opposite end of the political spectrum are conservatives, who say now is the correct time to be yelling at Obama over immigration. They perceive his actions to be lawless and making the issue a centerpiece of their complaints against the Democratic president. A CNN poll released on Wednesday shows that 56 percent of Americans agree with them that Obama shouldn't have went around Congress to change the law, even though 50 percent of them say they would otherwise be fine with the actions included in his order if it came from the legislative branch. Another 26 percent said the reforms went too far, regardless, while 22 percent said they should have went further. As immigration reform advocates have been placing direct pressure on Obama at his own events, according to the New York Times, anti-amnesty activists are bombarding their members of Congress with envelopes filled will articles on illegal immigration. The Times also said a group of sheriffs were planning a demonstration next month at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. Republicans on the Hill who oppose Obama's executive actions having been putting their all into convincing the leadership of both the House and the Senate to give their blessing to a plan that would fund every government agency but those within the Department of Homeland Security. The only way for DHS to receive government money for services beyond border patrol and immigration enforcement procedures would be for Obama to sign legislation rescinding his executive order. Conservatives who back the plan say they believe members of Obama's party in the Senate, where Republicans will only hold 54 of the 60 seats needed to block a filibuster, would join with them in sending the bill to the president's desk. Even if it go there, though, the White House has indicated that it would consider vetoing it. Conservatives say they think Obama would rather see DHS funded than not at all, however, and they believe the gamble would pay off. Republican leaders have been mulling the strategy and have indicated that they are looking to make a decision during a weekly closed-door policy meeting with members on Tuesday. Even now, less than a month after the election that gave their party power, conservative activist groups are looking ahead to 2016 to make lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who don't side with them on this, and other key issues, pay at the ballot box, however. 'This is going to become the Obamacare for the 2016 cycle,' David N. Bossie, president of Citizens United told the Times. 'You’re going to see a constant drumbeat, a constant march,' he said. 'When you call down the thunder, sometimes it’s not pretty.'","'This will impact less than half of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living here right now,' one said .

"One in 30 deaths in Holland are now from euthanasia, it has been revealed. It comes after the Dutch government allowed mobile death squads to kill sick and elderly people in their own homes. Official figures released yesterday, showed that euthanasia deaths soared by 13 per cent in 2012 compared to the previous year. There were 4,188 deaths by euthanasia last year – accounting for three per cent of all deaths -  compared to 3,695 deaths by euthanasia in 2011. One way trip: Euthanasia in the Netherlands is carried out by a doctor administering a strong sedative to put the patient in a coma, followed by a drug to stop breathing and cause death . It marks the sixth consecutive year that deaths by euthanasia have increased in the Netherlands. The government has said that the reasons for the increase in euthanasia deaths cannot be determined with certainty. Leading theories include a growing awareness and acceptance of the practice among both Dutch doctors and patients. In March last year, however, Holland launched the world’s first mobile death squads to be dispatched in cases when family doctors refused to administer lethal drugs on ‘ethical’ grounds. The six units, comprising of at least a doctors and a nurse, were expected to send the number of euthanasia cases in Holland rocketing, with pro-euthanasia campaigners saying they would end the lives of an additional 1,000 ‘borderline’ patients a year. Anti-euthanasia activists in Britain said yesterday the year-on-year increases in euthanasia death proved argument that euthanasia was a ‘slippery slope’. Elspeth Chowdharay-Best, the honorary secretary of Alert, said: ‘It is what we expected and I do hope that people will pay more attention now to the warnings that have been made about introducing euthanasia to this country. ‘The Dutch experience shows that euthanasia becomes routine,’ she added. ‘It traps more and more people into thinking they ought to leave this world prematurely. ‘In that kind of culture euthanasia becomes expected and inevitable and everything else – such as good palliative care and a functional hospice movement – is gradually portrayed as rather selfish.’ Nikki Kenward of Distant Voices, a disability rights group, said: ‘These numbers fill me with fear and horror. ‘We are failing to see the dangers,’ said Mrs Kenward who has been confined to a wheelchair since an attack of Guillian-Barre syndrome in the early 1990s. The Dignitas building in Pfaeffikon near Zurich: Under Swiss law only 'assisted suicide' is permitted - which means that patients must take an active role in administering the drug that ends their lives . ‘Anyone who believes these figures to be necessary or acceptable should look to the future and be wary of the moment when the death doctor calls at their house uninvited – when the safeguards, score-sheets and so-called sentimentality have given way to a new world where age, infirmity and “useless” lives are seen as unnecessary and people like me are targeted once again.’ Holland became the first country in the world since Nazi Germany to legalise euthanasia when in 2002 it approved doctor-administered lethal drugs for terminally ill people facing unbearable suffering. For several years, the reported number of cases declined, but since 2006 – when there were 1,923 deaths by euthanasia - they have risen steadily. Most cases involve cancer patients but increasingly that have included dementia sufferers and even psychiatric patients. In 2005 the Groningen Protocol protected doctors from being prosecuted for the euthanasia of infants as long as they followed approved guidelines. Euthanasia is carried out by administering a strong sedative to put the patient in a coma, followed by a drug to stop breathing and cause death. The Dutch government has insisted that ‘the greatest care’ is taken to offer euthanasia only to patients ‘who are suffering unbearably with no prospect of improvement’. Holland is following a pattern of incremental euthanasia deaths wherever the practice has been legalised. Last year, Belgium, where euthanasia came into force in 2003, saw a 25 per cent increase in the number of euthanasia deaths, leaping from 1,133 in 2011 to 1,432, a figure representing about two per cent of all deaths in the country. A similar pattern is emerging in those countries where physician-assisted suicide has been legalised.In Washington State in the U.S., physician-assisted suicide deaths increased by 17 per cent in 2012 to 83 cases, up from 70 in 2011. Again there were incremental rises of 51 in 2010 and 36 in 2009, when the state’ s Death With Dignity Act took effect. In the neighbouring State of Oregon, the first U.S.-state to legalise assisted suicide, deaths at the hands of doctors are also at an all-time high. There were 59 assisted suicide deaths in Oregon in 2009, 65 in 2010, 71 in 2011 and 77 in 2012 - a 30 per cent increase overall in just four years. Overall, assisted suicides have shot up by 381 per cent from 16 in 1998, when the practice was legalised. Switzerland, which first relaxed prohibitions on assisted suicide in 1942, has seen a 700 per cent increase deaths in the same period. Authorities recorded a steady rise of assisted suicides of Swiss nationals from 43 in 1998 to 297 in 2009. The figures do not include people from abroad who travel to Dignitas to commit suicide there.","Around 3 per cent of all deaths in the Netherlands are now by euthanasia .

"Sienna Miller today admitted having a 'brief' affair with Daniel Craig - but insisted that she was just being friendly when she left him a voicemail message saying 'I love you'. The News of the World claimed that the actress was cheating on her then-boyfriend Jude Law in 2005 after a reporter listened to the message by hacking in to Mr Craig's inbox. The actress told a court today that she had a 'brief encounter' with her friend and co-star Mr Craig, but added that she often said 'I love you' at the end of phone conversations with friends or family. Speaking via video-link at the Old Bailey, Ms Miller was asked about a message she left on Mr Craig's phone saying: 'Hi. It's me. Can't speak. I'm at the Groucho with Jude. I love you.' Scroll down for video . An artist's court drawing from the Old Bailey today. Ms Miller is pictured next to an FBI employee while giving evidence via video-link . Affair: A hacked message apparently revealed that Sienna Miller was in a relationship with Daniel Craig, her co-star in 2004 film Layer Cake . Co-stars: Ms Miller today admitted the pair were 'briefly involved' (the two pictured in film Layer Cake above) as she gave evidence to the Old Bailey . She said: 'The thing that's been . slightly misconstrued about this voicemail message is the fact that I . said ""I love you"" and that this was some incredibly important . declaration of love. I've always ended my phone calls to Daniel saying . ""I love you"".' Ms Miller gave evidence from New Orleans, and could be seen sitting next to an FBI agent as she was questioned. Former . News of the World reporter Dan Evans has previously told the court that . a story about Ms Miller and Mr Craig having an affair was partially . sourced from the voicemail message. Ms . Miller denied the message meant she was in a relationship with Mr Craig . but she did tell the court they were 'briefly involved'. 'Whether or not I was in a relationship with Daniel Craig, it was not a relationship, it was a very brief encounter, and he was my best friend,' she said. 'Me saying I love you, whether anything romantic happened briefly or not, there was nothing significant.' Friends: Jude Law, Mr Craig and Ms Miller walking together in north London in May 2004 .

Miller also confirmed she left messages on the phone of Kelly Hoppen, . her former stepmother, but denied she was weeping during the phone . calls. The court heard that Evans claimed to hear Ms Miller crying in a message to Ms Hoppen. Ms . Miller said: 'It's a difficult time to remember. It was very . emotionally raw. It is not possible for me to say whether or not with . any certainty. I think I was crying a lot at the time. 'But I do not think I would have been crying in a message to Kelly Hoppen, no.' When . asked about her relationship with the media by Timothy Langdale QC, for . former editor Andy Coulson, she said: 'It was part of my job to . communicate with the media and, yes, I had some negative experiences.'

All seven defendants deny all the charges against them. Trial: Former News of the World reporter Dan Evans, left, has given evidence about the newspaper's ex-editor Andy Coulson, right . On the stand: Evans give evidence under cross-examination from Timothy Langdale QC as Coulson looks on . The . Layer Cake star said she had pleaded with a News of the World . journalist to be kinder to Mr Law when they met at a pre-Baftas party, . asking him to 'give Jude a break'. She said: 'I spoke to him as a human being, making clear that this was an off-the-record conversation. Earlier the court heard that a source . connected to Mr Law had asked the News of the World to write that Ms . Miller had 'cheated first', adding that the actress was 'clingy' and a . bit of a 'stalker'. A News of the World journalist is alleged to have met with Mr Law’s publicist to discuss how the tabloid would report the affair. The PR asked the journalist to ‘back-date’ the affair so it would appear Miss Miller cheated on Law before he was caught out in a fling with his children’s nanny. They allegedly said the request came from Mr Law himself. According to a transcript of their taped conversation, she said: ‘If you could definitely pre-date it so that she cheated first, that’s the thing he wants the most.’ The Oscar-nominated actor was then said to have given his approval to a headline saying he had broken off their relationship over the affair. 'This . was a conversation between two human beings, not an actress and a . journalist. I appealed to his better nature and this was then abused. 'I probably said, ""He's one of the nicest, kindest people I know and you are misrepresenting him, please stop it.""' When . asked if she had ever courted publicity, she said: 'Absolutely never, . not once. Never ever. Hand on my heart, I've taken an oath.' Ms . Miller said she was not aware that anyone associated with her or her . then boyfriend Mr Law was communicating with the paper in 2005. There . was laughter in the court when Ms Miller was questioned by defence . lawyer Mr Langdale about her message to Mr Craig which ended 'I love . you'. She said: 'You just told me you love me and I interrupted you.' There . was also laughter as the actress struggled to remember the date of her . sister Savannah's wedding.

"Olympic hopeful: Julian Hughes-John, 31, has been jailed for 12 years for kidnap and grievous bodily harm . A ‘dangerous’ former Olympic hopeful has been jailed for 12 years after kidnapping and torturing a man for money. Disgraced Julian Hughes-John, 31, who represented Great Britain in its Bobsleigh team throughout Europe, was part of a trio who bundled their victim into a van whilst brandishing a shotgun and wearing balaclavas, before hammering a drill bit into his ankle. The gang were caught after a passing police car spotted the suspicious van parked in Selsey Road, Luton, Bedfordshire on March 24 last year and stopped to speak to the driver. The van pulled away, before stopping further down the road, where the three men fled. When they checked the vehicle, officers were shocked to find a 32-year-old man tied up inside. The culprits were later caught and arrested. Hughes-John, from Luton, was found guilty of kidnap and grievous bodily harm with . intent and yesterday sentenced to 12 years in prison with a public . protection order, meaning he will be on licence for a minimum of ten . years after he has completed his sentence, half of which must be served . in custody. The court . heard how, after being imprisoned ten years ago for his part in an armed . robbery, Hughes-John turned his life around through sport, being . selected to compete in the British bob-sleigh team across Europe. But . after the U.S refused him a visa to enter the country and compete, . because of his violent history, he turned back to a life of crime. Judge David Farrell QC told the defendants during sentencing yesterday (Thursday) that it was a calculated and ruthless attack which left a man fearing for his life. Write caption here . He said: 'This was a carefully planned and ruthlessly executed kidnapping. 'It . was a significantly serious and violent assault in which you . deliberately incapacitated the victim to prevent him escaping, perhaps . in order to tell you where the money was. 'It was only because of the timely . arrival of the police that this was bought to an end. The victim feared . what else might have happened to him, had they not passed by.” He added that the victim has suffered serious psychological effects since the 25-minute long attack. The court heard how the three had targeted their victim, believing he had access to substantial amounts of money. They . had even followed the victim’s girlfriend earlier in the day, before . waiting for him near to her house and pouncing on him as he got out of . his car. Hughes-John (not pictured) was once a member of the Great Britain bobsleigh team . Addressing Hughes-John, the judge added: 'After managing to rebuild your life, your willingness to return to crime at such a ruthless and serious level when things did not work out satisfies me that there is a strong risk to the public of serious harm. 'You are a person who is cool, calculated and can use your intelligence in a way that can and does present a real danger to the public. 'I am therefore imposing a public protection order on you.' Dean Raeside, aged 23, from Stephens Close, Luton, was found guilty of the same offences and was jailed for 12 years, and must serve a minimum of six years in prison. Dean Wright, aged 27, from Rivergate House, Luton, the driver of the van, pleaded guilty to kidnap and was convicted of GBH with intent. He was sentenced to 11 years, half of which will be served in custody. Both were spared public protection orders. A fourth man believed to be involved in the attack was not captured.","Julian Hughes-John was once part of Great Britain bobsleigh team .

"Scientists discovered that a special protein helps fight back cold sores - and that people who lack the protein are much more vulnerable . Scientists have put their finger on why some people are plagued by unsightly cold sores. They’ve shown that people who get cold sore after cold sore don’t make enough of a protein that keeps the virus under control. The insight could lead to new treatments for the potentially fatal complications of the extremely common bug. It has long been known that by adulthood, most people are infected with the cold sore-causing herpes simplex virus type 1 bug. However, while up to 90 per cent of adults have HSV-1 lurking in their system, only around a quarter of them will experience frequent outbreaks. Now, Edinburgh University scientists have discovered why. They began by looking at how cold sores – fluid-filled crusty blisters that occur around the mouth - occur. The HSV-1 bug is usually caught in childhood and often through a kiss from a family member or friend with a cold sore. It passes through the skin and travels up a nerve, where it lies inactive until stress, sunlight, illness or another trigger, awakens it and leads to cold sores forming. By analysing thousands of genes, the researchers found one that makes a protein called Interferon-lambda that helps keep the virus from being reactivated. They then compared the DNA of people who regularly got cold sores with that of people who had the virus but were rarely troubled by it. In those who often got cold sores, the gene for Interferon-lambda tended to be flawed, meaning they made less of the protein. This left their immune system unable to keep the bug under control and meant they were plagued by cold sores. Overall, around a quarter of Britons have the genetic flaw that makes them prone to cold sores, the journal PLoS Pathogens reports. Cold sores are caused by the HSV1 virus (pictured), which almost everyone carries. But most of the time our bodies can fight the illness off. Researcher Professor Juergen Haas said the finding shows the importance of studying the person that is infected, as well as the infection itself. 'Most people carry the cold sore strain of the herpes simplex virus but until now we never knew why only some of them develop cold sores. 'Knowing that susceptibility to the virus involved relates to people’s genes reinforces the need to research, not only the evolution of the viruses themselves, but the susceptibility of the hosts to infection.' The professor’s discovery could lead to Interferon-lamba being used as a treatment for HSV-1. The risk of side-effects means it is not likely to be used on cold sores, which despite looking unsightly usually clear up without treatment. However, it could be used to improve treatment of rare but potentially fatal side-effects of the virus, including infections and swelling of the brain. Professor Haas said: 'HSV-1 belongs to a family of viruses that persists in the body for life. Once you are infected, usually as a child, it persists in the nerve cells. You cannot really get rid of it. 'You can only avoid or treat the recurrences. It is a particularly nasty type of virus.'","Cold sores are caused by HSV1 virus - which almost everybody carries .

"A healthy lifestyle may do more than simply slow the ageing process.  It could actually reverse it. Keeping physically fit, having a plant-based diet and practising stress-reduction techniques such as yoga could extend the lifespan of cells, researchers say. They studied the effect of healthy living on lengths of DNA called telomeres – tiny ‘caps’ on the ends of chromosomes that protect against the ageing process. Just as the tips of shoelaces prevent fraying, telomeres keep chromosomes stable and prevent deterioration when the cells containing them divide. Secret to a longer life? Researchers found that subjects who ate a healthy diet and used stress reduction techniques such as yoga, stock image pictured, had longer telomeres (lengths of DNA which shorten as we age) than those who didn't . Dubbed the ‘chromosomal clock’, they shorten as we age. This process is associated with a greater risk of early death and of conditions such as heart disease, dementia, diabetes and cancers, as well as with increased vulnerability to infection. Scientists believe the shortening process may even place an unextendable limit on the human lifespan. The pilot study, published in The Lancet Oncology, compared two groups of men with early non-aggressive prostate cancer who had not undergone surgery or radiotherapy but were having regular checks. One group of 25 men continued without making any changes. Ten others underwent a radical lifestyle transformation supervised by doctors, nutritionists and psychologists. Their diet was switched to one high in plant proteins, fruits, vegetables and unrefined grains while  low in fat and processed carbohydrates. They were taught stress reduction techniques such as yoga and meditation, and were given counselling. They also took moderate levels of exercise, such as walking for 30 minutes, six days a week. After five years, blood tests showed that the telomeres of the healthy-lifestyle group had lengthened by an average of 10 per cent, effectively reversing the natural ageing process.  But the telomeres of the group who continued with their previous lifestyle shortened by an average of 3 per cent. The study found no significant difference between the groups in the progress of prostate cancer. But the scientists believe that their findings carry an important health message with wider implications. The team’s leader, Professor Dean Ornish, from the Preventive Medicine Research Institute at the University of California in San Francisco, said: ‘The implications of this relatively small pilot study may go beyond men with prostate cancer. ‘If validated by large-scale randomised controlled trials, these comprehensive lifestyle changes may significantly reduce the risk of a wide variety of diseases and premature mortality. Our genes, and our telomeres, are a predisposition, but they are not necessarily our fate.’ Dr Lynne Cox of the University of Oxford said: ‘This new study suggests that reducing stress, improving diet and increasing exercise not only prevent telomere loss but also lead to small but significant increases in telomere length. ‘It is perhaps too soon to judge whether this increase will correlate with increased longevity or healthspan. Overall, though, the findings of this paper support the calls for adoption of and adherence to healthier lifestyles.’","Researchers studied the effect of healthy living on lengths of DNA called telomeres which protect against the ageing process .

"Britain will be 'swamped' by tuberculosis unless new measures to diagnose the disease . A leading doctor has warned that Britain will be ‘swamped’ by tuberculosis unless new measures to diagnose the disease in immigrants are introduced. The disease, which was rife in Britain until the 1950s, is an increasing and worrying problem in urban areas. Rising immigration has seen a surge in cases in the last 20 years. Under current rules, new immigrants from countries where TB is common are required to have chest X-rays before being allowed into Britain. But doctors argue this century-old method only spots active TB once it is already destroying the lungs – meaning cases are often diagnosed far too late. Other countries such as the U.S. use a blood test, which can detect the latent TB in those not displaying any symptoms. Cases have fallen since this technique was introduced in 2007. At the British Thoracic Society conference this week, Peter Davies of the Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital, said urgent changes were needed to halt the decades-long rise in TB cases. He told The Times: ‘The tide has been coming in for 20 years, it’s been getting bigger and bigger and if we don’t do something we will be swamped with TB as we were 100 years ago.’ TB is caused by a bacterium that spreads through saliva. The disease used to be known as consumption because the bacterium ate holes in the lungs. From 50,000 cases a year in Britain in the 1950s, the rate fell to 5,000 in the 1980s. TB is a bacterial infection which is spread by inhaling drops of saliva when an infected person coughs, speaks or sneezes. The disease mainly affects the lungs, . but can travel to other parts of the body including the brain, kidneys, . bones and joints. The disease is curable with a six-month course of . antibiotics, but a drug-resistant form can develop if the course is not . completed. Left untreated it can prove fatal. Symptoms include a persistent cough that . lasts for more than three weeks that gets progressively worse, . unexplained weight loss, fever, night sweats, chest pain, fatigue and . loss of appetite. However, many people who are infected . never develop symptoms - although the bacteria remain in the body, they . are not infectious. Last year there were just over 9,000 cases of TB - a five per cent increase on the year before, according to figures from the Health Protection Agency. The main risk area is still London with 3,588 cases reported in 2011, accounting for 40 per cent of the UK total. And nearly three quarters of those suffering the disease were those not born in the UK. Professor Davies and his peers recommend that people from the Indian subcontinent and sub-Saharan Africa, where rates are highest, should be given the blood test when registering with a GP. Those found to have latent TB can easily eliminate it with a course of antibiotics. Speaking about the blood test, he said:  ‘It’s a no-brainer. If we screen for latent TB we would eliminate the majority of cases of people coming into this country. Now we’ve got the blood tests, for goodness’ sake let’s use them.’ He added that with TB claiming up to 500 deaths a year, the numbers were as many as HIV. The homeless and drug addicts should also be screened because new infections have become more common among these groups, he continued. Mike Mandlebaum, chief executive of the charity TB Alert, said: ‘The truth is that TB never really went away in the UK and has been steadily rising here, from around 5,000 cases a year at the end of the Eighties to 8,500 in 2007/8. ‘TB is a disease usually associated with certain high-risk groups such as those with HIV, those from Eastern bloc countries and Asia, and those living in crowded living conditions. But anyone can get it.' Onn Min Kon, a consultant at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, London, said that rates of the disease are continuing to rise and that the UK has the highest rates in Europe. Last year there were just over 9,000 cases of TB - a five per cent increase on the year before, according to figures from the Health Protection Agency . Echoing the sentiments of Mr Mandlebaum, he said even low risk people are susceptible if the disease is out of control, it being possible to become infected by being in the same room as someone with TB. He added that  people should not become careless about the risks because they didn’t fit the traditional demographic of someone who gets the disease. His research has found that a fifth of immigrants to Britain from high-risk areas had latent TB – but the current guidelines for screening men around 75 per cent of these cases will be missed, so the real figure may be substantially higher. The Department of Health said that in line with NICE guidance, the NHS currently uses both chest X-ray screening and blood-testing to check for TB, with the evidence for new technologies kept under review.’","9,000 cases of tuberculosis in the UK last year - up 5% on the year before .

"Ebola patient Ashoka Mukpo took to Twitter today to say he felt he was on the road to good health . The health of Ebola patient Ashoka Mukpo appears to be improving after he returned to Twitter today to thank well-wishers for their 'good vibes'. Mr Mukpo, 33, is being treated in a specialized quarantine unit at Nebraska Medical Center and last week received blood from Ebola survivor, Dr Kent Brantly, in his fight against the deadly virus. The patient posted on Twitter on Monday afternoon: 'Back on twitter, feeling like I'm on the road to good health. Will be posting some thoughts this week. Endless gratitude for the good vibes.' Although Mr Mukpo had good news to reveal about his health, it emerged on a fundraising site this weekend that the 33-year-old is facing half a million dollars in medical bills. On a Gofundme page for Mr Mukpo, the message read: 'We are reaching out to help cover the enormous projected cost of Ashoka’s medical care, and to allow for his family to aid in, and properly support him during his recovery. 'It is anticipated at this time that Ashoka's medical expenses and family support will exceed $500,000.' So far, the funds raised stood at just less than $48,000. Scroll down for video . Ebola patient Ashoka Mukpo returned to Twitter on Monday to thank those who had supported him . Mr Mukpo was flown out of Liberia on a special medical flight with a quarantine unit and has received round-the-clock care at Nebraska Medical Center . A fundraising page was set up for Mr Mukpo this weekend which revealed he is facing half a million dollars in medical expenses over his Ebola treatment . Mr Mukpo was working as a freelance cameraman for NBC News in Liberia earlier this month when he contracted Ebola. He was flown back to the U.S. on October 6 and has been treated at the infectious disease facility in Omaha. His round-the-clock care and benefit from experimental treatment seem to have helped Mr Mukpo on the road to recovery - but he noted today the benefits of the pioneering treatment he had compared to what he had seen in Africa. He tweeted: 'Now that I've had first hand exp with this scourge of a disease, I'm even more pained at how little care sick west Africans are receiving.' He added: 'Be on the lookout for the Ebola Diaries blog coming soon. Will compile material from long-term reporter residents of Liberia.' Mr Mukpo's condition worsened at Nebraska Medical Center last week, so doctors decided to try a previous technique of giving the patient a blood transfusion from an Ebola survivor. His immune system appeared to have benefited from the blood donation from Dr Brantly. The doctor, who beat Ebola after being flown back from Liberia to the U.S. in July,  raced to the nearest clinic in Kansas City, Missouri, while on a road trip last week to donate. Mr Mukpo is stretchered from the plane last Monday after arriving from Liberia  to be treated for Ebola at Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha . Mr Mukpo's fiancée, Helen Finlay, said last week that it was heart-wrenching to watch her boyfriend on four years battle the deadly virus and be unable to get close to him . Dr Kent Brantly was also flown back from Liberia to the U.S. after contracting Ebola during his missionary work for Samaritan's Purse. He survived after receiving a dose of the experimental serum Z-Mapp and round-the-clock care at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. Those who have survived Ebola have antibodies in their blood which can help new sufferers beat the disease. Dr Brantly had earlier donated blood to a fellow doctor, Dr Rick Sacra, who also contracted Ebola during his work in West Africa and survived the disease. Mr Mukpo's father, Dr Mitchell Levy, told NBC that the family were deeply touched by Dr Brantly's selfless actions. Dr Levy told the network: 'This act of kindness and generosity makes me believe in the goodness of humanity.' Mr Mukpo also received the experimental drug Brincidofovir, which has shown promise in fighting the virus. The drug, developed by North Carolina-based Chimerix, is approved for the treatment of the herpes virus. It has never before been used on Ebola patients. Dallas nurse Nina Pham, 26, is fighting for her life against Ebola after contracting the virus from the patient she treated, Thomas Eric Duncan . The fiancée of Mr Mukpo described last week the torment of watching him battle the deadly virus - but be unable to get close to comfort him. British-born Helen Finlay described the experience as 'heart-wrenching', adding: 'I mean when you have a loved one who is as sick as he is, you want to curl up next to them and tell them you're going to be okay and be close to them and obviously you can't do that. It is a little bit hard.' Mr Mukpo's improving health came after a nurse, who treated Ebola 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan, was confirmed as having the virus this weekend. Nina Pham, 26, from Fort Worth, Texas, was one of the team of medical staff who treated Mr Duncan at the Dallas Presbyterian Hospital before he died from the dreaded virus last week. She is now being treated in isolation at the Dallas hospital and is in a stable condition, CDC Director Tom Frieden said on Monday. Mr Duncan, a Liberian national, passed away from the disease last Wednesday morning. Mr Duncan, the first ever Ebola case diagnosed in the U.S., had also been receiving Brincidofovir. Parents of Ashoka Mukpo, Lady Diana Mukpo and Dr Mitchell Levy, said last week that they were relieved to have their son back in the U.S. to be treated for Ebola . Thomas Duncan passed away last Wednesday morning after contracting Ebola in September. He was receiving the experimental drug Brincidofovir .","Ashoka Mukpo, 33, is being treated in a specialized quarantine unit at Nebraska Medical Center .

"A nine-year-old boy has given his little brother a life-saving Christmas present by offering him a bone marrow transplant. Kiran Merrick donated bone marrow to save his five-year-old brother, Sam, who has chronic lung disease and a rare immune deficiency. The boys’ parents, Louise, 32, and Paul, 38, of Waterlooville, Hampshire, have been told there is an 80 per cent chance the transplant will cure their youngest son. Sam Merrick (pictured), five, has been given a life-saving bone marrow transplant thanks to his brother, Kiran, nine, who agreed to donate his bone marrow for the procedure . Mother-of-four, Mrs Merrick said: ‘We were all tested but Kiran was the one who had a 10 out of 10 match, which is the best match there could be. ‘Kiran told us he was scared so we talked to him in depth about it and said that if he didn't want to do it we would understand. ‘But he said he wanted to help Sam and started having numerous tests. ‘It was hard work with Sam and Kiran both in hospital but Kiran has done us both proud. ‘When Sam is ill now he always offers to give him more bone marrow to help his brother. ‘Sam's disease has meant he's caught more than the usual amount of childhood viruses and infections, with the severity much worse. Sam (front right) was born prematurely at just 26 weeks. He has a weak immune system and has had so many viruses that his lungs are full of scar tissue. He is pictured with his brothers Kiran (back right), Liam, 7, (front left) and Jordan, 13, (back left) Sam had such a weak immune system he had to be protected from germs as much as possible. He is pictured having treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital - he spent six hours a day, for ten days, in this plastic tent . ‘But Sam has defied all the odds in so many ways and has many more good days now. ‘All the boys adore him and love spending quality time with him.’ Sam, who also has two other brothers, Liam and Jordan, was born prematurely at just 26 weeks. He has a weak immune system and his mother says he has suffered from so many viruses that his lungs are full of scar tissue meaning he has lung disease. Before the bone marrow transplant, he had to have 60 per cent of his right lung removed and was very isolated due to his illness. Since the bone marrow transplant, Sam has become strong enough to be able to catch up on many of the childhood experiences he had missed out on. He visited Father Christmas, been swimming and started school . Sam (pictured shortly after his birth) is thought to have an 80 per cent chance of being cured by the transplant . He had to have a rain coat over his buggy when he went out in case he breathed in germs. Now, he is able to go to the shops, attend school and play with friends. Mrs Merrick, who is Sam's full-time carer, said: ‘Sam fights infections a lot better and we are noticing a huge difference in him. ‘We hope this will be his first Christmas at home and not in hospital. Mrs Merrick,  Sam's mother, said: 'Sam fights infections a lot better and we are noticing a huge difference in him. We hope this will be his first Christmas at home and not in hospital' Sam's family is raising money to buy a caravan to allow other families with sick children to go on holiday . ‘This year we reached numerous milestones such as being able to take him to a Santa's grotto and although he went really quiet in front of Santa he was chuffed to bits to receive a book. ‘He has also just started school full time and has been swimming for the first time. ‘This is a huge step in the progress Sam is making and a huge part of childhood memories that he has been missing out on.’ The family are now hoping to raise £30,000 to buy a caravan in Pagham, West Sussex, to provide much needed breaks for other families with sick children.

"Saving money: Stephen Crabb told shocked mandarins he was getting rid of the car . Cabinet new boy Stephen Crabb’s first act as Welsh Secretary was to scrap his £100,000-a-year, taxpayer-funded Jaguar limousine. Minutes after arriving at his new Whitehall department, he told shocked mandarins to get rid of the car to save money. Instead, Mr Crabb, 41, pictured right, plans to use public transport to get to work, and one of the Government’s pool of eco-friendly Toyota Prius cars when necessary. His predecessor as Welsh Secretary, David Jones, who was fired last week, was accused last year of abusing his chauffeur-driven Jaguar, which costs £8,000 a month. Jones was branded ‘lazy’ and ‘shameful’ after he used the luxury car to travel 100m from his office to Downing Street and then back again. He took the short trip to a Cabinet meeting in his ministerial car even though it would have taken just a few minutes to walk. His chauffeur stayed outside No 10 for 90 minutes and then drove him back to his office. Government ‘pool cars’ cost a more modest £10,000 a year. A source said: ‘Stephen wants to show that he believes in saving public money where possible. ‘He has always travelled by bus and train and sees no reason to change everything.’ Scroll down for video .

"Behind the badge: Jason Harrington worked as a TSA agent from 2007 to 2013 and is now a writer . A former TSA officer has confirmed many of the worst suspicions about airport security screeners: they stop passengers for having an attitude, they confiscate snow globes from children and nail clippers from pilots, they profile passengers based on their nationality. And yes, they do see travelers naked in the X-ray photos. In a confessional piece for Politico, former TSA agent-turned-writer Jason Harrington spills the secrets on the ways that the security workers pass the time during their long shifts. ‘I confiscated jars of homemade apple butter on the pretense that they could pose threats to national security. I was even required to confiscate nail clippers from airline pilots—the implied logic being that pilots could use the nail clippers to hijack the very planes they were flying,’ he wrote. One of the most coveted rotations while he worked at Chicago’s O’Hare airport while Harrington worked there from 2007 through 2013 was the secretive Image Operator room where guards took turns sitting in the windowless room- that also lacked security cameras- viewing the pictures of passengers that the x-ray machines took. ‘Many of the images we gawked at were of overweight people, their every fold and dimple on full awful display. Piercings of every kind were visible. Women who’d had mastectomies were easy to discern—their chests showed up on our screens as dull, pixelated regions. Hernias appeared as bulging, blistery growths in the crotch area,’ he wrote in the Politico article. ‘All the old, crass stereotypes about race and genitalia size thrived on our secure government radio channels.’ The I.O. room turned into its own experiment in explicit behavior as agents would use it as a secret meeting point for mid0-work rendez-vous since the lack of security cameras kept them from being busted. The TSA issued a statement in response to MailOnline, saying: 'Many of the TSA procedures and policies referenced in this article are no longer in place or are characterized inaccurately.' Too close for comfort: TSA agents laughed at passengers, including every 'fold and dimple' that was noted by the scanners when an overweight passenger walked through the $150,000 machines . Extra bonus: Passengers may not enjoy their last minute purchases, but the TSA agents sure do . Explicit: He said that the agents were judgmental and observed 'crass' racial and gender stereotypes . 'Every passenger deserves to be . treated with dignity and respect and Transportation Security . Administration policy upholds this standard. TSA does not tolerate any . form of unethical or unlawful behavior by its employees and takes swift . disciplinary action if discovered. 'Since . November 2011, TSA has aggressively implemented risk-based security . procedures to move away from a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach. 'TSA . has installed Automated Target Recognition software on every Advanced . Imaging Technology (AIT) unit in use, eliminating the analyzed images . referenced in the article. It . concluded by reporting that the agency 'has instituted one-step removal . procedures in many cases for employees behaving unethically or . unlawfully'. Harrington, who went on to take a graduate course in creative writing after leaving the TSA, even translated the underhanded code-words used by the agents to alert their friends to an attractive passenger approaching the line. Fanny Pack Lane 2 and Alfalfa are both used to give a heads-up about an attractive woman headed towards the agents. Code Red and Code Yellow are also used in the same way- depending on the color of her shirt. While the overly-detailed pictures provided entertainment for the screeners, Harrington writes that the expensive machines did little else. Even when a representative from the machine manufacturer came to give the TSA agents a tutorial on the $150,000 machines, he admitted that they barely worked. Waste: Harrington tells how anything can get past the X-ray machines and agents regularly got back at annoying passengers by having them go through extra checks . ‘He said we wouldn’t be able to . distinguish plastic explosives from body fat and that guns were . practically invisible if they were turned sideways in a pocket,’ Harrington wrote. A number . of agents became concerned about the amount of secondary radiation they . were being put through by working next to the machines day-in and . day-out, even though they regularly towed the party line that it was . safe when passengers asked them the same question. While . he expressed empathy for alarmed pregnant women who were told to go . through the machine anyway, there were also lighter moments that came as . a result. One of his code words listed on the blog that he started to vent about life behind the TSA shield, called Taking Sense Away, was the ‘baby-shower-opt-out’: when a woman opts out and explains that she is pregnant to the surprise of the friends she is traveling with, who shriek and yell and have an impromptu celebration. The more serious allegations that came through in his piece came to his description of the not-so-random security checks of ‘suspicious’ passengers. A number of boarding passes have a code- SSSS- printed on them based on the passenger’s name, indicating that they are on a watch list or have been flagged up for whatever reason. Beyond that, a passenger’s nationality could also automatically prove reason for an extra-thorough check and each TSA agent is given a list of a dozen countries that they should memorize (or pin to the back of their shield badge for safe keeping): Syria, Algeria, Afghanistan, Cuba,  Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan. All a farce? Agents regularly make fun of their colleagues who 'thought their job was a matter of national security', and called them 'white shirts' in return . Conspicuously absent from that list? Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, two countries with a history of harboring terrorists. Harrington explained that the slip was not accidental but political. Political posturing and possible security threats were not the only reasons that you could be selected for an extra search, however, as he also explained that ‘retaliatory wait time’ was a common practice, as agents regularly made the process more difficult when they simply didn’t like your attitude. ‘Pretending that something in your bag or on your full body image needs to be resolved- the punitive possibilities are endless, and there are many tricks in the screener’s bag,’ he wrote. Harrington began voicing his concerns about TSA practices well into his time there, first writing a letter that was published in The New York Times in 2010. His supervisor had ‘a chat’ with him about it, but didn’t fire him, and so he continued to write about his complaints but this time on an anonymous blog. That blog, Taking Sense Away, eventually went viral and his fear of being caught and desire to leave a job that he never intended to be long-term led to his decision to leave and go to graduate school in 2013. He is now working on a book about his time in uniform.","Former TSA agent Jason Harrington blasts the 'useless' X-ray scanners- but said that the agents enjoyed laughing at passengers' looks # .

"Gareth Southgate has insisted players such as Luke Shaw and Calum Chambers should not view coming back into the England Under 21 fold following senior honours as a ‘punishment’. The two full-backs, who moved from Southampton to Manchester United and Arsenal for a combined £46million, have both been named in Southgate’s squad for their Euro 2015 play-off against Croatia. Shaw was part of Roy Hodgson’s squad for the World Cup while Chambers earned his first England cap in last month’s friendly against Norway. Luke Shaw, in action for Manchester United, has been called up to play for the England U21s . Calum Chambers lined up for Arsenal in their 4-1 Champions League victory over Galatasaray on Wednesday . Luke Shaw has three previous caps for the England Under 21s, but has pulled out of the squad on four occasions. But Southagte, who also named Saido Berahino, Harry Kane and Eric Dier in his squad, said there should be more movement between youth groups and the senior team to aid players’ development. ‘It shouldn’t be seen as players coming back down, like that’s some sort of punishment,’ Southgate said. ‘It should be seen as part of their development. ‘We’ve got to make that movement between squads more fluid. Because we haven’t done it so often in past it’s viewed slightly negatively at times. ‘We feel it is the right thing to do. It's a positive message, to show they are prepared to come and join in with the rest of the group is important. Gareth Southgate has also named West Brom forward Saido Berahino in his 23-man squad . ‘Roy and myself work very closely every time there's a squad announced and clearly Luke and Calum have been around the senior squad already. ‘The fact it's a play-off game Roy was keen that those who he didn't think would start for him were with us. That's the joined-up thinking we're trying to put in place. ‘The boys have to come and have the desire to come and do that. They understand the situation because getting to the finals is important.’ The first match in the play-off takes place on October 10 at Molineux, with the return leg in Vinkovci four days later.

The oil-rich Gulf state is ploughing billions of pounds into hosting the 2022 World Cup, whilst only recently it was awarded the 2019 World Athletics Championships.

"The troubled development of the Circuit of Wales now faces a public inquiry in March, throwing into doubt next year's staging of the British round of MotoGP. Work should have commenced on the £315million motorsports venue on the outskirts of Ebbw Vale in February last year. However, the organisation behind the project, the Heads of the Valleys Development Company (HVDC), have encountered a number of planning permission hurdles. Circuit of Wales chiefs were forced to hand the staging of this season's British event to Donington Park . Despite signing a five-year agreement in August last year to host MotoGP, CoW bosses were quickly forced to hand over the staging of this season's event to Donington Park. HVDC then sought permission to de-register 600 acres of common land at Rassau, Blaenau Gwent, the site for the proposed circuit. Despite belief that would swiftly be granted and work would finally start in December or January, only now has the decision been taken to hold an inquiry, due to commence on March 10 for eight days. The inquiry has the support of the CoW, with chief executive Michael Carrick stating: 'The planning process is a lengthy one and we will continue to work with the planning body to ensure on-site works start as soon as possible in 2015. Last season's champion Marc Marquez of Repsol Honda Team celebrates on the podium in Germany . 'We are still aiming to have phase one site-wide and circuit infrastructure ready to host MotoGP when completed. 'This is a hugely important development, not just for the regeneration of Blaenau Gwent, but also for the UK economy. 'It's critical we ensure every detail is considered in the planning process before construction works can commence.' Following the inquiry, and even if permission is eventually granted, HVDC could yet face a judicial review, which would push development back further. Any additional delays would then impact on CoW's hopes of hosting MotoGP next year.","The development of the Circuit of Wales has hit further problems .

"Donington Park has been forced to cancel this year's British round of MotoGP due to the failure of Circuit of Wales (CoW) bosses to fulfil funding obligations. Last year MotoGP rights holders Dorna signed a five-year agreement with CoW from 2015, despite the fact construction work had yet to commence on the troubled Ebbw Vale facility. It resulted in CoW turning to Donington Park chiefs for assistance for this year, believing they would then be able to take up the running of the event. The British Grand Prix in the MotoGP championship is in turmoil after Donington Park pulled out of hosting the 2015 race. Above is the start of the 2014 Grand Prix which took place at Silverstone . CoW, however, continues to face numerous planning hurdles which have clearly had a knock-on effect with regard to the distribution of funds, resulting in delays paying Donington Park. A statement from Donington Park Racing Ltd (DPRL) read: 'The situation at 10th February 2015 is very clear. 'Despite DPRL's best efforts, the time lost with CoW being unable to complete the funding arrangements has resulted in delays in almost all of the event's critically-important operational plans, from track works to equipment hire. 'Therefore, in the judgement of the board of DPRL, this current position could jeopardise the safe and successful running of the 2015 British MotoGP at Donington to such an extent that both the commercial risks and the lack of time are now too great to allow Donington to proceed. 'Therefore, Donington Park must withdraw from any further participation. Donington Park had previously held the British Grand Prix from 1987 through to 2009, with Australia's Casey Stoner (above) winning on a Ducati in 2008 . 'Consequently, the 2015 British round of the FIM MotoGP World Championship will not now be held at Donington Park on August 30th 2015.' Christopher Tate, Donington Park managing director, has naturally expressed his bitter disappointment at the fact the race will not now take place at his circuit. 'The whole Donington team who have worked so hard here over the past six months to fulfil our part of the MotoGP planning are as disappointed as the many fans will be who wanted to see the event return to Donington Park,' said Tate. 'The position we are now in is, of course, frustrating and uncomfortable for all concerned. 'We have our overall business, our staff and their futures to consider, as well as our concerns for the fans. 'We have rebuilt so much of this facility and its global reputation in the years since 2010 under new ownership and management. The British round of the 2015 MotoGP season is now without a venue, with Silverstone one alternative . 'We are not going to risk all that, nor risk affecting the quality of the MotoGP fans' experience - looking after the fans is at the heart of what Donington does. 'It is this week, way past any normal deadlines, when we - in partnership with CoW - would have been committing to major expenditures. 'CoW have made it clear to us they are not now in a position to complete, so we have to withdraw and end the planned arrangement.' Donington has confirmed all fans who purchased tickets will be given a full refund due to their monies being held in an escrow account. It now remains to be seen whether CoW will turn to Silverstone, who held the event from 2010-2014, but like Donington they will require financial guarantees, and time may also be too short.","Donington Park was in agreement with Circuit of Wales (Cow) to host event .

"A husband and wife married 67 years died only hours apart this week. Arthur Orvis Beard, 93, died Sunday of a stroke at his Nederland, Texas, retirement home. Wife Oneida Beard, 95, passed away the next day. The pair met in 1945 shortly after he returned from fighting in World War II, brother John Beard told the Beaumont Enterprise. They married the next year. Til death do they part: Arthur Orvis Beard and Oneida Beard died within hours of each other after being married 67 years . ‘It's almost like they were waiting for each other to die,’ said John Beard. ‘They couldn't live without each other.’ The childless couple lived together and then died together. ‘They were fine people,’ the 85-year-old brother added. ‘They were just good people with many friends.’ Relatives spoke glowingly in comments left online about their lives. ‘When we would visit their home in Nederland, there was always a big evening dinner in the dining room with the best iced tea in the world,’ a woman identified only as Leslie wrote on Arthur Beard’s obituary. Together into their 90s: Arthur Orvis Beard was 93 when he passed and Oneida Beard was 95 . ‘I remember the smell of his workshop where he loved to make grandmother and grandfather clocks,’ Leslie continued. ‘He made one for each of us kids when we grew up. ‘They lived life the way it should be lived’ Others spoke fondly of time spent fishing with the uncle they referred lovingly to by his middle name Orvis. Another said the couple ‘were my heroes during my teen years.’ They were buried Wednesday after a joint funeral, of course. Over 100 people attended, according to the paper. The Reverend who presided over the service said ‘it’s most natural to talk about them together. ‘When two people marry, they become one.’","Arthur Orvis Beard, 93, died Sunday of a stroke .

"You heard it here first: big pockets are going to be, well, big, next season. And it's all thanks to Apple.

"Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has sent out a clear message of support to Gareth Bale and told supporters to expect him back in the team for the visit of Liverpool in a week's time. Bale has missed Real's last two games and with the side giving their best performances of the season so far without him, there have been calls for Ancelotti to stick with a midfield quartet of Isco, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and James Rodriguez. But the Real boss said: 'People seem to have forgotten who it was that scored the winning goal in the Spanish Cup final last season and who it was who scored in the Champions League final. Gareth Bale, Real Madrid's £86million signing, should be fit to play against Liverpool, admits Carlo Ancelotti . Bale is expected to be fit for when Liverpool play Real Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday night . Ancelotti on Bale's fitness ahead of the showdown: 'If not for Saturday then for the game against Liverpool' 'He (Bale) is recuperating well and we will see how he is at the weekend, and if not for Saturday then for the game against Liverpool.' Isco is a fans' favourite but spent most of last season watching from the bench as Bale's second half of the season made him one of Real's most important players. Ancelotti said last week that when the £86million man is fit then he will be in the side. That upset some supporters still on a high after Real demolished Liverpool and Barcelona in the space of five days with Isco at the heart of two stunning team performances.

"Under threat: An undated photo of businessman Neil Heywood who was murdered in November last year . A bodyguard who protected Neil Haywood during his affair with his alleged murderer Gu Kailai has spoken of how he fought off three Chinese assassins in an attempt on the old Harrovian’s life. Michael Wright and his team were protecting the couple during the time they shared a flat in Bournemouth and revealed that the exposure of the affair led to a serious threat to Neil Heywood's life when three men tried to break into their home. His interview comes the days after . Gu Kailai appeared in court in China accused of killing Neil Heywood after he made a threatening . demand for £13million from her playboy son. Mr Wright said the team were surprised . by three Chinese henchmen under orders to kill Mr Heywood after a spy, . posing as a cook, has exposed the affair in 2001. He said the three men attempted to break into the flat using martial arts. ‘They didn’t speak any English but . they wanted to get upstairs to the flat where Neil and Mrs Gu was . hiding,’ Mr Wright told The Mirror. ‘They were under orders to kill . someone and it was my job to stop them. I was confronted by one of the . guys at the front and wrestled him to the ground to restrain him.’ ‘It was brutal. Those guys wanted . blood. Eventually we got the better of them and they didn’t want the . British police turning up so they jumped in a car and sped off.’ The attempt on his life terrified Neil Heywood and Mrs Gu was ‘shaking like a leaf’. Mr Wright also revealed that despite the . attempt on his life Mr Haywood and Mrs Gu became increasingly relaxed . about their affair and would enjoy romantic dates at local restaurants calling . themselves Neil and Gu Horus for protection. Mr Wright described Neil Heywood as a . nervous ‘old English colonial’ in linen suits who would chain-smoke at . least three packs a day. Gu Kailai has admitted to Chinese police in a pre-trial interview that she lured her former lover to a hotel room where she got him drunk and then laced his drink with cyanide. Facing trial: Gu Kailai, 52, and aide Zhang Xiaojun, 33, are escorted into the Hefei City People's Court . No contest: Gu and Zhang did not raise any objections that on November 13, 2011, they went to Heywood's hotel room and, after getting him drunk, administered a fatal poison . The . alleged motive behind 41-year-old Mr Heywood’s grisly death was . revealed at the murder trial of Mrs Gu, dubbed the Jackie Kennedy of China. Her lawyer even argued that affable Mr Heywood, a father of two young . children, ‘should bear some responsibility’ for his own murder. Mrs Gu appeared in court on Wednesday alongside her co-accused – family . bodyguard Zhang Xiajun, 33, who is alleged to have prepared the poison – . where they both entered pleas but they did not contest the murder charge against them. The court heard the Jaguar-driving . Englishman had fallen into an ‘economic dispute’ with Mrs Gu’s party-loving . son Bo Guagua, 24, whom Mr Heywood had once mentored to secure a place . at his alma mater, Harrow School. Mr Bo, known for a love of champagne . and shisha parties while studying at Oxford University, was allegedly . told by Mr Heywood: ‘If you do not give me £13million, you will be . destroyed,’ the judges heard, according to a reliable source who was in . the courtroom. Political scandal: Gu Zailai, left, with her husband - former Chongqing Municipality Communist Party Secretary Bo Xilai. The murder case is one of China's biggest political scandals . These threats, in an email or letter, were said to have been forwarded by Bo to his mother. International media were banned from . the highly-politicised trial, which concluded in less than seven hours . in the Intermediate People’s Court in the eastern Chinese city of Hefei. The source added that the court heard it was not the first . assassination plot on Mr Heywood, with Mrs Gu having previously conspired to . kill him with a local police chief. Implicated: The official allegation against Gu suggests Heywood might have been making threats against her son Bo Guagua, 24 . The court’s deputy director Tang Yigan . announced: ‘Gu Kailai believed that Neil Heywood had threatened the . personal safety  of her son Bo and decided to kill him.’ Gu summoned him to Chongqing, the . mega-city in southwestern China where her husband was Communist Party . Secretary, on November 13 last year. They drank tea and wine together in . room 1605 of the ‘Lucky Holiday Hotel’, before Mr Heywood became drunk . and was sick. After he had vomited, Gu, 53, helped . him drink a glass of water – which she had mixed with a lethal draft of . potassium cyanide. A . student who was allowed to witness the case said Gu had appeared . ‘calm’, despite the possibility she could be sentenced to death. ‘There . were no tears. Both looked quite calm, peaceful. Both said they accepted . the court’s authority,’ said the student. Mr Tang said prosecutors . believed the facts of the ‘brutal’ crime were clear and backed by ‘ample . evidence’, and that ‘Gu Kailai is the main culprit and Zhang is the . accomplice’. Gu had reportedly made a full . confession to police, which it was in her interests to do because it . will act in her favour during sentencing deliberations. The judges . reserved their verdict to an unspecified date within the next 30 days . She will almost certainly be found . guilty, but could be spared the executioner’s bullet because of her . defence that she was only trying to protect her son. In a bid to further . lighten her sentence, Gu was said to have made accusations about ‘other . people’s crimes’, although no details were given.","Michael Wright protected Bournemouth flat where the murdered businessman lived with Gu Kailai .

"A South African preacher who made his congregation eat grass to make them 'closer to God' before using them as a human carpet has now got them drinking petrol. Pastor Lesego Daniel of the Rabboni Centre Ministry poured some of the liquid into a bucket before dropping a match into it and setting it alight to prove that it really was petrol. Unveiling his latest 'miracle' to the congregation, he then told them that the petrol had been turned into pineapple juice and persuaded people to line up to take a sip from a bottle of the liquid.

A video showing his congregation in the town of Garankuwa, near Pretoria in northern South Africa's Gauteng Province, drinking the yellow liquid warns: 'If you cannot turn water into wine, don't try this'. Pastor Daniel tells his congregation: 'I want to prove to you, with the flames that will burn here, that it shows what can be achieved if you have faith.' He adds: 'What you see, you have to believe it.' He then drinks some of the liquid himself. GP Dr Arun Ghosh underlined the dangers of drinking petrol. He told MailOnline: 'It's highly toxic and can give you serious gastric erosion. It will lead to severe stomach problems.' Demonstration: A member of the congregation lights the petrol to show that it's real . Pastor Daniel tells his congregation 'I want to prove to you, with the flames that will burn here, that it shows what can be achieved if you have faith' The controversial preacher made international headlines in January when he was photographed persuading followers to eat the grass at his ministry. He said that humans with faith eat anything to feed their bodies and can survive on whatever they choose to eat, and persuading them to eat grass and drink petrol was simply a way of proving the point. One woman claimed eating grass stopped her having a sore throat, while another said it healed her after a stroke. Interviewed by local media one of the congregation, Rosemary Phetha, said: 'Yes, we eat grass and we're proud of it because it demonstrates that, with God's power, we can do anything.' The controversial preacher made international headlines in January when he was photographed persuading followers to eat the grass at his ministry . One woman claimed eating grass stopped her having a sore throat, while another said it healed her after a stroke . Another, Doreen Kgatle, 27, from Garankuwa, suffered a stroke two years ago. She said: 'I could not walk but soon after eating the grass, as the pastor had ordered, I started gaining strength and an hour later I could walk again.' Photos showed that followers who had eaten grass then allowed Pastor Daniel to walk across them as they spread out on the floor. The grass eating, however, failed to impress many with one outraged commentator saying: 'Is this a scene in a movie? This can't be real. God created animals to chew grass and made human beings to dominate over animals. Any person who reduces human beings to animals is definitely not of God.' And another person wrote online: 'Why is he stepping on people? This is inhumane. Shocking.'","Pastor Lesego Daniel made news after telling his congregation to eat grass .

"The Duchess of Cambridge may already be pregnant with her second child and plans to add another baby to the royal brood but one controversial feminist has slammed her decision, saying she's 'too thin' and should stop. Germaine Greer, who penned best-selling book The Female Eunuch in 1970, said that the former Kate Middleton, who gave birth to Prince George last July, is 'too thin' and shouldn't have any more children. Speaking to British-based magazine Newsweek Europe about Kate’s chronic morning sickness, hyperemesis gravidarum, the 75-year-old Australian said: 'The girl is too thin! [Kate] is vomiting her guts up and shouldn’t have been made to go through all this again so soon. 'It’s not so much that she has to be a womb, but she has to be a mother. I would hope after this one she says, ""That’s it. No more"".' Scroll down for video . Hitting out: Controversial feminist Germaine Greer, right, has launched an extradorinary attack on the royal family and said that the Duchess of Cambridge, left, is 'too thin' and shouldn't have any more children . Hyperemesis gravidarum is brutal. Affecting only two per cent of pregnant women, the sickness is so severe that sufferers end up dehydrated and weak. This often results in hospital admission - as it did when Kate was carrying her first child - for intravenous fluids and heavy-duty anti-sickness drugs. If that wasn't enough, Greer added that 32-year-old Kate had a 'b*****d of a job' because she had been 'put in charge of William'. She believes that Kate's interests have been limited by the royal family, which she dismisses as a 'mad anachronism', and argues that Kate has had to learn exactly how to behave, adding that spontaneity will get her in trouble. She also states that Kate, who graduated from St Andrews University with a 2.1 honours degree in art history in 2005, is a great deal more intelligent than the rest of the royals yet is 'made to appear absolutely anodyne'. Germaine, a theorist, academic and journalist,  is widely regarded as one of the mid-twentieth century's most controversial feminist voices. She has penned numerous tomes, including Sex and Destiny: The Politics of Human Fertility (1984); The Change: Women, Ageing and the Menopause (1991) and The Whole Woman (1999). Time to stop? Speaking about Kate, who is mother to one-year-old George and is already pregnant with baby number two, Greer said: '[Kate] is vomiting her guts up and shouldn't have been made to go through all this again so soon. It's not so much that she has to be a womb, but she has to be a mother. I would hope after this one she says, ""That's it. No more"".' She once defined her goal as 'women's liberation' as distinct from ""equality with men' and aims to promote the freedom of women to define their own values and determine their own fate. Mouthpiece: Germaine, a theorist, academic and journalist, is widely regarded as one of the mid-twentieth century's most controversial feminist voices . Childless Greer left home in her youth due to conflict with her family. She tied the knot to  Welsh carpenter Paul du Feu in London in 1968 - but the marriage only lasted three-and-a-half weeks. Republican Greer actually met the Queen - and famously curtseyed - during a visit to Buckingham Palace in 2006. The Queen was hosting a reception for Australians ahead of her royal tour, when she opened the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. Last weekend, the Duchess was forced to pull out of a tour of Malta on behalf of the Queen, leaving Prince William to stand in for her. Kate was also due to join William at an engagement in Oxford three weeks ago but was too ill - and it was her absence that prompted the Palace to announce her pregnancy prematurely. However, according to Royal aides, the Duchess is planning to resume official engagements next month, with a spokesman telling The Mail on Sunday: ‘There will be engagements in October and November. We just haven’t announced them yet.’ The Duchess has been suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum – the condition she suffered during her pregnancy with Prince George. Although she has not been admitted to hospital this time, she has received medical assistance at Kensington Palace. The Duchess’s last official engagement was on August 5 when she opened a poppy installation at the Tower of London with her husband William and Prince Harry. Over the summer she headed to Belgium for First World War centenary commemorations and was in Yorkshire in July for the start of the Tour de France. But she has not carried out a charitable engagement since July, when went to a North London school to see one of her M-Pact projects, and has told aides she is keen to revisit some of her charities. Now that she is feeling better, the couple are expected to move into their new ten-bedroom Georgian pile, Anmer Hall, in Norfolk. Taking pity? Greer added that 32-year-old Kate had a 'b*****d of a job' because she had been 'put in charge of William' and her interests have been limited by the royal family . Business as usual: According to Royal aides, the Duchess is planning to resume official engagements next month . Hard at work: The Duchess of Cambridge  during a visit to Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire to mark the completion of a year-long restoration project in June this year . ‘While they will be predominantly living in Norfolk, the intention is for Kate to hop between London and Norfolk while looking after Prince George,’ said a source. Three weeks after it was revealed the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expecting a second child, some punters are placing sums of at least £1,000 on its name. And with speculation rife as to what Prince William and Kate will call their new child, one of the most authoritative of royal authors claimed today that he is convinced they will name it after Diana. Andrew Morton - who wrote a biography of the Princess of Wales which revealed the truth behind her strained royal relationships - said a daughter would be given the name Elizabeth Diana Windsor. Kate’s latest pregnancy was announced on September 8, as it was revealed she was suffering from very acute morning sickness and being treated by doctors at Kensington Palace. The couple are choosing to base their family in Norfolk, but the new baby will be delivered at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, central London, where Prince George was born in July 2013.","Greer said  Kate Middleton is 'too thin' and shouldn't have more children .

"A 379-year-old Rembrandt 'selfie' has finally been verified as being painted by the Dutch Old Master’s own hand. The authenticity of the famous self-portrait has previously been in doubt, but following eight months of tests, scientists are now certain it is a genuine Rembrandt masterpiece. The work of art, which has an estimated value of £30 million ($50 million), is now back on display at the National Trust’s Buckland Abbey, near Tavistock in Devon. Scroll down for video . Tina Sitwell, Paintings conservation advisor, (left) and Patricia Pertnyk, House Steward, are pictured with the self-portrait of Rembrandt. The painting has been returned to Buckland Abbey, Devon, after scientific analysis confirmed it was painted by Dutch Old Master's own hand . The painting was given to the National Trust in 2010 as a gift from the estate of the late Edna, Lady Samuel of Wych Cross, and is now the first Rembrandt in its collection of 13,500 paintings. As the National Trust cares for items for public benefit forever, it could never be sold. In the 31-inch by 28-inch (91 x 72cm) portrait, Rembrandt is wearing a black velvet cap with two ostrich feathers, a gorget - a decorative metal band worn round the neck and originally part of a military outfit or armour - and a short, decorated velvet cape. Eight-year-old Harry Dempster  looking at the self-portrait of Rembrandt. The painting was given to the National Trust in 2010 as a gift from the estate of the late Edna, Lady Samuel of Wych Cross, and is now the first Rembrandt in its collection of 13,500 paintings . The painting went through a series of tests to verify its authenticity. This included: . Infra-red reflectography: Infrared radiation is often used to ‘see through’ paint layers that are impenetrable to the human eye. The radiation passes through paint until it reaches something that absorbs it, or it is reflected back to the camera. For instance, if an artist has begun a painting by drawing the design in black on a white ground, an infrared image can make this visible. X-radiography: The technique can show the different elements of a painting, from the canvas or panel it is painted on to the top paint layer. X-radiographs are useful for revealing changes that may have occurred at different stages in the development of a painting.  An X-radiograph records the areas of a work where the X-rays have been impeded. For instance, Pigments containing heavy metals such as lead and mercury show up, . Raking light photography: This technique illuminates paintings from a light source at an oblique angle or almost parallel to the surface to provide information about its surface composition. In some instances, raking light can help reveal whether a painter changed their intentions. It can also help document deterioration over time. Painted in 1635, the authenticity of the portrait had previously been thrown into doubt by Rembrandt specialist Horst Gerson and the Rembrandt Research Project in 1968. At the time they felt that certain areas of the painting were not accomplished enough to be by Rembrandt, that the date and painting style did not correlate, and the panel type was unusual. In 2005 Dr Ernst van de Wetering, one of these experts, concluded that the painting may well be a genuine Rembrandt when confronted with an X-radiograph of the painting and other circumstantial evidence. In 2012 he had a chance to study the painting at Buckland Abbey where his theory was further confirmed. His assurance led the conservation charity to send the painting away to the world famous Hamilton Kerr Institute in Cambridgeshire for further scientific analysis. Christine Slottvedd Kimbriel, a paintings conservator at the Institute, explained the scientific work that was carried out to confirm it as a Rembrandt. 'The self-portrait went through a series of investigate analyses to include close visual examination under magnification, infra-red reflectography, X-radiography, raking light photography and pigment and medium analysis,' she said. 'Careful cleaning and removal of several layers of aged and yellowed varnish which had been added to the painting much later, revealed the original colours and painting style beneath. 'What was revealed was a true depth of colour, much more detail and a three-dimensional appearance to the fabric in Rembrandt’s cloak which had previously been obscured and detracted from the quality of the work in the eyes of the Rembrandt Research Project. Careful cleaning and removal of several layers of aged and yellowed varnish, which had been added to the painting much later, revealed the original colours and painting style beneath . 'Next, it was close investigation of the artist’s signature that gave us one of the biggest clues as to its true authenticity. 'The signature and date of 1635, inscribed both on the front and back of the panel, had been considered problematic in previous assessments as it was thought that the style and composition was much more akin to the artist’s style slightly later in his career. 'But, the cross-section analysis left no reason to doubt that the inscription was added at the time of execution of the painting. 'The infrared reflectography and X-ray photography gave further insight into the compositional changes that took place at various stages during the execution of the portrait. 'For example a white figure-of-eight cuff could be seen in the X-ray, showing how Rembrandt’s left hand was at one stage included in the composition. The self-portrait of Rembrandt has been carefully hung at the National Trust’s Buckland Abbey, near Tavistock in Devon.  Painted in 1635, the authenticity of the portrait had previously been thrown into doubt by Rembrandt specialist Horst Gerson and the Rembrandt Research Project in 1968 . 'Changes to the outline of the figure, carried out at a late stage and without much care to perfectly match the surrounding paint, were also present, and again, such alterations are present in many of Rembrandt’s own works, suggesting a dynamic process of painting typical of Rembrandt.' David Taylor, paintings and sculptor curator at the National Trust, said: 'The debate over whether this is or isn’t a Rembrandt has been ongoing for decades. 'The key element for me has been the cleaning. The varnish was so yellow that it was difficult to see how beautifully the portrait had been painted. 'Now you can really see all the flesh tones and other colours, as well as the way in which the paint has been handled - it’s now much easier to appreciate it as a Rembrandt. 'With the technical analysis backing up Ernst’s claims, we are obviously very excited. 'Caring for the work of one of the great Dutch masters, although in itself quite daunting, will also give us a great story to tell as we bring the mystery of its authorship to life for our visitors to enjoy.' Dr van de Wetering, a Dutch art historian who is considered the leading world expert on Rembrandt, examined the painting before it returned to Buckland Abbey. 'Although I was pretty certain the painting was a Rembrandt when I saw it in 2013, I wanted to further examine it after cleaning and see the results from the technical analysis as this had never been done before,' he said. 'With all this additional scientific evidence, I am satisfied it is by Rembrandt.'","Authenticity had previously been doubted by specialist Horst Gerson .

"Tiny robots built to mimic human movements are now so advanced they can - in theory - fly light aircraft. A replica robotic human, no more than five inches tall, has been filmed at the controls of a flight simulator, from which it can control a small airplane. The device - a diminutive model called the PIBOT - is able to taxi the stationary plane, complete a take-off, finish a short flight and bring the plane in to approach the runway. Scroll down for video . Technology: A humanoid PIBOT device is pictured below with a shrunken version of human airplane controls . The technology was exhibited at a robotics conference in Chicago this week, according to science magazine IEEE Spectrum. Landing the plane - the final and most complicated step - still requires human assistance, but it is hoped this too will be mastered soon. In footage from the event, the PIBOT is seen flicking switches on a pilots' console, then clamping down on a joystick to steer the plane as it soars through the sky. Part of the feat is achieved by the robot being pre-programmed to know where the buttons are and how to press them. Data feeds from the simulator also influence parts of steering, such as the pitch, roll and yaw of the craft. But the some of the steering is achieved by the machine's webcam seeing the simulation of the ground and sky - and reacting accordingly. During the entire simulation, the robot receives no external inputs and makes all the decisions itself. Working it out: A combination of processes and data feed into the robot to help it make decisions about flight . The details of the technology were laid out in a research paper called A Robot-Machine Interface for Full-functionality Automation using a Humanoid, by Heejin Jeong, David Hyunchul Shim and Sungwook Cho, scientists from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology. While the footage from the event reveals some abrupt twists and turns from the robot pilot, the movements are technically viable, if jerky. Indeed the inventors behind the modified PIBOT are so confident in its flying abilities that they think it could meet Government guidelines for flying real airplanes. One said: 'PIBOT can satisfy the various requirements specified in the flying handbook by the Federal Aviation Administration.'","Small device called a PIBOT shown working miniature plane controls .

"He started by talking about the honour of taking his first few steps as Manchester United manager alongside Sir Bobby Charlton. By the time Louis van Gaal was up and running on Thursday, however, it was clear he won’t need any assistance finding his own way in English football. It will be Van Gaal’s way or nothing. The 62-year-old Dutchman was everything we had come to expect: at times abrasive, humble, charming and even funny. But, above all, there was a cast-iron belief in his football philosophy and the importance of others grasping it. He railed against his reputation as a dictator but this is not a man who is afraid to seek out confrontation or ruffle a few feathers. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal's first Manchester United press conference . Man in charge: New Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal says the club are the biggest in the world . Straight to work: Van Gaal opted not to take a holiday after leading Holland to third at the World Cup . Having criticised United’s prized training ground on the club’s television station, Van Gaal walked into his opening press conference at Old Trafford a few minutes late - dressed in a grey suit and club tie - and immediately raised the thorny issue of United’s commercial might impacting on team affairs. ‘Within two days I know how important Manchester United is and how important the sponsors are,’ he said. You could almost hear the uncomfortable fidgeting of men in suits. Later he added, again unprompted: ‘Because of the greatness of this club it’s also much more difficult than another club. ‘This club is guided in the commercial way and we have to fulfil that also. It’s not always easy to fulfil commercial and football expectations. That is my big challenge after two days.’ On the issue of signings, Van Gaal insisted he gave his ‘approval’ to the deals for Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw. He will not demand any more arrivals until the existing squad have been given the chance to buy into his philosophy when they leave for a tour of America at lunchtime on Friday. Dutch of class: Louis van Gaal (centre) made a generous donation to his favourite charity . Midfield man: Ander Herrera became Louis van Gaal's first signing in a £28.4m deal . Beaming: Luke Shaw completed his £31.5million move as well, something which Van Gaal okayed . ‘My method is always the same,’ he said. ‘I want to look at the present players. I don’t know the players until I have trained and coached them. 'Firstly, I want to see, over the first two, three, four weeks, how the players perform my philosophy and how quickly they can pick it up. Then maybe I shall buy other players.’ Asked about the importance of drawing on the experience of stars such as Wayne Rooney, Van Gaal ducked the easy option of offering a glowing tribute to the striker and instead issued a veiled warning to his squad that character will count for more than reputation. ‘I am not convinced of the experience of players,’ he said. ‘It depends on the personality; not always on age and football experience but also as a human being. ‘My philosophy is not just the player but the total.’ Totale mens principe. The whole person. The three most important words in Van Gaal’s vocabulary, said a source close to him on Thursday. He will spend the time on tour talking to his players and finding out everything about their upbringing, background, families and living habits. Then he will assess the footballer. The personal touch and eye for detail is reminiscent of another former United manager. No 1 man: Louis van Gaal is proudly unveiled as Manchester United manager with Sir Bobby Charlton (right) Legends past... and future: Van Gaal exchanges a handshake with Old Trafford icon Charlton . VIDEO Van Gaal reveal Carrick injury . ‘Sir Alex Ferguson called to congratulate me and we have spoken about having a coffee or something to eat,’ said Van Gaal. ‘Sir Alex has a strong philosophy and that was confirmed because he won a lot of titles with Manchester United. I have a strong philosophy. From the age of 39, when I was coach of Ajax, the personality has not changed. But autocratic and having a strong personality are not the same. ‘I am a democratic, empathetic human being. I have a strong personality but the other characteristics are more important. It’s unfair because the media want to show that part of the personality.’ Having again described United as the biggest club in the world, the former Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach also mentioned on two occasions that he has now worked for the top clubs in the four best leagues in Europe. Experience doesn't matter: Wayne Rooney will have to prove his worth at Manchester United under Van Gaal . He tried to take a Dutch reporter to task on the latter point, briefly forgetting the original question, and there were withering stares for a couple of other journalists he felt were repeating themselves. But there was also evidence of that more human side. Van Gaal would have preferred a break after the World Cup to recharge. He asked for time and patience from United’s owners and supporters. ‘I have to prepare a team and adapt to this big club,’ he said. ‘It shall not be easy but I will do my utmost. And when you see my career you can see what I have won. ‘Now I need all my knowledge to transfer my philosophy into this team. You have to give me time to do that. Not only you, but the CEO and the owners. ‘It would have been better to have a sabbatical and come in January. But when you have been asked by the biggest club in the world, it’s a challenge I will never let go.’ Friendly: Predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson (left) had a coffee with new United boss Van Gaal (right)","Van Gaal was unveiled alongside United legend Sir Bobby Charlton .

"Indian victims of horrific acid attacks are relying on the generosity of strangers to help them after failing to get any financial support from their government. Acid attacks are sadly not uncommon in India, often targeting women in public places as a form of revenge linked to family disputes, sexism or misogyny. One victim, Reshma Qureshi, 18, was disfigured and lost an eye after her brother-in-law and his friends pinned her down and doused her face with acid. Target: It is thought Reshma Qureshi, 18, was singled out for an attack because of her beauty and popularity . Disfigured: Her brother-in-law and his friends threw acid in her face . Reshma's elder sister Gulshan, whose estranged husband carried out the attack in May, witnessed the assault and suffered burns on her arms, but wishes she had been the main target. The family believe Reshma was singled out because of her beauty and popularity. The once pretty and out-going commerce student now describes her face as 'so scary' as she has an empty eye socket and painful scars. She no longer socialises with friends but hides away in her family's cramped Mumbai home. She faces lifelong scars and the social stigma attached to being an acid attack victim. Reshma should have received swift state aid after India's top court ruled that victims were entitled to 100,000 rupees (£1015) within 15 days of an assault and a total of 300,000 rupees (£3046) in compensation. But, five months later, she is yet to receive a penny. 'One of my eyes is ruined, yet no help is coming,' said Reshma. In pain: Reshma's mother attempts to ease some of her discomfort by rubbing a cream on her scars . 'No help is coming': The teenager reveals she has yet to receive any compensation . Reshma, the adored youngest child of a taxi driver, was attacked in her family's northern home state of Uttar Pradesh, and the fact that she lives in Mumbai complicates her claim. Her relatives have clubbed together and taken out loans for her treatment, but doctors have said she may need up to 10 more operations. 'After that things will be better, but still nothing will be alright,' Reshma said. Now she is relying on donations to help her get the treatment she needs after the volunteer network 'Make Love Not Scars', have set up a crowdfunding page on the website Indiegogo on her behalf. The immediate target is £1,367, although her overall costs are expected to be much higher. The group have previously successfully raised money for another Indian acid attack victim, Rekha, who is now receiving treatment. As she was: Since the attack, the once out-going Reshma has become reclusive . Desperate for justice: Her family have clubbed together to raise money for Reshma's treatment but it's not enough so now a crowdfunding page has been set up for her . Make Love Not Scars turned to the internet to help victims after becoming frustrated by the lack of government aid. Reshma and Rekha are not the only ones who haven't received compensation despite the steps taken to help improve the situation for survivors. Alok Dixit of the New Delhi-based Stop Acid Attacks campaign group said: 'Still there's no awareness on the issue... People don't know how to apply for compensation. The authorities don't know.' He said he knew of no-one who had received the initial 100,000 rupees within 15 days of an assault, while only two in 100 cases had managed to win the full 300,000 rupees. He added that even if claims were successful, the figure is 'not at all enough' for the costly and multiple plastic surgeries required. Life changing injuries: Reshma lost an eye as a result of acid being thrown on her . Campaign for change: The teen wants more to be done to stop other women suffering from her fate . Bringing the perpetrators of acid attacks to justice is another controversial area. Last year, acid attacks were made a specific criminal offence in India punishable with at least a decade behind bars. But court cases can drag on for years. In Reshma's case, her brother-in-law was arrested and jailed, but a juvenile in the gang has been freed on bail and two other accomplices remain at large, according to her family.

"The TSA has been accused of rudely failing to help a mute stroke victim, meaning she had to take a an eight-hour bus ride. Heidi Wright, who has been unable to speak for ten years, had been due to fly from LAX to Phoenix on Wednesday last week but was stopped by an agent who allegedly asked her to say her name. The family claim that a TSA official demanded that the disabled woman say her name as he sought additional ID because she had only a photocopy of an expired driver's license. However TSA officials insist that Miss Wright was not allowed to board the flight because she did not have valid ID - having provided only a poor photocopy of an expired driving license - and not because she as unable to say her name. Scroll down for video . Barred: Heidi Wright, who was left unable to speak after a stroke, was prevented from boarding a flight . Ms Wright's sister Sherry claimed the official was rude and insensitive, and said she was left distraught by their experience . 'I was just standing there, tears were coming out and I was like, ""Are you serious? We can’t get her to talk"",' Sherry Wright told ABC 7. She claimed the confrontation happened after she presented the official with additional ID because of the expired driver's license. 'I showed her ID, her social and her DMV papers,' Ms Wright said, adding: 'He just wanted me to make my sister talk, and I couldn't believe it.' The family claim they had contacted the airline before the flight to check what documents Heidi would need, and to alert the airport that a disabled passenger would be traveling. Another of the stroke victim's sisters had been waiting in Phoenix to collect her, and take over as the woman's primary carer. However, a spokesman for the airport, which processes 1.8 million passengers a day, of all abilities, says they were not given advance notice that the disabled passenger would need help. An official with knowledge of the incident told Mail Online: 'The traveler was not denied access to the sterile area because the passenger couldn’t speak. Valid photo ID is required.' The source said Ms Wright had presented staff with a photocopy of her social security card and photocopy of an expired California state ID that had expired in 2012. 'The photo on the California ID photocopy was so dark the face was indistinguishable,' the official said. Shocked: Sherry Wright, who accompanied her disabled sister to the airport, says she was appalled by how they were treated . Security: A TSA official at LAX says Wright did not have the correct ID needed for the flight . If the family had been able to provide a . valid ID - even if that meant going home to fetch one and catching a . later flight - then Ms Wright would have been allowed to board a plane. The TSA website states clearly what ID is required for travelers, and LAX airport staff are experienced in helping passengers of all abilities. It also has a dedicated service to help passengers with disabilities, though the TSA says that this service was not requested by the Wright family.","Heidi Wright was forced to take eight-hour bus ride after being denied access to LAX flight .

"A 90-year-old man who was arrested for feeding the homeless in his Florida city was back at it on Wednesday, despite being apprehended by police on Tuesday. Arnold Abbott has helped to prepare hundreds of meals a week for countless hungry homeless persons in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, since 1990, but a new ordinance now makes this illegal in the city. As a result, Abbott and and two ministers from the Sanctuary Church were arrested while dishing out hot food on Tuesday night. Scroll down for video . Getting printed: Arnold Abbott (above) has prepared hundreds of meals a week for homeless people in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, since 1990 . Against the law: A new ordinance in the city now makes this illegal, and Abbot was arrested on Tuesday and Wednesday (above) by police . Great man: Abbott believes if he does not continue his work homeless people will be forced to steal or dumpster dive . That, however, is not stopping them, and they were back at it again on Wednesday night as if nothing had happened. And after they finished serving food, police again arrested Abbott. It seems that despite Abbott's amazing charitable ways, the mayor of the city, Jack Seiler, has nothing but disgust for the selfless old man. Seiler told Local 10, 'Mr. Abbott has decided that he doesn't think these individuals should have to have any interaction with government, that they should be fed in the parks. We disagree.' Dishing it out: Abbott says he received calls from all over the world on Wednesday supporting him . Capturing the clergy: In addition to Abbott, police arrested two local ministers for feeding the homeless on Tuesday (above) Common criminal: Now, Abbott is facing two $500 fines and up to four months in prison . Abbott, however, has brought up the point that many of these people would be forced to dumpster dive, or just starve, without these meals. 'What the city is doing by cutting out feeding is very simple -- they are forcing homeless people to go dumpster-diving all over again,' Abbott said. 'They will steal. That's what the mayor is forcing the homeless to do.' Classic villain: Mayor Jack Seiler even came out against Abbott's charity work, saying he 'disagrees' with what he is doing . And many seem to agree with him, with Abbott saying he received calls from around the world on Wednesday. 'I love the city. I live here, it's a beautiful place and I'd like to keep it beautiful, but you cannot sweep the homeless under a rug,' explained Abbott. 'There is no rug large enough for that.' Abbott is likely to face a $500 fine for each arrest and could be sentenced to up to four months behind bars.","Arnold Abbott was arrested by police in Fort Lauderdale, Florida for feeding the homeless on Tuesday, which is now against the law .

"Cesc Fabregas has admitted he never would have dreamed of playing for Jose Mourinho three years ago when the two were arch-enemies in Spain. The Chelsea midfielder now says he’s happier than ever playing for the former Real Madrid manager, compares him with Pep Guardiola, and says he is desperate to win the European Cup with him. Asked in an interview in El Pais in Spain if he could ever have imagined working for Mourinho he says: ‘Three years ago no. It just shows you how you can never tell in life, and even more so in football. We had a very intense rivalry with Mourinho. It never reached the level of hatred, not even close, but there were disagreements with him and [John] Terry too. Chelsea were always the team that I most wanted to beat.’ Cesc Fabregas (right) admits his rivalry with Jose Mourinho (second left) was very strong in Spain . Fabregas, now at Chelsea, sees Mourinho in a different light and has put the past behind him . Hazard compared Pep Guardiola (left) and Mourinho, saying they both have a winning mentality . Asked how Terry received Fabregas into the dressing room when he joined last summer the Spain international said: ‘He told me that anything I needed I could count on him. 'We have now reached the stage where we can tell the tales of some of the battles we had to some of the younger players, and I certainly had some battles, especially with Terry and [Frank] Lampard.’ Fabregas was a London rival for both Terry and Mourinho when he signed for Arsenal from Barcelona. He then took the rivalry with Mourinho back to Spain with him when he returned to play for his boyhood team and the Chelsea manager took over at Real Madrid. Having worked for both Mourinho and Pep Guardiola he says they are not as unlike as they are often portrayed. Fabregas had a huge rivalry with Mourinho while they were at Barcelona and Real Madrid respectively . Fabregas clashed with Frank Lampard and Chelsea in the Champions League semi-final in 2011-12 . Fabregas, now flying at Chelsea, compared his current team-mate Eden Hazard with Lionel Messi (right) ‘They have one very important thing that unites them’ he said. ‘They are winners. They both hate losing. It's a mistake to think they are so different.’ Fabregas believes the similarities are even on the increase now that Chelsea have started playing a style of football closer to that played by Guardiola. He said: ‘This is not a team that sits and waits for the other side to attack. We want the ball and we want to attack.’ The Chelsea midfielder is hoping to win his first Champions League with Chelsea after losing the Paris final with Arsenal in 2006 and failing to lift the trophy for Barcelona. He said: ‘I would like to win it at least once. At the same time I don’t want it to become an obsession. I want to win everything with Chelsea.’ Fabregas says Hazard (left) is similar to Messi physically, as well as being honest and always wanting the ball . Fabregas joined Barcelona from Arsenal in 2011, and after three years moved back to England with Chelsea . Fabregas again dismissed the idea that he had any sway in making Leo Messi turn his back on Barcelona to move to London and he said he believes, in Eden Hazard Chelsea have a player who can reach the heights of the Argentine. He said: ‘There are even physical comparisons with the way he is short, strong and impossible to knock off the ball. He is honest, he never goes to ground, he always wants the ball, he doesn’t over-elaborate for the sake of show and he is just a very, very good player. He has the quality to go very far but he should maybe more ambitious when he’s in front of goal.’ For now it’s Fabregas that is scoring the lion’s share of goals from midfield despite playing in a deeper role for Chelsea than he did at Barcelona. He told El Pais: ‘I am playing deeper [than at Barcelona] but participating more. I touch the ball 90 or 100 times a game and I missed that feeling. At Barcelona I played further forward and it was down to the centre backs to bring the ball out from the back.’","Cesc Fabregas joined Chelsea from hometown club Barcelona in June 2014 .

"This never-before-seen Victorian photograph shows the real rabbit who inspired Beatrix Potter's famous character Benjamin Bunny. The adorable pet, named Benjamin Bouncer before his literary transformation, lived with Ms Potter from 1885 until he died in 1892. He would would not appear in her novels until 1904, but the Belgian rabbit - one of several she owned - clearly left a lasting impression. Inspiration: Benjamin Bouncer is pictured here in the late 1880s or early 1890s. He would later become Benjamin Bunny in Beatrix Potter's novels . He was supposed to feature in The Tale of Peter Rabbit - the first book in the series, from 1902, but was later edited out before starring in The Tale of Benjamin Bunny two years later. The author gave the photograph to the children of Joseph Mott, who was the art director at Royal Doulton, a pottery company which had been modelling characters from her tales. She wrote on the back of the picture . postcard: 'For Mr. Motts children - This is a photograph of the real old . original Mr Benjamin Bunny - he was a Belgian rabbit, very tame & . clever.' It has been suggested that Ms Potter's father Rupert may have taken the picture rather than the author herself, as Mr Potter was known to have an interest in photography. Message: Ms Potter wrote this postcard to the children of Mr Mott, whose descendants have now sold it . The 5.5ins by 3.5in card has now been sold for £1,100 by a descendant in the Mott family at Dominic Winter Auctioneers in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. Libby Joy, chairman of the Beatrix Potter Society, said: 'Benjamin Bouncer was a Belgian rabbit and was the first of Beatrix Potter's pet rabbits. 'He was acquired in about 1885. She brought him home from a London pet shop and brought him home in a paper bag. Iconic: Beatrix Potter's elegant watercolours of her beloved rabbits, such as the one pictured, helped make her books an enduring success . Owner: Beatrix Potter, pictured, spoke warmly of 'the real old original Mr Benjamin Bunny' 'We think the photograph on the postcard was taken by Beatrix herself, though it could have been taken by her father, who was a prolific photographer. 'We know quite a lot about Benjamin because Beatrix wrote about him in her Journal, and he was the model for most of the rabbits in her early published work in the 1890s - greetings cards and so on - that predated the little books.' In The Tale of Benjamin Bunny, the title character joins his cousin Peter Rabbit to return to Mr McGregor's garden and look for the clothes Peter left there in the first book. During the risky escapade, the two bunnies become trapped under a basket by Mr McGregor's cat and have to be rescued by Benjamin's father.","Sepia image sold at auction shows one of Beatrix Potter's rabbits .

Proud: Ms Coquerel said she was 'very proud to represent a cosmopolitan France.... It shows that today's France is a mixed France, where there is every culture, and I think a lot of people will see themselves in me' Last year Louis-Georges Tin, the president of CRAN (Representative Council of Black Associations), said there were not enough black contestants. Mr Tin said: ‘The failure to represent the contemporary French population in an event such as this is obviously serious. It amounts to denying the very existence of French people of African origin. ‘In the antiquated world of Miss France, blacks apparently can only come from overseas departments’. There was also anger expressed at the lack of Muslim contestants in the contest, especially as there are more than six million Muslims living in France. Marred: The competition has also been marred by the decision by its president and chief judge, movie star Alain Delon (left), joining the anti-immigration National Front, whose founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen (right), is a convicted racist and anti-Semite . Last month black justice minister Christiane Taubira was taunted with bananas, leading to black newsreader Harry Roselmack saying ‘racist France is back’. The National Front is enjoying huge success in polls, and is predicted to win almost a quarter of the national vote in European elections next year. This is despite its anti-immigration agenda, and the fact that its founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, is a convicted racist and anti-Semite. In 1998 Le Pen expressed annoyance that a mixed race France football team won the World Cup in Paris. Others claimed the victory proved the country was a ‘rainbow nation’, but four years later Le Pen came runner-up in the presidential elections.","Flora Coquerel, whose .

"The inner workings of ancient creatures shed light on the evolution of many modern species. Now scientists have discovered the most intact ancient cardiovascular system and it comes from a fossilised arthropod. The cardiovascular system of the fossil arthropod Fuxianhuia protensa is 520 million-years-old and reveals a complex circulation network, according to British experts. Earliest evidence: The cardiovascular system of the fossil arthropod Fuxianhuia protensa is 520million-years-old and reveals a complex circulation network. It is shown clearly in the X-ray (pictured right) as well as a dark carbon trace within the outline of the fossil (left) F. protensa was a predator, which appeared during the evolutionary burst called the Cambrian Explosion around 520 million years ago. It was around 4in (11cm) long and had movable eyestalks, which had concentrations of nerve tissue inside them. It could rotate its eyestalks in a wide arc allowing it to see in different directions. The fossil, which is a distant relative of modern lobsters, spiders and millipedes, was discovered in China. It shows a dark carbon trace within the outline of the fossil, which outlines a heart in the middle of the body with blood vessels leading to eyes, antennae, brain and legs. The discovery was made by researchers in China, the U.S. and the UK, who X-rayed the F. protensa fossil. Most living animals move oxygen and nutrients around their body using a cardiovascular system. The fossil find is direct evidence that by 520 million years ago the arthropod group had already developed complex organ systems that remain recognisable in species today, according to the study, which was published in Nature Communications. Arthropods are the most diverse group of modern animals and come in many different shapes and sizes. Yet some of the basic arrangements of their cardiovascular system are distinctive to this group, such as a heart towards the back of the body and how blood vessels are arranged through body segments. Complex: The fossil from China shows a dark carbon trace within the outline of the fossil, which outlines a heart in the middle of the body with blood vessels leading to eyes, antennae, brain and legs, detailed in this 3D diagram, which gives an idea of that the strange arthropod looked like . ‘This is a significant discovery. The exquisitely preserved cardiovascular structures of F. protensa allow us to make direct comparison with other arthropods alive today, which has revealed the ancestral basic pattern for the wide range of cardiovascular systems seen in modern arthropods, such as insects, spiders, lobsters and millipedes,’ said lead author and museum palaeontologist Dr Xiaoya Ma. ‘This cardiovascular system is closely linked to the brain, eyes and antennae of the animal, showing a high demand for oxygen from these highly active parts of the body.’ F. protensa is now the most anatomically well-known fossil arthropod as its brain, nervous system and gut have previously been identified. This gives more insight than ever about the early evolution of the group. Evidence: The fossil find is direct evidence that . by 520 million years ago the arthropod group had already developed . complex organ systems that remain recognisable in species today. The fossil on the left shows the animal's tough armour, while the fossil on the right shows its complex cardiovascular system . Fellow museum palaeontologist and co-author Dr Greg Edgecombe said: ‘The specimen is really unusually preserved. ‘The external structures of the animal were relatively decayed away and are preserved as an imprint of the body, but one single internal organ system is pristinely preserved as carbon trace. ‘We had to rule out what it wasn’t, and were left with the cardiovascular system. Then everything fell into place.’ Arthropods have a rich fossil history, but until recently very little was known about their cardiovascular systems. The animal has a complex brain too: In 2012 scientists revealed that Fuxianhuia protensa had a brain just as complex as today's lobsters and crabs. Another fossil (pictured) showed the creature's preserved brain as dark brown patches and is the oldest fossil example of a complex brain in early animals . In October 2012 scientists revealed that the ancient animal Fuxianhuia protensa had a brain just as complex as today's lobsters and crabs. Another 520million-year-old fossil identified by experts from the museum showed the creature's preserved brain as dark brown patches and is the oldest fossil example of a complex brain in early animals. The team used the museum's scanning electron microscope (SEM) to look at the surface structure of the brain material and an energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscope to see how the details of the brain and optic tracts were preserved. They found that the brain was made up of three sections that were connected to the head segments. And nerve fibre tracts ran from the brain to the eyes and antennae. 'We were surprised by the degree of complexity, which was more comparable to that seen in living crustaceans and insects,' said Dr Edgecombe. 'The obvious comparisons are with crustaceans like lobsters or prawns because they also have movable eye stalks. The eye stalks have elaborate concentrations of neural tissue inside them, and the brain has 3 segments that are fused in front of the mouth.' The team said the animal could rotate its eye stalks over quite a wide arc, making it able to see in different directions. Dr Edgecombe said:  'It must have had quite acute vision. This is consistent with its relatively sophisticated brain because we would expect big, movable eyes to be associated with quite sophisticated neural wiring.’ It is thought that F. protensa branched off from the arthropod evolutionary tree before the common ancestor of today's arthropods appeared. Dr Ma said: 'The common ancestor of this diverse group [arthropods] may have also had elaborate brains similar to those of lobsters or flies, rather than to the simpler brains of, say, brine shrimp or fairy shrimp.’ It is extremely rare to find fossilised soft tissue but Chengjiang - the site where both the fossils showing the animal’s brain structure and cardiovascular system were found - is one of the places where soft anatomy of many different kinds of animals is preserved in exceptional detail. Dr Edgecombe said: ‘The keys to preserving soft anatomy in Cambrian fossils seems to be low oxygen conditions that inhibit bacterial activity soon after the animal dies and then rapid burial of the carcass in fine-grained sediment.'","The ancient cardiovascular system belongs to a fossil arthropod that is related to the modern group including insects, spiders and lobsters .

"Fans of fantasy fiction might imagine it was Gollum’s greed and obsession, or Dracula’s thirst for blood that lead the villains to come to a sticky end. But the consistent triumph of good over evil in fantasy literature may be linked to unsavoury characters’ aversion to sunlight, a scientist has said. The British researcher theorised that baddies who dwell in the darkness and eat a poor diet are left lacking in vitamin D, leading to muscle weakness, which critically undermines their performance in battle. British researchers think baddies who dwell in the darkness, such as Gollum (pictured from The Hobbit film) eat a poor diet are left lacking in vitamin D, leading to muscle weakness, which critically undermines their performance in battle . However, good characters are often bathed in sunlight which makes them strong, according to a light-hearted study by Imperial College London. No previous studies have investigated vitamin D levels in imaginary populations, so to test the hypothesis, researchers scoured J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, The Hobbit for references to characters' living conditions, habits and diet. They used these clues to give each character a score, rating their likely vitamin D levels. Vitamin D is produced in the skin when it is exposed to sunlight and can also be obtained from some foods such as oily fish, egg yolks and cheese. The Hobbit's hero, Bilbo Baggins, lives in a hole, but it has windows, and he is known to enjoy sitting in the sun overlooking his garden. The hobbit diet is clearly varied, as Bilbo is able to offer cake, tea, seed cake, ale, porter, red wine, raspberry jam, mince pies, cheese, pork pie, salad, cold chicken, pickles and apple tart to the dwarves who visit to engage him on the business of burglary. The Hobbit's hero, Bilbo Baggins (pictured) lives in a hole, but it has windows, and he is known to enjoy sitting in the sun overlooking his garden. The hobbit diet is varied and includes tea, seed cake, ale, raspberry jam, mince pies, cheese, pork pie, salad, cold chicken, pickles and apple tart . In contrast, villains such as Gollum, the goblins and Smaug the dragon spend most of their time in darkness and do not whip up feasts for visitors, instead preferring to dine on decaying corpses and scraps of meat. The good characters, who all emerge victorious, have significantly higher vitamin D scores than the bad characters, who are defeated, Dr Nicholas Hopkinson of Imperial College London and his son Joseph noted, in the Christmas edition of the Medical Journal of Australia. ‘Systematic textual analysis of The Hobbit supports our initial hypothesis that the triumph of good over evil may be assisted to some extent by the poor diet and lack of sunlight experienced by the evil characters,’ he said. Vitamin D is produced in the skin when it is exposed to sunlight, and can also be obtained from some foods such as oily fish, egg yolks and cheese. Magnified vitamin D crystals are pictured . The pair acknowledged that their study had several limitations. ‘We have not discriminated between creatures that can be considered, broadly speaking, to be mammalian and those that are not and whose physiology is more obscure. ‘Unfortunately, the principal purpose of the author of The Hobbit was not to provide a systematic dietary history, so reporting bias is a possibility. ‘In particular, there is an emphasis in the text on meat items similar to Homer's Odyssey, where feasting is a recurrent motif but where few references to salad are made.’ They said that more research would be needed to establish whether their study is representative of Tolkien’s other novels and of fantasy literature in general.","A scientist from Imperial College London, said the triumph of good over evil in fantasy literature may be linked to villains’ aversion to sunlight .

"A new YouTube video gives a terrifying portrayal of the vulnerability of drunk women - and the shocking lengths that some men will go to in order to take advantage of their inebriated state. The video, which was created by social media entrepreneur Stephen Zhang, follows a young woman - who is pretending to be seriously intoxicated - as she tries to find her way home from Hollywood Boulevard. Throughout the video, the young woman, who introduces herself as Jennifer, appears to be sipping from a beer can as she staggers from one man to another asking for directions to her bus stop. Scroll down for video . 'I've had a little too much to drink': The woman, who introduces herself as Jennifer, approaches five different men on Hollywood Boulevard in order to ask for directions to her bus stop . Taking advantage: The first man featured (pictured) tries to lure Jennifer back to his apartment with the promise of a water bed . During the four-minute video, Jennifer approaches five different men and each time makes clear that she needs to find a bus which will take her home to Culver City. Introducing the video, the woman briefly explains the details of the experiment, saying: 'Hey guys, today I'm on Hollywood Boulevard, I've had a little too much to drink. Let's see if anyone will help me to get home.' Shockingly, of the five men featured, only one actually offers her assistance, while the rest attempt to lure her back to their homes - despite her obviously drunken state. 'Hey, where you going?' the first man asks. 'You don't need to take a bus, we're going to go this way. We're going to go somewhere else... to my house. There's a bus line at my house.' 'I just want to help you': Another man tries to get the young woman into his car (pictured) 'I have more beer': One of the last men Jennifer approaches offers to give her more alcohol - if she will go back to his place and 'hang out' He later adds: 'I got a water bed, I got all of that. Come on, it's right there.' Another asks whether Jennifer wants to 'hang out' at his home, before he tries to convince her to get into his car. 'Let's go, come on,' he says. 'I just want to help you so much. It's OK, just come with me.' The last two men featured in the video nearly come to blows deciding who will get the chance to escort Jennifer home. While one is offering to take Jennifer back to his place, where he has 'more beer', the second interrupts their conversation - and for a brief moment it seems like he might actually be staging a rescue, as he tells the first man to 'f**k off'. 'F**k off': Two men nearly come to blows over who will get the chance to escort the drunk woman home . Knight in shining armor: Only one man (pictured) offers to help Jennifer find her bus stop . Sadly that isn't the case. 'You're not going home with him, you're coming home with me,' he says to Jennifer, before adding: 'You shouldn't hang around with such losers, [my place] is close by.' Only one man - the second person to be approached during filming - tries to help Jennifer find her bus stop and even offers her assistance as she makes her way down some stairs. The shocking video footage comes just a few weeks after a similar clip (see below), which documented the verbal harassment one woman received while walking around New York City, surfaced online, sparking outrage from women around the world. That video has since been watched by more than 35 million people.","An actress, pretending to be drunk, asked five men on Hollywood Boulevard if they would help her find her bus stop - and filmed their reactions .

"Unveiled: Sara Al Amoudi, who is accused of swindling a couple out of property worth £14million by posing as a Saudi princess was actually a prostitute, a court heard . A woman accused of swindling a couple out of property worth £14million by posing as a Saudi princess was actually a prostitute, a court heard. Sara Al Amoudi reportedly boasted of ‘limitless wealth’, and convinced HSBC to lend her £4million, while a statement from Barclays suggested she had £165million in her account. But property developers Amanda Clutterbuck, 56, and Ian Paton, 45, say the ‘princess’ actually worked as a prostitute with her two sisters in a £750,000 flat yards from Harrods. A judge also urged Miss Al Amoudi to remove her burka in court for the complex civil claim from Miss Clutterbuck and Mr Paton for the value of six luxurious London properties they signed over to her. Miss Al Amoudi, who counts peers among her friends and is said to have dated actor Colin Farrell, earned the nickname ‘the vamp in the veil’ following a previous court case in which ex-boyfriend Patrick Ribbsaeter, a Swedish model, was cleared of assaulting her chauffeur. He claimed that Miss Al Amoudi – whose age has been variously reported as 30 and 43 – regularly discarded her veil to go to nightclubs and drink herself into a stupor. London’s High Court heard how Mr Paton was introduced to Miss Al Amoudi about ten years ago by another property developer, Elliot Nichol. Miss Al Amoudi, Mr Paton and Miss Clutterbuck then became involved in a multimillion-pound scheme to redevelop prime sites in the capital. Mr Paton and Miss Clutterbuck claim they lost everything when the venture collapsed – and realised they had been tricked. Miss Clutterbuck said in a  statement: ‘I thought I was living through an Alfred Hitchcock film,  in which reality seemed to be totally distorted. Mr Nichol had drunkenly admitted that the so-called Saudi Arabian “princesses” were in fact prostitutes.’ Accused: Sara Al Amoudi, pictured with her bodyguard, told the court in evidence that she had handed large sums of money to Mr Paton, but not received all of it back . The couple’s counsel, Stuart Cakebread, told the court: ‘It is the claimants’ case that she repeatedly made the representation that she was married to a member of the Saudi royal family and that she had access to limitless wealth because of her father.’ He claimed Miss Al Amoudi had named two different men as her father: Ethiopian-born billionaire Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Al Amoudi – who this week issued a denial through his London solicitors – and his cousin Sheikh Mohammed Aboud Al Amoudi, who also denies being related to her. Jonathan Seitler, defending, said the case should not get ‘bogged down in some of the detail surrounding the question of identity’. In the dock: Sarah Al Amoudi, 30, leaves London's High Court surrounded by minders in a Rolls Royce with an 'HRH' number plate . He stressed that while Miss Al Amoudi was indeed ‘a person of substantial means’, her wealth played no part in making Miss Clutterbuck and Mr Paton part with any money. Mr Seitler has already alleged that Mr Paton had a lengthy affair with Miss Al Amoudi and borrowed and stole millions from her, before repaying her with the very properties on which the case is centred. The court also heard how hereditary peer Lord Mereworth, 83, a close friend of Miss Al Amoudi, had phoned Miss Clutterbuck to tell her Mr Paton was a crack cocaine addict. Mr Paton denies both claims. Another twist came when judge Sarah Asplin told Mr Seitler that ‘given the fact that the claim is fraudulent misrepresentation, it seems to me that it may make a difference to me whether or not your client is entirely veiled’. The case continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Sara Al Amoudi reportedly boasted of .

"The pilots and some passengers on a plane that made an extraordinary landing on the Hudson River marked the fifth anniversary of that remarkable event on Wednesday, giving thanks to those who kept everyone who was on that flight alive. 'I'm filled with joy and gratitude about what was able to be accomplished by so many five years ago today and the fact that all 155 passengers and crew are here today because of it,' said Capt. Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger III, who gained instant fame for his calm handling of US Airways flight 1549. The flight had just taken off from LaGuardia Airport when a flock of geese disabled the engines. Sullenberger safely glided to a water landing and all 155 passengers and crew members were rescued in what became known as the 'miracle on the Hudson.'

Sullenberger and about a half-dozen passengers gathered at the NY Waterway ferry terminal to thank the ferry boat company, whose boats quickly got to the downed plane and rescued people. They then boarded a boat and sailed out to the area of the landing, where they raised a toast. Five years later, 'it feels like yesterday, every day,' said passenger Denise Lockie of Charlotte, N.C. 'It's a miracle and I'm just glad I'm here.' Passenger Barry Leonard, of Charlotte, said those on the plane have seen children and grandchildren born in the past five years.

The incident also led to changes in how the airline industry deals with bird strikes, said Michael Begier, national coordinator of the Airport Wildlife Hazards Program run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It brought the idea that bird strikes can be dangerous to planes solidly into public consciousness, he said, leading to an increased willingness among airports and airlines to report bird strike incidents. By having more strike data, the government is better able to gauge how wildlife should be managed in the regions around airports, he said.

"President Obama lashed out Tuesday at Republican lawmakers during a Hollywood speech seemingly designed to shift public debate away from his Obamacare- and Iran-related political train wrecks and toward safer territory: jobs and the economy. Speaking to a crowd estimated at between 1,800 to 2,000 people – primarily staff of the DreamWorks Animation film studio, according to a White House pool reporter – the president slammed GOP partisans while claiming economic moral high ground that poll numbers suggest he's incapable of holding. 'Instead of rooting for failure or re-fighting old battles, Republicans in Congress need to work with us,' he declared, complaining about his opponents' fixation on the Affordable Care Act. 'We would be a lot further along without some of this dysfunction and obstruction we've seen in Washington,' he insisted,.'if we didn't [sic] have one wing of one party that was a little less obsessed with repealing health care for 40 million people.' Obama's speech at DreamWorks Animation may be a payback for CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg's massive fundraising haul on the president's behalf . BFFs: Katzenberg (L) raised at least $15 million for Obama's 2012 re-election campaign, placing him in the president's inner circle and winning his company a coveted visit . He claimed that the nation would have created more jobs through infrastructure projects and other initiatives if Republicans 'hadn't spent more than 40 votes trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act.' More than 6 in 10 American workers told pollsters in a recent Washington Post survey, co-led by a University of Virginia agency, that they fear they will lose their jobs, the highest such number measured since the 1970s. And 32 per cent said they worry 'a lot' about becoming suddenly unemployed. The DreamWorks crowd was safe political territory, a company led by major Democratic donors and situated in Hollywood's liberal enclave. Obama played to the crowd, saying as he departed that 'I can't wait to see your next movie!' and praising the U.S. entertainment industry for providing the world's best 'place to make movies and television and music.' Nationally, though, he's having trouble re-establishing his credibility after the disastrous launch of his signature health insurance overhaul, and persuading Americans that he's up to the job of rescuing the country's faltering economy. A CNN/ORC International poll released Monday showed that 53 per cent of Americans believe the president is not honest and trustworthy. And only 40 percent say he can manage the government effectively. Six months ago, Obama maintained his high voter ratings on such personal attributes even as his job-performance began to tank. But no more. Teleprompters are commonplace in Hollywood, and put Obama in his element as he soaked in the sun and delivered his outdoor speech on Tuesday . Virtual motion: Obama and Katzenberg took in a demonstration of motion-capture technology used in the upcoming film, 'How to Train Your Dragon 2,' during the president's tour the movie studios in Glendale, California . So instead of touting his own bona fides, he took a page from his campaign playbook and attacked his opposition. Republicans, he said, had done 'nothing to create jobs, or grow the economy, or strengthen the middle class.' Obama blamed Republicans for stonewalling his policies, and took credit for economic developments, like rising domestic oil production, that have come about despite his policies . Casting himself as the nation's public-opinion barometer, he declared that 'the American people agree with us' – meaning Democrats – 'that jobs and growing the economy should be our top priority.' 'For instance, he claimed that 'for the first time in nearly 20 years, America now produces more of our own oil than we buy from other countries.' But the Energy Information Administration says America's boom in domestic oil output is due mostly to hydraulic fracturing – fracking – a controversial technique used to get oil from shale deposits. That method has drawn ire from Democrats in Congress and among the president's nonprofit environmental cheerleaders. It's Republicans, especially those from states like Texas and North Dakota, who have pushed the fracking revolution forward. And Obama claimed that 'thanks in part to the Affordable Care Act, health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years.' That finding came from a report prepared by the president's own Council of Economic Advisers, an office within the White House. The group said last week that health care spending grew at an annual rate of 1.3 percent rate per capita since 2010, the lowest rate on record for any three-year period. But overall, health care expenses in the U.S. amount to 17.7 per cent of GDP, by far the highest such measure in the developed world. And by every measure, consumers are on average facing higher insurance costs as the Affordable Care Act reaches full implementation. Obama has failed to endorse or embrace fracking, as a hat-tip to green campaigners. But the technology is responsible for the U.S. oil boom he touted on Tuesdady . Wild and crazy guys: Actor Steve Martin (L) met Obama, mugged for cameras and elbow-bumped the president before his speech in California . Jonathan Gruber, an economist at MIT who helped craft the Obamacare law, warned USA Today that 'I think the health economists are still saying, ""Wait and see"" ... what will happen in the long term.' Obama insisted Tuesday in Hollywood that he's not letting up as his health insurance plan approaches a series of key deadlines. 'Yes, we are going to continue to implement the health care law. The product is good. People want it,' he claimed. 'Thousands of Californians are signing up,' Obama added. And in a wry acknowledgment of the technical glitches that have made Obamacare a laughingstock, the president insisted, 'By the way, the website is continually working better. So check it out.' Presiding over the Hollywood Affair was DreamWorks Animation studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg, one of Obama's most stalwart and consistent fundraisers. He raised $15 million for the president's 2012 re-election campaign during just one expensive, star-studded dinner last year.' White House Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest, however, downplayed the coincidence. 'Mr. Katzenberg's support for the president's policies has no bearing on our decision to visit there,' he told reporters Tuesday on Air Force One.","'We would be a lot further along without some of this dysfunction and obstruction ,' the president insisted .

Martyn Farr, 63, plunged to the depths of this . previously undiscovered cave in New Zealand through a 350-feet-long . underwater passage, before emerging into an amazing display of stalactites and stalagmites. Farr, from Crickhowell in South Wales, managed to make his way though a three mile-long . system of underground tunnels carrying . 65lb of equipment to reach the never-before-seen cave. Scroll down for video . Underground beauty: The cave diver was treated to this sight as he emerged into the cave for the first time . Farr spent around nine hours in total underground and captured the only footage of the extraordinary place, which he called ‘Avalon Hall’ after the mystical island from the legend of Britain’s King Arthur. 'Finding something as special as Avalon Hall is very much every cave explorer’s dream,' says Martyn. ‘Being the first to find something special or unique is a quite incredible feeling. I have never lost the passion for this. The name speaks volumes about the beauty and grandeur of the place,’ Martyn Farr was stunned to find himself in the huge cave half a mile underground . It is a challenge to find anything new and previously undiscovered in the present age, but underground it is a different story, says the diving instructor. 'We are constantly finding new stuff,' he reveals. ‘Now it’s wide open and we have a system of passages running to over three-miles in length – with many more miles still to come.’ Avalon Hall is the latest find in a system of new caves ultimately draining to the famous Waikoropupu Spring system, near Takaka, located at the northern tip of New Zealand’s South Island. Commonly known as ‘Pupu Springs’ the place is a spiritual centre for New Zealand’s indigenous population – the Maoris, whose own legends tell of the healing properties of the water. Ethereal: Parr carried 65ibs of equipment with him along three miles of tunnels to capture his discovery . Brave: 'Drowning is the worst that can happen,' Parr says of his exploring . However, for cave divers like Martyn who reach places never before reached by another human, the spring can be a potentially deadly place. ‘If you are cave diving you only have a limited supply of gas, in this case compressed air,’ he said. ‘Hypothermia in the ten degree temperature is always a concern. ‘If you are caving beyond a dive then you really must not get injured because you need to be fully mobile, fit and healthy to kit yourself up and dive out. ‘Drowning is the worst that can happen - the world of caves is packed with potential danger for the untrained or inexperienced. We all know this, so we prepare thoroughly and take care. ‘My philosophy in this respect is simple - Don’t have the accident.’","Cave diver travels through 350-foot underground passage to make discovery .

According to Tim Harris, speaking to MailOnline, the colours in the spring are natural and arise from chemicals and the algae within the water. ‘It’s obviously quite a hostile environment, which particularly struck us,’ he said. ‘The colours and shapes and composition are interesting in that picture. ‘And it’s good to see bison in the frame, to give you a sense of scale and also how animals can survive in extremely hostile environments.

This image was taken in Italy. ‘There was some stiff competition in the adult category, and some great images from the younger age group too,' said judge Tim Harris . In another image a turtle is seen eating a jellyfish, something Mr Harris explains is fairly common in the natural world. ‘Jellyfish are the main food of marine turtles, that’s what they routinely eat,’ he explains. ‘What was particularly arresting about that image was the colours in it. ‘I’ve seen plenty of photos like it before but not one with such strikingly colour jellyfish. ‘It’s a very bold and arresting image that stood out.'

On the right, a chick embryo in a hardened eggshell is sustained until full development. On the left, a tarsier is pictured in its natural habitat . In another image parasitoid wasps - those that spend a large party of their life attached to another organism – are shown making ‘clay pots’. According to the photographer Thomas Endlein: ‘Parasitoid wasps expend a lot of effort in providing a good start for their offspring: not only do they build shelter in form of intricate clay pots but they also provide food in the form of paralysed caterpillars. ‘The caterpillar needs to be just the right size to fit through the narrow opening of the pot to reach the growing larva inside. ‘In the picture, several stages of this behaviour are shown: in the bottom left a wasp is busy adding a `mouthful' of clay to the rim of an almost finished pot. Another wasp is just about to feed in a caterpillar through the opening of the pot, and the wasp in the bottom right is sealing the opening.’ In the competition there are two categories, the regular Photographer of the Year and the Young Photographer of the Year.  In this image A farmer protects his family and animals from mosquitoes .

"Robert F Kennedy Junior had an affair with the wife of plastic surgeon to the stars Laurence Kirwan behind the back of his fiancée Cheryl Hines, it is claimed today. With just weeks before RFK Jr is set to say ‘I Do’ to the Curb Your Enthusiasm star, sources close to Professor Kirwan have revealed how his estranged wife, Connecticut socialite Chelsea Chapman Kirwan, struck up a close friendship with the Kennedy scion that has spanned the past two years. A high-profile surgeon with offices in London, New York and Connecticut, a source close to Prof Kirwan, 62, told MailOnline: ‘He was well aware that his wife and Bobby had a friendship before their split and that they have had ongoing telephone calls.’ Estranged: Surgeon to the stars Laurence Kirwan and his soon to be ex wife Chelsea at a party. Sources close to Prof Kirwan claimed the mother of three of his children had an 'inappropriate' relationship with Robert F Kennedy Jr . It is believed a friendship started well before the Kirwans separated on July . 4, 2012 - and a source reveals how Chelsea’s cell phone records show she was . speaking to RFK Jr five times a day in August 2012. The exact nature of Chelsea’s relationship with RFK Jr could well come out in court next month when Prof Kirwan will appeal to try and modify the protection order currently in place over his visitation rights with his three children with Chelsea, 42. The case will be heard on July 22 in Connecticut. Allegedly, Chelsea actually told Prof. Kirwan that she had met Bobby at the gym in Armonk, New York. A source said: 'She didn’t say they were having an affair, but she was obviously infatuated. RFK Jr gave her his book which she was reading, she was very impressed by him. ‘Prof Kirwan’s away in London a lot of the time, he doesn’t have any physical proof – but if it looks like it and sounds like it, the likelihood is they were having an affair. ‘Certainly, Prof Kirwan believes the relationship was inappropriate.’ Indeed, the source close to Prof Kirwan believes Chelsea’s ‘game plan’ was to ‘trade up to RFK Jr’, however, a source close to Chelsea insisted: 'There was no trading up, that's just ridiculous.' Last week, the National Enquirer reported that RFK Jr had had an affair behind the back of Cheryl Hines with an unnamed woman, now known to be Chelsea, but later dumped her. The publication said that RFK Jr ‘turned on the Kennedy charm to woo the woman into bed, with a source saying. He’s a no-good horn dog!’. It claimed the liaison lasted for two years. All smiles: Robert Kennedy Jr and Cheryl Hines tied the knot on August 2 - despite allegations of his infidelity . Tying the knot: RFK Jr, an environmental lawyer, revealed hjs engagement to Curb Your Enthusiasm actress Chery Hines in April at Muhammad Ali's Celebrity Fight Night in Phoenix, Arizona . RFK . Jr, a father of six, began dating Cheryl, 48, in 2012, months before . his estranged wife, Mary Richardson, tragically committed suicide in May . 2012 at their Mount Kisco, New York home aged just 52. The couple are expected to tie the knot this summer during the Kennedys' annual reunion in Hyannis Port. The pair are planning a ceremony at the Kennedy compound with close friends and family invited, including mom Ethel Kennedy, Page Six reported. This . will be the second marriage for Cheryl, who has a 10-year-old . daughter Catherine from her previous marriage to Paul Young. RFK . Jr, an environmental lawyer, revealed their engagement at the end of . April at Muhammad Ali’s Celebrity Fight Night in Phoenix, Arizona. And asked about their relationship, Cheryl said recently: . 'We share the same values. Family first. We like to have a good time and . work hard. It’s fun to have a partner...It’s a good match-up.' Meanwhile, Prof Kirwan and his estranged wife split on July 4, 2012, prompting a bitter divorce. Then . in August 2012, the surgeon was charged with attacking Chelsea and his . step daughter in an angry confrontation at their family home in . Connecticut, a six-bedroom, $5.9 million property complete with swimming pool. But he later turned himself in to police, and was arrested and placed in custody. He . was charged with third degree assault and disorderly conduct against . his alleged victims - Chelsea and her daughter Tailor, then 18, now 20. 'We share the same values': Cheryl Hines - pictured with Robert F Kennedy Jr at the Deer Valley Celebrity Skifest in Utah in December 2012 - spoke out about their  marriage, saying: 'It's fun to have a partner. It's a good match up.' Tragic: RFK Jr with his second wife, Mary Richardon, who killed herself in May 2012. The former couple are seen, left, at a dinner at the Ripple of Hope Gala in NYC in November 2010 - and, right, at the Deer Valley Celebrity Skifest in Utah in December 2008 . A . 'full protective order' was issued in the case, meaning Prof Kirwan was . temporarily banned from living under the same roof as any of his . children covered by the order. He was allowed contact with them, but only as part of a supervised visit. However, he was not allowed to get in touch with Chelsea after a 'no contact' order was put in place by the courts. In . August 2012, Prof Kirwan, who considers British TV host Ulrika Jonsson among his patients, told the Daily Mail that he had been . unfaithful to Chelsea, but said: ‘I admit that I’ve not acted like a . saint, but I never wanted my marriage to end.’ He . admitted that long absences took a toll on his first marriage to . Fenella, a half English-half Italian Oxford University graduate with whom he has four children – twin daughters now aged 30, another . daughter, 27, and a son, 25.  One of the twins is currently starring on . the Food Network. He is still on good terms with Fenella and all of the . children. Prof Kirwan divorced Fenella in 2000. By then he had met Chelsea when she attended his practice to have her skin blemishes treated. They wed in 2001 and have twins aged eleven, and an eight-year-old daughter, who has Down’s syndrome. Going strong: The actress has been dating Robert Kennedy Jr since 2012 and happily brought him along when she was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in January . Family home: The Kirwans shared this $5.9 million Connecticut home, where Chelsea Kirwan still lives . Admitting to indiscretions,Prof Kirwan nonetheless said: ‘I have the greatest respect for my wife and I . have tried hard to save my marriage. I still want to do everything . possible to work it out.’ There are now new attorneys working on the divorce case following a mistrial and Prof Kirwan and his wife have a court date in September of this year. In November, the charges will be dropped as he will have completed his two years probation, if he successfully adheres to the protection order and the guidelines set by the court. When reached by MailOnline, Prof Kirwan declined to comment, while Chelsea Kirwan Chapman declined to comment. Adore: Robert Kennedy Jr's kids are said to adore Cheryl Hines.

"The best friend of the alleged Vanderbilt gang-rape victim took the stand Wednesday to describe her then-roommate's distressing appearance the morning after the attack is said to have occurred. Four former Vanderbilt football players are currently on trial for raping a woman repeatedly while she was unconscious on June 23, 2013, including the victim's then-boyfriend Brandon Vandenburg. Lauren Miller went to a bar with the victim the night leading up to the attack, and told the court her reaction the next time she saw her friend the following morning. She says her roommate came back to their condo with a gash on her leg, looking ill and 'out of it'. 'My immediate reaction was ""Woah, what happened to you?""' Miller recalled. Scroll down for video . Shocking: The former roommate of the alleged Vanderbilt rape victim took the stand on Wednesday to describe what she looked like the morning after the attack . She said her roommate's makeup was a mess, she was missing a shoe and her hair was unkempt . 'So just from a physical standpoint, starting from top to bottom, her makeup was completely disheveled, the one thing I very clearly remember was the state of her hair. She had had it curled the night before and I remember being like, ""Did you go jump in a pool?""' She says she also found her roommate's black heel on the lawn outside their condo, and later overheard a voicemail  message left by Vandenburg which her friend played on speaker. 'I heard him talking to (the woman) and saying he had just gotten out of football meeting, and he was being accused of some very horrible things that he did not do,' Miller recalled. 'And he was telling (the woman) to not believe anything she heard.' The alleged victim has no memory of the attack. Vandenburg and former teammates Cory Batey, Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie and Brandon Banks face five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. Vandenburg faces an additional charge of tampering with evidence and unlawful photography.

Two other former Vanderbilt athletes took the stand as well on Wednesday to give their witness accounts of the event. Then Vanderbilt tennis player Michael Retta and football player Dillon Van Der Wal told the jury that they saw the victim lying outside of Vandenburg's room that morning but neither reported the incident to police at the time. They both gave conflicting reports about whether Vandenburg asked for help moving the girl to his bed. Retta says he saw the alleged victim naked in the morning hours of June 23, while Van Der Wall said he saw the woman with 'handprints on her buttocks'. He also described Vandenburg's emotions that morning, saying he was 'extremely fidgety,' 'not acting normal,' and pacing.

"Cottage owners who watched their 140-year-old homes pulled down because of a landslide have slammed a council after they were handed a £40,000 bill for the cost of the demolition. Five houses which overlooked the harbour in Whitby, North Yorkshire, had to be knocked down in December after flooding washed away the land beneath them. Nearby St Mary's church and its cliff-top . graveyard, which featured in Bram Stoker's Dracula, was also affected . by the landslides which caused human bones from the exposed graves to fall down the cliff into neighbour's gardens. In danger: The five houses in Whitby became unstable after flooding washed away the land beneath them . No time: Homeowners had just 30 minutes to grab their belongings before workers moved in to begin demolishing the houses . Gone: The five 140-year-old cottagers were torn down on Aelfleda Terrace in Whitby, north Yorkshire . Insult to injury: Residents have suffered further misery after they were asked to pay £40,000 by Scarborough Council for the demolition work . The heavy rain caused a gaping hole to . emerge at the front of the street and Scarborough Council ordered the . homes had to be demolished immediately. Jude Knight, 62, who had lived in her home for 26 years, said she had just 30 minutes to clear her house of possessions before fleeing the property. And now she has suffered further misery after the council handed her a £40,000 bill to cover the cost of the work. The retired training manager, who was the only permanent resident of Aefleda Terrace, said: 'I loved that house. Having to leave it so quickly was horrendous and such an emotional wrench. 'Now I feel as though things have been made even worse than they already were. 'The decision was made by Scarborough County Council to demolish the houses very quickly, within a matter of hours. 'They . did not feel they had time to test the foundations the houses stood on . even though there was not a crack in any of the cottages. Now . they have sent us this bill for £40,000.' Owners of the other properties, which were all holiday homes, have already been told their insurance company will pay out but Ms Knight is still waiting to find out if her insurer Saga will cover the bill. 'I am waiting. At the moment they have said they will accept payment of the value of the house,' she said. 'I . would guess my property was worth about £175,000. But if I am liable to . pay £40,000 then this could leave me in the unfortunate position of . being unable to afford a new home.' Raining bones: Nearby St Mary's church was also affected after human bones began falling down the cliff from graves which were exposed by the landslide . Eerie: Ancient graves were exposed at the church, which dates back to the 1100s, after heavy rain . Christopher Lee, left, starring as Dracula, the classic novel written by Bram Stoker, right . Contractors were called in to help retain . the cliffside below St Mary's, but the church has now been ordered to . pay £90,000 to stabilise it. Vicar Rev David Smith said the church is having to pay its own costs out of money earmarked to ensure the future of buildings including the Grade I listed St Mary's. He added: 'There is no help from central funding for parishes, we do this work without prejudice, but there are houses and businesses below and we need to get it done. 'If you live below a cliffside that has been moving since 1700 it is one of the things that can happen. 'This is money needed for repairs to our four churches.' Scarborough Borough Council said it used emergency powers to demolish homes in Aelfleda Terrace because of the instability of the site. A spokesperson said: 'In that respect as it was taxpayers' money we are obliged to recoup that cost and we have been negotiating with the home-owners and their insurance companies. 'Some insurers have already accepted liability and have paid out in full on the claim, including the cost of demolition. 'Some insurers have agreed that policy cover is in place including demolition cover and have requested further information. 'A small number of insurers have yet to confirm that policy cover is in place and we will continue to engage with these companies via the property owners over the coming weeks.' The council said it did not need to intervene with the churchyard and had simply acted to inform the church of its responsibilities.","Five homes in Whitby, North Yorkshire, knocked down after flooding .

"A high school in North Carolina has cancelled a play its theater students were set to perform because the show has a 'sexually explicit' gay scene. Maiden High School's principal called off the production of Almost, Maine because of the play's sexual overtones and innuendo - including a scene where two men declare their love for each other. But the playwright behind the critically-acclaimed show has hit out at the school, saying his production is about 'love, not sexual love'. Maiden High School, North Carolina, has cancelled its theater students' production of Almost, Maine because of a scene involving a gay couple . Maiden High School (pictured) principal Rob Bliss said the show had sexually explicit overtones and multiple sexual innuendos . The six-minute scene that has upset Maiden High School's principal and local churches involves two men discussing bad dates they have been on. The two men declare they have fallen in love which each other, fall to the ground and then the scene ends. There is no sexual contact between them. The play's student director Connie Baker told the Hickory Record that her class had worked for two weeks to get permission to perform the show and had been rehearsing for a week before they were told they had to cancel. She said they had already edited the script to make it appear as if the men were not about to have sex. 'We received approval from our principal and the school's superintendent to do this play. We also had to have every student's parent sign a permission slip before they could audition. We did this, auditioned everyone and started rehearsals,' Miss Baker said. Playwright John Cariani said the play was about 'love, not sexual love', as he called for the school to reverse their decision . 'Word had spread throughout the community that there were homosexual characters in our play. There were complaints from different churches and multiple parents of students.' The playwright behind the stage show, John Cariani, said he had contacted the school to try to find a solution but did not receive a reply. Mr Cariani said: 'I believe the play is about love, not sexual love. The scene with the two young men has no reference to sex at all. 'I just think there is a solution other than cancelling the production. I’ve reached out to the teacher who applied for rights to the play, but I haven’t heard back. 'I don’t think the students should have to suffer. They had already purchased the play and started rehearsing for it.' The students have launched a petition, calling on their school to reverse the decision. It has been signed by nearly 2,000 people in six days. Maiden High School principal Rob Bliss said: 'In regards to the request for students to perform the play Almost, Maine, careful review and consideration was given to the contents of this play. 'The play contained sexually explicit overtones and multiple sexual innuendos that are not aligned with our mission and educational objectives. 'As principal of Maiden High School, I have an obligation to ensure that all material, including drama performances, are appropriate and educationally sound for students of all ages. 'Our faculty and staff are still in review of potential performances to be conducted by our students this fall. At this time no final decision has been made regarding whether and what drama performances are to be presented this fall.' The school district’s superintendent Dan Brigman said the choice of play was up to individual principals.","Maiden High School calls off Almost, Maine play because of gay scene .

"Forget Captain Kirk and his Starship Enterprise. Buzz-off Buzz Lightyear. And Star Wars Jedi knight  Luke Skywalker can take a galactic hike too. Make way instead for the first real interplanetary spaceman superhero who arguably inspired them all - Britain’s home-grown, lantern-jawed pilot of the future Dan Dare. For today the firm most famous for its car-repair manuals is publishing the nuts-and-bolts inside track into the technology that propelled him through the solar system to worlds far beyond our own. Pilot of the future: Haynes has published a manual revealing the technology that propelled Dan Dare to worlds far beyond our own, inspiring legions of fans along the way . Haynes Publishing's 'Dan Dare Pilot of the Future - Space Fleet Operations Manual' is an engrossing labour of love from a team clearly devoted to the legacy of a hero who inspired a generation – in the hope that he may do so anew. It includes work from some of the original artists, as well as updated cutaways of space-craft, kit and weaponry that remain true to the original spirit. For a generation of post-war children - largely though not exclusively schoolboys - Dan Dare’s interplanetary adventures were a vibrant and exotic escape from the grey austerity and rationing that persisted long after global hostilities ended. From the moment the first Dan Dare strip blasted off in full colour on the front of the revolutionary new Eagle comic on Friday April 14, 1950 – priced at ‘3d’, or one and a half pence in  today’s currency - the future never looked brighter. It caused a sensation and sold nearly a million. The Anastasia: The new manual from Haynes gives an insight into the technology that powered Dan Dare's personal spacecraft, the Anastasia . Formidable flagship: The manual also focuses on the spacecraft used by rebel leader Tharl in the legendary Eagle comic . The Eagle comic was the brainchild of former RAF chaplain and parish vicar, the Rev. Marcus Morris,  who wanted to create a morally-uplifting but no less interesting comic for children which their parents wouldn’t frown on and ban. But it was artist Frank Hampson who created Dan Dare and assembled around him a team working at fever pitch in Epsom, Surrey, to script his stories, design his space-craft and gadgets and bring the character and his adventures to life. Hampson used family, friends and colleagues to pose up in costumes for photographs which formed the basis of the finished drawn strips. Legendary: The Eagle comic was a must-read for a generation of post-war children in Britain . But it wasn’t pure fantasy, with as much care taken with the science - as far as was known or hinted at at the time - as with the fiction. With hindsight there are some howlers, but most are forgivable and pale in significance to the majesty of the illustrations. Arthur C. Clarke, who would become the author of ‘2001, A Space Odyssey’ is said to have been a scientific advisor. Originally conceived as a space . chaplain complete with dog collar, Dan Dare emerged finally in print as . chief pilot for the Interplanet Space Fleet on an a somewhat idealised . planet Earth featuring a United Nations-inspired world government, glass . domed cities, and beautiful garden landscape. But there were also . problems. Dare’s first  mission was to Venus to find food for a starving . earth with a booming population explosion. Dare's exploits were serialised on Radio Luxembourg, which aired The New Adventures of Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future, five times a week for five years from July 1951. The . back story is no less fascinating. In this alternative modern history . of the known universe, it was Britain which won the space race, building . on Germany’s wartime V2 rocket programme to pip the U.S. to land the . first man on the Moon and plant the Union Flag on its lunar surface. Later the UK was part of a joint mission to Mars with the Americans, using three spacecraft called Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt  and Charles de Gaulle after the three allied leaders during the Second World War. As the uniforms suggest, the Space . Fleet is a thinly disguised but updated version of the RAF, with green . rather than blue colouring. Our . hero, Manchester-born and Cambridge-educated Colonel Daniel MacGregor . Dare, with his distinctive wiggly eyebrow, embodies the true Brit spirit . of heroism, fair play, and an inner moral strength – always willing to . give even his worst enemies a second chance.The . manual includes profiles of his closest friends and colleagues – alien . as well as human. Central among them are  - for the time a gender . stereotype-defying breakthrough – a smart, intelligent, brave and . resourceful scientific space-woman and nutritionist, Professor Jocelyn . Peabody, whose quick-thinking and fluency in alien languages ‘saves . lives'. And not . forgetting his loyal side-kick Digby, a down-to-earth father of four . from Wigan in Lancashire, who steadfastly refuses promotion to stay at . his friend’s side in space. Dan Dare manual author Rod Barzilay, . 66, admits to having been a fan since boyhood. In the small-print of . the acknowledgments he gives a salute to Sue, ‘my long suffering wife . who became a  Dan Dare widow for most of the time I was scribbling . away'.He says: ’Eagle . took the world of children’s publishing by storm. But the feature that . really  caught everyone’s attention, and was to inspire a whole . generation of future artists, writers and even scientists, was the Dan . Dare Pilot of the Future science-fiction strip. The Tempus Frangit: Dan Dare fans can immerse themselves in the space pilot's world once again thanks to the new manual . McHoo Asteroid Base: Dan Dare first blasted off on the front cover of the new Eagle comic in April 1950 . ‘It was superbly drawn and scripted and based on science facts of the time, with imaginative innovations thrown in for good measure. Hampson and his team realistically portrayed future equipment and inventions, kindling the imagination of its readers and encouraging a widespread hankering for space travel and interplanetary adventure’ Mr Barzilay went on: ’At the time post-war Britain was full of optimism for a better and brighter future. 'The Festival of Britain was being prepared, the aviation industry was about to steal a world lead with its Comet jet aircraft , and the country was entering upon a boom age which would prompt Prime Minister Harold Macmillan to famously state ‘our people have never had it so good'. ‘So to many of us space travel felt just around the corner and Hampson’s exciting ideas didn’t seem far-fetched at all’. Labour of love: The 66-year-old author of the manual, Ron Barzilay, has been a fan of Dan Dare, his loyal pal Digby and arch enemy The Mekon since he was a young boy . The Zylbat: The manual features pictures of the spacecraft used by Dan and his loyal sidekick, Digby, as they journeyed through galaxies . M.E.K.I Space Station: The superbly drawn comic was based on scientific facts as they were at the time . The manual looks at the characters . and technology. It includes cutaways and details of Dan Dare’s own . personal two-seater space-craft, the Anastasia, which was ‘designed and . built in 1997’ using alien technology as a special thank you gift. It has four different propulsion . systems including jet-power to fly, magnetic motors to hover, rocket . boosters and revolutionary ‘impulse drive’, similar to what would emerge . later in Star trek as ‘warp drive.’ Indeed . many technologies which appeared in Star Trek in the mid 1960s had . their first outing in Dan Dare more than a decade earlier. For example, . ‘Beam me up Scottie’ became a catch-phrase in the transporter room of . the Starship Enterprise. Dan fans: The new manual from Haynes, seen above left and right, looks at all the characters and technology that captivated Dan Dare fans in post-war Britain . But . the teleportation technology was seen as early as 1950 in Dan Dare . where it was called a ‘telesender’ - technology which scrambled and . unscrambled atoms to send people vast distances. Space hero: Dan Dare can count Monty Python's Michael Palin and Terry Jones, as well as musical maestro Sir Tim Rice among his fans . Hampson, who died in 1985 aged 66, . commented in later life that Star trek had ‘really cleaned out’ Dan . Dare’s technology cupboard of ideas. Dan . Dare’s arch enemy is the Mekon, the green-skinned, dome-headed but . small-bodied leader of the war-like Treens who inhabit Venus. The . manual notes: ’A Mekon takes 50 years to mature and lives for 300 . years. 'He moves around by means of a personal flying chair that has been . armoured against all known hand weapons. It goes on: ‘He is ruthless in his . dealings with those  who fail him, destroying any who don’t deliver and . has proved very elusive when things go against him. A number of times he . has been presumed dead, only to resurface again.’ Dan Dare inspired a legion of avid . fans including Monty Python’s Michael Palin and Terry Jones, who said: . ’The combination of fantasy and humour, for me, was irresistible. I was . hooked. It was pure genius.’ And . musical maestro and song lyricist Sir Tim Rice, who had copies of the . Eagle shipped over to him while a child living in Japan in the 1950s, . said: ‘Dan remains an human and likeable character, an emblem of the . optimism, straight-forward and culturally confident Britain of the 1950s . which lives on in Dan Dare’s future, but sadly never made it in ours.’ As . author Rod Barzilay concludes: ’Dan’s story has now become the future . of an exciting parallel universe rather than our own. 'It nevertheless . remains a fascinating place to be explored.’ Dan Dare's original home the Eagle was published from 1950 to 1969, before being relaunched in a new format from 1982 to 1994. The . space hero has also appeared in Revolver and the Planet, and was at the . centre of a seven-issue mini-series published by Virgin Comics in 2008. The strip has also appeared in Spaceship Away magazine, which was launched in 2003 and continues today.","A new manual revales technology behind the spacecraft used by legendary comic book hero Dan Dare .

"Heartless vandals have destroyed a Second World War memorial just days before Britain honours its heroes on Remembrance Sunday. The sick thieves stole a plaque bearing the names of those who died fighting in the Second World War from a war memorial in Brentwood, Essex. The shocking theft comes shortly before veterans and the public are set to parade through the town on November 11. Heartless theft: Vandals took a metal plate which honoured British war dead . John Woolmore, 74, who is chairman of the Brentwood branch of the Royal British Legion, slammed the thieves for causing ‘immeasurable sentimental damage’ to proud families of fallen soldiers in the town. Mr Woolmore’s father, Francis Joseph Woolmore, who died in 1944 serving his country in the Second World War, is remembered on one of the seven remaining plaques at the memorial. He said: 'This memorial means everything to me and many other families - especially at this time of year. 'I can’t believe that these thieves wouldn’t have known that the plaque contained the names of those who have given their lives for their country. 'This is all our fallen heroes have to be remembered by. 'I hope these thieves understand they have caused immeasurable sentimental damage just to earn a few quid for scrap metal. 'I can’t believe how people can be such idiots.' Shocked: Chairman of the Brentwood branch of the Royal British Legion, John Woolmore was unhappy . The theft comes less than eight months after vandals destroyed a memorial in neighbouring Warley, Essex, honouring nine brave soldiers from Royal Anglian Regiment who died whilst serving in Afghanistan five years ago. Brentwood Borough Council officials are now in a race against time to install a new plaque in time for Remembrance Sunday on November 11. Councillor Louise McKinlay, leader of Brentwood Borough Council, said: 'I am appalled by the theft of one of the panels at the Brentwood War Memorial. 'I condemn the callous behaviour of whoever is responsible for ripping down this panel listing the names of the fallen to make themselves a few pounds. 'Anyone with information should contact the police straightaway. 'We have photos of all the panels and we will be trying as hard as we can to get the stolen panel replaced before the Remembrance Day parade. 'I have also instructed officers to make sure the panels are as secure as they can be.' Local councillor Russell Quirk added: 'It is absolutely disgusting and, coming up to Remembrance Day, the timing could not be more inappropriate. 'This is the ultimate disrespect for what - £30? What is it that drives these people to desecrate memorials? 'What is it that drives these people to want to make a quick buck out of the war dead? It’s baffling.' Police believe thieves ripped the metal plaque off the stone memorial sometime between Thursday, 18 and Friday, October 26. The theft was not reported to the council and police until Tuesday. The memorial contains 16 plaques honouring soldiers who died serving their country in the First and Second World War. An Essex Police spokesperson said: 'If anybody has any information, or saw anything suspicious then please call police at Brentwood on 101.'","Taking the plaque caused 'immeasurable sentimental damage' to families in Brentwood, Essex .

"For the brave pilots, it was not some corner of a foreign field that became their final resting place - rather the very heartland of England.

The RAF removed or buried much of the debris from early crash sites. But as the war lengthened many plane wrecks were left to corrode on the rocks and remote peat bogs where they lay. Over the years many parts have been removed - some by the authorities others by trophy-hunters. Other pieces, often scattered over large areas, have been collected and gathered together into makeshift memorials resembling aluminium cairns that are decorated with crosses, wreaths and poppies. Eleven years ago Alan Clark, 29, began visiting, documenting and researching the crash sites. Mr Clark said: 'My grandfather flew in the war and he was really interested in the research I was doing - he'd never spoken about the war to anyone but began to talk to me about it.

Mr Clark, along with two friends, scours libraries and records offices across Britain, looking for details on the crashes and the aircrew.

Many of these training flights ended in disaster when crews became lost and disorientated. Damaged aircraft also crashed returning from bombing missions over Germany and France. Nineteen forties aircraft cruised much lower than modern aircraft so it was all-too easy to fly a little too low and into the path of high hill-tops and mountains.

"A man with a 17-hour erection had to have three pints of drained from his penis to relieve the problem. Jason Garnett, 23, described the situation as 'pure agony' and said he could only watch in horror as a doctor stabbed a cannula into the side of his manhood. He was diagnosed with a condition known as priapism - caused by a blockage of the blood vessels that empty the penis. Doctors told him they would have to draw off blood to reduce the pressure. Scroll down for video . Jason Garnett, 23, could only watch in horror as a doctor stabbed a cannula into the side of his penis . 'Seeing them stab my penis with a needle was horrible - like something out of a horror film,' said Mr Garner, a hotel worker from Harrogate, North Yorkshire. 'They were injecting me with adrenalin - and had to do it 24 times.' Doctors had warned that if the injections failed to work, they would have to operate. The incident occurred last week after he spent the drinking heavily before sleeping with a female friend - and not taking Viagra, he insists. 'I got home went to sleep for a bit,' he told MailOnline. 'I woke up at 9am and it was there, but lots of guys have that in the morning.' But by midday, the began to get concerned. 'It started to get really sore, and I looked on the internet to see what it could be. 'I tried putting an ice pack on it, sitting in a bath with some ice and even went for a run around the block with it tucked into my belt.' While he could urinate, he admits it was quite difficult. By late afternoon, the pain was unbearable and he got his house mate to drive him to hospital. 'At first, he was in hysterics, but then realised how serious it was,' he said. Priapism usually affects men but in rare cases, can affect women too. The condition is where a penis or clitoris becomes engorged with blood, causing a painful, long-lasting erection. It is caused by a blockage of the blood vessels that empty the penis. Also, a number of medications can sometimes disrupt the normal workings of the nerves that help trigger an erection by widening the arteries in the penis. The nerves essentially ‘forget’ to narrow the arteries after the feelings of sexual arousal have passed, leading to priapism. Those that have been linked to priapism include anti-depressants, erectile dysfunction medication and some recreational drugs. 'I was in so much pain when I arrived at the desk that I can't remember exactly what I said - but I made the staff laugh,' he recalled. Two hours later, a urologist arrived from another hospital to treat him. 'He warned me he would have to draw the blood out by stabbing the side of my penis with a cannula. 'At that point I thought ""just hurry up"" - it really, really, really, really hurt.' The doctor drained two pints of blood - and the remainder was left to drip out onto an absorbent pad. 'I think in total there was about three-and-a-half pints that came out,' said Mr Garnett. 'The urologist said he had never seen anything like it.' Even after the blood had been drained, the erection remained.  It was only at 2am that the problem subsided - after 24 injections. Such was the extent of his blood loss and the effect on his blood pressure of the adrenalin injections, Mr Garnett had to spend Friday to Monday in hospital. Fortunately, he has been reassured there will be no long-term damage. But doctors can't rule out the problem occurring again. 'I'm not worried about it, though,' said Mr Garnett. 'The girls will love it.' Due to the amount of blood he lost, and the effect of the adrenaline shots on his body, Mr Garnett had to stay in hospital for three nights .

The building attracted 80,000 visitors . last year alone - and brought in £6m ($10m) in revenue, but tourism . officials believe this figure can be boosted considerably with the right enhancements. Interior photograph of a cell in the Ohio State Reformatory which was officially opened in September 1896 . A multitude of scenes were filmed in the vicinity of the Ohio State Reformatory and now fans can visit the site . The society has already raised more than £1.2m ($2m) which was used to repair the reformatory roof, and its new plans include heating some sections of the reformatory which have not been heated for decades, and opening up additional areas to the public. Stained glass windows which were vandalised have also been removed for repair. A significant boost in tourism will safeguard the future of the Reformatory for generations to come say its supporters. Last week thousands of Shawshank fans . gathered at the reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio, to celebrate the 20th . anniversary of the film which has now achieved cult status. Celebrations . included re-enactments of scenes from the film while the renovated guard . room played host to a 1940s themed cocktail party. Morgan Freeman played the character of Red in the much loved film which has increased visitors to Mansfield . The inmates of the fictional Shawshank State Prison work outside Ohio State Reformatory during filming . The Shawshank Redemption was a slow burner to begin with. Filmed in 1993, it received encouraging reviews from critics but failed to attract large audiences. In fact the British Video Association said the film earned a meagre £2.6m at UK cinemas and only just covered its costs from US box office sales. But once released on home video and later on DVD the film captured the imagination of movie fans worldwide. Earlier this year it was named by renowned film magazine Empire as the fourth best movie of all time. Tourists and fans became increasingly keen to visit the historic building in Mansfield as a result of the film's growing success, and the building was given a new lease of life. The Shawshank Redemption bus tour includes a visit to  some of the film's most renowned locations. Shawshank fans can visit the Bissman building where Brooks (James Whitmore) hanged himself and Red decided to 'get busy living', and see the bench where Brooks fed his birds. Visitors to the building in Mansfield, Ohio can see the bench where Brooks (James Whitmore) fed the birds . Tim Robbins (Andy Dufresne) shares a scene with Morgan Freeman (Red) outside the reformatory . Other recognisable locations include the remains of the old oak tree where Andy hid money for Red and Malabar Farm State Park where Andy followed his cheating wife. The Mansfield Reformatory Preservation Society has worked hard on marketing the reformatory in recent years and has put on events including a huge Halloween festival,extreme ghost hunts and murder mystery dinners. Thousands of people have come to pay homage to what many people believe is one of the greatest films of all time and the legacy of the Oscar nominated movie should ensure that visitors continue to flock to Mansfield for years to come. However, tourists seeking the authentic 'Shawshank' experience should be careful to ensure cell doors don't close behind them. 'We don’t have keys for some of these,' one of the tour guides revealed. 'They might be in there until the next day.'","Special events held in Ohio to celebrate the film's 20th anniversary .

"CVS has finally kicked the habit and dropped cigarettes from its stores. The pharmacy is attempting become more health conscious and is sharpening its focus on customer health. The nation's second-largest drugstore chain will stop the sale of tobacco nearly a month sooner than planned. CVS Caremark said it will now be known as CVS Health, effective immediately. The signs on its roughly 7,700 drugstores won't change, so the tweak may not register with shoppers. Scroll down for video . A change in health: Rhode Island-based CVS Caremark will now be known as CVS Health, and stores will stop the sale of tobacco nearly a month sooner than planned . Kicking the habit: CVS announced plans Wednesday that it has pulled all remaining cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco and other tobacco products from each of its 7,700 pharmacies nationwide . Bright ideas: CVS Health President and CEO Larry J. Merlo gives an interview on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange about the decision stop selling all tobacco products . However, those customers will see a big change when they check out. The cigars and cigarettes that used to fill the shelves behind store cash registers have been replaced with nicotine gum and other products that help people kick the tobacco habit. CVS said earlier this year that it would stop selling tobacco products on October 1. CVS and other drugstores have delved deeper into customer health care in recent years, in part to serve the aging Baby Boom generation and the millions of uninsured people who are expected to gain coverage under the federal health care overhaul. They've built hundreds of walk-in clinics in their stores and have steadily expanded the services they provide. Change for the better: The cigars and cigarettes that used to fill the shelves behind store cash registers have been replaced with nicotine gum and other products that help people kick the tobacco habit . The move to go tobacco-free, carries a substantial risk to CVS' bottom line, but it holds the potential for a long-term competitive advantage over its peers, particularly Walgreens, , the nation's largest pharmacy retailer . Drugstores now offer an array of vaccinations and flu shots, and their clinics can help monitor chronic illnesses like diabetes or high blood pressure. CVS said its new name reflects its broader commitment to health care. 'We're doing more and more to extend the front lines of health care,' CEO Larry Merlo said. As part of this push, the drugstore chain announced earlier this year that it would phase out tobacco sales. The company said it could no longer sell tobacco in a setting where health care is delivered, and the presence of that product was hard to justify when it tried teaming up with hospital groups and doctors to help with patient care. Merlo said the company moved up its quit date nearly a month because they got ready for the move sooner than they anticipated, not because its distribution centers had already run out of tobacco. Rebrand: The company, long known as CVS Caremark Corp., announced plans to rebrand as CVS Health, a clear nod to the broader role it hopes to play in the health care market . The corporate name change represents an improvement because the average person didn't understand the word Caremark, which represents the company's pharmacy benefits management business, said Laura Ries, president of the brand consulting firm Ries & Ries. The new name may provide a better sense of what CVS does to the few investors or people on Wall Street who don't know about the company, which is ranked 12th in the 2014 Fortune 500. But Ries said the name's power is limited because health is a generic word that is common in many company names. 'It's an improvement off of Caremark, but it's not some amazing wonderful thing that will change the world,' she said.","CVS Caremark plans to stop selling tobacco products in all of its stores starting Wednesday .
Health experts hope the move will be followed by other major drugstore chains .
CVS announced in February that it planned to drop tobacco by October 1 as the sales conflicted with its health care mission.

"Rosemary Batty, the mother of 11-year-old boy Luke Batty who was beaten to death by his father in February, has dedicated her Victorian Australian of the Year Award to her tragic son. Ms Batty said her son Luke would be proud and a little embarrassed by his mum receiving the Victorian Australian of the Year Award for Domestic Violence Campaigner. 'As an 11, 12-year-old boy, he would be embarrassed and say `mum it's not a good look' ... it's not X Factor or Australian Idol,' she said in a lighter moment after receiving the award. Scroll down for video . Rosemary Batty, the mother of 11-year-old boy Luke Batty who was beaten to death by his father in February, has dedicated her Victorian Australian of the Year Award to her tragic son . While the young boy might have been uncomfortable seeing his mother on stage, she was a popular winner at a reception in Melbourne on Tuesday night, judging by the standing ovation and minute-long applause she received when her name was announced. Speaking of her son, the bereaved mother became emotional. 'I am here because of Luke,' she said. Ms Batty has put the fight against domestic violence on the national agenda since her ex-partner killed their son in broad daylight on a cricket pitch. Ms Batty has put the fight against domestic violence on the national agenda since her ex-partner killed their son in broad daylight on a cricket pitch . Ms Batty said her son Luke would be proud and a little embarrassed by his mum receiving the Victorian Australian of the Year Award for Domestic Violence Campaigner . She also firmly voiced commitment to speak up for victims of domestic violence. 'It's important that we understand it's no longer a subject that should stay behind closed doors,' she said. 'My commitment is I will continue to push this message and I accept this award on behalf of victims of domestic violence and for those who have no voice.' The British woman explained that one in every three women is affected by domestic violence. Ms Batty has vigorously campaigned against domestic violence since her son was tragically killed by his deranged father, Greg Anderson, 54, with a cricket bat and knife, at Tyabb oval on February 12. An ongoing inquest into the murder has recently revealed that four police officers missed the opportunity to detain Anderson two weeks before he murdered his son because they were unaware of warrants for his arrest, due to an incompetent police data system. An ongoing inquest into the murder has recently revealed that four police officers missed the opportunity to detain Anderson two weeks before he murdered his son because they were unaware of warrants for his arrest, due to an incompetent police data system . Police sent four officers to Anderson's address on January 27, just weeks before Luke's death, as they knew of his violent reputation. According to Ms Batty's lawyer, the officers who conducted the relevant background check on Anderson 'found no record' of outstanding warrants. They were serving an intervention order taken out by Anderson's housemate. Police Chief Commissioner Ken Lay said in February that the IT system failure was just one piece of a complicated case and there was no way of knowing if Anderson would have been held in custody or immediately bailed if he had been arrested before the murder. The inquest also heard that the Department of Human Services closed its child protection file on Luke four months before he was murdered. Ms Batty told of inquest police said they couldn't help her if her former partner tried to kill her and Luke . In a harrowing testimony, Rosie Batty revealed she and her son were terrified of Greg Anderson, Luke's father. We locked the doors... we had a baseball bat in one bedroom, we had a baseball bat in another bedroom,' Ms Batty said in court, the ABC reported. 'This is what I was living with. The police were telling me we can't be there in time if he wants to kill you... perhaps you should consider moving back to England.' Ms Batty also feared Anderson may have been contemplating killing their child in a murder suicide but believed the 11-year-old would be safe in public places. She said she started to believe Mr Anderson could pose a physical risk to their son when he showed Luke a knife and told him 'this could be the one to end it all' Ms Batty said she started believing Greg Anderson could pose a physical risk to their son when he showed Luke Batty a knife and told him 'this could be the one to end it all'. But she believed he would be safe with his father so long as they were in public areas like the football or cricket oval. 'I didn't know if Greg was referring to his own suicide tendencies or if he would like to have a joint suicide,' she told the Victorian Coroners Court. 'That image of him harming him (Luke) couldn't happen in a public place. 'It couldn't happen at the Tyabb oval but it bloody did.' Luke died after Mr Anderson struck him with a cricket bat and attacked him with a knife. An eight-year-old boy, who was at the oval at the time of the attack, saw Mr Anderson raise the bat over his right shoulder but did not see it connect with Luke. He ran and told his father, who called paramedics. When emergency services workers arrived they saw Mr Anderson kneeling by Luke. At first they thought he was helping him, the inquest heard. When ambulance workers tried to approach Luke, Mr Anderson said 'he's in heaven now'. Rosie Batty, whose son Luke Batty was killed by his father Greg Anderson in February, outside the inquest into Luke's death on Tuesday . Luke's mother, Rosie Batty, said she wanted her son to have a normal relationship with his father. 'For me it's really important a child should know his father,' she told the inquest. 'Greg was really loving and keen to be involved in Luke's life. 'But I said to myself this is a journey, I'll keep doing things that feel right until they didn't feel right anymore.' Ms Batty said she changed her mind in April 2013 when Luke revealed his father had shown him a knife while Anderson prayed in his car. 'I was so alarmed I knew I could no longer support his relationship with his father,' Ms Batty said. Greg Anderson was '100 per cent bad' and always likely to kill his son, according to a police officer who says his efforts to have him locked up were undone by the courts . Ms Batty blocked Anderson from having any access to his son in April 2013. Counsel assisting the inquest, Rachel Ellyard, said the order was changed again in July 2013 to allow Mr Anderson access to Luke at football and cricket matches on the weekend. Ms Ellyard said Mr Anderson was technically in breach of that order by seeing Luke at cricket training on a weekday. Ms Batty said when she saw Mr Anderson at the cricket oval on the night of Luke's death it occurred to her to call the police, but she decided not to. She said she had previously had unpleasant situations trying to get the police involved at the cricket club and didn't want to embarrass Luke in front of his friends. Anderson, 54, was shot  by police after he lunged at emergency service at the oval where he brutally bludgeoned his son. He died in hospital from gunshot wounds and self-inflicted knife wounds.","Rosie Batty has been awarded the Victorian Australian of the Year for her work as a domestic abuse campaigner .

"Everyone knows that Olympic success is the reward for a monastic life of self-denial, early nights and relentless training. But even the most dedicated young sports heroes have an inner tiger just roaring to get out .  .  . as anyone who witnessed Bradley Wiggins celebrating his Sports Personality of the Year victory with his electric guitar could attest. New Year’s Eve is just the occasion to let your hair down, when even the steeliest self-discipline can dissolve.

In real life, of course, some of the sporting heroes could hardly wait until the Games ended. The vamp of the velodrome, Victoria Pendleton, renounced Lycra for sequins almost as soon as the Olympic flame flickered its last, quickly signing up for Strictly Come Dancing. Teenage diving sensation Tom Daley’s trunks were barely dry before he agreed  to host ITV’s new celebrity diving show Splash! Meanwhile he’s been enjoying the things he missed out on during those years of dedication; he’s even appeared in pantomime, making a guest appearance alongside Christopher Biggins in his home town of Plymouth. And who would be surprised if fun-loving Zara Phillips – part of the silver-medal- winning eventing team – ended up drinking champagne in the straw, rather than through a straw, on New Year’s Eve? Meanwhile, for Mo Farah real life has become even more punishing than his training regime. It was an emotional sight when he embraced his pregnant wife Tania as applause echoed round the Olympic  Stadium – but now he has to live with the arduous reality of four-month-old twin daughters Aisha and Amani keeping him awake at night. lFor more lookalike photographs, visit alisonjackson.com.

"Some museums have to trap treasures behind dusty glass to protect them, which obscures many of the most interesting and intricate details. But a new invention could give them a fresh lease of life. Scientists have developed interactive semi-transparent mirrors that allow people to ‘touch’ objects using the reflection of their fingers. Scroll down for video . Scientists have developed interactive semi-transparent mirrors that allow people to ‘touch’ exhibits in museums that are behind glass, using the reflection of their fingers, to reveal information and manipulate inaccessible objects (pictured) By tracking the movement of their hands, the mirrors use augmented reality to let visitors pick up and rotate the virtual objects - and reveal more information about certain items. To create the technology, computer scientists from the University of Bristol created a setup that involved sensors, projectors and semi-transparent mirrors placed in front of a pane of glass.

The researchers have unveiled their study at the ACM UIST conference in Honolulu, Hawaii. They claim their device could change the way people interact in public spaces, such as museums and shops. In a museum, people in front of a cabinet would see the reflection of their fingers inside the glass case overlapping the same point behind the glass, allowing them to seemingly reach around objects.

By combining the mirror with a projector, people’s fingertips could act like little torches to illuminate the objects they point at. When the reflection of someone’s hand cuts though the object, the projections on visitors’ hands could also reveal the inside of an object on display. They could use their finger as a cursor to rotate a 3D reconstruction of an object too. Lead researcher Dr Diego Martinez told MailOnline that the technology uses the space behind and in front of the reflective surface to add augmentations. 'For instance, in the museum cabinet, the top projector allows you to do projection mapping, changing the external aspect of the object. 'However, it would never be able to reveal its internals. Using our approach, your hand's reflection can cut through the object.If we project on your hand as it cuts though, this will be visible inside the object.'

One example is when people can’t access a shop because it’s closed. 'However, their reflection would be visible inside the shop window and that would enable them to try clothes on using their reflection, pay for the item using a debit/credit card and then have it delivered to their home. ‘The possibility to blend together the spaces in front and behind the semi-transparent mirror could mean a whole new type of interactive experience. ‘While projectors can only augment the surface of objects, combining them with reflections allows people to reveal what’s inside the object or even purely virtual objects floating around them.

"Twice the legal limit: Mitchell Todd was not wearing a seatbelt and surrounded by empty wine bottles and beer cans when he crashed his car . An international rugby player, twice the legal drinking limit, was not wearing a seatbelt when he crashed and died following a drinking session at his rugby club, an inquest heard today. Former Scotland under-20 international and Nottingham Rugby Club player Mitchell Todd, 21, was found in his Citroen C3, surrounded by empty wine bottles and beer cans, in a field near Normanton-on-the-Wolds in south Nottinghamshire last August by a member of the public. A post-mortem examination confirmed Todd, who represented Scotland under 20s in last season's Six Nations and featured in the Junior World Cup, died as a result of a catastrophic brain injury which he could not have survived, the inquest at Nottingham Town Hall heard today. Todd had drunk excessively after an all-day training event with Nottingham Rugby Club at Trent College in Long Eaton, Nottinghamshire, on August 14 last year before being found in his car in the early hours of the following morning, assistant deputy coroner Jane Gillespie heard. His blood-alcohol reading was 172mg of . alcohol per 100mls of blood an inquest into his death heard today. The . legal driving limit is 80mg. Detective constable Mark Henshaw, from Nottinghamshire Police, told the inquest the young player, who was described by his club as an ‘exceptional talent’, drank free wine and beer at a meal at the end of the training event at the college. He then got a taxi into Nottingham city centre where he continued to drink beer and spirits with his team mates until 2am. The rugby club had warned players not to drive after the event at the college but an intoxicated Todd ignored this advice and returned to his car. The officer told the inquest it was not known why Todd, who lived in Nod Rise, Coventry, had been driving on Cotgrave Road as he knew no one in that area. Residents in the area described hearing a loud thud around 3.15am on August 15 and seeing a small, dark coloured vehicle travelling at speed to the police. Todd's mother Delia Todd wiped tears from her eyes as Pc Robert Lloyd, a forensics collision investigator with Nottinghamshire Police, described the moments before the crash that claimed her son's life. The officer told the hearing the . Citroen had been travelling in excess of the 40mph speed limit when Todd . lost control of his vehicle on a left hand bend. He then drove on the wrong side of . the road, clipping road signs and trees as he careered across grass . verges and kerbs before failing to take a right hand bend and crashing . through a fence and hedge into a field, Pc Lloyd told the inquest. Talent: Todd, a former Scotland under-20 international and Nottingham Rugby Club (pictured), had drunk excessively after an all-day training event with the Trent College before the crash . An inquest was opened and adjourned . for further investigation by police last summer after the car was found . lying on its roof in the field, pointing towards the road. Pc Lloyd told the hearing the car was found to have no defects but that Todd had not been wearing his seat belt. The officer said: ‘If he had been . wearing his seat belt I think there would have been a very great . difference to the outcome. He would have been shaken up but not have . sustained the serious injuries which he did.’ He confirmed no other vehicles had been involved in the incident and that Todd had been travelling alone in the car. Pc Lloyd said: ‘In my opinion the . cause of the crash was travelling too fast around a left hand bend while . the driver was intoxicated. The state of his injuries were compounded . by the lack of a seat belt.’ Summing up the evidence, Miss . Gillespie described Todd, who was born in Solihull and had just finished . a degree in sports therapy at Coventry University, as a rugby player . with a promising career in front of him. Recording a verdict of accidental . death, the coroner said: ‘This is a sad, unnecessary and preventable . waste of a talented young life and I very much hope that valuable . lessons are learnt as a result of this tragedy. ‘I find that the combination of . intoxication, excess speed and Mitchell's failure to wear a seatbelt . resulted in this terrible incident and the catastrophic brain injury . suffered by Mitchell, which he simply could not survive. Tragedy: Mitchell Todd was rushed to Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, but died of a massive brain injury . ‘Taking into account all of the evidence available to me, my verdict is one of accidental death. ‘I extend my deepest sympathies to Mitchell's family and friends.’ Ms Todd made no comment following the verdict. Nottingham Rugby chief executive . Simon Beatham said: ‘Everyone at Nottingham Rugby continues to mourn the . death of an exceptionally talented young man. ‘The loss of Mitchell touched this club profoundly and our hearts, thoughts and sympathies are with all his family and friends.’ Todd signed a new contract with the . club in May and was expected to make a big impact during the 2012-2013 . season, the club added. He qualified for Scotland through his . Edinburgh-born father and had also represented Scottish Exiles from . under-17 to under-20 level. He won 10 Scotland under-20 caps and played . in the IRB Junior World Championship. Rob Brierley, the Scottish Rugby . Union's performance development manager for Exiles, said: ‘Mitch was a . quiet, sensitive bloke with a real steely determination never more . evident than on the rugby pitch. ‘He was a real athlete, somebody who was late to the game and was developing all the time.’ The Scottish Rugby Union added: ‘Scottish Rugby extends its sincere condolences to all Mitchell Todd's family and friends.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Mitchell Todd, 21, was twice the legal drinking limit at the time of the crash .

"It's comforting, homely and – to almost all of us – undeniably delicious. But the smell of freshly baked bread may have positive effects far beyond the obvious ones. Researchers believe it may also make us kinder to strangers. The smell of freshly baked bread may have positive effects, including making us nicer to strangers . They found that shoppers were more likely to alert a passer-by that they had dropped a belonging if, at the time, they were also passing near a bakery giving off the mouth-watering aroma. Their findings, published in the Journal of Social Psychology, suggest certain smells trigger a positive mood that leads to a greater degree of altruism, or unconditional concern for the welfare of others. Numerous studies have already shown how pleasant smells can make us feel happier. But the psychologists behind the latest experiment wanted to see whether this translates into something more tangible, such as a more considerate attitude towards strangers. Scientists discovered certain smells trigger a positive mood . The experts, at the University of Southern Brittany in France, recruited eight young men and women volunteers and told them to stand outside either a bakery or a clothes boutique. The volunteers pretended to be looking for something in their bags as they stepped in front of a passing shopper. As they walked a few feet in front of the shopper, the participants dropped a glove, handkerchief or packet of tissues. Two observers stood about 60ft away. The experiments – which were repeated up to 400 times – found that when the volunteers dropped the items outside the bakery, 77 per cent of passers-by stopped and helped recover the lost items and hand them back to their owner. Outside the clothes shop only 52 per cent of strangers helped. Reporting on their findings, the researchers suggested other smells widely regarded as pleasant would trigger similarly benevolent behaviour. ‘Our results show that, in general, spontaneous help is offered more in areas where pleasant ambient smells are spread,’ they said. 'This experiment confirms the role of ambient food odours on altruism.’","French researchers found 'spontaneous help was triggered by pleasant ambient smells'

"Do you often get the feeling of déjà vu, possibly feeling like your days are becoming a little samey? Well this could be down to your daily routine, a new survey has revealed. Three quarters of us Brits stick to a strict daily ritual, from having the same things for breakfast every day to going to bed at the same time and even staying loyal to a particular mug. Research shows that many of us have become set in our ways and are reluctant to change our daily habits - however this fear of leaving our comfort zone has left us feeling trapped. Many Brits feel as though their lives are like Groundhog day with many of us sticking to the same routine, such as going to bed and waking up at the same time . Many of us admit to buying the same brands of food and drink, as well as frequenting the same restaurants and we are devoted to certain shops and supermarkets. Researchers also found that our . hairstyle is the thing we are least likely to change, with one in . five admitting they've had the same hairstyle for a decade. Three in ten of us even went as far to admit that we have become so comfortable in our routine that we are left feeling 'scared' to try new things. This comes from a study carried out to mark the launch of Clipper Teas campaign, that encorages us to try a new brew. However it seems that many of us will be sticking to our old bags as ten per cent of Brits claim they've stuck to one brand their whole lives. Life Coach Amanda Brown, says our refusal to change is to do with our sense of security. 'We stick with what we know for a number of reasons: it's easy, we feel safe and secure, or we simply don't imagine anything different to what we already have. 'Change is a word that seems to strike fear in people when actually change is a really positive thing.' Some of us have even become loyal to a breakfast cereal . However, it seems we're much more at . ease with making big life-changing decisions, with the results of Clipper's research showing . Brits are twice as likely to have dumped their partner in the last ten . years as they are to have changed their brand of tea bag. And while a fifth of respondents have changed jobs in the last ten years, just one in ten have given a new moisturiser a go. 'We find big changes in life easier to tackle than small changes because we approach them in different ways' says Amanda. 'Big . changes are often the result of us wanting something different, a new . job, house, car or a relationship. We find it easier to change things if . we don't like something because we can see pleasure in the change.' Despite many of us finding it tricky to . transform our routines, it seems that many of us are not satisfied with . our repetitive lifestyles. The study from Clipper tea showed that 74 per cent feel like every day is Groundhog Day, with nine in ten adults saying they often follow the same routines every single day. Eight in ten believe they . would actually benefit from making small changes to their everyday life, . with three quarters wishing they could find a way to escape their . comfort zone. Just under half the respondents said that they liked sticking with what they know but 32 per cent were worried about what might happen if they decided to mix things up a bit. Amanda added that although we find it hard . to change smaller things in our lives it is often a good idea as it can . build our confidence. 'When . we change tiny things such as a shade of lipstick or our brand of tea . we send positive messages to the brain that we can make change happen . every day, which builds our confidence. 'Trying . something new doesn't mean we lose the comfort zone, it just means . we've giving something a go, and it's only by trying it first that we . can decide if we like it or not.' As well as our day-to-day routine, many of us have gone as far as to become stuck on repeat with our holiday choices. Monarch . airlines found that we tend to stick with where we know with eight in . ten Brits having returned to a holiday destination twice or more. The most common reasons behind the repetitive getaways are weather, food and the length of flight, while others said they enjoyed being on first name terms with staff and local people. And one in seven said they return to the same resort time after time because they like its family friendly element and the fact it caters well for children. Many families return to the same resorts because they feel restricted by their budget . It also emerged that Spain, The Canary Islands and France are the destinations we are most likely to return to. Andrew Swaffield, Managing Director of Monarch Airlines who commissioned the study, said: . 'It's easy to return to the same holiday destination year after year. 'If you know your way around and know what to expect then it does make things more straight forward. 'And the research shows that Brits like a familiar face and look forward to catching up with local proprietors each year.' It sometimes even comes down to traveling the same week or fortnight of the year, every year. Andrew went on to say that we even have routines once we're away. 'Knowing . where to eat, how much money to take and knowing that young children . will be entertained are all plus points to returning to the same resort.' He . says that although it may be easier to stick with what you know it is . also important to try something new every once in a while. 'It's important not to get stuck in a holiday rut and not broaden your horizons.' Many of the repeat visitors claimed that their price range kept them in stuck in the same holiday destination.","A new survey reveals that many of us are reluctant to change .

"A baby girl who was born after just 25 weeks of pregnancy weighing only 1lb 11oz is set to make it home to her family in time for Christmas. Skylar Primrose Knight has spent the last eight months in hospital fighting for her life. Now, she is to be allowed to go home to celebrate her first Christmas with her parents, Caroline and Richard, and siblings Som, 10, and Summer, five. Skylar Primrose Knight (pictured with her parents, Richard and Caroline) was born at just 25 weeks and only weighed 1lb 11oz. She was given just a 30 per cent chance of survival . Mrs Knight, 37, of South Walsham, Norfolk, said: ’When she’s well she is a really happy and content little baby. ‘When you see her smile, it just melts you.’ She added: ‘It will be lovely to have her back home for Christmas.’ Skylar arrived in April, tipping the scales at less than the weight of a bag of sugar. Ever since her birth, she has been battling to survive at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit. The family had been expecting to welcome their third baby into the world on July 26. Skylar (pictured shortly after her birth) has battled infections and lung disease and required numerous blood transfusions but is now set to be released from hospital in time for Christmas . But halfway through Mrs Knight’s pregnancy, her waters broke. She went to the doctor and within days it was clear the baby was on the way. She was forced to spend five days at Luton and Dunstable Hospital in Bedfordshire before a bed was found at Norfolk and Norwich Hospital. Skylar was born on April 13 and her long battle for survival began. Offshore oil worker Mr Knight, 38, said: ‘We were told there was a 30 per cent chance of survival and of that 30 per cent there was only a 10 per cent chance she would not have brain damage.’ Mrs Knight added: ‘They said babies born earlier than 24 weeks were classed as a miscarriage so the longer I kept her in the better chance she had.’ Within minutes of being born, Skylar was put on a ventilator to help her breathe. She had wires ‘coming out of every vein and artery’ and had to be fed with a special high-energy sugar solution. Skylar has chronic lung disease but is not believed to have suffered brain damage as was initially feared . Mrs Knight, whose other two children were born full-term, was almost reluctant to meet her baby at first. ‘I think it was a bit of self-preservation - in case we lost her,’ said Mr Knight. ‘I just couldn’t believe it was happening,’ said Mrs Knight. The day after Skylar was born, Mr Knight went home to explain what was happening to Som and Summer. ‘I told them she was so excited to come home she’d arrived early, but she wasn’t big enough yet so the hospital had put her in a plastic mum to help her grow. ‘When they came to see her, the first thing Summer said was that she looked like a chicken,’ he said. ‘For me, that was amazing. She saw past all the tubes and machines, the wires and scary things. ‘They were both just so happy to have a sister.’ Three weeks ago Skylar nearly died when some food became stuck in her throat and she stopped breathing . Slowly, Skylar - whose name means eternal life, love, strength and beauty - continued to grow and develop. She has needed five blood transfusions and has battled viruses and infections. Only three weeks ago, she had to be revived and hauled back from the brink after food stuck in her throat and she stopped breathing. She’s also battling chronic lung disease but appears to have escaped any brain damage. ‘It is just one thing after another,’ said Mr Knight. If a baby is born before the 24th week of pregnancy it is classed as a miscarriage. If it is born between the 24th and 37th weeks of pregnancy it is classed as premature. Between 37 and 42 weeks it is classed as full-term. About one in 13 babies are born prematurely in the UK. Source: NHS Choices . ‘There have been some really tough decisions, some very tough days. ‘We just had to trust the doctors because they do this every day.’ In July, Skylar was booked to have a heart operation at London’s famous Great Ormond Street Hospital. Surgeons wanted to clamp shut a valve in her heart which had failed to close after her birth - a condition known as patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Mr and Mrs Knight were ‘frustrated’ when a three-day wait became three weeks. But just 24 hours before the surgery, a scan showed the valve was closing by itself and the operation was no longer needed. Skylar became strong enough to move to the hospital’s children’s ward and this week spent her first night at home. She is now poised to be freed from hospital on Monday - just in time for Christmas Day. Mr Knight’s thrilled mother, Dorothy, said: ‘We would like to sincerely thanks all the staff at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, the neonatal intensive care unit and the children’s ward for their nursing skills and dedication in caring for Skylar Primrose. ‘It has been a really long struggle for Skylar but she is certainly a little fighter.’","Skylar Primrose Knight was born in April - 3 months before her due date .

"A group of teenagers vandalized a Brooklyn deli on Saturday night after leaving a raucous party nearby, said police. Surveillance footage of the event shows the teens storming the entrance of Gourmet Butcher, a deli in crown heights at just after 9pm. The young vandals can be seen knocking over shelves in the front of the store and grabbing armfuls of candy as they threw storage on the ground. Ambush: Dozens of teens unexpectedly swarmed a Crown Heights deli at around 9 p.m on Saturday night . Vandals: Teens knocked all of the candies and cookies off of the counter and pocketed some as they continued to terrorize the owners at the Gourmet Deli in Crown Heights . Destroyed: The teens can be seen in surveillance video knocking over shelves and storage boxes in the small kosher deli in Crown heights where they allegedly destroyed up to $700 worth in merchandise . One employee was able to chase the teens out with a broom. The ambush was first reported on Crownheightsinfo.com. It 'happened in seconds,' said deli owner Yanki Klein to Dnainfo.com. Klien said that the teenagers destroyed between $500 and $700 worth of inventory. They knocked over, 'all the candies and cookies,' he told reporters. 'I was in shock. I called the police,' Klein said. Response: After chasing the teens out with a broom, the owners called the police who are investigating an assault against a 23-year-old and also trying to identify suspects . Protection: Spectators then went outside to ensure the teens wouldn't go back into the deli to destroy more candies and cookies inside the popular Brooklyn store . Before the attack: Surveillance footage of the store before the teens ambushed shows just how much candy and boxes were on the shelves before the teens stormed inside . Protective: The owner of Gourmet Deli is glad other employees and patrons were there at the time of the attack to stand guard to make sure no more teens try to come back into the deli to destroy mire . NBC reports that owners at the deli, which is a kosher establishment, say that teenagers have come in before yelling antisemitic language. Police say that there is no indication that the incident was a hate crime and they are not investigating it as one. When police responded to a call from the deli one 23-year-old man reported being assaulted. Police have observed the surveillance footage but haven't been able to identify any suspects. 'I don’t want to think how it could end if it there wasn't a few people in the store,'said Klein to dnainfo.com. 'We’re trying to make a living here and it’s very scary to be insecure,' he said. Local leaders, including Borough President Eric L. Adams, are planning to hold a news conference today about the attack .","Surveillance footage of the event shows the teens storming the entrance of Gourmet Butcher, a deli in crown heights at just after 9pm .

"Phil Robertson, the star of A&E's hit reality show Duck Dynasty, has addressed his controversial comments about homosexuals, comparing his attitude towards gays to that of Jesus Christ himself. The 68-year-old patriarch of Louisiana’s Robertson clan sat down with ABC News this week to promote his new autobiography, UnPHILtered: The Way I See It, and discuss a series of incendiary remarks he has made concerning homosexuals, African-Americans and Nazis. Speaking with ABC’s Ryan Owens, Robertson reiterated: 'People need to get it in their head, dude, I don’t hate anybody.' Scroll down for videos . What would Jesus do: Phil Robertson, the outspoken star of Duck Dynasty, comapred himself to the Son of God regarding his attitude towards homosexuals . Speaking out: Robertson agreed to be interviewed by ABC's Ryan Owens (left) to promote his new autobiography . The camo-wearing, bearded reality star who made a fortune manufacturing and selling duck calls under the brand Duck Commander was briefly suspended by A&E last December for calling homosexuality a sin and comparing it to bestiality in a GQ interview. Robertson also went on record as saying that growing up in Louisiana in the 1960s, he never witnessed a black person being mistreated by whites, and that Nazis needed Jesus. Amid a firestorm sparked by his incendiary remarks, Mr Robertson remained defiant, saying that he was merely quoting from the Bible. ‘I just said, “Whether it be bestiality.” I could've said pedophilia, rape, homosexual sin, heterosexual sin,’ Robertson said. ‘To me, I was just letting them know they're all the same. Just sin.’ In response to a question about Robertson's reputation as a homophobe, the 68-year-old compared himself to the Son of God. 'I'm as much of a homophobe as Jesus was,' the deeply devout Mr Robertson stated. 'The people who are participating in homosexual behavior, they need to know that I love them.' Tell-all book: Robertson penned his new memoir UnPHILtered in part to address the controversy sparked by his incendiary comments last year . Slap on the wrist: Robertson, 68, was temporarily suspended from Duck Dynasty in December 2013 after comparing homosexuality to bestiality in a GQ interview . Deeply devout: The 68-year-old said his belief in Christ turned him from an alcoholic womanizer into a better husband, father and businessman . He also took the opportunity to address his earlier remarks about African-Americans in the segregated South, insisting that he does not see race and considers all people, black or white, the same. Robertson, who struggled with alcohol in his youth, has credited his conversion to Christianity at age 28 with setting him on the right path in life. He earned a master’s degree in education from Louisiana Tech University, where he also played football. ‘I'm a highly-educated man, maybe a shocker to some,’ Robertson said. ‘I'm no dumbo.’ Robertson was later invited to play football professionally with the Washington Redskins, but famously turned down the offer because it interfered with duck hunting season. In 1966, he married Marsha Kay, better known to Duck Dynasty fans as Miss Kay, and the couple had four children together, two of whom also starred on the A&E reality show. A lover, not a fighter: Robertson, pictured in this still from a Duck Dynasty episode during a vow renewal ceremony with his wife, Miss Kay, said he does not hate anyone . The 68-year-old patriarch and businessman used the ABC interview to send a message to his critics who have been excoriating him online for his remarks about race and sexual orientation. ‘I don't own a cell phone. I've never turned on a computer in my life,’ he said. ‘So whatever America is saying or not saying about me, true or untrue, what they need to understand is I'm not hearing it.’ UnPHILtered, released by Howard Books Tuesday, is a follow-up to Robertson’s 2013 autobiography Happy, Happy, Happy. He also co-authored the book Everything’s Better With a Beard with his quirky brother, Si, and two of his sons, Willie and Jase.","Phil Robertson, 68, spoke to ABC News to promote his new memoir UnPHILtered .

"Over five years total number of benefit claimants is up by more than 700,000 . Benefit claims by foreign nationals have increased by more than 40 per cent in the past five years, official figures show. The astonishing increase has taken the number of non-Britons in receipt of benefits over 400,000 for the first time. It means they are costing taxpayers billions of pounds a year. Handouts: Benefit claims by foreign nationals have increased by more than 40 per cent in the past five years, taking the total number of non-British claimants to over 400,000, official figures show . The rise has been fuelled by a four-fold increase in benefit claims by Eastern Europeans, and sharp rises among African claimants. The disclosure will lead to renewed debate about access to benefits by immigrants and concerns about benefit tourism. It comes amid rising fears about the potential impact of tens of thousands of Romanians and Bulgarians who could come to Britain from January next year when restrictions on work and benefit claims must be dropped under an EU deadline. The figures, released by the Department for Work and Pensions under the Freedom of Information Act, show a total of 406,900 non-UK nationals were claiming work-related benefits such as jobseekers’ allowance, incapacity benefit and disability living allowance in the year to February 2012. That is an increase of 41 per cent since 2008, when the total stood at 288,720. A breakdown by continent showed the biggest number of individual claimants were from Asia and the Middle East. Their numbers increased by a third from 99,000 to 132,000 over the five years. African nationals were the next biggest group. Their numbers went from just over 77,000 to more than 100,000 in five years. But the biggest increases in benefit claims were among citizens of the accession countries – those former Eastern Bloc nations that joined the EU in 2004. From May 2011 Britain was forced to drop rules restricting benefits to these nationals and their numbers shot up from 28,000 in February that year to nearly 50,000 last year. The number of claimants stood at just 12,600 in 2008. There were also a significant number of claimants from core EU countries such as France and Germany, which rose to 66,000 in 2012. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the MigrationWatch think tank, described the figures as ‘very striking’ and noted that they did not include other benefits for which most Eastern Europeans, being low paid, would qualify. 'Very striking': Sir Andrew Green, chairman . of MigrationWatch, noted that the figures did not include benefits . for which the low paid qualify . Over the five years, the total number of benefit claimants, including Britons, has increased from 5.17million to 5.88million. There was 12 per cent rise among Britons. The foreign nationals in the figures will include migrants who came here to work, study or join their families. Ministers say it is impossible to predict how many Romanians and Bulgarians will come to Britain in January and have repeatedly refused to put out an official estimate, but MigrationWatch estimates the figure could be 50,000. Even the countries’ ambassadors predict that it could be around 35,000. Ministers fear a repeat of the 2004 debacle when the influx from the accession countries was grossly underestimated. It is unclear how many of the 400,000 foreign claimants will be illegal migrants but previous analysis has suggested that up to two per cent could be in Britain illegally. A DWP spokesman said it was tightening the rules ‘to ensure genuine workers and jobseekers get support, but not people who come to this country to take advantage’. ‘We are also currently working with our counterparts across Europe to address the concerns we have about the abuse of free movement,’ said the spokesman, who added that many of those claiming benefits as foreign nationals will go on to obtain British citizenship.","Rise fuelled by four-fold increase in benefit claims by Eastern Europeans .

"'The chip is changing my life': Tim Reddish with the silver medal he won at the 2000 Sydney Paralympics and the OBE he was awarded in 2009 . He's won more than 50 medals swimming for his country, but Tim Reddish only ever had the pleasure of seeing a handful of them. Diagnosed with a degenerative eye condition at the age of 31, the former Paralympian went totally blind 17 years ago. But thanks to the fitting of a bionic eye, the 55-year-old can now see his haul in all its glory. Mr Reddish – currently the chairman of the British Paralympic Association – told yesterday how a revolutionary retinal chip is enabling him to make out shapes and read a clock face. The eight-hour procedure to implant an artificial retina brings hope to thousands who suffer with similar conditions. It costs up to £100,000 per patient and builds on previous attempts to produce a bionic eye using a camera and transmitter linked to a pair of glasses as a means of relaying images to the artificial retina. Mr Reddish is one of nine totally blind UK patients who took part in a trial of the chip at the Oxford University Eye Hospital and King’s College Hospital, London. He said of the moment medics switched on the chip: ‘It was as if a match had been lit in a dark room – it was unbelievable. ‘In the lab tests, when there are objects on a table, and the lighting is bright, I can tell you how many objects there are, and most of the time I can read the clock. 'To be able to see even the vaguest of blurry outlines of the medals I won is a terrific achievement and means a lot to me.’ Mr Reddish, from Nottingham, began losing his sight after developing retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited disease that destroys the retina and which affects an estimated 20,000 in the UK. Scroll down for video . Artist's impression: Connected via a wire thinner than a human hair to a power supply just behind the ear, the chip is made up of 1,500 pixels, each with its own amplifier and electrode for stimulating the retinal nerves . The father-of-two competed at three Games with the British Paralympic swimming team. He scooped silver and bronze in 1992 in Barcelona, silver and bronze in Atlanta in 1996 and a silver medal in Sydney in 2000. He also won 11 gold world blind . swimming championships medals during an illustrious career, before . becoming performance director for the Paralympic swimming team at the . Athens and Beijing Games. He was honoured with an MBE in 2001 . and an OBE in 2009, both for services to disabled sport. Last October, . medics inserted a 3mm square, light sensitive chip under the existing . retina in his right eye. Tiny: It is hoped that the 3mm chip could soon provide the 15million people left blinded by retinitis pigmentosa a means of partially restoring their vision . This X-ray image shows the position of the chip and its power supply in a patient's skull: When light enters the eye, the chip sends electrical signals to the optic nerve, which passes on the information to the brain . The chip is packed with 1,500 . light-sensitive panels, producing a pixelated image which is boosted by . an ‘amplifier’, buried inside the head behind the ear. Each pixel mimics the function of the . photoreceptor rod and cone cells in the eye which were destroyed as a . result of Mr Reddish’s condition. Robert MacLaren, a consultant retinal . surgeon involved in the trial, said: ‘This technology has proven that it . is possible to restore some sight to a person who before was completely . blind. It is a huge step forward but there is still much more work to . be done.’ Professor MacLaren said because it is a trial, the chips were implanted in only one eye of each patient. The trial was funded by a grant from . the Department of Health’s National Institute for Health Research, while . German chip manufacturer Retina Implant AG also provided its devices . for free. How it looks inside the eye: The tiny light-sensitive microchip sits in the macular region - the area of the eye where clear images are formed in normal-sighted individuals .

"Prosecutors ruled there was a realistic chance of convicting Cyril Smith of child sex offences 12 years before he died . Prosecutors ruled there was a realistic chance of convicting Cyril Smith of child sex offences 12 years before he died. But they advised against bringing a case because the Liberal politician had been assured decades earlier that he would not face charges. Documents made public yesterday also reveal that police knew of three potential witnesses to Smith’s abuse but failed to interview them. Since his death in 2010 at the age of 82, the former MP for Rochdale has been exposed as a serial molester of scores of young boys. He escaped justice despite repeated complaints by his victims and a series of inquiries. Lancashire Police investigated him in 1969 over complaints that he abused eight teenage boys at a hostel in Rochdale. But the then Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Norman Skelhorn, rejected the case, ruling the following year that the allegations were ‘somewhat stale’ and ‘completely without corroboration’. In 1998 the Crown Prosecution Service was asked to review the original file of evidence – and its resulting advice to police was finally released yesterday after a lengthy Freedom of Information battle. Peter Watson, Crown prosecutor for Rochdale, noted in his ruling at the time that the alleged victims living in the hostel all complained of ‘virtually the same type of indecent misconduct’ and had given consistent accounts. He said it was understandable that they had failed to complain immediately given Smith’s imposing physical size and position of authority. Mr Watson added that the politician’s response to the allegations was ‘by no means convincing’ because he had not addressed the boys’ specific claims. He concluded: ‘I have arrived at the firm view, having regard in particular to the number and nature of the complaints and how they came to be made, that there would be a realistic prospect of conviction.’ But the prosecutor went on to recommend against charging Smith because police had told him back in March 1970 that he would not face further action. He said: ‘If a decision was reached to institute proceedings, then the prosecution would undoubtedly face legal argument from the defence to the effect that it would be an abuse of the process of the court to allow the prosecution to continue with its case. My own view in this case is that the defence would be more likely than not to be successful.’ No prosecution was brought – but then two more men came forward to Manchester police to make complaints against Smith and a further file was submitted in 1999. Documents made public yesterday also reveal that police knew of three potential witnesses to the abuse carried out by Cyril Smith (above) but failed to interview them . This time Mr Watson ruled against any action because one did not constitute a crime and the evidence in the second claim was ‘not particularly strong’. But he observed that detectives were aware of other people who might have relevant information – yet had not spoken to them. He wrote: ‘I have been told that there are three further potential witnesses whose identities are known but who have not been interviewed by the police. Whether or not they should be traced and interviewed is entirely an operational matter for the police. ‘I do not think that it would be appropriate for me to offer any advice or recommendation upon that aspect of the case.’ In 2012 the CPS stressed that Smith would have faced prosecution had the same allegations been made against him today. Rochdale’s current MP Labour’s Simon Danczuk said: ‘I have spoken to police officers involved in Operation Cleopatra and they thought Cyril Smith was guilty as hell. ‘They will be extremely disappointed that the CPS were in a hurry to shred the evidence.’ The disclosures were made by a care worker who comforted the youngster after the alleged abuse at Elm Guest House in Barnes, London (above) A boy linked to the alleged Westminster paedophile ring was so traumatised by his ordeal that he despairingly referred to himself as ‘daddy’s little princess’, it emerged last night. The tormented youngster also had a pet name for one of his suspected attackers that suggested he was a politician who later became a cabinet minister. The disclosures were made by a care worker who comforted the youngster when he was rescued from years of alleged abuse at the Elm Guest House in Barnes, South-West London. The care worker was present when the boy – then eight or nine – was taken into care in 1982 and interviewed by police about his ordeal. The child said the suspected abuser worked in ‘the big house’, which detectives believed could have meant the Houses of Parliament. He also provided social workers with the man’s first name, which the Mail is not revealing for legal reasons. With the help of overseas law enforcement agencies, Scotland Yard traced the alleged victim, now in his 40s, to the United States in a bid to gather further evidence about his suffering three decades ago. But according to sources in America, the alleged victim either changed his story or declined to give a statement elaborating on what he told police in the 1980s. A Labour minister suspected of sexually abusing children with a convicted paedophile tried to help the pervert foster two young brothers, it was claimed yesterday. The politician, said to be close to Tony Blair, was alleged to have brought pressure on social services to allow children’s home boss Michael John Carroll to get care of two vulnerable boys aged 12 and 14. Carroll said the claim was nonsense. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Cyril Smith was exposed as a serial molester of boys after his death in 2010 .

Of the men who admitted rape, just under half had done so more than once. Demanding change: While India was not among countries surveyed in the UN report, it has been rocked to its core by a series of recent rape cases that have sparked widespread outrage as well as changes to the law . Shocking: Perhaps even more alarming still, 75 per cent of those men said they committed the act for reasons of 'sexual entitlement' Perhaps even more alarming still, 75 per cent of those men said they committed the act for reasons of 'sexual entitlement'. Report author Dr Emma Fulu said: 'They believed they had the right to have sex with the woman regardless of consent. Papua New Guinea Bougainville Island - 62% . Indonesia Papua Province - 48.6% . Indonesia urban - 26.2% . China urban/rural - 22.2% . Cambodia - 20.4% . Indonesia rural - 19.5% . Sri Lanka - 14.5% . Bangladesh rural - 14.1% . Bangladesh urban - 9.5% . 'The second most common motivation reported was to rape as a form of entertainment, so for fun or because they were bored (60 per cent).' That was followed by using rape as a form of punishment or because the man was angry (40 per cent). She added: 'Perhaps surprisingly, the least common motivation was alcohol. Only about half of the men said they felt guilty about their crime and 23 per cent had been imprisoned for a rape. It also revealed that men who had suffered some form of abuse as a child were more likely to commit rape. The research was funded by several United Nations agencies and . Australia, Britain, Norway and Sweden. The papers were published online . today in the journal, Lancet Global Health. Papua New Guinea was the worst offender of the countries surveyed with six men in ten admitting to violating a woman while in Bangladesh that figure was just under one in ten. 'These data justifiably create global outrage, accentuated by horrific recent high-profile cases, including the brutal gang rape of a student in New Delhi,' said Dr Michele Decker from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore . 'More than half of non-partner rape perpetrators first did so as adolescents, which affirms that young people are a crucial target population for prevention of rape. The figures were released today, the same day four men were convicted of the brutal rape and murder of a 23-year-old medical student on a moving bus in New Delhi. While India was not among countries surveyed in the UN report, it has been rocked to its core by a series of recent rape cases that have sparked widespread outrage as well as changes to the law. None more so than the case wound up today. All that is left, appeals pending, is their sentencing tomorrow. The victim's family led calls today for them all to be hanged, the legal penalty for such a crime in India.","The survey, by the United Nations, interviewed 10,000 men across Bangladesh, China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Papua New Guinea .

"Gary Neville has attacked Manchester United’s bizarre transfer policy after claiming the sale of Danny Welbeck for just £16m is ‘strange’. United have spent fortunes this summer to sign Falcao, Angel di Maria, Daley Blind, Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw and Marco Rojo. Neville said: ‘It’s not the way I would expect United to go about their business, I thought it would be more controlled. VIDEO Scroll down to see Phil Neville's thoughts on Welbeck's transfer . Manchester United sold Danny Welbeck to rivals Arsenal for £16million after the arrival of Radamel Falcao . ‘I can’t work it out and I know I worked with Danny Welbeck last week [with England], but it’s odd. I have to admit I thought the Danny Welbeck sale was a strange one, but that’s just me. ‘Of all the prices paid this summer, there are right backs and left-backs galore who have been bought for £14m, £15m, £16m? ‘How have Arsenal got him [Welbeck] for £16m? I can’t work it out. It has helped out a competitor because Arsenal are the team they are fighting for fourth possibly. ‘I am struggling to work out the logic, I can’t understand it. It’s odd in two or three ways. ‘Falcao tipped them over the edge, it surprised and shocked everyone. How he gets them in that team I don’t know. How they get Rooney, Di Maria, Robin van Persie, Falcao, Herrera, Januzaj and Mata into that team I don’t know.’ Arsene Wenger signed Danny Welbeck after first choice striker Olivier Giroud fractured his ankle . Radamel Falcao joined Manchester United on a season-long loan deal with the option of a permanent deal . Neville went on to claim United have over-paid for players after their seventh placed finish in the Barclays Premier League last season. He told talkSPORT: ‘In one sense I am excited because they have signed world class players. People jumped on the bandwagon last year and said they wouldn’t attract players, but they have a massive commercial operation. ‘They have overpaid, there is no doubt about that but people will still go there.’ Welbeck is expected to start for Arsenal on Saturday when they take on Manchester City at the Emirates in the Barclays Premier League. The England striker, who scored twice for his country against Switzerland on Tuesday, admitted he needs a run of games up front to prove he is a top player for club and country. Arsenal’s £16m signing said: ‘It is well known I prefer to play through the middle so when I get my opportunity I just want to show what I can do. Once I get into the box and getting the opportunities I have got faith in my ability. Manchester United broke the British transfer record when they paid £60m for Angel di Maria . ‘Before I wasn’t getting into the box because I wasn’t playing too much as a striker and I had to worry about my defensive work. I just know once I get the opportunity and a run of games up front I will do my best. ‘That’s definitely what I need. It is good for any footballer to get a run of games. You become more confident and play much more ease and to get a run of games would be absolutely perfect. That is my first 90 minutes this season so it is just the start of things and really looking forward to it.’ VIDEO Arsenal spending doesn't guarantee success - Dein .","Gary Neville attacked Manchester United's transfer policy .

"Sam Allardyce and Harry Redknapp have been in the game long enough to witness shock results. They have seen games and moments of brilliance that endure. This match had none. West Ham can be pleased with a scrappy yet solid victory and their first clean sheet of the season, taking them to seventh in the table. QPR sank to the bottom, with the worst defensive record in the top flight. They have conceded 15 goals in seven games and demonstrated precious little talent in attack. For Rob Green, Rio Ferdinand and Bobby Zamora, who all had long spells at Upton Park, it was an unhappy return to their old stamping ground. But no former Hammer was more dissatisfied by QPR’s fifth consecutive away defeat than their manager.

Subs: McCarthy, Isla, Mutch, Dunne, Vargas, Zamora, Taarabt . Harry Redknapp: 5 . Harry Redknapp has made a few tough calls in his time and he might be tempted to ring the changes at QPR. He passed on this message from first-team coach Glenn Hoddle, who was watching from the stands, to his assistant Kevin Bond. QPR did not have West Ham’s number on Sunday... Harry Redknapp, who spent seven years at West Ham from 1994, lamented the lack of fitness among his team, singling out £10million new boy Sandro, whom he hauled off after an unremarkable 67 minutes. ‘I put a lot of faith in him when I brought him in,’ Redknapp said of the Brazilian midfielder secured from Tottenham. ‘He’s had an injury and we need to get him fit. The doctor told me at half-time that he could only play another five minutes. A few of the players are still not up to speed and peak fitness. People like Jordon Mutch, who I brought in, have not managed to put two games together. It’s a problem for us.’ Asked about Gary Neville’s Sky TV assessment of QPR’s performance as ‘diabolical,’ Redknapp replied: ‘We weren’t great, that’s for sure. It’s his opinion isn’t it? I have seen some diabolical performances of late as well but we won’t go into that one.’ Allardyce’s new signings, meanwhile, have bedded in seemingly without problem. Diafro Sakho, who arrived for £4.5m from French side Metz, got his fifth goal in as many starts. Sakho, who revealed he is driven by the need to provide for his poverty-stricken family in Senegal, showed plenty of desire, patiently waiting to head home a James Tomkins cross. ‘I expected him to spend maybe 10 or 15 games for us finding out about the Premier League,’ said Allardyce, ‘But he is so desperate to do well and his runs are so good. He seems to have the knack of turning up in the right place at the right time. That’s fantastic for him and absolutely outstanding for us. That goes for all the signings. ‘We didn’t really make any defensive errors today.

Sakho, who had been rejected by QPR, revealed that it was only the intervention of West Ham’s co-chairman David Sullivan that secured his move to Upton Park. He said: ‘I have always wanted to play in England and when West Ham came in for me in the summer, I thought that was it. But then the deal began to fall through as I think the coach was having doubts and I was resigned to returning to France. ‘Fortunately for me, Mr Sullivan stepped in and said he would be signing me and on a permanent deal. It was the chance I needed. I had heard QPR didn’t want me so I wanted to prove I could do it. West Ham gave me the chance and now Mr Allardyce believes in me too.’ West Ham took the lead after five minutes. The resurgent Stewart Downing, Allardyce’s man of the match, whipped the ball over the heads of several white shirts and the flailing arms of Enner Valencia towards the far post. QPR’s Nedum Onuoha, making his first start of the season, angled the ball into the net with his thigh. Green looked dumbstruck, first gesturing for handball then reprimanding his struggling defenders. West Ham missed a plum opportunity to double their lead moments later when Sakho accelerated past Ferdinand and pulled the ball back across the box only for Valencia to poke the ball wide of the post. QPR, who haven’t won at Upton Park for 21 years, had only one significant chance in the first half when Charlie Austin made a zipping run into the box, slotting the ball through Tomkins’ legs. Austin ignored the shouts of Niko Kranjcar to pull the ball back, instead blasting it at Adrian, who saved comfortably enough. QPR were briefly enlivened by the introduction of Zamora at half-time. Within minutes, the 33-year-old, who grew up just a few stops on the Tube from Upton Park, set up Austin with a decent chance and won a free kick. But West Ham extended their lead after 59 minutes. Mauro Zarate’s volley was blocked and Tomkins collected on the bounce and lobbed over several defenders for Sakho to head home. There was more drama moments later when Green took a free-kick in the box which was intercepted by Valencia, hovering seven yards away.

"This is the moment an irate taxi driver makes a citizen's arrest after a woman tried to flee his cab without paying her £25 fare. The brazen woman refused to pay driver Phillip Williams at the end of her 15-mile journey, leaving him with no choice but to restrain her while pleading for passers-by to call the police. The 10-minute altercation was captured on film and shows the angry driver holding the woman's arm in Dudley town centre, West Midlands, and shouting: 'She owes me £25 taxi fare, can someone call the police please.' But rather than help the distressed driver, passers-by confronted him and ordered him to let her go. Footage shows the woman struggling with the man, kicking his car door and grabbing his face as she tried to escape his grip. Scroll down for video . Citizen's arrest: Taxi driver Phillip Williams tries to restrain the 19-year-old woman who tried to dodge a £25 fare and calls for members of the public walking by to help him by calling the police... ...but instead of rushing to his aid the crowd turn on him for holding the woman, with only one elderly lady (right) showing support by asking gathered passers-by whether they will pay the £25 fare if he lets her go . Restrained: Passers-by filmed Mr Williams as he held onto the non-paying passenger . Struggle: The woman pushed and shoved at Mr Williams as he tried to restrain her in a citizen's arrest . The 58-year-old driver who works for Star Cars and Coaches in Erdington, Birmingham, can be heard in the video saying to the woman: 'Show me identification and I'll let you go. All I am asking for is a name and address and I will let you go.' The only support he seems to get is from an elderly woman who asked the crowd of about 50 people which had gathered around him whether they would be prepared to lose the money. She said: 'If he lets her go will you pay her taxi fare? If she owed you money would you let her do one? 'If she owes him money she has got to pay him. How can she have a taxi and not pay?' But after being closed in by the mob, the self-employed driver was forced to let the woman go and was left out of pocket. Footage of the incident, which happened on July 4, has gone viral on Facebook, causing Mr Williams to receive more than 2,000 messages of support saying he was right to apprehend the woman. The 19-year-old passenger, who is not being named publically, had told the driver . she had an exam and needed to get to Dudley Library as quickly as . possible when Phillip picked her up from her home in Erdington, . Birmingham at 2pm. When they arrived she told him she needed to go inside to get the money, which sparked his suspicion. Mr Williams went in with her, fearing she would flee without . paying. She then confessed she didn't have the money and asked him to . drive her to a cash point. But as they arrived at the town centre cashpoint she tried to run, so Mr Williams jumped out to restrain her. Out of pocket: Self-employed Mr Williams has been left short by the incident after it caused him to miss another fare . Today, the father-of-four from Aston, Birmingham, said: 'I grabbed her because she tried to run off. I asked her to give me her name and address but she started screaming blue murder and next thing there were about 50 people videoing me and taking photos. 'I was restraining her and asked if someone could call the police and help me out but no one did. 'One man was insisting I had to let her go and threatened to call the police on me for assault. I thought I was doing the right thing just by restraining her. 'I am an honest man trying to earn a living. It is hard enough in the taxi game now - it is very competitive. 'She said she'd give me her details so I let her go and she ran off. '£25 is a big fare. I can't let people run off without paying. You could not go into Asda and spend £25 on food and not pay. It is not acceptable.It comes straight out my pocket. 'I did not do anything wrong. I lost two hours that day and missed another fare.' The woman has since been identified, been made to pay the fare and banned from using the taxi firm. Mr Williams added: 'We all do foolish things when we are young but people need to know they can't do this to taxi drivers. 'I've been driving 23-years and it's not the first time this has happened and I am sure it won't be the last. Experienced: The father-of-four has been driving taxis for 23 years and has seen several people 'do a runner' Taxi company: Stars Cars and Coaches said it would expect any of its drivers to behave in the same way if someone tried to jump a fare . 'She has since apologised so that is the end of it. I am surprised at how much interest this has generated but it is nice to know people are on my side.' Martin Walker, operations manager of Star Cars & Coaches, said: 'The footage is concerning when you see it because you don't know the full circumstances of what's occurred. When you understand the full circumstances your realise the pressure the driver was under at the time. 'In that situation he was surrounding by members of the public filming him and it was an exasperating position to be in. It is not a nice video to watch. 'At the end of the day it is a happy resolution and nice to know there are so many people on the driver's side. I would expect any of our drivers to react that way.' A spokesman for the firm added: 'This passenger booked a vehicle and did a runner. It was a £25 fare - it was not a short journey. 'It has created such a big thing. It happens every day of the week. It is wrong. It is classed as milking. 'All the older people who are in the video know it is wrong, whereas all the younger ones are on her side.' Mr Williams decided not to press charges after he received his fare. Dudley Police tweeted last week: 'The taxi fair was paid for in the end and local officers have spoken to women and have reassured the taxi driver.' (sic) A spokesperson for West Midlands Police added: 'The taxi fare was paid and there was no prosecution against the girl.'","Phillip Williams restrained the woman, 19, after she tried to jump a £25 fare .

"Shirley Player, 61, stole £57,000 a year from 2007 to 2014 . When Shirley Player was diagnosed with cancer, she decided she had nothing to lose. Facing debts, and assuming she would be dead before anyone found out, she stole £400,000 from her employers. But fate did not deal her the hand she had accepted. Doctors gave her the cancer all-clear...and police charged her with theft. While the 61-year-old accounts manager has escaped her death sentence, she is now beginning a four year jail sentence. ‘She had not expected to be still here,’ prosecutor Carolyn Branford-Wood told Bournemouth Crown Court. The extent of the married grandmother’s thieving came to light when her employers, an estate agency, carried out an audit earlier this year. They discovered Player had transferred a total of £390,550 into her personal bank accounts over seven years, concealing the payments as tenant deposit returns. She made 390 transactions into four accounts, and then covered up the payments by editing the company’s accounts system to make them look legitimate. Mrs Branford-Wood said Player, from Bournemouth, used the money to settle debts, pay rents and on ‘family treats’. She said: ‘She had thought she might have died before the thefts were discovered. ‘She lost both her sisters to cancer in the mid-2000s and she had then been diagnosed but responded favourably to treatment.’ The court heard how Player confessed her crimes to police immediately. Mrs Branford-Wood said Player – who turned up to court smoking a cigarette – told officers: ‘It started because I had debts and then I thought, “I’m getting away with it” and it just escalated. In the end I could not stop.’ The prosecutor said: ‘Asked where the money had gone, she said it was on bills, rent and treats for the family. There was no property purchase and no expensive new car.’ Player worked at Allan and Bath estate agents, which was bought by Leaders in 2006, for 14 years, starting off as an accounts assistant but eventually becoming accounts manager. In mitigation, Brian Sharman, said his client had lost one sister to cancer in 2006 and another in 2008. Although she didn’t have the disease when she began the theft, Player was convinced it was just a matter of time before she would be diagnosed, and she was in 2010. The accounts manager claims she stole the money because her two sisters had previously died from breast cancer. Bournemouth Crown Court heard she had thought she would 'not be here' when her employers uncovered what she had been doing . Mr Sharman added: ‘She thought she would be dead before they found out.’ Sentencing Player, Judge John Harrow said: ‘You stole a colossal amount of money.’ He said her gross abuse of trust meant that imprisonment was unavoidable. Player, who lives in a £250,000 semi-detached house in Bournemouth, was given the all-clear about six months ago after radiotherapy. Her retired husband Malcolm said he had no idea about his wife’s crime spree until the police investigation. He added: ‘We weren’t driving around in Bentleys and drinking champagne. We might have gone out for the odd steak dinner.’","Accounts manager Shirley Player, 61, stole £57,000 a year from 2007-2014 .

"Mauricio Pochettino was teased about his linguistic capabilities but for once his team did the talking. A single strike by Christian Eriksen translated into a much-needed win for Tottenham and a small degree of revenge for their boss. Pochettino was bombarded with abuse from Saints fans from the moment he emerged from the tunnel until hope had been squeezed from Ronald Koeman’s team. ‘Where’s your translator gone?’ they wanted to know, among other, less polite, questions. Spurs, so often lacking fluency under the manager they lured from St Mary’s, actually produced a response to make the Argentine proud and go into the international break within a goal of fourth-placed Manchester United.

Eriksen fires Tottenham into the lead against Southampton just before half-time at White Hart Lane . Tottenham secured their first Premier League win in five games with a 1-0 victory over Southampton at White Hart Lane . Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris 7, Naughton 6 (Dier 32, 6), Kaboul 6, Vertonghen 6, Rose 6.5, Mason 6, Capoue 6.5, Lamela 6 (Kane 90), Eriksen 7.5 (Dembele 82), Chadli 6.5, Adebayor 6.5.

It proves how congested the Barclays Premier League is behind the top two. Perhaps there is a Champions League place for Pochettino to target. On this evidence, he is finally injecting solidity into the team. They were less creative in attack but Eriksen’s second goal of the season ended a run of four League games without a win. ‘It was an emotional game for me,’ said Pochettino. ‘I love Southampton. It was a great 18 months for me and my family and it was a tough decision to leave. But I can understand the fans. This is football. ‘It doesn’t change my feelings. I will always be grateful to the club and the people of Southampton. My decision is done. I have no regrets. I am happy to be here and happy with the win. It was important to get the three points.’ Koeman claimed the supporters ought to have shown more respect. ‘That’s the reaction of the fans but I don’t agree,’ said the Southampton boss. ‘Everybody deserves respect. Normally, respect is high in the Premier League. Mauricio did a great job at Southampton and now he’s the manager of Tottenham.’ Koeman, above all, was upset not to leave with a point. His team were committed and industrious and matched Spurs in midfield but rarely looked like scoring in a game bookended by two chances missed by Sadio Mane. The former was deflected wide by Kyle Naughton and the latter squirted wide as he failed to convert a cross fizzed in from the left by Ryan Bertrand. Naughton left White Hart Lane on crutches, his right foot and ankle in a protective boot after a nasty Bertrand challenge in the first half. Bertrand left his studs up and Naughton’s leg twisted under impact. He will have a scan today to determine the damage. ‘It was a big hit,’ admitted Pochettino.

Ultimately, it was about who would be most clinical and that was Spurs, who must have been encouraged by a nervous performance by Fraser Forster, in stark contrast to the immaculate-as-ever Hugo Lloris. The game was only three minutes old when Bertrand cleared off his line to deny Jan Vertonghen. Erik Lamela also went close, clipping a post with a slider from distance. It seemed a deliberate policy to test Forster with low shots from distance. The England goalkeeper rode his luck when he spilt an effort from Eriksen and saw it spin wide of the post, but was beaten five minutes before half-time. Emmanuel Adebayor and Nacer Chadli linked up neatly on the left and Chadli nursed the ball out to Eriksen, who smashed it low into the corner. Forster was beaten again seconds later when Spurs sprang out of defence on a quick break launched by Lamela. Adebayor unzipped the defence to release Chadli, who clipped a shot past the keeper but it thumped into a post and was scrambled away. Lloris saved a free-kick by Dusan Tadic before the interval and there was a curious incident soon after the restart, when Younes Kaboul eased Mane off the ball with a shoulder and referee Mike Jones awarded a foul. Nacer Chadli has been involved in five of Tottenham’s nine Premier League goals this season. He has scored four and now set up one. It didn’t look like a foul but Kaboul was certainly the last man by some considerable distance. If Jones thought it was a foul he should have shown the red card. Koeman seemed to agree, but added: ‘I think a yellow is OK.’ He was in dangerous territory here, considering how he stayed on after a last-man foul on David Platt and then scored against England as they were denied a place at the World Cup in 1994. It almost worked in Southampton’s favour when Kaboul sliced a clearance to Victor Wanyama on the edge of the box, but Lloris preserved the lead with a good save. Pochettino faced the Saints for the first time since his departure in the summer. Matt Barlow runs the rule over how he coped. RECEPTION: Not good at all. Noisily jeered by Southampton fans as he emerged from the tunnel and the target for plenty of verbals in the first half-hour. ‘Who the f*** is Pochettino,’ they sang, ‘Sit down Mauricio,’ and ‘Where’s your translator gone?’ There was a barrage of x-rated abuse whenever he stood up and ventured to the edge of the pitch. In all this time, there was little by way of positive support from the Spurs fans. BODY LANGUAGE: Defiant and untroubled. Having ditched his Spurs tracksuit for his Sunday best, Pochettino stood with his back to the visiting fans early in the game, anxiously passing messages on to the pitch as his team started slowly. Once they were ahead, he relaxed. Only occasionally did he seem exasperated, usually when possession had been surrendered cheaply, and he embraced those he replaced as they came off. TACTICS: It took Spurs time to impose their style on the game. The two teams, both under orders to press, seemed to neutralise each other. Defences were strong and chances were rare. Spurs created the better ones and looked more solid, helped by the fact Hugo Lloris was faultless as usual while Fraser Forster was clumsy and errorprone and Christian Eriksen found a gem to win the game.

"The British host of a US TV show who once ran a UK dance school which was likened to a religious cult has been shot dead by his son-in-law in an attempted 'murder-suicide'. Scott Rogers, 52, is understood to have been killed by Mathew Hodgkinson, who was also his former lover, in a murder-suicide attempt at his Louisiana home, according to local police. Mr Hodgkinson, 36, who was also British, was married to Mr Rogers' daughter Kimmy, and it has been suggested that all three lived in the home where Mr Rogers was shot. Scroll down for video . Louisiana TV personality Scott Rogers, 52, was shot and killed at his Baton Rouge home on Wednesday by his son-in-law - Matthew Hodgkinson - who was also believed to be his former lover . Originally from Suffolk, Rogers was well-known in Baton Rouge as the host of the feel-good Around Town show, which airs on WAFB on Saturday and Sunday mornings. A suspected suicide note believed to be written by Hodgkinson was found in Rogers’ home. ‘They broke our happy loving home. They do not get to take Scott too,’ read the note. Police said Hodgkinson is currently in a coma in Our Lady of the Lake Hospital, Baton Rouge after surviving the alleged murder-suicide attempt. Rogers, founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk in 1983. He was then known as Richard Scott-Rogers in the UK. The school was likened to a 'religious cult' by Suffolk County Council bosses, who in 1995 warned parents of the 'perceived risk' of sending children to the school. The Iberville Parish Sheriff's Office said a suspected suicide note believed to be written by Matthew Hodgkinson was found in Rogers’ home . On Thursday two men, appearing anonymously on a Louisiana radio show, alleged that Scott Rogers, who had been known as Richard Scott-Rogers, had sexually abused them as young boys in the UK. Scott Rogers, who was known as Richard Scott-Rogers in the UK, founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds in 1983. But the school was likened to a 'religious cult' by Suffolk County Council in 1995, and they warned parents of the 'perceived risk' of sending their children there. According to the Bury Free Press, Rogers was acquitted of child molestation charges involving a 13-year-old boy in 1993. Parents also told the paper about 'sleepovers' Rogers would have with some of his young students, during which he would 'cuddle them in their sleeping bags.' In 1995, Suffolk County Council voiced concerns about 'a senior member' of the academy following a High Court case in 1993. In a statement released at the time, the council warned parents of an 'unhealthy atmosphere' at the academy and compared it to that of 'a religious or supposedly religious cult' . It said: 'There was also considerable anxiety felt as to levels of intimacy that existed between the senior member and pupils.' But at the time head teacher Rachel Richards denied the claims of 'cult-style brainwashing classes', she said: 'We are just a school teaching the performing arts.' Rogers left the UK and moved to the U.S. in the mid-90s. One of the alleged victims, who said he met Rogers at his dance academy, claimed to have been intimately involved with Rogers from the age of 13. He said that the encounters 'increased in frequency' until he was 18. The other alleged victim described him as a 'monster'. Rogers, was acquitted of child molestation charges involving a 13-year-old boy in 1993, according to the Bury Free Press.

At the time head teacher Rachel Richards denied the claims of 'cult-style brainwashing classes', she said: 'We are just a school teaching the performing arts. Some of our pupils have moved on to appear in the West End theatre and on television. 'People are still coming here for classes from all over Suffolk. We are not involved in any cult activities and to say we are is ridiculous.' Rogers moved to the U.S. in the mid-90s. Iberville Parish Sheriff Brett Stassi, investigating the shooting, said Rogers' home had been the scene of a 'bunch of stress' in the past several weeks. He said: 'It looked like a murder and failed attempted suicide. Scott was shot in his bed, under the covers, tucked neatly in. 'It looks like Mathew put the gun to his own head... he was seriously wounded but still alive. He's still in a critical condition in an induced coma. It's been topsy-turvy at this residence. Matthew Hodgkinson, 36, was married to Rogers' daughter Kimmy, and it has believed that all three lived in the home where Rogers was shot . Hodgkinson is said to be in a coma in Our Lady of the Lake Hospital in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, pictured . 'We responded to a couple of calls. It's been a high stress environment for this family and looks like it culminated in this.' Rogers was also under investigation for fraud and the state took custody of two children - his 10-year-old adopted son and a two-year-old boy he was in the process of adopting - earlier this month, according to The Advocate. Mr Stassi also told the Times-Picayune that the marriage between Hodgkinson, who was also Rogers’ former dance student, and Kimberly Ann Scott-Rogers was a sham to keep UK-born Hodgkinson in the country. She was reportedly testifying before a federal grand jury when her father was killed.","TV personality Scott Rogers, 52, from Suffolk was shot and killed at his Louisiana home on Wednesday .

"Arnold Schwarzenegger is selling the diesel-guzzling behemoth off-road utility vehicle he bought after famously signing into law one of California's most sweeping anti-emissions laws to date. The former governor bought his 5-ton, 12 miles-per-gallon Unimog back in 2012, perhaps to complement his past purchases of personal tank and HumVee. Now the 1977 Unimog U1300 refitted to the Terminator star's specifications--complete with a dashboard bearing his signature--can be yours for $275,000. Tons of fun: Seen here driving the behemoth in 2012, Arnold Schwarzenegger has placed his personal Unimog up for sale for around $275,000 . A car to match his persona: Arnold has purchased a personal military tank and HumVee, as well. The Unimog is a utility truck known across much of the world for its ruggedness and adaptability. At right, the action star reaches up to open the door of the truck in Brentwood, California . Conspicuous: Here, the Unimog, which can only reach around 60MPH, sits at a Los Angeles curb . That's with the mark-up that comes with having a superstar as its previous owner, reports Fox News. Schwarzenegger actually paid $25,000 or so less when he purchased the vehicle. It's unclear exactly what he did with the massive truck while it remained in his possession over the last couple of years. The utility vehicles are well-known outside the US as construction and military vehicles. But if he used the Unimog for anything like he does his personal tank, that's not why he purchased it. Earlier this year, the action star posted a YouTube video that asked the question 'Will it Crush?' along with his personal tank attempting to squash everything from a roll of bubble wrap to a Microsoft Zune. A real steal: Arnold even customized his Unimog by signing the dash . Unimogs are a Mercedes vehicle known much better outside the United States, where they are not sold.

"Sir Richard Branson has spoken of his agony as he watched his son Sam  being airlifted from the Matterhorn during a charity hike after falling ill, unable to help him as he circled in a helicopter running low on fuel. The 29-year-old was taken seriously ill with extreme altitude sickness as he neared the summit. He couldn't breathe and was retching uncontrollably, so his guides radioed for him to be extracted by air. He did, however, manage to reach the top before he was flown to safety. Scroll down for video . Drama: Sam Branson (bottom left in a yellow jacket) was rescued by emergency helicopter after summiting the Matterhorn for a charity hike, due to extreme altitude sickness . We made it: Sam Branson (centre) at the top of the Matterhorn, despite feeling very ill . Sam couldn't breathe and was retching uncontrollably, so his guides radioed for him to be extracted by air . Final push: The Virgin Strive Challenge team pictured nearing the top . 'Helpless': Richard Branson was unable to assist his brave son as he circled the Matterhorn from the air . Amazing view: Sir Richard Branson looks across to the Matterhorn . The ascent to the summit of the 14,700-foot peak, which straddles the Swiss-Italian border, was undertaken as part of the Virgin Strive Challenge - and Branson senior, 64, watched the drama unfold from a helicopter at the end of last month. He told MailOnline how he felt helpless watching from above. He said: ‘I obviously didn't know that Sam was throwing up and had a horrendous headache that developed from altitude sickness. ‘I thought everything was going great. It was a beautiful day. We were circling the Matterhorn and had one door open. He was advised not to get to the top but I can understand having got to close that he went for it. 'I could see everyone huddling round somebody. He was retching and was in quite a bad way. 'Then, just as we were heading down, we saw an ambulance helicopter going up. We were short of fuel, so we landed. 'Then we heard that Sam had been medevaced off the top. They dangled him out of the door! He said he opened his eyes and saw the mountain spinning below him, so he felt even sicker than he did before. He was clutching his guide. 'They dropped him down to where we all were. He was shaken, but pleased that he'd accomplished the top of the Matterhorn, despite a slightly less than satisfactory end from his point of view.' He added: 'He was brought up watching me doing foolish things, whether it's transatlantic sailing records or going round world in balloons. I’m sure a bit of adventure bug has rubbed off on him. I’m a great believer to see what you're capable of and pushing yourself to the limits.' Sam told MailOnline that it involved a gigantic effort to reach the top. He said: 'One of the guides, mountaineer Kenton Cool, who’s summited Everest 11 times, told me 200 metres from the top that I’d have to be choppered down. He said: “If you dig deep we can get you to the top.” ‘Each step I would retch and cry. My team were being brilliant. They helped me push through the pain. They were heroes.’ Agony: Sam described how near the summit he would take one step and retch, then another step and retch again . Expert help: Sam was guided to the top of the Matterhorn by Kenton Cool, who has summited Everest 11 times . Poorly: Sam kneels down in the snow on the Matterhorn, unable to carry on . Sam was then picked up by a helicopter, which took him away as he dangled from a winch while attached to a rescuer. He said: 'They have to get off mountain because the winds can be so unpredictable, so they fly straight off. I had my eyes closed! I was in shock and not in the best way. I was emotionally drained and feeling sick. And the flight really freaked me out.’ He continued: ‘It was an epic ending to an epic adventure and I’m just glad everyone got down safely.’ The Matterhorn is known in the climbing community as being a challenging peak. Sam added: ‘There are sections where if you fall, you’re dead. And it gets more technical the higher you get.’ Hike: Sam Branson before he was overcome with altitude sickness .

"If you're out at the beach this weekend - like most Americans hope they will be - it might be an idea to look up. About 5,000 feet up, actually. That's about where Belgian photographer Antoine Rose will be making his works of art. The self-taught snapper initially started out taking pictures of kiteboarders as head photographer of the Kiteboarding World Cup, according to Fast Company. Then, while covering finals in Ipanema and Copacabana, Rose turned his lens from the water to the beach - and that's where the magic happened. Think this is a painting? It's not: Aerial photographer Antoine Rose takes pictures of crowded packed beaches from 5,000 feet in the air . Cartoonish: Rose claims that, save some basic touch ups, his photos are not edited or choreographed . The idea came to rose during a trip to Ipanema and Copacabana, where he was covering the Kiteboarding World Cup as head photographer . The series of photos has been titled 'Up In The Air' and is years in the making . Most of Rose's most recent work was shot in The Hamptons . Intricate: The photos come off as landscape-type paintings . Not your average occupation: A great deal of safety is required for the work Rose does . While the resultant photos appear heavily edited - almost cartoon-like - Rose said he does not do anything to his shots, save a few minor touch ups on PhotoShop. Also he does have anything to do with how the umbrellas, chairs or people are placed - that's just natural, he says. Most of his more recent pieces have been taken in The Hamptons and Miami, both of which are known for their colorful umbrellas and swimwear fashions. However, while the pictures are pretty and celebratory, there are many dangers to the work Rose does. Dangling out of a helicopter in order to get the shots takes many safety measures. Additionally, Rose told Fast Company he once had a close call with an Air Canada plane. The heights he travels to in order to capture the right photos is alot higher than routes helicopters typically take, and takes proper precaution from the pilot. Roses's photographs can be found in prestigious private and corporate collections . Some of the pieces are part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Arts and Design in New York . Puzzling: The effect of the photos almost makes the people and objects on the ground look like puzzle pieces . Rose also says that his work is part anthropological, because it documents certain human behaviors, such as the way people gather .

"It started as a corner shop herbalist in Nottingham in 1849, and grew to become one of the most recognisable names on the British high street. Now Boots the chemist is the latest home-grown brand to be sold off to an American firm – in a deal worth nearly £6billion. US giant Walgreens already owns a 45 per cent stake in the British chain, which it acquired for £4billion in 2012. It is now set to buy the remaining 55 per cent to become the sole owner. End of an era: Boots is the latest British brand to be sold off to a U.S. firm – in a deal worth nearly £6billion . Boots is the latest in a long line of well-known British brands to be sold off to foreign companies. US supermarket chain Walmart took over Asda in 1999, while Cadbury has been owned by American firm Kraft since 2010. Italian tycoon Stefano Pessina, the chairman of Boots, is set to make around £1.5billion from the deal. He and private equity firm KKR have owned the business since 2007. Walgreens and Boots have developed several joint initiatives over the past two years – for example, Boots’ popular No7 anti-ageing serums have been sold in the US by Walgreens stores. It is now possible the British outlets will stock more American brands, and may introduce US-style health screening clinics to allow customers to test their blood glucose or cholesterol levels. Walgreens bosses are planning a major cost-cutting exercise designed to save £594million by 2017, however it is unclear how this will affect the British firm’s 70,000 staff and 2,500 stores. Mr Pessina, 73, will be appointed executive vice chairman of the new business, called Walgreens Boots Alliance. He has described the deal as more of a ‘merger’ than an American takeover, adding that several British executives from Boots have already been given high-profile jobs by Walgreens. He said: ‘I strongly believe that the merger will bring significant growth opportunities for both mature and emerging markets. ‘Today’s announcement reflects the great track record and accomplishments of our people to date and I am convinced that their skills, expertise and commitment will continue to make a positive contribution.’ The sale will mean the US retailer owns more than 11,000 shops in 12 countries, as well as the largest pharmaceutical wholesale and distribution network in the world. Walgreens’ American boss, Greg Wasson, will run the new company as president and chief executive. Like Boots, Walgreens began as a single pharmacy. It was opened in 1901 by Charles R Walgreen Snr, and by 1919 had expanded to 20 stores selling food and drink as well as medicines. Much of its early success stemmed from selling whiskey on prescription during the prohibition era. Walgreens has come under fire for continuing to stock tobacco products alongside medicines, but the company claims this means it is more readily able to offer customers advice and products to help them quit smoking. When the deal was in its early stages, some suggested that Walgreens planned to move its headquarters from the US to Britain in order to save on corporation tax. But the firm has said this is not the case, and it will remain based at its current site in Chicago. Boots’ head office will stay in Nottingham, where the business was founded in 1849 by farm worker John Boot, a Methodist who felt strongly about the need to make medicines available to the poor. When he died in 1860 aged 45, his wife Mary and son Jesse took over the chain. By 1890, it had grown to more than 200 stores. ... but it could mean less queueing and cheaper medicines . By RUTH SUNDERLAND, Associate City Editor . Long queues to pick up a prescription at Boots could be a thing of the past after the chemist’s merger with Walgreens. The American giant, which has more than 8,000 outlets across the US, is more advanced when it comes to the technology it uses to run its pharmacy counters. Thanks to the superior systems, waiting times are usually shorter and pharmacists do not need to spend as much time rummaging around on the shelves behind the counter to find medicines. End of this headache? Customers wait to be served in a boots branch at Heathrow Airport, London . Boots in the UK could also copy Walgreens’ pharmacy apps. One allows customers to get a repeat prescription by scanning their medicine’s barcode on a smartphone. They can then pick up their order in just 30 minutes. At flagship Walgreens shops, there is also a no-appointment-needed doctor service, which could be replicated here. The US pharmacies offer many more vaccinations, including those for travellers going to exotic locations. If Boots began offering these services, it would save British customers the inconvenience of a trip to the doctor’s surgery for a jab. In the longer term, Boots’ American deal could lead to cheaper drugs, thanks to a separate partnership it has forged with a US wholesaler called AmerisourceBergen. After the Boots-Walgreens merger they will be able to hand in medicine orders together, putting them in a very strong position to achieve the lowest prices. Combined, the pair will be the biggest purchaser of non-patent drugs on the planet. And the traffic is not all one way. While Boots is a mid-market staple of the British shopping scene, pharmacies in the US are an entirely different matter. ‘Drugstores’ are typically cheap and cheerful bazaars where toiletries and vitamin pills nestle next to cheap electronic goods, lurid cuddly toys and even fridges full of beer. When it comes to cosmetics, drugstores offer budget brands, usually with no testers or ladies in white coats to advise. Women wanting a more upmarket experience have to head for the glitzy department stores and pay top dollar for designer lotions and potions. But Boots is set to bring a slice of the British high street to Walgreens, launching wider ranges of its well-known brands including No7 and Botanics in US stores, and recruiting in-house beauty advisers. It will sell well-loved products such as No7 lipsticks to US women, and remodel Walgreens stores along British lines. Finally, UK customers will be relieved to learn that the Advantage loyalty card will not be affected by the merger, and that the familiar ‘three for two’ offers on Boots products will continue as normal.","US chain Walgreens is set to buy the 55 per cent of Boots is doesn't yet own .

The 49-year-old journalist describes the collapse of their nine-year affair after a  gossip magazine published pictures of Mr Hollande visiting his mistress on a moped. And she reveals he sent her 29 texts in one day trying to win her back – while still seeing his lover, TV actress Julie Gayet. The book, Thank You For This Moment, has sent shockwaves through France, where politicians’ private lives are not publicly aired. Miss Trierweiler received an advance of some £70,000 for the first kiss-and-tell account of a serving head of state. Extracts detailing the ‘cruelty’ of a ‘passionate, possessive and mad’ affair appeared yesterday in Paris Match magazine. But the most damaging claim is that Mr Hollande is a snob who mocks the poor. Miss Trierweiler, whose maiden name is Massonneau, recalls spending Christmas with her working-class family. She writes that Mr Hollande quipped: ‘They’re not very nice, the Massonneau family.’ She says her family ‘is so typical of his electors’, adding: ‘He stood for election as a man who does not like the rich. In reality, the President does not like the poor. He, the man of the Left, calls them the toothless ones. He’s very proud of his humour.’ Mr Hollande sacked Miss Trierweiler as his first lady on January 25 in a short official statement. But she says he had already lied brazenly to her about Miss Gayet, 42. She claims to have confronted him when rumours spread in December 2013, saying: ‘“Swear to me on my son’s life that it’s false and we won’t talk about it any more”. He swears, and dismisses it as nonsense.’ When the truth emerged, she spent eight days in hospital for ‘stress’. Disturbingly, she writes: ‘Julie Gayet was top of the  morning news. I’m cracking up, I can’t hear anything, I rush to the bathroom. I take the small plastic bag containing sleeping pills. Francois follows me. He tries to snatch the bag. ‘I run into the bedroom. The pills scatter on to the bed and floor. I manage to grab them. I swallow what I can. I want to sleep. I feel the storm about to break around me, and I don’t have the strength to resist.’ Scroll down for video . Bitter: Miss Trierweiler pictured with French President Francois Hollande, who she has portrayed as a hypocrite . After their split, Mr Hollande attempted to remain in contact, said Miss Trierweiler, on one day ‘sending me 29 text messages’. Miss Trierweiler – known as the Rottweiler – claims that on August 12, his 60th birthday, when many were speculating he might marry Miss Gayet, Mr Hollande texted his former lover: ‘It is up to you to say yes to me’. Elysee Palace sources said the President – nicknamed Flanby, for a brand of caramel pudding – had been ‘completely unaware of this book’. Meanwhile Paris Match, where Miss Trierweiler works, describes it as ‘both a scream of love and a slow descent into hell, a dive into the intimacy of a couple. Two people and nothing else – Valerie and Francois.’ Over 12 . pages, it tells the story of Miss Trierweiler’s ‘passionate, possessive, . mad love for this man whom I loved, who made me laugh, and who . destabilised me deliciously’. Miss . Trierweiler says she felt ‘dehumanised’ throughout the Socialist . politician’s rise to power because she was seen as his mistress, and . talks of feeling ‘illegitimate’ when Mr Hollande won the presidency in . 2012. Of the day he came to power, she writes: ‘He’s cold, he doesn’t smile. I’m his stooge, but I have no value.’ Thank .

"Divorce can be a turbulent time, so why not do it in extreme comfort? That's the big sell behind Gideon Putnam Resort & Spa, a luxury resort in upstate New York's, latest venture. Previously renowned for putting on lavish weddings the hotel and spa has turned it's attention to quick splits with $5,000 (£3,000) weekend divorce packages. For that amount you and your soon-to-be ex husband can make a weekend of it with access to the baths and spa, tennis, hiking, swimming, golf courses and  ice skating, in between trips to your attorney. Excess baggage? Gideon Putnam Resort and Spa in Saratoga Springs in New York will take care of it . Sound like a nice way to break-up? The 'Divorce Hotel' has only two criteria: you must be a US citizen and  agree to use the attorneys and mediators provided by the hotel. A jolly on the golf course this ain't - you have to be fully committed to your forthcoming divorce. Over the weekend guests work with mediators to finalise the sticky details into a signed agreement and, if they choose, the whole process can be filmed as part of a new reality show made by A. Smith and Co., the production company behind Gordon Ramsay’s 'Kitchen Nightmares'. Visit the hotel's Roosevelt Baths  for sanctuary from your other half before you make the break . Program founder Jim Halfens told the New York Post, 'Practically, they are divorced after signing on Sunday.' 'After signing, all work is done and we send it to a judge who only puts a stamp on it to make it official.' Halfens, who already runs similar projects in his native Netherlands, expects to start up his services at the end of September. Rob Sgarlata, a hotel representative, stated, 'They want people to get into an environment that minimizes the stress of the situation and that's exactly what we offer.' Couples  check into separate rooms and   use a shared suite for 'mediation' talks . He added, 'We welcome all kinds of guests.' Problems could arise when weddings and divorces are held at the same time but Sgarlata says the hotel will keep the milestones separate. 'We would be sensitive to having them in different parts of the hotel,' he said.","Gideon Putnam Resort & Spa in New York charges couples £5,000 for  stay .

"The family of the man who police say shot himself in the back while under arrest  are asking for a new investigation into his death, following the release of a coroner's report which found the bullet actually entered through the front of his body. Louisiana State Police said in a March release that they arrested 23-year-old Victor White after he got into an alleged fight and he was found in possession of drugs. White was transported to the sheriff's office in a police car, and his hands were handcuffed behind him, police said. While handcuffed, White fired a bullet into his own back and later died, police said. Speaking out: Benjamin Crump speaks at a podium in a Monday news conference. Victor White's parents, Vanessa and the Rev. Victor White Sr., are seen to his right standing behind . Was it something else? Victor White, who police claim shot himself, is seen in this file photo . 'Once at the Sheriff’s Office, White became uncooperative and refused to exit the deputy’s patrol vehicle,' the release said. 'As the deputy requested assistance from other deputies, White produced a handgun and fired one round striking himself in the back.' The coroner's report, however, cited a gunshot wound to the chest,The Times-Picayune reported. At a Monday press conference, Benjamin Crump, the attorney for White's family, said 'We think the Justice Department has to do an independent investigation. We cannot rely on the State Police here in Louisiana who work so closely with the New Iberia Sheriff's Department,' the newspaper reported. 'How is it than [police] can find these soft packages [of drugs on him] but they can't find a hard gun?' Crump also reportedly said. Mystery: Attorney Benjamin Crump said the claim that Victor White shot himself 'just continues to defy all logic' WDSU reported that Crump also said, '[White] has to somehow get his arms over his head, shoot himself in the chest, from right to the left - even though he's left handed, so he doesn't use his dominant hand - and then, on top of all of that, the bullet as it gets across, it doesn't go downward, it goes upward. 'It just continues to defy all logic.' Rev Victor White Sr. was filmed by Times-Picayune saying 'I'll say this: my son didn't kill himself' at the press conference. 'My son had too much going on in his life at that time to take his life,' he also said.","Victor White's family and attorneys have asked for a separate investigation into whether or not White killed himself .

"The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa could infect more than 20,000 people, the World Health Organisation has revealed in a bleak assessment of the deadly disease. The United Nations health agency issued plans to combat the outbreak in four West African nations - Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria - where it said the actual number of cases could already be two to four times higher than the reported 3,069. The current death toll stands at 1,552. The news comes as a new outbreak was confirmed in the Democratic Republic of Congo after a pregnant woman contracted the disease from infected bush meat and passed it on to health workers. Scroll down for video . Treatment: The World Health Organisation has revealed plans to combat Ebola in four West African nations - Guinea (pictured), Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria - where it said the actual number of cases could already be far higher than the reported 3,069. The death toll in the West African epidemic alone currently stands at 1,552 . Grim: A group of young volunteers wear special uniforms for the burial of people in Kptema graveyard in Kenema, Sierra Leone earlier this week. The victims' bodies are sterilized after dying from the virus . Describing plans to tackle the West African outbreak, the WHO said: 'This roadmap assumes that in many areas of intense transmission the actual number of cases may be two-four fold higher than that currently reported.' 'It acknowledges that the aggregate case load of Ebola Virus Disease could exceed 20,000 over the course of this emergency,' the agency added. The deadly West African outbreak that began in Guinea in March and has since spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, requires a massive and coordinated international response, the WHO said. 'Response activities must be adapted in areas of very intense transmission and particular attention must be given to stopping transmission in capital cities and major ports, thereby facilitating the larger response and relief effort,' the WHO said. The virus is still being spread in a 'substantial number of localities', aggravating fragile social and economic conditions and has already killed an unprecedented number of health workers. Today it was revealed that Nigeria has confirmed its first Ebola death outside the city of Lagos, with a doctor succumbing to the virus in the oil hub Port Harcourt last Friday. A further 70 people are now under surveillance in the city, with the man's wife among those that have been placed in quarantine. Protection: The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa - which began in Guinea (pictured) - could infect more than 20,000 people, the World Health Organisation has revealed in a bleak assessment of the deadly disease . A woman washes her child with salted water in a suburb of the Côte d’Ivoire capital Abidjan. The woman was relying on a rumor that was spread in the area claiming that salted water helps to fight against the deadly virus . A wider U.N.-led plan being launched by the end of September is 'expected to underpin support for the increasingly acute problems associated with food security, protection, water, sanitation and hygiene, primary and secondary health care and education, as well as the longer-term recovery effort that will be needed,' the WHO said in today's report. A separate outbreak of Ebola in Democratic Republic of Congo - identified as a different strain and thought to have started when a pregnant woman contracted the virus from infected bush meat - is not included in the WHO's forecast. An unnamed woman in the village of Ikanamongo in DRC's northern Equateur Province is believed to have butchered an animal that had been captured and killed by her husband shortly before falling ill. The woman was subsequently transported to a private clinic in nearby Isaka village for specialist care due to her pregnancy, but she subsequently died of a then-unidentified haemorrhagic fever. The Ebola then infected and killed a number of the woman's relatives and health care workers due to local customs and rituals carried out on her corpse that delayed her funeral by more than a week. Infection zone: People stand on the shoreline near a sign reading 'No Dumping', amongst rubbish at West Point - an area of the Liberian capital Monrovia that is badly hit by the  Ebola virus . Lock down: Local residents not allowed to leave the West Point area,  as Liberian government forces clamp down on movement to prevent the spread of Ebola in the capital city Monrovia . The DRC's Ministry of Health notified the World Health Organization of the outbreak on Tuesday, following the woman's death on August 11. Since then a number of her relatives and at least four health-care workers who were exposed to her corpse have died, and there a reports several others are seriously ill. In a report, WHO blamed 'local customs and rituals associated with death' for delaying the woman's burial and dramatically increasing the number of people coming into close contact with her body. Between 28 July and 18 August this year, a total of 24 suspected cases of Ebola have been identified in the DRC, leading to at least 13 deaths. It is Congo's seventh outbreak since the deadly hemorrhagic fever was discovered in 1976 in the same isolated northwestern jungle province in which the pregnant woman died. Spread: Nurses wearing protective suits enter a Liberian village in order to search for a man suspected of being infected with the deadly Ebola virus. The man was later taken to a hospital in Monrovia for treatment . Crucially, the strain currently infecting people in DRC is different to that which has already killed at least 1,427 people in West Africa - which has somewhat allayed fears that the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history could have somehow travelled thousands of miles to the continent's centre. Among the healthcare workers known to have died shortly after coming in to contact with the pregnant woman are one doctor and two nurses who performed her surgery, a male ward assistant, and a hygiene specialist working in the clinic. WHO said an unknown number of her relatives involved in 'local customs and rituals' relating to her death have also now died, without expanding on what those practices might have been. A further 11 cases are being held in isolation centres suffering the suspected symptoms of the disease - which kills in the vast majority of cases - with tissue samples sent to laboratories in the DRC's capital Kinshasa, and in neighbouring Gabon for further analysis. In total it is believed at least 80 people came into close enough contact to contract the virus from the pregnant woman between the time of her infection and eventual burial. Tragic: A Liberian man in a truck looks down on another man believed to be dying from the Ebola virus, in one of the main streets on the outskirts of the capital city Monrovia earlier this week . In response to the outbreak, the DRC's Ministry of Health has dispatched teams of scientists and investigators to Equateur Province in order to evaluate the situation there and work out how many other people may be at risk - either from human-to-human transmission or from infected bush meat. Neither the deceased pregnant woman nor any of her 80 contacts have any history of travel to the areas of West Africa currently hit by an alternative strain of Ebola. News of the DRC outbreak comes as U.S. health officials prepared to announce that a human study of an Ebola vaccine made by GlaxoSmithKline will begin within a couple of weeks. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, will start the study no later than the end of the year, according to people familiar with the plans. In addition, a steering committee made up of senior officials from NIH and the Department of Defense last week approved the first step toward using three advanced laboratories to manufacture Ebola vaccines and treatments. The three labs, in Texas, Maryland and North Carolina, were set up in 2012 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in partnership with private industry to respond to pandemics or chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear threats. A GSK spokeswoman confirmed that the trial would begin but declined to specify when.","World Health Organisation delivers bleak assessment of African outbreak .

"Waste: Women will throw away £26 of unwanted Christmas beauty gifts, totalling £676million, every year, according to new research . Nine out of ten British women will receive beauty products from loved ones this Christmas – but a jaw-dropping £676million worth will never be used, according to a poll. The average British woman will throw away two Christmas beauty gifts, worth an average of £26, according to new research by teeth-whitening brand Blanx. One in five UK women admit they will discard even more unwanted Christmas beauty gifts, totalling up to an eye-popping value of £60, this year. Senior Brand Manager for Blanx, Louise Marks: 'Men be warned. If that designer lipstick, the one that just cost you a fortune, isn’t your lady’s preferred colour or that make-up you just ordered from a bespoke beauty house in Paris is a shade too light, it doesn’t matter that it took you three weeks to source and order it, it’s going to land in a bin sooner rather than later.' While the average UK woman buys almost three new beauty products for herself per month they tend to stick to the same tried and tested brands they know and trust. More than seven out of 10 women say they continue to buy the same beauty products because of 'positive usage'. Meanwhile, just over 12 per cent buy on the recommendation of others. A further 18.5 per cent buy the same beauty brands out of loyalty and some 24.7 per cent buy the same brands because of habit. Buyer beware: If it's not the right shade or brand for the lady, it's probably destined for the bin . Ms Marks added: 'British women are very loyal to their favourite brands and tend to want to stick with the beauty products they know and love. 'They very rarely choose a new beauty product based on a recommendation from others and choose their make-up and other beauty essentials out of habit, loyalty and, most importantly, because it has had a positive result for them in the past. 'Men need to be aware that it is easy to get it wrong when buying beauty products for their ladies at Christmas and British women are not scared of being ruthless when it comes to their beauty regime.'","On average, British women will bin £26 of unwanted beauty gifts .

"David Strettle reminded England coach Stuart Lancaster of his predatory credentials with a match-winning hat-trick that helped erase the painful memories of Saracens last Twickenham visit. The former England international, who finished last season as the Aviva Premiership’s leading English-qualified try-scorer with 11 touchdowns, was back in business again on Saturday as Mark McCall’s men made hard work of putting Dai Young’s resurgent Wasps away. His last-minute try - awarded by Television Match Official David Sainsbury but contested by Young and his Wasps charges - stole what would have been a famous victory from Wasps; who also failed to win on the opening day of last season by the narrowest of margins. Match winner: A straining David Strettle crosses for the winning try . Elusive: Christian Wade crosses for his second try . Back in it: Nathan Hughes touches down to begin Wasps' comeback . Concentration: Wasps' Joe Simpson passes the ball off the back of a scrum . Saracens have spent the summer employing a variety of methods to help support their players, including one similar to that used to treat service veterans suffering Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, following the agony of losing in both European and domestic finals. But there’s nothing like getting back on the bike. On Saturday they had Strettle to thank following a below-par performance that saw them take a 21-6 first-half lead before allowing another winger with England credentials, Christian Wade, to put Wasps within sight of victory before Strettle pounced. ‘We had drama here at the end of last season and we had drama here again today,’ said Strettle. ‘The intensity wasn’t there all the time but we got there in the end.’ The 31-year-old Strettle made the last of his 14 England appearances on tour in Argentina 15 months ago and has been overtaken in the pecking order by the likes of Marland Yarde, Jack Nowell, Jonny May, Chris Ashton and his opposite man in this game, Wade. Opener: Strettle dives over for his and Saracens' first try . Dive for the line: Chris Ashton stretches to score a try . Delighted: Strettle celebrates his opening score with Billy Vunipola and Ashton . Committed: It was a tense encounter at Twickenham between London rivals Wasps and Saracens . ‘I still have England ambitions but you should be asking Stuart Lancaster,’ Strettle added. ‘I want to be involved in the World Cup. I think I played well enough last season to be in the squad but nobody has told me what I need to do to get there.’ Wade will consider himself unlucky to have been on the losing side after producing an enormously encouraging display on his first game back since suffering a serious foot injury at the tail end of last season which cost him his place on England’s tour to New Zealand. In truth, the whole Wasps team will be kicking themselves after battling their way back from an awful first-half display to find themselves 28-20 in front when Wade touched down for his second try after 60 minutes. They only had themselves to blame in front of 66,164 at Twickenham. First, Strettle latched on to replacement Owen Farrell’s clever pass to cross in the left-hand corner. The fly-half converted to make the score 28-27. Doubling up: Strettle claims his second try during the thrilling victory over Wasps . Nice job: Andy Goode congratulates Wade on his second try . Animated: Saracens celebrate Ashton's first half score . As Wasps sensed a repeat of last season’s defeat to Harlequins on day one of the season, Young’s men seemed to suffer a case of the collective collywobbles. Flanker Ashley Johnson — outstanding up until that point — stood still before hitting a ruck close to Saracens’ line before being penalised by referee Andrew Small and allowing Saracens to clear their lines and breathe again. Centre Duncan Taylor burst through the Wasps midfield and Farrell was again on hand to feed Strettle to bounce over in the corner with Elliot Daly in close attendance. Referee Small referred the decision to the TMO and, just like last season’s final on the same ground, the decision went in the attacking team’s favour. This time, unlike their last-gasp defeat to Northampton in May, Saracens were the beneficiaries. ‘It’s important we recognised there was some hurt from last season,’ McCall said. ‘We’ve talked about the response we’ve wanted to have to the way last season ended. There’s certainly been no self-pity at our club. We’ve moved on.’ Divine intervention: Hughes points to the sky after scoring . Close call: Wade just about touches down in the corner under the eagle eyes of the line judge . Ruck: Saracens and Wasps players battle for the ball at Twickenham . Sin bin: Saracens' Kelly Brown is shown the yellow card . Young, sat disbelieving as his side blew their second London double header in succession, was left fuming at the decision to award Strettle’s third try after he’d opened his account with another contentious first-half effort which saw him make the slightest of contacts with Wasps full back Rob Miller before touching down. ‘Our first 40 minutes weren’t good enough,’ said Young. ‘We were much better in the second half but ended up committing suicide. There were two decisions which didn’t go our way. But the reason Sarries are a champion team is because they take every single opportunity they get.’ Wasps replacement prop Phil Swainston will be assessed this week after passing the newly updated 10-minute Head Injury Assessment only to suffer another head knock when he returned.","Strettle crossed in the last minute after Wasps' brilliant comeback looked to have won the season opener .

"Fabio Moniz, 27, has been sentenced to life in jail after being convicted of raping two women last year and attempting to assault others . A predatory rapist who posed as a gay Vogue  photographer to snare wealthy young victims was jailed for life yesterday. Fabio Moniz, 27, toured exclusive West End venues to charm women with his ‘cut glass’ accent and immaculate manners. But he poisoned them with the date rape drug GHB before subjecting them to sexual assaults. He told the court that his life was like that of conman Frank  Abagnale portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the film Catch Me If You Can. Yesterday Moniz was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of nine years for raping two women. But detectives suspect he may have claimed many more victims. In 2009 he was cleared of attacking an American tourist. Judge Patricia Lees told Snaresbrook Crown Court that the Portuguese national was a ‘lone predator’ and a ‘very dangerous character’. Moniz prowled the West End hunting for victims at fashionable nightclubs including Whisky Mist and Mahiki. His Facebook page is full of  pictures of him posing with women at nightspots in the capital. He pretended to be a photographer, club promoter and even claimed to work for City accountants KPMG and to have partied with celebrities including pop star Rihanna. In the first of the attacks in September last year, he approached two women outside the Funky Buddha nightclub. Telling them he ‘works in the fashion business with supermodels’ they went to another club where he spiked their drinks. The rapist posed as a homosexual fashion photographer before attacking women in flats and hotels across London . Moniz fed his victims drinks laced with date-rape drugs such as GHB which leaves very little trace in the body . One of them said: ‘He was smartly . dressed in a denim shirt, sweater and jeans and had a cut-glass accent . with a slight lisp.’ Moniz took them back to a flat in Bermondsey, . south-east London, where one woke up to discover him trying to have sex . with her. Just 20 days . later he targeted an American in her early thirties who was dining alone . in Claridges. He told her he was gay and had just finished a Vogue . photoshoot before taking her to a club. She can remember little more . except she woke up naked in her hotel room with Moniz beside her. In . both cases he stole personal possessions including credit cards. Moniz . was confronted in court by a second American who accused him of raping . her in 2009. The woman, now a successful financial analyst, travelled . back to Britain to give evidence against him. Police . do not know how long Moniz has been in Britain. Detective . Superintendent Kate Halpin said: ‘Given the nature of his crimes, it is . highly likely Moniz  has committed further offences.’ Moniz, . of no fixed address, who was convicted of two counts of rape and one of . attempted rape at an earlier hearing, was ordered to sign the sex . offenders’ register for life.","Fabio Moniz posed as a gay fashion photographer to prey on women in top London bars and nightclubs .

"The chairman of the Maine Republican Party says he is investigating after 'dozens and dozens of black people' voted on Election Day in rural Maine - but 'nobody in town knows anybody that's black'. The GOP politician's allegations have been heavily criticized by Democrats and has drawn skepticism from state elections officials. Charlie Webster said he has suspicions about voter fraud because hundreds of first-time voters registered on Election Day. Scroll down for video . Outrage: GOP chairman Charlie Webster said he had his suspicions about voter fraud because 'dozens and dozens of black people' voted in rural Maine communities . Charlie Webster said he has suspicions about voter fraud because hundreds of first-time voters registered on Election Day. He refused to say what towns he was talking about or reveal other specifics, but claimed his allegations are not racially motivated. He first made the allegations on a local Portland TV station. Webster said: ‘It doesn’t matter to me whether they’re black or Chinese or Indonesian. The issue isn’t that. The issue is that people have come into vote that no one had seen before.' Megan Sanborn, spokeswoman for the secretary of state’s office, said no one has complained to election officials about voter fraud and that there are no plans for an investigation. She said Secretary of State Charlie Summers was surprised by Webster’s allegations and said the office doesn’t open investigations based on hearsay. Ms Sanborn said: 'We haven’t received . any phone calls regarding anyone concerned about voter fraud or . anything along those lines. 'Secretary . Summers feels that every Maine person has the right to vote and he . encourages people to vote. Maine has one of the highest voter turnouts . in the state and Secretary Summers is proud of that.' Underhand? A GOP politician has raised allegations of voter fraud in rural parts of Maine (pictured the state capital, Augusta) Nevertheless, Webster declined to back down today, saying people who think there’s no voter fraud 'have their heads in the sand'. He said he’s concerned that get-out-the-vote efforts by Democrats and liberal groups may have crossed the line by getting ineligible voters to the polling places. Democratic Party spokeswoman Lizzy Reinholt characterized the allegations as sour grapes and noted that the GOP has made voter fraud accusations in the past that weren’t borne out. 'It’s sad to see that rather than reflecting on devastating losses of his party and going quietly, he continues to spew misinformation and to use fear-mongering as an excuse,' she said. As of the 2010 census, 94 per cent of Maine's population was white, 1.1 per cent African-American, 0.6 per cent American-Indian and Alaska Native, 1 per cent Asian and 1.3 per cent Hispanic.",Charlie Webster of the Maine Republican Party said 'we're going to find out  what happened' in rural communities .
"In Fine Style: The Art of Tudor and Stuart Fashion features a 400-year-old waistcoat and jacket reportedly worn by Charles I . A new exhibition in Buckingham Palace proves that the Stuarts were in a league of their own when it came to power-dressing. In Fine Style: The Art of Tudor and Stuart Fashion is the latest exhibition in the Queen's Gallery and brings garments from the 16th and 17th centuries together with paintings from the same era to convey how trends and attitudes towards fashion have changed over the years. This exhibition explores in fine detail the costume of British monarchs and their court during the 200-year period through the carefully preserved items of clothing and portraits borrowed from the Royal Collection. In Fine Style: The Art of Tudor and Stuart Fashion exhibition at Buckingham Palace proves that the Stuarts had impeccable style. Right, a 400-year-old waistcoat is in near-perfect condition . The collection follows the changing styles over the time and, with items rich in lavish embroidery or boosted by dramatic shoulderpads, clearly portrays how clothing was used to depict status - a kind of power-dressing for the Royals, if you like. Including works by Hans Holbein the Younger, Nicholas Hilliard, Van Dyck . and Peter Lely, the exhibition brings together more than 60 paintings, as . well as drawings, garments, jewellery, accessories and armour. The star of the show is a 400-year-old ladies' waistcoat with floral embroidery, which is in near-perfect condition. The garment, which dates from the reign of James I, would have been treated like a family heirloom, said Anna Reynolds, who curated the exhibition. Speaking to the Telegraph, she said: 'Fashion was just as important back then as it is now, if not more so. 'They would be used to make a statement, and people's attitude to clothes was very different from today,' She explained how even the most simple item such as a white shirt would go through around 20 different processes before it was complete and would then have to be bleached in the sun for a further seven months.

'Clothes were passed from person to person [...] and it would have been considered an honour to receive a second-hand item as a gift from someone.'

"A 26-year-old writer who published an article about saving her virginity until she is married has been inundated with support on social media. Ellen Burkhardt, from Minnesota, wrote an article about her decision for Salon Magazine. And she since wrote the piece she has been overwhelmed with well-wishers who have praised her bravery for publicly discussing such a personal topic. Scroll down for video . Ellen Burkhardt, from Minnesota, has created a buzz on social media about her decision to stay a virgin until after she is married . In the piece Burkhardt says she finds it difficult to explain to men she is dating that she will not have sex until after marriage, but she is planning to stick to her decision. 'I should be better at sharing this bit of information by now. I'm a 26-year-old woman with a college degree, a good job, an adorable duplex and no debt. 'I have a solid group of friends, a supportive family and a clear awareness of who I am and who I want to be. 'By most accounts, I am a successful human being. Yet the moment I have to tell the guy I'm dating that sex is not an option, I become a squirmy, awkward, fidgety girl who can't make eye contact or put together a complete sentence.' In the article Burkhardt talks about being a Christian . Burkhardt, declares she is a 'Christian. Not a Bible-thumping, the-world-is-going-to-hell-in-a-handbasket Christian, but a (sexually) conservative, Bible-believing, traditionally raised Minnesota Lutheran girl who was taught that sex is for marriage and that's that.' Burkhardt details her previous relationships in which the boys have either lost interest immediately or end it with her a few months down the line. She says a man she titles as 'Boy One' fell into the 'celibacy-then-bail category' and it ended with a drunken row about her choice. Another relationship 'Boy Two' was simply a rebound and Burkhardt admits she told him she did not see them going in the direction of marriage so sex was not an issue and they finished. But she says 'Boy Three' who worked at her church was a devout and serious Christian, but he pressured her until she felt outside her 'comfort zone', and would throw a tantrium because she would not relent. Burkhardt insists her decision has not made her unhappy, but instead says: 'I've come to realize that of all the experiences and opportunities offered in life, to love someone is the most precious.' After her article started gaining traction on social media Burkhardt gave an interview to CBS Local about its response. 'Clearly I've hit a nerve, and maybe more people feel the way I do, then we realize and they've just been too intimidated to share that perspective,' she said. Burkhardt said: 'Clearly I've hit a nerve, and maybe more people feel the way I do, then we realize' She said she wants her article to help other people who are in the minority too. 'Take the time to really find out who you are, what you want. 'Once you figure that out, just stick to it,' she said. 'For me, it's not having sex until I'm in love and married.' Social media was hugely supportive of Burkhardt's confessional piece, with many claiming to have been inspired by her honesty. On Twitter, user @Bre wrote that 'We need more people like Ellen Burkhardt in this world...she's just telling her story without judging others.' In an article posted to her blog, Deadreamer, writer, Sarah Lampkin said that she didn't feel so isolated now that Burkhardt had penned her article. 'Being a vigin can feel like a bad thing in our society,' wrote Lampkin. 'It feels as though we are mocked for our virginity.' 'But after reading Ellen's article, I have some hope......I do hope you go and read her article. It is inspiring and helps give me a small peace of mind.'","Ellen Burkhardt, from Minnesota, wrote article about her decision .

"Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho thought Arsenal trio Laurent Koscielny, Calum Chambers and Danny Welbeck should have bee sent off during Chelsea's 2-0 win at Stamford Bridge - but refused to criticise referee Martin Atkinson .

Mourinho said: 'I think the referee, from a technical point of view, had a fantastic performance in a difficult, technical, fast match with lots of runs behind - also the linesmen had a difficult game and I think they did a fantastic job. 'But Arsenal could have finished with eight men, because it is a red card for Koscielny, it is a double yellow card for Chambers in the first half, and clear was a red card for Welbeck. ""But I accept that the Welbeck red card was not given - the game was over and Welbeck is a good kid and is not aggressive. It was maybe just a reaction, some frustration. 'So I have no complaint really.' Arsene Wenger shoved Mourinho in the chest with 20 minutes gone at Stamford Bridge on Sunday . Mourinho downplayed his first half touchline bust-up with Arsenal manager Wenger by insisting it was 'no problem'. Asked about the incident, Mourinho said: 'For me, it is over. 'But the technical area is very clear - I have mine, he has his and he cannot come to mine, especially to put pressure on the referee to give a red card to my player. 'So I just told him ""leave my technical area and don't come back please"".' Mourinho, pictured with Roman Abramovich and the Chelsea owner's son Arkadiy, looked in jubilant mood . Abramovich will have been delighted with his side's performance against London rivals Arsenal . The Chelsea owner, pictured shaking Mourinho's hand, saw his side pick up all three points at the Bridge .","Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho thought Laurent Koscielny, Calum Chambers and Danny Welbeck were all lucky to stay on the field .
