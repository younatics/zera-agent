"Amir Khan will give Floyd Mayweather Jnr until the end of the week to agree to fight him. The Bolton welterweight had been confident that his dominant victory over Devon Alexander last month would set him up for the Las Vegas mega-fight. But he has grown frustrated after his efforts to negotiate a deal with the best boxer in the world drew a blank. Amir Khan, pictured beating Devon Alexander, wants to fight Floyd Mayweather next . Khan has given Mayweather a deadline of five days to decide if he wants to fight . The pound-for-pound boxing king shakes hands with LA Lakers star Kobe Bryant . ‘I want to fight in May and I want the Mayweather fight but it’s not getting any closer,’ Khan admitted to Sportsmail. ‘I’ve answered all the things Mayweather wanted me to do. He wanted me to fight at welterweight, I did that; he wanted to do a vote [to see who he would fight], I won the vote; he wanted me to beat a top guy in the division and I gave Devon Alexander a beating he’d never had before. ‘There is a lot of money in a fight with me, not just in America, but he’s trying to avoid me. He’s avoiding two names in boxing, Manny Pacquiao and Amir Khan. ‘Mayweather wants to keep his ‘0’, he doesn’t want to take the big fights. If he’s not fighting the top guys but is fighting guys who are over the hill or not at their peak, he’s going to be undefeated. ‘One thing about me is I’ve fought guys at their peak and who have been dangerous. I didn’t have to fight them but I did. Losing doesn’t make you a bad fighter, losing shows how good you are if you come back from those losses. The 37-year-old boxer shares a joke with a friend while watching  the Lakers take on the Indiana Pacers . Mayweather's last fight was against Argentine Marcos Maidana back in September of 2014 . Khan prays alongside Pakistani military officials at the memorial of the school where 150 people were killed . Manny Pacquiao is also desperate to fight Mayweather, but could also fight Khan if the American refuses . ‘It’s a waiting game, I’ve given his team five days. I need to know this week because I need to start training.’ Should Mayweather look elsewhere for what he has said will be the penultimate fight of his illustrious career, Khan will turn to his former training partner Pacquiao or British rival Kell Brook. The Filipino is also desperate to face Mayweather while Brook is set to return in March after recovering from being stabbed in Tenerife last August. ‘If Mayweather doesn’t take the fight then maybe the Pacquiao fight will be more interesting for me,’ Khan said. ‘We’ve sparred and trained together, we are friends and it would be a good fight. I have youth on my side and I’m a smart fighter. I’ve improved since I’ve been with my new trainer but Manny is the same fighter he was five years ago. ‘The thing with Kell Brook is that he hasn’t fought since he was stabbed. He wants to have a warm-up fight then have a big one. ‘I don’t think it will happen soon but it could happen towards the end of the year. It’s a fight that interests me.’ UK’s leading sports nutrition brand, MaxiNutrition is supporting Amir Khan to be at his best in 2015 #MyGoal.

"Horrified rush-hour passengers were trapped in a ‘runaway’ Tube train which ran through four stations without stopping on Friday. The Tube driver told passengers on the Southbound Northern Line train that he had lost control of the train because a new automated system had ‘overridden’ his commands. It sparked safety fears with rail unions demanding urgent answers to what exactly happened and why. The Northern Line train took off from Old Street Station on Friday afternoon and ran amok after the new automated system 'overrode' driver's commands (stock image) London Underground later apologised for the incident which it initially blamed on a ‘technical fault with the signalling system’ which they later believe may have been down to human error. It said the problem occurred because a ‘don’t stop’ instruction given to one stricken but empty train being taken out of service  was inadvertently carried across to a second fully functioning train just behind - which was supposed to stop for passengers. The saga comes just a year after London Underground and its contractors were fined £300,000 for an earlier runaway train incident which the judge said had put lives at risk of a potential ‘terrible tragedy.’ Eyewitness said Friday’s drama happened at the height of rush-hour around 5pm after passengers were told to evacuate a ‘defective’ train at Old Street Underground station before it was taken out of service. They then boarded another Tube train right behind to take them on to their destinations. No break: The train passed four stations before finally stopping at Elephant and Castle . The second train duly set off and should have stopped first at Moorgate, but instead carried on through the station, then past Bank, London Bridge and Borough before finally coming to a stop at Elephant and Castle. Hannah Downing, 25, from Chislehurst in Kent, described how drama unfolded at Old Street Station when the train in front of hers broke down. Passengers from that stricken train transferred to hers and both continued on their way. She said: ‘It was weird. The automated woman’s voice on our train said we would not be stopping at the next station. Then the driver came on and told us he did not know what was happening nor why we weren’t stopping. ‘Then we went past three more stations and it was the same story.’ ‘We eventually did come to a stop at Elephant and Castle but the doors wouldn’t open. ‘The driver came on the intercom to apologise. ‘He told passengers they had got a new automated system and it had not let him stop. It had overridden his commands and not letting him stop the train at the stations. ‘He said they had been having issues with the new automated system. London Underground confirmed there had been a ‘technical fault with the signalling system’ which they believe may have amounted to human error and apologised for the mistake. Signallers had programmed the first defective train to continue without stopping to Kennington. However, they had then failed to rescind that instruction for the second train. So it too continued without stopping. It stressed no-one had been hurt. Pat Hansbury, general manager of the Northern line, London Underground, said: ‘I apologise to customers who were inconvenienced when they were unable to alight at their usual stops for a short time on a southbound Northern line train this afternoon. ‘When an earlier defective train was taken out of service at Old Street station it was set to run directly to Kennington without stopping at the stations in between. ‘Due to this instruction this meant that the replacement train, which took on passengers at Old Street, also passed through four stations without stopping.’ Terror train: The Northern Line train was packed with commuters during Friday afternoon rush hour (stock image) He said: ’The safety system built into the signalling controls meant that the train was at all times kept at a controlled distance from the train ahead – pausing when the train in front stopped at each station then proceeding when it was safe to do so, this is a key feature of the signalling system. ‘The train travelled at a controlled speed throughout the journey without any risk to passengers safety at all times, however we are investigating why the instruction remained in place for the replacement train’. The RMT rail union said a key concern would be exactly how close the train would have been to any train in front :’At that time of day at peak rush hour there’s a train every three or four minutes on that line. We need to find out exactly what happened.’ In February last year London Underground and its contractors were fined £300,000 for endangering passengers and staff after a runaway train caused chaos on the Northern line. A 39-tonnes maintenance wagon hurtled through seven stations in August 2010 before it could be stopped. A passenger train in front of it was told to keep going and not stop, while commuters were told to run to the front carriages, the Old Bailey heard. London Underground, Tube Lines Ltd and Schweerbau GMBH pleaded guilty to endangering passengers and staff under Health and Safety law. They were each fined £100,000. Tube Lines and LU are part of Transport for London while the German company manufactured the wagon and its tow-bar. Judge Richard Hone said: ""There was the potential of terrible tragedy. He said the runaway train was out of control for four miles during 16 minutes. To those involved it must have seemed an extremely frightening eternity,’ he added. The court was told that a fault had now been remedied and the incident was extremely unlikely to occur again. The RMT transport union described it at the time as ‘a shocking incident which could very easily have resulted in a major tragedy and loss of life’.","Northern Line train passed four stations before it stopped .

"NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has made a surprise appearance as a speaker at the Technology Entertainment and Design (TED) conference in Vancouver, Canada, claiming that certain governments wanted him dead. Snowden appeared on-stage via a screen alongside Sir Tim Berners-Lee, created with the invention of the World Wide Web, who was putting forward his vision of a Magna Carta for the internet that would enshrine the right to web freedom. ""It is no mystery that there are governments out there that want to see me dead,"" Snowden told the conference. ""I don't want to harm any governments but they cannot ignore due process."" Scroll down for video . World Wide Web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee welcomes whistleblower Edward Snowden via videolink . ""A Magna Carta is exactly what we . need.

""I . am living proof that that an individual can go head-to-head with the . most powerful intelligence agencies around the world and win."" His . appearance follows a similar video link at the SXSW (South X South .

Leak: The MYSTIC program is just the latest revelation revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden . The . Technology Entertainment and Design (TED) conference brings together . speakers from around the world to share their ideas on how to improve . and better understand the world. Snowden . also hinted during his address that there were more documents to be . revealed about Prism, saying ""some of the most important reporting to be . done is yet to come"". Sir . Tim, who was speaking as part of the celebrations to mark 25 years of . the World Wide Web, described Snowden as a ‘hero’ and offered him a . virtual high-five when he appeared on stage. The appearance comes on the heels of a claim by Snowden that the National Security Agency (NSA) has been recording all of a foreign country's . phone calls, then listening to the conversations up to a month later. The . program is the latest revelation from a trove of classified documents . that Snowden leaked to certain news . organisations last year. Thorn: The release by Snowden of secret documents on NSA spying practices has become an enormous thorn in the heel of the spy agency . Most of those documents have described . the U.S. collecting massive amounts of data and text.This program is . different in that it records phone calls. The NSA listening program was first reported by the Washington Post, which agreed to not identify the targeted country or other countries . where the program's use was envisioned by officials at the request of government officials. This . NSA program dates to 2009 and is called MYSTIC, according to documents . obtained by the Post. It is used to intercept conversations in one . specific country, but documents show the NSA intends to use it in other . countries, the Post said. The . conversations swept up likely include those of Americans who make calls . to or from the targeted country. Civil libertarians are concerned that . this program and others like it will target other countries and that the . NSA will eventually hold the data longer than what was defined its . original charter and use it for other reasons. The . White House would not comment on the specific program described by the . Post. But National Security Council spokesman Caitlin Hayden said that . information sought by the U.S. intelligence community is, in many cases, . hidden in the 'large and complex system' of global communications . Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who was speaking as part of the celebrations to mark 25 years of the World Wide Web, described Edward Snowden (on the TV screen) as a 'hero' 'The United States must consequently . collect signals intelligence in bulk in certain circumstances in order . to identify these threats,' Hayden said in a statement. She said the . presidential directive that authorises this type of collection 'makes . clear that signals intelligence collected in bulk may only be used to . meet specific security requirements'. The . NSA is authorised to collect in bulk signals intelligence - the type of . intelligence that comes from radio signals and communications, for . example, as long as the purpose of the collection is to counter threats . regarding espionage, terrorism, proliferation, cyber security, safety of . U.S. troops and transnational crime. Bulk . collection means collecting everything, even if some of what's . collected has nothing to do with national security. Most of the . conversations collected under the NSA program would be irrelevant, the . Post said. The NSA would not confirm the existence of the MYSTIC program. But a spokesman said that the NSA's collection programs are legal and done for national security purposes. 'NSA does not conduct signals intelligence collection in any country, or anywhere in the world, unless it is necessary to advance U.S. national security and foreign policy interests and to protect its citizens and the citizens of its allies and partners from harm,' NSA spokesman Vanee Vines said in an email. Vines said it jeopardises national security when details about classified intelligence programs are made public.","Former NSA contractor lauded as a 'hero' by Sir Tim Berners-Lee .

"The CDC chief today apologized for suggesting a nurse who contracted Ebola was to blame and admitted that the agency had to 'rethink' how to combat the deadly virus. Dr Tom Frieden confirmed on Monday that Texas Health Presbyterian nurse Nina Pham, 26, who treated 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan, was in a 'stable condition' and that everything was being done to give her the best possible care. However he added that even one case of the infection being contracted in the U.S. was 'unacceptable'. The CDC chief said: 'I feel awful that a hospital worker became infected taking care of an Ebola patient.' Scroll down for video . Dr Tom Frieden (pictured today) said the CDC would be 'rethinking' its Ebola strategy after a nurse treating the first Ebola case diagnosed in the U.S. contracted the virus . Nurse Nina Pham, 26, was identified on Monday as the healthcare worker who contracted Ebola while treating 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas . The CDC was scrambling to interview all staff at Texas Presbyterian who could have been exposed to patient Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian man who became sick after traveling to the U.S. and died at the hospital. Anyone at risk will be monitored, Dr Frieden said. However he admitted that other healthcare workers who treated Duncan were at risk of Ebola but could not give an exact number as an investigation into the 'breach in protocol' continued. Dr Frieden said during the press conference from Atlanta on Monday: 'Stopping Ebola is hard - we're working together to make it easier and better. 'We have to rethink the way we address Ebola infection control because even a single infection is unacceptable.' The doctor said that one person who came in contact with Miss Pham, when she may have been contagious, was being monitored closely. All 48 people who came in contact with Mr Duncan, who died last Wednesday, were being monitored but none had shown Ebola symptoms, Dr Frieden said. Health authorities were unclear how the nurse contracted the virus but the CDC was investigating procedures used in caring for an Ebola patient. Authorities would be paying particular attention to the stage where protective clothing is taken off when the worker has come out of the isolation unit after being in contact with the Ebola sufferer. President  Obama and Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell (right) participate in a conference call with Director of the Center for Disease Control Dr Tom Frieden on Ebola at the Oval Office of the White House on Monday . The CDC chief suggested that changes may need to be made to protective clothing and said there were plans to bring in a 'buddy system' - where staff could monitor each other as they took off their gear. The director urged U.S. hospitals to 'think Ebola' - telling facilities to be on the lookout for patients with fever or symptoms of Ebola who have traveled from the three Ebola-stricken African nations - Liberia, Guinea or Sierra Leone - in the past 21 days. Dr Frieden reiterated his belief that travel should not be banned from West Africa to the U.S. So far, JFK airport in New York has introduced screening procedures with four additional airports - Washington-Dulles, Newark, Chicago O'Hare and Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson - to begin on Thursday. Of the 91 people stopped for additional screening at U.S. airports so far, none had shown Ebola symptoms. The CDC's director faced fierce criticism on Sunday when he said a Dallas nurse's 'breach in protocol' caused her to catch Ebola – avoiding responsibility for the first case of the deadly virus transmitted on American soil. Critics rounded on Dr Thomas Frieden, saying he was 'scapegoating' the nurse - who was wearing a full protective suit as she treated 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan – instead of dealing with his agency's failure to introduce a rigorous set of procedures for hospitals across the country. A hazmat truck sits outside of an apartment today in Dallas, Texas where the nurse diagnosed with the Ebola virus resides . Miss Pham, 26, is fighting for her life after contracting Ebola from Thomas Eric Duncan. Here she is pictured with her beloved King Charles Spaniel who is not expected to be destroyed but has been quarantined . Today, Dr Frieden said: 'My intention was not to suggest there was fault with the hospital or the healthcare worker.' Miss Pham's home was disinfected by a hazmat team on Sunday afternoon, as Texas state officials and the CDC struggled to keep a handle on a growing sense of panic. Texas State Health Services Commissioner, Dr. David Lakey, said at the press conference on Monday that it was 'very disappointing' to discover one of their own healthcare workers had contracted the Ebola virus. Dr Lakey also said that they were trying to find a location to take care of the nurse's beloved King Charles Spaniel and where the pet can be quarantined while he is monitored. The dog is not expected to be destroyed.

"A group of African-American pastors stunned Washington on Tuesday by calling for the impeachment and removal of Eric Holder, the black lawyer who heads the U.S. Department of Justice. Attorney General Holder, a longtime friend and ally of President Barack Obama, spoke Tuesday at the winter meeting of the National Association of Attorneys General, telling top law enforcers at the state level that laws banning gay marriage can be cast aside if they believe they encourage illegal discrimination. 'In general,' Holder told them, 'I believe that we must be suspicious of legal classifications based solely on sexual orientation.' 'And we must endeavor in all of our . efforts to uphold and advance the values that once led our forebears to . declare unequivocally that all are created equal and entitled to equal . opportunity.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Attorney General Eric Holder spoke at the annual Attorneys General Winter Meeting in Washington, saying that state-level law enforcement chiefs can choose to abandon laws banning same-sex marriages . The Coalition of African American Pastors demanded the impeachment of Eric Holder on Tuesday, asking 1 million Americans to sign a petition aimed at giving Congress political cover . Times are changing: Plaintiffs celebrated a Virginia ruling that struck down the state's same-sex marriage ban after the state's new attorney general, Mark Herring, chose not to defend it in court . Holder's speech came just weeks after Holder ordered Justice Department employees to give legal same-sex marriages equal consideration, even in states where such unions are not recognized. The result of his latest remarks is a new federal government-sanctioned license, covering attorneys general who refuse to defend 'traditional marriage' laws when they are challenged in court. That has angered the Coalition of African American Pastors, which said it aims to collect 1 million signatures on an impeachment petition that blames Holder for violating his oath of office by picking and choosing which laws to enforce on the basis of his personal beliefs. 'President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have turned their backs on the values the American people hold dear,' the group said, 'values particularly cherished in the black community: values like marriage, which should be strengthened and promoted, rather than weakened and undermined. Addressing Holder's move to bring state attorneys general along, the group accused him in a statement of trying to 'coerce states to fall in line with the same-sex ""marriage"" agenda.' Six hours after the coalition's pres conference, its online petition to Congress had collected fewer than 4,000 signatures. Rev. Bill Owens (4th from L) said Tuesday that Holder 'will go down in history as the worst attorney general' The gay marriage debate has divided America, with supporters seeming to have captured the momentum in recent years . Blacks and evangelicals are the two demographic groups most opposed to same-sex marriages, a fact brought into sharp relief by Tuesday's launch of a black pastors' movement to impeach Holder . 'Attorney General Holder has attempted to undermine the states’ authority ... specifically with his latest directives to Department of Justice employees to interpret same-sex ""marriage"" status as broadly as possible even in those states which do not recognize these unions,' the petition reads in part. 'The Attorney General has brazenly overstepped the bounds of his authority and he must be held accountable.' Newly minted Democratic Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring believed his state's ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional, so he has chosen not to defend it -- a move Eric Holder hopes more of Herring's colleagues will embrace . Members of the Republican Attorneys General Association, the more conservative half of Holder's Tuesday morning audience, slammed him for his selective approach to law enforcement. 'A state attorney general has a solemn duty to the state and its people to defend state laws and constitutional provisions against challenge under federal law,' Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange said in a statement. 'To refuse to do so because of personal policy preferences or political pressure erodes the rule of law on which all of our freedoms are founded. A government that does not enforce the law equally will lead our society to disrespect the rule of law.' But six Democratic state attorneys general, including Virginia newcomer Mark Herring, have chosen to sit on their hands while gay advocacy groups and individual plaintiffs have sued over state laws that limit the definition of 'marriage' to a union between one man and one woman. Herring's inaction paved the way for a federal judge to strike down a state constitutional amendment banning gay marriages. The case will be appealed, but only as a procedural matter aimed at hurrying a final disposition. The American Foundation for Equal Rights, a group supporting the plaintiffs in that case, said Monday that 'loving gay and lesbian couples and their families should not have to live one more day as second-class citizens under unjust laws.' Adam Umhoefer, the group's executive director, said he hoped that 'soon all Virginians – and hopefully all Americans – will have the freedom to marry the person they love and their rights fully realized.' Quieting the masses: President Obama, Eric Holder and advisor Valerie Jarrett met Feb. 18 with leaders from African American civil rights groups in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, but reportedly focused health care and his 'income inequality' platform . Fox News reported that Ethics and Public Policy Center president Ed Whelan blasted Holder on Tuesday, saying that  'state attorneys general are obligated to defend state marriage laws.' Whelan called it 'unfortunate and outrageous that Attorney General Holder doesn't understand that, but it's hardly surprising.' Coalition of African American Pastors founder Rev. Bill Owens told reporters Tuesday that 'our leaders in Washington are letting [Holder] get away with his illegal conduct.' 'He will go down in history as the worst attorney general,' Owens said. The petition, he added, is meant to give Republicans in Congress 'the encouragement necessary to remove this dangerous ideologue from public office.' As gay marriage has gained legal footholds in more and more states, President Obama's usually rock-solid African American community has wavered, consistently polling low approval numbers for the practice. Americans in black households disapprove of gay marriage in larger numbers than any other ethnic subset of the U.S. A June 2013 Pew Research Center survey found that just 39 per cent of blacks support gay marriage initiatives, compared with 51 per cent of the larger population. But 69 per cent of blacks also acknowledge that the legal recognition of same-sex marriages is inevitable, according to Pew. Twenty-two per cent of self-identified evangelical Christians support gay marriage, while 70 per cent see it as an unstoppable social force. That combined gulf – between black Christians' desires and their practical predictions – presents a public opinion-shaping opportunity that the pastoral coalition hopes to take advantage of. Unstoppable: Most blacks and evangelicals concede that despite their objections, gay marriage rights are likely to steamroll their way into American history . Owens also said Tuesday that he would move to impeach the president if it were practical to do so. 'If Obama was a white man, he would be impeached,' he told reporters. 'Obama has been given a free pass to do what he pleases, but I don’t give him a pass. I’m very black. Been black all my life. He doesn’t get a pass.' Owens called it unfortunate that the president has drawn lines of equivalency between the gay rights movement and the earlier Civil Rights movement aimed at correcting historical injustices against blacks in the U.S. 'It's a disgrace that this man has stood on the shoulders of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr.,"" Owens said. 'I detest them calling this a civil rights movement. It's not a civil rights movement; it's a civil wrongs movement.' But Holder has persisted in treating gay rights as a natural heir to the 1960s movement that relegated ordinary discrimination of African-Americans, now considered shocking and unacceptable, to America's historical dust-heap. 'If I were attorney general in Kansas in 1953, I would not have defended a Kansas statute that put in place separate-but-equal facilities,' Holder told The New York Times. According to The Washington Times, Holder has told The New Yorker in an interview for a future article that he will likely step down by the end of 2014, but plans on staying 'well into' the year.","The U.S. attorney general believes he's found a way to force the gay-marriage issue in states that refuse to recognize them .

"A 90-year-old Holocaust survivor made his orchestral debut with renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma last night and played music composed 70 years ago in a Nazi prison camp. George Horner and Ma received floral bouquets and a standing ovation from the audience of about 1,000 people at Boston's Symphony Hall. The performance benefited the Terezin Music Foundation, an organisation dedicated to preserving the work of artists and musicians killed in the Holocaust. Scroll down for video . Moving: George Horner plays piano alongside renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma in Boston . Dr Horner, a retired doctor who now lives in Newtown, Philadelphia, was 21 when he was freed by Allied soldiers in 1945 after serving time at Terezin, Auschwitz and Buchenwald. His parents and sister perished in the camps. Although his back still bears the scars of a Nazi beating, he remains sprightly and seems much younger than his 90 years. Ma, who was born 10 years after the end of the Second World War, said before the performance that he hoped it will inspire people to a better future. George Horner and Ma received floral bouquets and a standing ovation from the audience of about 1,000 people in Boston's Symphony Hall . He said: 'I grew up with the words, ""never again"". 'It . is kind of inconceivable that there are people who say the Holocaust . didn't exist. George Horner is a living contradiction of what those . people are saying.' He said . Horner was able to survive 'because he had music, because he had . friends, because the power of music could fill in the empty spaces.' He added: 'To me George Horner is a huge hero, and is a huge inspiration. Embraced: Yo-Yo Ma greets George Horner in a rehearsal room before their performance . Warming up: Cellist Yo-Yo Ma and George Horner had a brief rehearsal before the performance in aid of the Terezin Music Foundation . 'He is a witness to a window, and to a . slice of history, that we never want to see again, and yet we keep . seeing versions of that all over the world. I hope we are inspired by . that and we keep that memory forever.' Led by Ludwig, the foundation is named for the town of Terezin, site of an unusual Jewish ghetto in what was then German-occupied Czechoslovakia. Even amid death and hard labour, Nazi soldiers allowed prisoners to stage artistic performances. Remarkable: Dr George Horner performed songs composed in the Nazis concentration camps . Memories: Dr George Horner performs a song on the piano at his home in Newtown Square, Philadelphia . Legacy: Horner agreed to do the performance which he described as a 'noble' mission . Horner played piano and accordion in the Terezin cabarets, including tunes written by fellow inmate Karel Svenk. Last night Horner played two of Svenk's works solo — a march and a lullaby — and then teamed up with Ma for a third piece called 'How Come the Black Man Sits in the Back of the Bus?' George Horner joined Yo-Yo Ma at Boston's Symphony Hall . They . appeared to enjoy their evening, chatting briefly between numbers and . walking off the stage hand-in-hand after taking a bow together. Before the performance, Ma and Horner met and embraced ahead of a brief rehearsal. Ma . thanked Horner for helping the Terezin Music Foundation, named for the . town of Terezin, site of an unusual Jewish ghetto in what was then . German-occupied Czechoslovakia. 'It's an extraordinary link to the past,' said concert organizer Mark Ludwig. Svenk did not survive the genocide. But his musical legacy has, due in part to a chance meeting of Ludwig, a scholar of Terezin composers, and Horner, who never forgot the songs that were written and played in captivity. Ludwig said he found it hard to ask Horner to perform pieces laden with such difficult memories. 'To ask somebody who played this in the camps, that's asking a lot,' said Ludwig. Yet Horner readily agreed to what he described as a 'noble' mission. It didn't hurt that he would be sharing the stage with Ma — even if he thought Ludwig was joking at first. 'I couldn't believe it, because it's a fantastic thing for me.' The program featured additional performances by Ma and the Hawthorne String Quartet. When Horner found out about the duet with Ma, Ludwig said, 'he was so excited, to me he sounded like a teenager.'

"If Shubham . Banerjee cannot lay claim to being the world's youngest venture . capital-backed entrepreneur, he comes very close. Banerjee was 12 years old when he closed an early-stage . funding round with Intel Capital, the company's venture . capital arm, last month for his prototype for a low-cost Braille . printer. Since then, the San Jose, California middle-schooler . has turned 13. Shubham Banerjee was 12 when he closed an early-stage funding round with Intel Capital . Young entrepreneurs usually have reached at least their . mid-teens when they hit it big.

Stripe, were 16 and 19 when they sold an earlier business to a . Canadian company for $5 million. After reading a fundraising flyer about the blind, Banerjee . felt inspired to turn a high-tech version of Legos, the toy . building blocks, into a device that could print in Braille. One . day, he wants to mass-produce the printers and sell them for . about $350, far less than Braille printers cost now. This past summer, he worked on incorporating an Intel Edison . chip, a processor aimed at hobbyists, into the printer. In . September, Intel invited him to a conference in India to . highlight uses for Edison. There, he got a big surprise. Intel executive Mike Bell announced from the conference . stage that the giant chipmaker would invest in his company, . Braigo Labs. Until then, his funding consisted of the $35,000 . his parents gave him. 'I turned back to my dad, and said, 'What did he just say?'' Banerjee recalled. 'I was all over the place.' Banerjee and a spokesman for Intel Capital declined to . disclose the size of the investment. A person familiar with the . matter said it was a few hundred thousand dollars. He plans to . use it to build a better prototype of the printer and test it . with more groups for the blind. After the announcement, Banerjee had to bone up on . unfamiliar terms such as 'venture capital.' He also needed to convince adults to co-sign his funding and . patent documents. Banerjee and a spokesman for Intel Capital declined todisclose the size of the investment. Among the company officials he turned to: . Braigo's president, his mom, Malini.

"Amir Khan has staged a tongue-in-cheek 'come and fight me' plea to Floyd Mayweather Jnr as the American pound-for-pound king closes in on a multi-million dollar fight with Manny Pacquiao. It is understood undefeated five-division world champion Mayweather is ready to complete terms with Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum in Los Angeles on Friday for a May 2 superfight. But Briton Khan is keen to muscle in, attempting to goad the 37-year-old WBC and WBA welterweight champion into taking him on instead of the 36-year-old Filipino WBO holder. Amir Khan is interviewed during a promotion event for boxing company RDX . Khan calls out Mayweather, telling him to accept a fight against him this year . Khan taunts Mayweather by wearing a mask of the pound-for-pound king and holding a bundle of cash . Khan has been long hoping for a fight against the world's best boxer . In a video seen exclusively by Sportsmail from boxing suppliers RDX, Khan comically dons a facemask of Mayweather and holds out a wad of money in hand. He then attempts to goad his illusive opponent further, whilst pointing at a giant wall projection spelling out 'Who are ya?' as he looks to up the pressure on the American to give in and fight him. Despite the Bolton hero's best efforts, Mayweather is likely to snub Khan and give boxing fans the bout they have long-awaited. Mayweather has previously been dismissive about Khan despite the 28-year-old's impressive victory over Devon Alexander last December. WBC silver welterweight holder Khan is determined to become a world champion again but may have to be patient in his bid to conquer either Mayweather or Pacquiao with a fight against fellow Brit Kell Brook - the IBF champion - a possibility later this year. Indeed, Khan will be an interested bystander once Mayweather and Pacquiao eventually lock horns. The pair are expected to clash this spring in the American's hometown of Las Vegas at the MGM Grand in a mega-fight worth at least $300million (£197m). Mayweather wants to fight on May 2, the Saturday closest to the Cinco de Mayo holiday, as has been his tradition in recent years. But that date has also been earmarked for Miguel Cotto's proposed clash with Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez which would be one of the biggest fights in the history of the Puerto Rico-Mexico rivalry. Mayweather said last month: 'The public want this fight. I want it. The only stumbling block has been Bob Arum (Pacquiao's promoter) but I think both fighters want it. So it's time to get it on. I'm not ducking anyone, so let's get this on. Years ago we had problems with random blood and urine testing. I just want to have an even playing field. As Khan goaded Mayweather, a giant projection mocking the Money Man appeared on the wall . Those present at the promotional event also got involved by wearing their own Mayweather masks . Khan (left) appeared in good spirits during the  event . 'Now he's in a very, very tight situation with his loss to (Juan Manuel) Marquez and his loss to (Timothy) Bradley. His pay-per-view numbers are extremely low, so he's desperate. I wanted that fight a long time ago.' Reports in America over the weekend suggested the venue had been agreed, as well as a drug testing programme. The final stumbling block appears to be the purse split with Mayweather refusing to agree to a 50/50 division. But Pacquiao has long been adamant that he would accept the smaller portion in order to end more than five years of debate since the fight was first mooted. Before Christmas he told Sky Sports: 'Mayweather can get the amount he wants. I challenged him to a charity fight. Until now, he has not agreed to it. 'So, money is not the issue in our fight. This fight is about legacy, this is about making the fans happy and, above all, this is for the good of boxing. Khan is likely to miss out on his chance to fight Mayweather, who looks set to face Manny Pacquiao . 'He has reached a dead end. He has nowhere to run but to fight me. I will try my best to make this a thrilling and entertaining fight. But I doubt if he's gonna engage me in a slugfest. You all know his fighting style. Most of his previous fights, if not all, induced us to sleep. 'I know what I have to do. I will chase him wherever he goes just in case he decides to run around the ring. We will devise a good fight plan against him.' Khan will be more than willing to step in, however, if negotiations break down between boxing's long-standing arch-rivals.","Sportsmail has exclusive video of Amir Khan mocking Floyd Mayweather .

"Princes William and Harry were back together with the so-called 'Glosse Posse' today as they attended the wedding of a childhood friend . The royals watched on as Victoria Inskip, who has known the princes since they were teenagers, married Robert Davies-Jones at Malmesbury Abbey this afternoon. But the Duchess of Cambridge was absent from the wedding signalling she is still suffering from severe ante-natal sickness. Scroll down for video . Prince William and Harry were seen mingling with the guests at the wedding of their close friend Victoria Inskip at Malmesbury Abbey, Wiltshire . Although the princes were at the wedding, the Duchess of Cambridge did not attend, signalling she may still be suffering from ante-natal sickness . The bride, Victoria Inskip has been a fund-raiser for Prince Harry's African charity Sentebale . However, they were joined by close friends Guy Pelly and the bride's brother Thomas Inskip, also known as Skippy, who are part of the set, which revolves around the exclusive Beaufort Hunt. The Duchess has not been seen since it was announced earlier this month that she was pregnant with the couple's second child. At the time Kensington Palace officials confirmed that she was suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, the same condition that led to her being hospitalised during her first pregnancy with Prince George. Last week Prince William had to take her place on an official trip to Malta after she was too ill to go. Miss Inskip, and her brother Thomas have known Princes William and Harry since they were regulars at the Club H 'nightclub' they set up in the basement of Highgrove, the Gloucestershire home of Prince Charles. The princes' close friend Victoria Inskip, with her new husband Robert Davies-Jones at Malmesbury Abbey . She has also been a fund-raiser for the African charity Sentebale, that was set up by Prince Harry to help vulnerable children in Lesotho and works as an estate agent. Mr Davies Jones, 35, whose family are from Hexham, Northumberland and are friends of the Duke of Northumberland. Meanwhile her brother, also known as 'Skippy' attended Eton with Prince Harry and is also credited with organising Prince William's stag party before his wedding in 2011. The bride's brother Thomas Inskip, left, is often referred to as the 'wingman' of Prince Harry. Also attending the wedding was Guy Pelly and wife Lizzie Wilson, right . The newlyweds pose with their parents after their wedding ceremony this afternoon . He is known as Harry's best friend, often referred to as his 'wingman' and was with Harry on his ill-fated trip to Croatia in August in 2011. During the trip, they got drunk on vodka, whisky, beer and tequila, and were photographed jumping into a pool fully-clothed at a nightclub on the party island of Hvar. He was also with him on a skiing trip to Verbier in November when they amused themselves by throwing snowballs at unsuspecting passers-by from a balcony. The siblings' father Owen Inskip, a field-master of Prince Charles’s favourite hunt, The Beaufort, has made a fortune over the years from a number of businesses, including ‘managing’ thousands of council homes for local authorities and upmarket estates. Thomas Inskip, right, attended Eton with Prince Harry and is also credited with organising Prince William's stag party . Mr Inskip was with Harry on his ill-fated trip to Croatia in August in 2011, where the prince jumped into a pool fully clothed . Their maternal grandfather was the eccentric Labour peer Lord Rufus Noel-Buxton, an enthusiastic wader, who once forded the Thames at low tide, arriving on the steps of the Houses of Parliament. The family’s nine-bedroom country pile, Alderley Farm, near Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, was sold for more than £7 million in 2007. Also attending today's wedding was another close friend of the princes Guy Pelly and his wife Elizabeth Wilson, the granddaughter of the Holiday Inn hotel empire founder. Mr Pelly became friendly with Prince William in 2001 when they were both junior members of the Beaufort Hunt and so became close to Harry too. The princes were also at Mr Pelly's wedding earlier this year in Memphis, Tennessee along with cousins Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.","William and Harry were at the wedding of childhood friend Victoria Inskip .

"The Duchess of Cambridge and  Prince George . The Duchess of Cambridge is preparing to return to work after recovering from three weeks of acute morning sickness. According to Royal aides, the Duchess is planning to resume official engagements next month, with a spokesman telling The Mail on Sunday: ‘There will be engagements in October and November. We just haven’t announced them yet.’ The Duchess has been suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum – the condition she suffered during her pregnancy with Prince George. Although she has not been admitted to hospital this time, she has received medical assistance at Kensington Palace. The Duchess’s last official engagement was on August 5 when she opened a poppy installation at the Tower of London with her husband William and Prince Harry. Over the summer she headed to Belgium for First World War centenary commemorations and was in Yorkshire in July for the start of the Tour de France. But she has not carried out a charitable engagement since July, when went to a North London school to see one of her M-Pact projects, and has told aides she is keen to revisit some of her charities. Last weekend, the Duchess was forced to pull out of a tour of Malta on behalf of the Queen, leaving Prince William to stand in for her. Kate was also due to join William at an engagement in Oxford three weeks ago but was too ill – and it was her absence that prompted the Palace to announce her pregnancy prematurely. Now that she is feeling better, the couple are expected to move into their new ten-bedroom Georgian pile, Anmer Hall, in Norfolk. ‘While they will be predominantly living in Norfolk, the intention is for Kate to hop between London and Norfolk while looking after Prince George,’ said a source. The Duchess of Cambridge views the Tower of London's 'Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red' poppy installation which commemorate the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of First World War .

"A US pilot and his British passenger have been killed in a joyride flight after their Second World War   P-51 Mustang fighter crashes off Galveston coast. Police said Keith Hibbett, 51, of Denton, Texas, was flying the plane, . and John Stephen Busby, 66, from Britain, was the plane's only . passenger. The cause of the accident has not been determined, but the pilot was not in contact with air traffic control just before the crash at about noon local time, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Lynn Lunsford said. Scroll down for video . Crash: Police said Keith Hibbett, 51, of Denton, Texas, (pictured) was flying the plane, and John Stephen Busby, 66, from Britain, was the plane's only passenger . The P-51 Mustang was manufactured in 1944, according to FAA records, and owned by the Texas Aviation Hall of Fame, a part of the Lone Star Flight Museum in Galveston. Mr Busby had paid the museum to take the flight as part of a program offered by the museum. Mr Busby and his wife had been visiting to celebrate their 41st wedding anniversary. Recovery: Emergency crews recovered the bodies after combing over Chocolate Bay for about an hour . According to museum officials, Hibbett was an experienced pilot. US Coast Guard petty officer Steve Lehmann said the captain of a charter boat notified authorities after seeing the crash in an area between Chocolate Bay and Galveston Bay. He said the plane went down in water 4ft deep. Emergency crews recovered the bodies after combing over Chocolate Bay for about an hour, KHOU.com reported. Joyride: 'Galveston Gal', a TF-51 training variant of the P-51 Mustang fighter aircraft . The P-51 Mustang was the nemesis of the Luftwaffe, shooting down over 4,900 enemy planes and therefore, greatly assisted the bombing campaign against Nazi Germany in World War Two. It gave the bombers of US 8th Air Force the fighter cover it so desperately needed over occupied Europe. The P-51 was originally ordered in April 1940 by the British Air Purchasing Commission. There was a realisation in Britain that its bomber squadrons were open to attack during bombing raids and that Fighter Command did not have the aircraft available to give Bomber Command sufficient protection. The P51 Mustang had an astonishing success rate - its ratio for kills to losses was said to have been 19 kills for every 1 Mustang lost. Such was the success of the Mustang, that the Senate War Investigating Committee set up by Harry Truman in 1944, called it 'the most aerodynamically perfect pursuit plane in existence.' Source: History Learning Site . Witnesses told police the plane went down without warning or any signs of trouble. Jennifer Spaulding told KHOU.com she was on another boat and she heard the impact of the crash. 'We saw the water spraying up in the air, but we never saw what it was,' Spaulding said. 'We never saw a plane go down or anything, so we didn’t think anything like a plane. We just figured it was a boat.' According to the museum website, the plane was used by the El Salvadoran Air Force in the 1960s, during which time the one-person plane was modified to allow it to carry two people. It had been painted with the markings of the Galveston Gal, a tribute to the World War II fighter group of a Galveston native. The museum offered rides in the plane for $1,995 for one passenger, according to its website. Museum officials did not respond to requests for comment. Investigators with the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the cause of the crash. In 2011 a pilot and 10 people on the ground died when a souped-up World War II-era P-51 Mustang fighter crashed into spectators at an air race in Reno. Investigators said it bore modifications that weakened its structure and showed evidence that the pilot flew it beyond its limits. Pilot Jimmy Leeward was blamed for failing to fully document and test extensive modifications to the aircraft before the September 2011 crash which left over 70 people injured.","Police said Keith Hibbett, 51, of Denton, Texas, was flying the plane .

"Thinking of buying underwear for the party season but daunted by the prospect of traipsing from shop to shop, spending hours being measured and trying on bras? Ordering online and taking the time to try them on at home is far more appealing. But given that I’ve oscillated from a post-pregnancy 36HH to the 32F I was a few months ago, could I really buy a bra over the internet and actually expect it to fit? A new online brand, Optifit, claims its measuring method means its bras will fit any woman. I put this device to the test, pitting it against other online approaches — while expert bra fitter Allison Hawkins gives me her verdict . . . Scroll down for video . OPTIFIT . optifit.com . MEASURING PROCESS: Optifit bras are made with no underwiring, padding or gel, which supposedly put pressure on breast tissue. Uses its own sizes and measuring system, a strap called the Opti-Measure. You have to send off for this (£4 plus £1.50 postage) and it takes a couple of days to arrive. This gives you a body frame measurement (a letter from T to Z); your body depth (small, medium or large); and breast volume (from one to 21). You then order one of six bras. I chose Shades Of Grey, £69.99. ORDERING TIME: With up to 504 sizes, sometimes the bras are made to order and delivery (£4) takes two weeks. After I’d placed my order, Optifit’s Sue McDonald called me. As I fell between two sizes, she sent me both — I could send back the spare — plus an extender for the band and an instructional DVD. MY VERDICT: Feels unlike any other bra. The material was super-soft, but I didn’t like the 1950s ‘torpedo boobs’ look. I liked that the band sat low on my back, but though I’d been warned the bra is meant to feel tight, I found it uncomfortable. EXPERT VERDICT: I was pleasantly surprised. But while the design was supportive, the cups seemed to flatten Lucy’s breasts and make them point in different directions, and it was far too tight under the breast bone. 7/10 . BRAVISSIMO . bravissimo.com . MEASURING PROCESS: The site has a video showing the differences in look and feel between a good and bad fit. A three-step guide to finding the perfect fit specifically excludes a tape measure. Instead, it tells you what to look for when you stand in front of a mirror in your current bra. So, if you are wearing a 34D where the back is riding up, reduce the back size to 32 — but, if the current cups fit you should also increase the cup size, to a DD because a 32D is a smaller cup than a 34D. I was satisfied that 32F was right for me, so I chose a Freya design called Deco Honey (£32) in Jade. ORDERING TIME: Standard delivery cost £3.95 and took three days. MY VERDICT: Hello, boys! This plunge-cut, moulded bra made me feel quite sexy although it didn’t fit properly. It pushed my breasts up so they were spilling out, but I can’t help thinking it would be fun for a night out. EXPERT VERDICT: Lucy likes this for the wow factor but it’s way too tight, puts too much pressure on her shoulders and will give her backache. 5/10 . MARKS & SPENCER . marksandspencer.com . THE MEASURING PROCESS: In the DD-plus lingerie section, I clicked the link to the Bra Fit Tool and followed a step-by-step guide to measuring yourself. First, you put on the best-fitting bra you already own. Next, you choose between an everyday bra, a maternity bra or a sports bra — I chose the first. Then you measure your ‘underband’ — just below where your bra sits. You enter this measurement, along with the size, brand and fit of the bra you’re wearing, then answer questions about your age and build. I turned out to be the 32F I thought I was all along and chose the Iris Embroidered Non-Padded Full Cup (£22.50) because I thought the pale purple colour was pretty. ORDERING TIME: Delivery cost £3.99 and the bra arrived the next day. MY VERDICT: Despite the secure fastening and underwiring, the silky material initially felt comfortable. But after half an hour, the straps started digging in to my shoulders, and although it seemed to be the right size, I realised my breasts looked a bit saggy. EXPERT VERDICT: Not bad for the price but the cut is wrong for Lucy. She needs a full-cup bra that will support her properly and although M&S describes this as a full-cup, it’s actually a half-cup with a deep lace trim, that’s constructed in a way that dragged Lucy’s breasts down. 6/10 . LACE . lace-lingerie.com . MEASURING PROCESS: Despite a huge choice, there are no guides to tell you how to find a bra that fits, only a list of the different styles. Given that the 32-band bras I’d tried from M&S and Bravissimo had been slightly on the tight side, I gambled on a larger back size — and, as Bravissimo suggested, a smaller cup. I ordered a 34E in the Prima Donna Twist Nostalgia Balcony bra (£42), which caught my eye. ORDERING TIME: Delivery is £3 and can take up to five working days. MY VERDICT: This bra is slightly padded, which makes it very comfortable. It seemed to fit well. The cup size worked and I didn’t get the ‘four boob’ effect that often happens when I spill out of a bra. My only quibble would be that the shoulder straps are too narrow. EXPERT VERDICT: Quite a good bra for Lucy as it’s bigger around her rib cage, which she needs. It has a good shape and will work well under a T-shirt. But there is not enough support and only one hook and eye at the back. 8/10 . FINAL VERDICT . It’s ironic that for all the fancy approaches to measuring, the bra that Allison thought fitted me best was from the site that gave no guidance on how to find a bra that fits. While I’m loath to tackle the Christmas crowds, this has rather proved that there’s no substitute for going into a shop, being properly fitted and trying on bras.","Thinking of buying underwear for the party season?

"Blundering Iraqi air force pilots gave vital supplies of food, water and ammunition to Islamic State militants instead of their own beleaguered troops. The aid drops were meant to help Iraqi soldiers desperately fending off jihadist fighters near Saqlawia in the western province of Anbar. Hakim Al-Zamili, an Iraqi MP who is a member of the security and defense committee, said the mistake had effectively allowed ISIS to kill off its besieged soldiers. Scroll down for video . Welcome air strike: Islamic State fighters were handed supplies of food, water and ammunition intended for Iraqi troops after a mistake by inexperienced air force pilots who dropped them in the wrong area (file picture) Because most of the extremist group's weaponry was seized from Iraqi forces during its lightning offensive in June, the extra ammunition would have given its fighters a critical edge in the battle. Al-Zamili told NBC News: 'Those soldiers were in deadly need of these supplies, but because of the wrong plans of the commanders in the Iraqi army and lack of experience of the pilots, we in a way or another helped ISIS fighters to kill our soldiers.' A brigadier-general in Iraq's Defense Ministry, who declined to be named, confirmed the incident, which happened on September 19. The officer also put the error down to a lack of experience, saying the pilots are 'all young and new'. An investigation is being carried out to determine the exact cause of the mistake. The error raises further questions about the effectiveness of Iraq's fledgling air force at a time when the U.S.-led coalition will be depending on its military to help push back the insurgency. Scene: The aid drops were meant to help Iraqi soldiers desperately fending off jihadist fighters near Saqlawia in the western province of Anbar, but instead fell into the hands of the enemy . U.S.-led forces today launched further air strikes on Islamic State fighters who are besieging a Kurdish town near the Syrian border with Turkey, according to Kurdish sources in the town and a monitoring group said. A Reuters correspondent on the Turkish side of the border could hear jets overhead and saw a column of black smoke rising into the sky from the southeast of the town. 'Today, American jets hit a village that is 4-5 km (2-3 miles) southeast of Kobani and we heard they destroyed one (Islamic State) tank,' Parwer Mohammed Ali, a translator with the PYD Kurdish group, told Reuters by telephone from Kobani, known as Ain al-Arab in Arabic. Meanwhile, British fighter jets fired on militants west of Baghdad overnight, the Ministry of Defence said Wednesday, in their second strikes in as many days in Iraq. The United States has been carrying out strikes in Iraq against the militant group since July and in Syria since August with the help of Arab allies and Britain. Using mostly night strikes, it aims to damage and destroy the bases and forces of the Al Qaeda offshoot that has captured large areas of both countries.","Furious Iraqi MP says blunder 'helped ISIS fighters to kill our soldiers'

Last month Mr Gove criticised the debasement of English lessons, saying some schools were telling pupils to read ‘transient vampire books’ like the Twilight series instead of ‘transcendent Victorian novels’ such as Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. But Ms Blackman, today revealed as the eighth Children’s Laureate, rejected the minister’s attitude to popular books. “I don’t agree with Michael Gove. The point is that they are reading. My strategy is to say to a child ‘if you love vampire stories then have you thought about Frankenstein?,’ she said. She revealed that as a schoolgirl a teacher took a comic from her because it was not considered good reading material, the Evening Standard reported. ‘The teacher tore it up and said “don’t read that rubbish”. That was my hard-earned pocket money. It was a snobby attitude and I want to change that,’ she added. Her intervention - on the day her appointment was announced - follows a series of clashes between Mr Gove and the profession which has seen two of the leading teaching unions pass votes of no confidence in the Education Secretary. Ms Blackman said Mr Gove was in danger of reducing teachers to a ‘delivery mechanism’ to get children through tests rather than teaching them to think for themselves. Critic: Malorie Blackman, announced today as the new Waterstones Children's Laureate, said Mr Gove was wrong to dictate which books children read . She said that pupils were paying the price for the ‘adversarial’ relationship which had developed between the profession and the Department for Education, while teachers were left feeling demoralised and undervalued. ‘I do not know whether he (Mr Gove) trusts teachers or not but the perception is that he does not listen. If we are not careful we are in danger of losing our very best teachers,’ she told BBC Radio 4's The World At One. ‘They have got to be more than just a delivery mechanism - some of them feel that's what they've been turned into, as a way of just getting children through tests. What we should be doing is teaching our children to think and not just to regurgitate facts.’ Michael Gove criticised the books behind the Twilight films staring Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson . The Twilight vampire series by author Stephanie Meyer was not a patch on George Eliot, Mr Gove said . Mr Gove insists he is committed to driving up standards in the classroom, but critics of his more traditionalist approach to education accuse him of creating a climate of bullying, fear and intimidation. Ms Blackman, the author of the Noughts And Crosses series of books, said the confrontational atmosphere was taking its toll on schools. ‘I do feel that at the moment the head teachers and teachers and the Department for Education have a relationship that is so adversarial and it is the children who are suffering,’ she said. ‘It is very easy for those who are not in schools every day to come up with edicts about 'we should be doing this and we should be doing that'. Rushing in with initiative after initiative and initiative means that teachers are becoming demoralised, are feeling they are not valued.’","Education Secretary said youngsters should read Jane Eyre not Twilight .

"The fate of the United Kingdom was being 'closely' followed by the Queen last night, as she is poised to lead an attempt to heal the wounds of Scotland’s rancorous independence battle. Palace officials said the monarch was being kept abreast of the latest news from counting centres across Scotland as votes against independence mounted. And senior advisers were due to meet from 1am to plan the official response to the break-up of the Union or the need to heal the bitter divisions of the campaign. With all 32 local authorities declared, it was revealed this morning Scotland voted against independence with a majority of 55 per cent. Scroll down for video .

But it was delayed by a day to allow her staff to cast their vote and give the Queen the opportunity to be updated on the results as they came in. Palace aides said the Queen was following the result 'closely' and 'being kept abreast of matters by officials in Edinburgh and London', Sky News reported. It is understood that staff were to hold a meeting overnight to plan the Queen's official response, when the result became clear.

From remote Scottish islands to the tough city estates of Glasgow, people were divided over a vote being watched intently across the world. Yesterday, church leaders urged both unionist and separatist campaigners to come together to build harmony in the wake of the vote, which has divided friends and family. Sources said the Queen was also considering delivering a message to the country over the coming days in an attempt to encourage unity. Though Buckingham Palace stressed her political neutrality, she intervened in the closing days to urge Scots to ‘think carefully’ about their votes in what was widely interpreted as a counsel of caution. David Cameron is also expected to make a televised address from Downing Street today. The Prime Minister made a series of visits to Scotland during the campaign to deliver increasingly desperate appeals for the Scots to stay in the Union.

Her Majesty told a member of the public that voters should 'think very carefully about the future' as she emerged from the morning service at the church she attends near Balmoral. It came after Prince Harry also revealed that he expected Scotland would remain in the United Kingdom next year. The Queen's comment was widely viewed as urging voters to take caution before backing independence, which would chime with comments made four decades ago that she wanted to rule as the Queen of every country in the UK.

"Practices: The Office of fair Trading has told the biggest payday loan firms to improve how they inform customers and chase debts . Payday loan giant Wonga has increased the interest rate it uses to illustrate the cost of borrowing to 5,853 per cent – a rise of 1,600 per cent. The move has triggered more calls for tighter regulation of an industry that cashes in on hard-up borrowers. Most customers of payday loan firms only take out small amounts over a short period to tide them over until they get their salary. But lenders are required by law to give a representative annual percentage rate of interest (APR), setting out what the loan would cost over a year, so customers can make comparisons with other firms easily to find the cheapest deal. Wonga used to give the example of a £207 loan over 20 days, with interest and charges of £47.42 and an APR of 4,214 per cent. But it now uses a new example of someone borrowing a smaller sum of £150 for 18 days, with interest and charges of £33.49 and an APR of 5,853 per cent. Wonga has not actually increased its charges or interest rates, but says it has voluntarily changed the loan example it uses on its website as a better reflection of how customers borrow. The firm argues that the APR calculation, which makes assumptions about borrowing money over a full year, is not the best way to illustrate the cost of its loans to customers. A spokesman said: ‘We made the change as the way our customers are using the service has changed. More are taking out shorter loans for smaller amounts, which, perversely, has the effect of increasing the representative APR. Providing a clear and full cost up front is one of our responsible lending policies.’ How much? Wonga has pushed up its typical APR to 5,853 per cent but it says that customer's will pay less . Short term fix: Most customers of payday loan firms only take out small amounts over a short period to tide them over but lenders have to set out what the loan would cost over a year . On its website, it tells customers: . ‘While shorter Wonga loans cost less in real terms for our customers, . this trend means a bigger representative APR. It’s crazy but true.’ Wonga . and the 49 other biggest payday loan firms have been put on notice by . the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to improve the way they agree loans, . provide information to customers and chase debts. Interest: The projected APR for small Wonga loans is considerable . Some customers have been given loans without proper checks that they are earning and can afford repayments. Others have been allowed to roll over short-term loans several times, pushing interest charges to punishing levels. Several firms have used heavy-handed tactics to chase debts. Earlier this year, it emerged that a father killed himself after being harassed by payday loan firms demanding repayments. Anthony Breeze, 36, from Bolton, burned to death after dousing himself in petrol and setting himself alight. A Citizens Advice study found the firms are fuelling debt and misery by lending to the vulnerable, including people who are drunk, the under-18s and the mentally ill. Its chief executive, Gillian Guy, said: ‘High interest rates are just one of the problems people face when taking out payday loans – hefty charges, rollovers and having their bank accounts drained, leaving them in serious financial hardship and struggling to repay money they’ve borrowed.’","Payday loan firm gave new projection of what it costs to borrow based on smaller sums .

"President Obama made time for beer and billiards in Colorado, but won't go near a humanitarian crisis in Texas, a disgusted Democratic member of Congress from the Lone Star State said Wednesday. Rep. Henry Cuellar crossed his party to say he is 'very very upset' with Obama for choosing a photo op with Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper over a chance to see firsthand how his administration is handling a flood of young illegal immigrants who have trekked to the U.S. from three Central American countries. 'He's so close to the border. And let me say this: when I saw, and I hate to use the word bizarre, but under the circumstances, when he is shown playing pool in Colorado, drinking a beer, and he can't even go 242 miles to the Texas border?' Cuellar added that the federal government is 'holding some of the young kids from the border' at Lackland Air Force Base. 'He could at least make that trip to San Antonio,' he said. Scroll down for video . 'That's some tasty beer!' President Barack Obama has a beer at Wynkoop Brewing Co. with Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper on Tuesday . Eye on the prize! Obama plays pool with Gov. John Hickenlooper keeping watch . 'He either can roll up his sleeves and go down to the border, or he can just look aloof and detached and not go to the border – send surrogates down there – and say that he's got everything under control.' 'It Just floored me,' a visibly perturbed Cuellar told MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell, 'because if he’s saying he's too busy to go down to the border, but you have time to drink a beer, play pool – the optics and the appearance just mean he's not paying attention to this humanitarian crisis.' Cuellar told Fox News on Wednesday morning that the White House has already pressured him to keep quiet. Obama will be in Texas on Wednesday afternoon and evening for Democratic Party fundraisers in Dallas and Austin. It's as close to the crisis as he's traveled since the human deluge became a public scandal. During the first speech of his two-day trip, Obama didn't mention the border situation, saying only that his flavor of 'immigration reform' is 'supported by a majority of Americans.' MailOnline was first to report last week that the president would steer clear of the state's besieged border with Mexico. Arizona Democratic Rep Raúl Grijalva said Tuesday on the same network that that the Southwest U.S. border 'deserved a presidential visit.' I think a visit by the president is reaffirming that the borderlands along the southwest border are vital and important to this nation,' he said, 'so I think a visit would be important and very symbolic.' 'This issue isn't going to go away ... while he's in Austin and Dallas,' Grijalva insisted. Humanitarian disaster: Young girls and boys are trapped in detention facilities after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border -- tens of thousands have descended on Texas and Arizona since last year . This child, not that child: Obama hugged a young girl in Denver but has no plans to see thousands of less fortunate children massed on the U.S. border a few hundred miles south of his Texas travel swing . Buzzfeed on Wednesday quoted unnamed Democratic members of Congress who called Obama's failure to see the border crisis firsthand 'confusing,' 'baffling' and 'a little offensive.' Washington Post scribe Ruth Marcus added on MSNBC that 'it's a little bit weird, because it seems like he is already in a hole, and he's keeping on digging.' Obama is behind the eight ball not only because of his casual game of pool with the Colorado governor, but also because of Republicans' claims that his 2012 immigration policy shift created the humanitarian disaster. He declared a two-year moratorium that summer on deporting illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. Another two-year delay was announced last month. Reports have swirled during the spring and summer that opportunistic human smugglers misinterpreted the policy to make Central Americans believe their own children could escape endemic violence and poverty by making a dangerous trip to the north. Rep. Henry Cuellar has bucked his party by insisting that President Obama should visit the border to see the humanitarian mess firsthand . As if a thank-you for the inspiration to come to America, some illegal immigrant children have reportedly been entering the U.S. wearing Obama-themed sneakers featuring 'Yes We Can' artwork and the president's face. Online commentator Dennis Michael Lynch first published the photos on Facebook, later adding on his website that they came from someone affiliated with U.S. Border Patrol. 'These pictures were taken from a friend who works at the processing center in South Texas,' read a note that Lynch said he received with the images. 'These are being worn by an illegal who will soon be released into the general public.' Laughing it off: Obama smiled and laughed as someone in the Denver crowd asked if he wanted a hit of marijuana . 'For people who may think this is a fake picture, notice the shoe laces. We make everyone remove their laces.' A few Democrats are publicly sticking up for the White House, most notably the far-left Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who said on CNN that a White House request for $3.7 billion in supplemental funding was the best course. 'The president knows Texas very well. I’m very confident he’s attending to serious issues by putting forth the supplemental,' she said. 'He’s going to meeting with local officials, some of whom I’ve already spoken to. We have been to the border, many of us. His cabinet members have been to the border. I think we will see that visit as time proceeds.' Obama will meet with 'local elected officials and faith leaders' about the border crisis in Dallas before his first political fundraising engagement on Wednesday, according to the White House. As that meeting began, the White House hastily announced that Obama would deliver public remarks less than an hour later about the border crisis. He will also make time for a private sit-down with Texas Gov. Rick Perry. NBC News reported, however, that Obama's handlers said he would 'get in the way' of Border Patrol efforts if he went. 'It's a no-win situation in some ways,' network White House correspondent Kristin Welker said Wednesday. 'If he goes there, what does he do? Does he give a speech? Does he meet with the children?' Republicans in Congress continue to point out a connection between America's porous southern border and Obama's repeated demands for 'comprehensive immigration reform.' Hanging out with Sarah Jessica Parker? Obama yukked it up with well-wishers in Denver, including a man wearing a horse-head costume . Texas Republican Rep. Lamar Smith said Tuesday that Obama's $3.7 billion request should go unanswered until his administration spends its existing budget to secure the border. 'This isn’t a funding problem,' Smith said on Capitol Hill. 'It’s an enforcement problem. Rather than enforce our nation’s immigration laws, the president has chosen to ignore them. Instead he continues to call for massive amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants.' Obama, he said, 'has no one to blame but himself for the current crisis on the southern border. He granted amnesty to illegal immigrant minors by promising not to deport those brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents. 'As a result, tens of thousands of illegal immigrants are now flooding across the border.' Oklahoma Republican Sen. Tom Coburn added on CNN that for a fraction of the White House's request, Congress could repatriate each of the illegal immigrant children – in style. 'Look, for $8 million, we can put them all on a first-class seat back to their homes,' he said on the Crossfire program. 'That's $8 million. That's a first-class seat, one way, to each of their homes.'","When the president touches down in Texas for two Democratic fundraisers, he won't go near the U.S.-Mexico border .

"The fight to clinch a third world title shot for George Groves will be as expensive as the one which just saw him claim the European super-middleweight title was unexpectedly arduous. It will begin this bright Monday morning. Kalle Sauerland, the Saint’s German promoter, will call WBC headquarters in Mexico City to press the claim for Groves’s mandatory challenge to Anthony Dirrell to take precedence over a voluntary defence. George Groves lands a strong right fist on opponent Christopher Rebrasse . Groves' promoter hopes to persuade Anthony Dirrell to open up a world title fight . But Anthony Dirrell (right), taking on Sakio Bika here, will take some convincing to take the fight . That decision is likely to rest with Dirrell and Sauerland knows he will have to make the American ‘an offer to come to London which is too good for him to refuse’. He adds: ‘It will be about the cash and fortunately we have the resources to deal with that.’ Having invested heavily in Saturday night’s promotion at Wembley Arena — even to the extent of flying in MC Michael Buffer from the US to make his rumbling announcement of the main event — Sauerland is prepared to dig deep again in the interests of a Londoner he proclaims as ‘one of the most exciting young boxers in the world’. Still, it is by no means certain that Dirrell will take the bait. He has made it clear that he considers Groves to be unworthy of another chance so quickly after being stopped twice by IBF world champion Carl Froch. Dirrell goes so far as to suggest that the Saint should prove himself by giving British rival James DeGale a rematch. George Groves launches a ferocious attack on Christopher Rebrasse . Christopher Rebrasse protects himself from a George Groves left hook . George Groves celebrates his belts with Arsenal stars Mesut Ozil (left) and Lukas Podolski . In monetary terms, Dirrell’s position is not as simple as the Groves camp would wish. A long-term strategy of a reasonable pay-night against a handpicked opponent he can be sure of beating, followed by a big bucks trip to England, would put even more cash in his bank account. Since Groves is determined to keep busier now, that scenario would require him to find an interim opponent in the new year. It is important that he should get back into the ring by then, now that he has dealt with the stress of returning from his shattering KO by Froch on that May night at Wembley Stadium. It is never easy to come back from such a loss and Groves admitted he was ‘tense’ going into the ring to face Christopher Rebrasse, adding: ‘You can never be sure what will happen in the first fight back after a defeat but my confidence is still there and I felt good.’ He was impressive in the first half of the fight, starting at a furious pace in an attempt to secure an early stoppage and winning the first seven rounds on my card. But when the knockout failed to materialise, there were tell-tale signs of him fading again and the obdurate Rebrasse enjoyed some success in the closing stages. George Groves was twice stopped by British rival Carl Froch . Carl Froch is adamant George Groves would lose to Anthony Dirrell if the pair entered the ring . George Groves in training for his bout with Christopher Rebrasse . The decision was comfortably unanimous — with Rebrasse agreeing he was well beaten on points — but not as emphatic as Groves would have liked against a second-tier super-middleweight. The only rematch which interests him is a third rubber with Froch. The Nottingham Cobra, a ringside commentator, discounted that possibility and advised Groves to take another rebuilding fight rather than rush in against Dirrell. Froch — still considering his own future — added: ‘George still looks easy to hit at the moment. He might have been in some trouble against a heavier puncher than Rebrasse. Dirrell would grind him down over the 12-round stretch.’ That is a niggling worry but Groves says: ‘The plan is to get Dirrell over here early next year and win my world title.’ The Saint is back, as brash as ever — which is good for British boxing — but as he concedes: ‘There is still a long road to go.’","George Groves beat Christopher Rebrasse to claim the European title .

"Chancellor George Osborne today said the Government would press ahead with money-saving cuts to police numbers and said throwing money at 'deep-seated social issues' was not the answer. He said that reform of the nation's police forces was needed, which would make officers more visible on the streets. However, he rejected the notion that improving the country's safety was a matter of simply boosting police numbers. Chancellor George Osborne said today that the Government would go ahead with cuts, as former U.S police chief claimed making multiple arrests was not the answer to solving society's problems . In a phone call to David Cameron this week President Obama congratulated the way Britain's police and politicians have handled the riots.. A White House, a spokesman said: 'President Obama commended the Prime Minister on the steadiness he, his Government and the British police had demonstrated in handling the recent riots and shared the Prime Minister's hope that the situation would now continue to remain calm.' Mr Osborne's words will infuriate many, . including London Mayor Boris Johnson,who claimed there were simply not . enough police on the streets to cope with this week's rioting and . looting. Praise: President Obama has commended the way police handled the riots . His words came as a former U.S. police . chief drafted in by David Cameron to help restore order to the UK's . streets said that making multiple arrests after a social disorder event . was not a helpful strategy. Former New York police head Bill Bratton claimed young thugs and gang members should be made to ‘fear’ the police and stiff punishments for crimes. Famed for his ‘zero tolerance’ tactics, Mr Bratton said that UK forces should be more assertive with offenders, advocating a doctrine of ‘escalating force’. 'You can't arrest your way out of the problem,' he said. 'Arrest is certainly appropriate for the most violent, the incorrigible, but so much of it can be addressed in other ways and it is not just a police issue, it is in fact a societal issue.' His words came as police forces around the country trumpeted the arrest of more than 2,000 suspects, thanks in part to a number of hugely successful 'shop a looter' campaigns run by individual forces. Last week David Cameron was reported to have approached Mr Bratton to discuss taking charge of the Metropolitan Police, and he has already enlisted him to help tackle the threat of gangs as a government advisor. However fresh doubts emerged today over Mr Bratton's chances of landing the top job at the Met, which could be hindered by the Prime Minister’s own police reforms and clampdown on immigration. According to the Guardian, as a U.S. citizen Mr Bratton may be blocked by the police and social responsibility bill currently going through parliament. It states that the Met commissioner must hold the office of 'constable', which Mr Bratton, who has never served in the British police, does not. He could be sworn in but would then face another obstacle. Those who hold the office of constable and who are not British citizens must have been granted immigration status allowing them to remain in the UK indefinitely. However, the government has vowed to restrict the numbers of people being granted permission to stay in Britain indefinitely to limit immigration. New York: Bratton made his name by tackling gang crime in the city . In further misery for Mr Cameron, a poll for the Independent newspaper showed 54 per cent of Brits thought the Prime Minister - on holiday when trouble started -had not taken command of the riot situation early enough in the week. A former leader of one of London's most feared street gangs added that the riots were indicative of frustrations among young people, rather than an orchestrated outburst of violence. The 63-year-old American said young offenders should be made to realise very early in their lives that crime will result in punishment. He said: ‘You want the criminal element to fear them, fear their ability to interrupt their own ability to carry out criminal behaviour, and arrest and prosecute and incarcerate them. ‘In my experience, the younger criminal element don’t fear the police and have been emboldened to challenge the police and effectively take them on,' he told the Telegraph. ‘What needs to be understood is that police are empowered to do certain things - to stop, to talk, to frisk on certain occasions, to arrest if necessary, to use force.’ The deadline for applications for the Commissioner’s post, which became vacant following the resignation of Sir Paul Stephenson during the phone hacking scandal, was supposed to be Friday. However, it has been put back following this week’s riots. Bill Bratton is not a complete outsider to British policing. He's been a consultant advising different forces. In 1991, he . famously delivered a list of about 400 gang and drug kingpins he wanted . to arrest to the mayor of Boston when he became commissioner. His initial success in New York relied on big increases in resources - recruiting 5,000 new better trained officer. Reports of serious crime dropped 27 per cent. In Los Angeles he worked on smaller budgets, specifically tackling gangs, using Big Society ideas of local areas taking responsibility for fighting crime in their neighbourhoods. Mr Bratton left Los Angeles police in 2009 - after significantly lowering the crime rate and is now chairman of Kroll, a Manhattan-based private security firm. The advert placed by the Home Office states that candidates ‘must be British citizens’. Mr Cameron spoke to Mr Bratton - who has also headed the Los Angeles police - by telephone yesterday. The two men discussed the possibility of Mr Bratton advising the Government on how to deal with gangs. Mr Bratton said: 'This is a Prime Minister who has a clear idea of what he wants to do. 'He sees this crisis as a way to bring change. The police force there can be a catalyst for that. I'm very optimistic.' The pair are expected to meet face-to-face next month to continue their talks. But many UK police officers are said to be furious at the Prime Minister's decision to contact him. Ian Hanson, chairman of Greater Manchester Police Federation, claimed many officers resented the decision to consult a foreigner about a domestic problem. He said: 'There is anger, there is disappointment and a degree of incredulity as well. 'We're local people who live in the communities, who work in the communities and police them. He needs to speak to us, not someone who lives 5,000 miles away.' Mr Hanson believes there were not enough police officers at the start of this week's riots because the Government has cut police numbers. He added: 'One thing that Bill Bratton did when he took over in New York in 1994, was he increased the establishment of New York City police by 5,000 officers. 'How an earth are we going to replicate that with cuts approaching 30,000 police officers?' Getting to grips: A police officer tackles a looter in Manchester on Tuesday night . Chancellor George Osborne today backed Mr Bratton and said there were 'deep-seated social problems' to address but stuck to the party line on police budget cuts. 'We . are committed to the plan we have set out for police reform. And it is . about reform, about improving the presence of the police in our . communities, making the police more visible,' he said. He told Radio 4 Today programme. 'There are very deep-seated social problems which we need to tackle. 'There are communities that have just . been left behind by the rest of the country, there are communities cut . off from the economic lifeblood of the rest of the country. 'I don't think the debate should be . reduced to whether there should be x-thousand numbers of police officers . or x-thousand-plus-one numbers of police officers in our society. 'We . want an effective police service. They have done an amazing job this . week. We want to use the advice of people like Bill Bratton to really . tackle some of the deep-seated social issues like gang culture. 'But . this is not just about police budgets; this is about a far bigger . challenge for our society, which is dealing with people who we have . ignored for too long and helping them feel they have a stake in . society.'","President Obama praises the way UK police tackled the rioters .

"Canon Jeremy Pemberton (left) with his boyfriend Laurence Cunnington before their marriage  in Southwell, Nottinghamshire . The first clergyman to enter into  a gay marriage in defiance of the Church of England has been ‘sacked’ by his bishop. Sources said Canon Jeremy Pemberton, who married Laurence Cunnington in April, is to have his rights to operate as a priest revoked. He will no longer be able to conduct services in the diocese, though he remains employed by the NHS as a hospital chaplain. The decision by the Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham Richard Inwood to remove the Canon’s ‘Permission to Officiate’ will also make it very difficult for him to function as a priest anywhere else in the Church of England. Pro-gay liberals say the development is ‘disappointing’. In another test of Church authority, well-known north London vicar Rev Andrew Cain yesterday became the second cleric to enter a banned same-sex union when he married his long-term boyfriend Stephen Foreshew. He has sent out invitations for a post-wedding party next month, which  will include ‘tea, with champagne, bells and the Gay Men’s Chorus for entertainment’. Neither Canon Pemberton would not comment and the Diocese of Southwell said it was a private matter. Commenting on the action against Canon Pemberton, Father Cain said last night: ‘This is very disappointing.Making a lifetime commitment to another person is what we preach.’ Dr Jeffrey John who is gay but celibate, was forced to withdraw his acceptance of the post of suffragan Bishop of Reading in a row over homosexual priests . Simon Sarmiento, the spokesman for  the liberal campaign group Inclusive Church, said: ‘If the bishops continue to take disciplinary action against clergy getting married they must expect a backlash.’ Both Canon Pemberton and Rev Mr Cain are taking advantage of David Cameron’s controversial new law that came into force in March, giving gay couples the same rights to civil marriages as heterosexuals. But the House of Bishops’ guidelines released in February said that clergy should not enter into such unions because they undermined the traditional Church teaching that marriage is reserved for a man and a woman.","Canon Jeremy Pemberton married Laurence Cunnington to have rights to operate as a priest revoked .

"A rare copy of the comic book featuring Superman's first appearance that went undiscovered for over 70 years in the insulation of a Minnesota house has sold for $175,000 - making the construction worker who found it a happy man. The high bidder for the copy of Action Comics No. 1 in the online auction was a 'hard core, golden age comic book collector,' Stephen Fishler, CEO of ComicConnect.com, said yesterday. The buyer's name was not released but 51 offers were submitted before bidding closed Monday night. This copy was found by David Gonzalez, 34, among old newspapers in the ceiling insulation of a . house he was restoring in the small western Minnesota town of Hoffman. Scroll down for video . Torn: David Gonzalez found this incredibly rare 1938 No. 1 issue of the Superman comic in the ceiling of a house, but the back cover of the precious find suffered a tear when he got into a fight with a relative over the value of the comic . He accidentally tore the cover when . grabbed it and tossed it aside during an argument a few days later with . his wife's aunt, which was part of the reason its condition was graded . only 1.5 on a 10-point scale used by comic collectors, but he said in an . interview last month that he really didn't care much about the money. Fishler said the buyer had been . looking for a several months for a lower-grade, un-restored copy of the . Man of Steel's debut, rather than a copy in better condition that could . have cost well over $1 million. Fishler estimates there are only around 100 known copies of Action Comics No. 1, which was published in 1938. He said it's prized not only for its rarity, but because Superman was the archetype of all comic book superheroes to come. Fishler said the book's backstory was part of why it appealed to the winning bidder. A pristine Action Comics No. 1 that . was graded a 9 fetched $2.16 million in November 2011, which was the . highest price ever paid for a comic book. Man of steel: The Action 1 comic, showing Superman for the first time, sold for $175,000 . Gonzalez could have made nearly . $200,000 if it were not for a heated argument with a relative that . turned into a tug-of-war over a rare and valuable Superman comic book. Gonzales, of New York, was renovating a house in Minnesota when he came across what is considered the Holy Grail of comic books. The book sat undisturbed in the ceiling of the house in the town of Hoffman for over 70 years. Hidden treasure: David Gonzalez found the rare comic in the wall of a house he was renovating . But . a few days after he found it, Gonzales said, he got into a heated . exchange with his wife’s aunt about its value, and she wanted a cut of . the money. He said he also grew irritated because every time she would turn a page, crumbs of paper would fall out. Finally he said, he grabbed it and tossed it aside, accidentally tearing the back cover. 'I don’t care about the money,' he recalled telling her. 'I don’t care. It’s my comic book. I can burn it if I want to.' Gonzales said the relative backed down when his wife warned her he was serious. The lucky construction worker said he . understands the ripped cover and other damage decreased the . potential price. But he said that doesn’t bother him. 'I’m not a hungry person about money,' he said, adding that he’d rather work for it. The selling price is ten times what Mr Gonzalez paid for the house where it was found. The father-of-four from Hoffman bought the abandoned house, with a damaged roof, for $10,100. When he tracked down the owner of the . rundown house, he was told a restaurant had offered $10,000 to demolish . the house and build a car park over it. So he offered an extra $100. The discovery has amazed comic book collectors, who say that most of the Action 1 comic books have been sold numerous times. Movie star: The latest Superman film, Man of Steel, is due for release in June . Valuable: This grade 9 copy of the Action 1 comic sold for more than $2 miillion . Only about 100 issues of the comic, . which sold originally for 10 cents, are known to exist and it is considered . by many enthusiasts to be the Holy Grail of comic books. 'It's considered by most people as . the most important book,' John Dolmayan, a comic book dealer and drummer . for System of a Down, told NBC News. 'It kind of ushered in the age of the superheroes.' The . next most valuable superhero is Spider-Man, whose first appearance in . Amazing Fantasy in 1962 attracts bids of about $1million at auction. Zurzolo, the co-owner of . ComicConnect, said it was miraculous that the Superman comic had survived for nearly eight decades. 'It’s . so hard for anyone to fathom that, in this day and age, you could still . discover a comic book that nobody has known about because this book was . in a wall of a house for more than 70 years,' he said. Superman has kept his popularity over the decades, generating a series of films, television shows and spin off series such as Smallville. In the latest film, Man of Steel, which is due for release on June 14, fans of the superhero from Krypton will watch Clark Kent confront his secret background after Earth is invaded by members of his race. The Superman find may have excited . comic book enthusiasts, but Mr Gonzalez is taking a Clark Kent approach . to his valuable discovery, by keeping his feet firmly on the ground. 'I . am a humble working guy, so I didn’t get too excited when I found it . with old newspapers stuffed in the walls,' he said. 'Money won’t buy you . happiness.'

"President Barack Obama's chief spokesman said Monday that most on the tens of thousands of unaccompanied illegal immigrant children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border are unlikely to qualify for humanitarian relief . that would prevent them from being sent back from their home countries. The . pointed warning came as the White House prepared to send a funding request to . Congress detailing the additional money Obama . wants to spend hiring more immigration judges and opening new detention facilities to deal with the border crisis. White House . officials told the Associated Press that they planned to ask Congress for more than $2 billion on Tuesday. White . House spokesman Josh Earnest said the administration also wants lawmakers to give it the legal authority to sidestep a 2008 law requiring a careful evaluation of each child before deportation proceedings can begin. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Obama lunched with a group of teachers in the Blue Room at the White House on Monday as his press flack Josh Earnest explained that most unaccompanied illegal immigrant children will be sent back to Central America, but asked Congress to authorize fast-track deportations . Crisis: More than 47,000 unaccompanied children have entered the country illegally since Oct. 1, including 9,700 in the Month of May alone . Hot seat: Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said Sunday that 'we need to find more efficient, effective ways to turn this tide around' That law, passed by a Democrat-controlled Congress, was meant to provide protection for children brought into the U.S. as part of human trafficking schemes, mostly related to the illicit sex trade. In the absence of a move on Capitol Hill, the federal government has no choice but to treat the deluge of children arriving from Central American countries the same way. That process can take weeks or months and tie up resources – including U.S. Border Patrol agents – making the border even more porous. Complicating the situation is a new set of data released last week by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, showing that the Obama administration has deeply curtailed efforts to deport minors or  turn them away at the border. In 2008, the last year of the Bush administration, 8,143 such children were prevented from staying in the U.S. In 2013 that number was just 1,669. Earnest told reporters on Monday that that while the administration will . allow the required immigration review process to unfold, officials so far . don't expect many of the children arriving at the border to be able to . stay in the U.S. 'It's . unlikely that most of these kids will qualify for humanitarian relief,' Earnest said. 'It means they will not have a legal basis for remaining . in this country and will be returned.' Department of Homeland Security . Secretary Jeh Johnson acknowledged Sunday on the NBC show 'Meet the Press' that it could take a long time for those deportations to begin. 'Our . border is not open to illegal migration, and we are taking a number of . steps to address it, including turning people around faster,' Johnson said. But 'we need to find more efficient, . effective ways to turn this tide around generally,' he said, 'and we've already . begun to do that.' Johnson . acknowledged that the unaccompanied children, some 9,700 taken into custody in May alone, pose a vexing problem. Most . of the children are from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. The White House is asking Congress for the authority to fast-track deportations to those three countries in particular. Hurry up: Newly minted White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the influx of unaccompanied minors at the border won't change deportation policy, but that the administration wants the authority to act faster . House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (R) was House Speaker in 2008 when Congress passed the law that the Obama White House now ants relaxed . While the Obama administration claims spikes in violence . and poverty have prompted parents there to send their children on difficult . and dangerous journeys north, Republicans contend that Obama's own 2012 immigration policy shift is to blame. That summer the president held a Rose Garden press conference to announce one of many 'executive actions,' a move to delay for two years the deportation of U.S. residents brought to the U.S. illegally as children. This year the White House extended that delay for another two years. As word of a new leniency filtered southward, aided by opportunistic traffickers, the current flood of children crossing the Rio Grande river into Texas, and evading border patrols in Arizona and New Mexico. Johnson . said the U.S. government is trying to send the message that all people . who enter the country illegally will face deportation proceedings . eventually. But in Central America, he said, 'the criminal smuggling . organizations are putting out a lot of disinformation about supposed . free passes into this country' that will expire soon. The resulting onslaught has overwhelmed federal agencies. When 140 would-be immigrants – mostly mothers with children – were flown to southern California to . ease an overcrowded Texas facility, angry residents of Murrieta, . California, greeted the bus as it pulled into town, complaining that . they were being saddled with more than their share. 'This . is a failure of diplomacy. It is a failure of leadership from the . administration,"" Texas Gov. Rick Perry said Sunday on ABC's 'This Week.' Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat, crossed party lines Sunday on CNN's 'State of the Union' to complain that the White House 'is one step behind' a foreseeable crisis since numbers of children coming from . Central America without adults has been rising dramatically since 2012. Unaccompanied . Central American children generally are being released to relatives . already in the United States. Mothers with their children often are . released with a summons to appear later in immigration court. Meanwhile, word of seemingly successful border crossings reaches their home countries, encouraging others to try. South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said Sunday on the CBS 'Face the Nation' program that children entering the country illegally . must be sent home. If not, he said, 'you're going to incentivize . people throughout that part of the world to keep sending their children . here.' Graham . also said foreign aid should be cut off to countries that don't do more to . discourage illegal immigration to the United States.","2008 law aimed at helping child trafficking victims requires Homeland Security to evaluate unaccompanied minors before deporting them .

"An Air France jet flew for five days before ground crews noticed that 30 screws were missing from one of its wings. The Airbus A340 plane had undergone routine maintenance in China, before flying to Paris and then on to the US before the potentially disastrous blunder was finally spotted. The plane, which can carry up to 440 passengers, was grounded in Boston while a 'large protective panel' was screwed back into place. Damaged: An Air France Airbus A340 (similar to the one pictured) flew for five days before ground crews noticed that 30 screws were missing from one of its wings . The gaffe was revealed in an internal union document leaked to French news agency AFP. Air France have blamed aircraft mechanics in the Chinese city of Xiamen, were the airline's jets are often serviced because of lower costs. An Air France technical operations spokesman said: 'The plane flew for several days before it was grounded because one third of the screws holding down a piece of bodywork were missing. 'It was part of the outer covering of the wing and at no point was flight safety compromised. Tragedy: The Air France Concorde crash 11 years ago killed 113 people and was blamed on a strip of metal on the runway which punctured the plane's tyres and sent rubber fragments flying into a fuel tank . July 25, 2000:  Concorde Flight 4590 from De Gaulle airport in Paris to JFK in New York, crashed just after take-off. All 109 people on board died, and four people on the ground. Probable cause was punctured tyre. August 2, 2005: Flight 358, an Airbus A340, overshot runway at Toronto Pearson International Airport during a thunderstorm. All 297 passengers and 12 crew survived but the plane was completely destroyed by fire. Pilot error blamed. June 1, 2009: Flight 447, an Airbus A330, from Rio de Janeiro to Paris lost contact with air traffic control while over Atlantic Ocean. Only portions of the plane and 51 bodies, out of 228 on board, were found. The cause of the disaster is still under investigation. 'The maintenance team that works for Air France are internationally recognised and this is the first ever incident of its kind.' But an aircraft construction expert said: 'The piece itself may not have endangered the flight if it came off. 'But there is always the risk that it could have struck and damaged another very important part of the aircraft as it became detached and blew away in flight.' An Air France union spokesman described the oversight as 'deplorable'. He added: 'Pieces of an aircraft should never simply go missing during maintenance. It is not the first time this has happened either. 'Last year a Boeing 747 was grounded after undergoing maintenance in China because parts of the plane had been painted with flammable paint.'

"A new dinosaur species may be the largest land predator ever discovered in Europe. The beast, found in Portugal, is estimated to have been up to 10 metres long and weighing in at between four and five tons. It would have been one of the largest carnivorous dinosaurs from the Jurassic era, according to findings published in the journal PLOS ONE. Fearsome: The enormous creature, named Torvosaurus gurney, was discovered in Lisbon, Portugal. It was more than 30ft (10m) long and had razor-sharp 4in(10cm)-long teeth . Scientists discovered bones belonging to the dinosaur north of Lisbon. They were originally believed to be Torvosaurus tanneri, a dinosaur species from North America. Torvosaurs were a type of carnivorous dinosaur that lived between 153 and 148 million years ago during the later part of the Jurassic Period. They are only known to have lived in what is now Colorado and Portugal. Torvosaurus tanneri was a large, heavily built, bipedal predator that could grow to a length of about 32ft (10m). It was among the largest carnivores of its time - with some specimens measuring up to 36ft (11m) long. The species is thought to have had short but very powerful arms. However, closer comparison of the shin bone, upper jawbone, teeth, and partial tail vertebrae suggested to the researchers that it may warrant a new species name, Torvosaurus gurneyi. Co-authors Christophe Hendrickx and Octavio Mateus, from Universidade Nova de Lisboa and Museu da Lourinhã, said T. gurneyi had blade-shaped teeth up to 10 cm long, which indicates it may have been at the top of the food chain in the Iberian Peninsula roughly 150 million years ago. They said the number of teeth, as well as size and shape of the mouth, may differentiate the European and the American Torvosaurus. An artist's impression of a Torvosaurus gurneyi as the fossilised remains of what scientists believe is the largest land dinosaur ever to have roamed Europe . One of the original upper mouth palates of the Torvosaurus gurneyi is pictured. T. gurneyi had blade-shaped teeth up to 10 cm long, which indicates it may have been at the top of the food chain . The bones were found in Lisbon, Portugal . The fossil of the upper jaw of T. tanneri has 11 or more teeth, while T. gurneyi has fewer than 11. The mouth bones also have a different shape and structure. The new dinosaur is the second species of Torvosaurus to be named. PhD student Hendrickx said: 'This is not the largest predatory dinosaur we know. 'Tyrannosaurus, Carcharodontosaurus, and Giganotosaurus from the Cretaceous were bigger animals. 'With a skull of 115 centimetres, Torvosaurus gurneyi was however one of the largest terrestrial carnivores at this epoch, and an active predator that hunted other large dinosaurs, as evidenced by blade shape teeth up to 10cms.' He said fossil evidence of closely-related dinosaurs suggest that the predator may have already been covered with proto-feathers. Recently described dinosaur embryos from Portugal are also ascribed to the new species of Torvosaurus. An artist's impression of a Torvosaurus gurneyi compared with a human being. The beast, found in Portugal, is estimated to have been up to 10 metres long and weighing in at between four and five tons .

"Barry McGuigan would like to point out that Carl Frampton, the heir apparent to his own Irish legend, would be only too happy to accommodate Scott Quigg, who has just defended the ‘regular’ WBA world super-bantamweight title with a quick-fire KO. However, McGuigan makes it clear that there would be more chance of that Battle of Britain happening if Quigg’s promoter Eddie Hearn would ‘stop posturing on the internet and engage in proper discussion.’ Hearn expressed being ‘keen to make Quigg-Frampton’ in his most recent MailOnline column but McGuigan says: ‘Eddie has not responded to our invitation to take part in meaningful talks. ‘He keeps twittering that he wants this fight for Quigg but the social media is no way to conduct serious negotiations. Certainly not for us. On top: Scott Quigg successfully defended his WBA super bantamweight title in Manchester . ‘Eddie did make one early offer to us but it was derisory. I invited him to meet with us immediately for sensible talks but he said he had to go abroad for another fight. So I suggested an appointment the following week... but he never came back to us. ‘Since then he’s kept saying in public how eager he is  to do this fight but we’ve still heard nothing from him. We would be delighted to get it on but do they really, really want it? I doubt it. ‘Quigg’s a good fighter but Carl is special and I believe he would knock him out. I suspect Eddie thinks so, too.’ Both boxers impressed in their most recent fights, each with second round stoppages.First, in a rocking Belfast, Frampton took out Mexico’s former two-time world champion Hugo Cazares in a final eliminator for the WBC world title. Pummel: Quigg was too good forTshifhiwa Munyai at the MEN Arena . Battle of Britain? Quigg could fight Carl Frampton (right) in a huge world title showdown . Then, on Saturday in Manchester, Quigg made his statement by halting African challenger Tshifiwa Munyai. Unless they can be brought into the same ring, each will move on to alternative championship fights. McGuigan is in talks with WBC belt-holder Leo Santo Cruz, who has declared himself willing to come to Belfast for a big-money stadium defence against Frampton later this summer. Hearn is eyeing a unification fight for Quigg with Kiko Martinez, who has been soundly beaten by Frampton but has come back to lift the IBF title. Hearn hints, also, that he is holding his own talks with Santa Cruz. The British public are already hungry for Frampton v Quigg  but it would appear that boxing politics are again at work here. There is no mention of Quigg making the logicial step up to meet full WBA champion Guillermo Rigondeaux, nor of Frampton taking that route. In all honesty that is probably a wise precaution on the part of both Brits. Cuba’s former two-time Olympic gold medallist was one of the greatest amateurs of all time is now in a brilliant class of his own in the professional super-bantam division. He, too, has offered to make the trip to Belfast but it would be foolish for either Frampton or Quigg to take on Rigondeaux at this stage of their development. And while Quigg-Frampton is potentially a big-money match at the moment, it will be even hotter box office if the meeting waits until they both hold world titles. Not that the great McGuigan ever ducked or delayed fighting anyone on his way to the pinnacle. And he says: ‘I never want to be drawn into the politics or arguments like these. But in this case I find myself having to make the case for Carl. ‘We are . caught up in the cross-fire of rivalry between two television networks, . BoxNation where Carl is appearing, and Sky, with whom Eddie has an . exclusive deal and who don’t want Quigg to fight on another channel. ‘But I have to make it known that Carl will gladly fight Quigg if they are willing to do it.’ Boxing politics: A number of obstacles need to be overcome if Quigg is to fight Frampton, like TV channels . It also has to be said that while both are exciting prospects, the quality of their latest victims left something to be desired. Cazares baled out after his first taste of Frampton’s power, staying down on one knee and then claiming he had misunderstood the ten count. Munyai was a very late replacement against Quigg, struggled as a consequence to make the weight and appeared drained and weak as soon he took a heavy shot. Of the two of them Frampton, who has yet to win an alpha-belt, looks more mature than Quigg at this point in their careers. Bernard Hopkins continues to defy all-comers, Father Time included. Already, at 49, the oldest boxer to win a recognised world championship, he has now became the longest in the tooth to unify two titles. He did so on Saturday by not only outclassing Kazakhstan’s Beibut Shumenov in Washington but decking, in the process, a challenger 19 years his junior. Thus he added the WBA light-heavyweight title to his IBF belt. Breathtaking: Bernard Hopkins beat Beibut Shumenov to unify the world light-heavyweight titles . Unloading: Hopkins battered Shumenov in their WBA & IBA light heavyweight title fight in Washington . So on to 50. His birthday is in January, when he will become eligible for senior citizen benefits in America. Expect him to fill in the gap by fighting, and probably defeating, Jean Pascal in Canada. Even if he does not make it to his half century still wearing the belts, his place in the pantheon as the ring’s oldest champion will surely never be challenged. George Foreman won the world heavyweight championship by knocking out Michael Moorer at 45 but relinquished the title a year later. And while Big George looked as if he was scoffing several times a day from one of his famous barbecues, Hopkins diets and trains to stay at or near his fighting weight at all times. Way back when: Hopkins hits Keith Holmes  at Madison Square Garden in 2001 . Dust off: The Executioner beat Oscar De La Hoya at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas in 2004 . Dust off: Welshman Joe Calzaghe out pointed Hopkins in 2008 to remain unbeaten . He still looks every inch – in his case a young man’s 31in around the waits - the modern professional boxer. This man, who enters the ring wearing the mask of an alien, really is a freak of nature. But he protects his human health by the clever way he fights, saying: ‘Boxing is a science.  If you don’t have to get hit, don’t. You don’t want to end up having to get someone else to count your money.’ It is 26 years since Hopkins lost his first professional bout and 20 years since he won his first world title, the IBF middleweight crown, by defeating Segundo Mercado at extreme and for him unfamiliar altitude in the Ecuador capital of Quito. He is the champion of bus-pass holders the world over and he adds: ‘I’m making history every day.’ Long may he continue to do so. Kell Brook’s long-awaited world title shot appears to be nearing but Sheffield’s finest could be forgiven for wishing that the fight between two Americans which has led to that opportunity had ended in a different result. Brutal: Shawn Porter (left) put Paulie Malignaggi in hospital after a devastating four rounds . Next in line: Kell Brook is awaiting a world title shot . Paulie Malignaggi – a loser previously to Ricky Hatton and Amir Khan – might well have been a manageable opponent for Brook but he was blown away in four brutal rounds by IBF welterweight champion Shawn Porter and ended Saturday night in a New York hospital. New York favourite Malignaggi, 34, recovered to say: ‘If this is it for me I want it to be known that I went out to a great champion.’ Brook is now Porter’s mandatory challenger and the fight is supposed to take place in July. If, as expected, the champion is granted a recovery-time extension of an extra twp or three months Brook should not be too concerned. He will need to be at his absolute best against Porter, who packs middleweight punching power, and every minute of preparation time will be precious. Ricky Hatton’s hot prospect Adam Etches continues his unusual route to the top in the Hitman’s show in Sheffield on Saturday night. Etches fights for his third world youth title against Mexican Felipe Teniente at the Ponds Forge Arena.Already the holder of two IBF championships at this level, he goes now for the WBC Youth middleweight crown. For the moment, the traditional progress to a British title is on hold. Etches says: ‘A lot of people are asking me when I’ll be fighting for a Londsdale Belt but these fights are getting me up the ratings with the world bodies.’ Protege: Adam Etches (left) has been taken under Ricky Hatton's wing . However, he is expected to meet Chris Eubank Jnr or John Ryder later this year. Lucas ‘Big Daddy’ Browne tops Saturday’s bill in his clash with Canada’s Erik Bahoeli for the vacant Commonwealth heavyweight title. *Browne-Bahoeli and Etches-Tenient are live Saturday night on BoxNation. It is the end of the road for boxing bin-man Rendall Munroe following the loss of his commonwealth featherweight title to young Josh Warrington. Munroe, 34 in June, was in tears as he retired on his stool at the end of the sixth round in Manchester on Saturday night. Once the emotions are back under control he can reflect on his admirable contribution to this hard old game, climaxed in 2010 by taking Japan’s brilliant Toshiaki Nishioka the distance in Tokyo in his one world featherweight title shot. End of the road: Rendall Munroe (right) was in tears after retiring during a commonwealth title fight . Munroe is one of the best-loved of British champions and it was fun for me to join him and his work-mates on an early-morning rubbish collection round in Leicester shortly before he flew to Japan.Thanks for the memories.","Scott Quigg should face Carl Frampton in a super-bantamweight title fight .

Tests done immediately after the exposure or . within this window period may not detect the virus and give a false . negative result. The CDC . recommends that individuals who have been exposed to HIV and have been . found negative before three months have elapsed get retested after three . months. Leathers released a further statement this morning: 'I do not have HIV and have not been exposed to HIV regardless of the reports out there saying otherwise. 'I was not contacted by the Free Speech Coalition to re-test, I reached out to them to see if I should re-test and was told I did not need to. 'I took all the necessary precautions before and after my scene for Vivid and acted responsibly and therefore was able to protect myself from exposure to anything. 'As an added precaution I retested 2 days after my shoot and again yesterday and was negative.' Diane Duke, executive director of the industry trade group the Free Speech Coalition, told the Associated Press in an e-mail about the HIV detection: 'The moratorium will be lifted once the risk of transmission has been eliminated. Virus: Cameron Bay, who has appeared in adult films since 2010, confirmed last night she was the performer responsible for the moratorium . 'In fact, since 2004 there have only been two cases of performers . testing positive for HIV and neither of those situations involved on-set . transmission,' Duke said. 'The current situation would bring the number . to three cases in nearly 10 years, not just in Los Angeles but . nationwide.' The industry briefly put a similar . moratorium in place last year after nearly a dozen performers were . infected during a syphilis outbreak. Word . of the latest moratorium quickly drew critical responses from porn . industry opponents. Among them was Michael Weinstein, whose group the . AIDS Healthcare Foundation successfully lobbied voters last year to . adopt an ordinance requiring actors use condoms in the making of most . porn films. 'How many adult film performers have to become infected with an array of preventable sexually transmitted diseases — including HIV, which is not curable — before the porn industry actually complies with the law requiring condom use,' he said in a statement. Since the ordinance's adoption, county officials have said they are investigating one violation. Assemblyman Isadore Hall III, who is pushing for the state to adopt a similar law, called Wednesday's news 'devastating and preventable.' 'Exposing workers to this type of harm would not be accepted in any other industry in this nation,' the Los Angeles Democrat said. The industry, which says its audience does not want to see condoms, is fighting the Los Angeles County measure in court.

"Fast food fans still getting over the unpleasant sight of a Taco Bell employee licking a stack of taco shells last week should probably look away now. An image has emerged showing a Wendy’s server filling his mouth with ice cream directly from the nozzle of a Frosty machine. The photo is just the latest in a series of unpleasant images to go viral showing fast food employees doing things that their employers wouldn't approve off. This vulgar image of a Wendy's employee eating ice cream direct from the Frosting machine has caused an internet sensation and led to the man losing his job . The only certainty with this PR disaster is when the fast food chain catches the culprit he will undoubtedly get sacked for doing untold damage to the chain’s brand. The photograph surfaced on Reddit on Wednesday along with the words: ‘I was going to buy a frosty from Wendy's until I saw the employee do this’. The photograph appears to have been taken behind the counter which suggests that the person taking it was also an employee. Wendy’s hasn’t released a statement yet but watch this space. Wendy's hasn't made a statement yet about the photograph but the company is expected to sack any staff involved in the prank . Tongue lashing: This unnamed employee has lost his job after this photograph was posted to the Taco Bell Facebook page and went viral . The incident comes hot on heels of Taco Bell taking decisive action against their now infamous taco licking employee. Fast food fans collectively wretched last week after a shocking photograph appeared on Taco Bell's official Facebook page showing a red-haired man licking a stack of unfilled shells. The photograph was posted on June 2 by a 'Jj O'Brien Nolan' and set off a PR nightmare for the fast food chain. Two days later, in response to a deluge of negative publicity, Taco Bell confirmed that the worker had been identified and fired. 'Our franchisee is responsible for the employment and conduct of his restaurant’s employees and he has informed us that he immediately suspended the employee shown in the photo and is in the process of terminating his employment. 'The employee who took the photo no longer works there.' Initially it was not confirmed whether the photograph was a fake or if the tacos were indeed meant for the trash or were used in food preparation. Taco Bell denied they were. Taco trials: It has emerged that the restaurant where the photograph was taken is in Ridgecrest, California . 'Our food handling procedures are strict and we have zero tolerance for any violations,' Taco Bell said in a statement. 'The taco shells were used for training in March before we launched a new product, and were in process of being thrown out.' Despite the risks of being caught, these are only the latest examples of fast food workers getting into hot water over questionable treatment of food photographed and posted to social media. In April, a KFC worker posted photographs of herself licking a pile of mashed potatoes on Facebook and was promptly fired by her employer. Last year, three Burger King employees from Ohio were fired after images of them standing in two bins full of shredded lettuce were uploaded to their Facebook pages. And in another shameful Taco Bell image, a worker tweeted a photograph of himself urinating into a plate of nachos in August last year. ‘I pissed on them where nobody could see, in private, and I threw them away. There’s literally nothing they can do. Fire me. I don’t care,’ Cameron Jankowski of Fort Wayne said of the photo. Taco Bell took him up on his offer and he was relieved of duties immediately.","A photo has emerged of a Wendy's employee disregarding health and safety standards at work .

"President Barack Obama has backed off a request for Congress to give his administration more latitude to deport illegal immigrant children coming to the U.S. from Central America, two high-profile Republican members of Congress said today. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mike McCaul claimed this morning that the president did not include a formal request for Congress to change the existing law after telling them in a letter last week he supported revisions because his party successfully pressured him not to. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi did not indicate that her caucus had asked the president to backtrack but made clear today in her weekly briefing with reporters that she was not in favor of amending the law to allow the Department of Homeland Security to immediately send children from non-contiguous countries back home. President Barack Obama, pictured here today in Austin, Texas, was expected to formally ask Congress to loosen deportation restrictions for illegal immigrant children from Central America but that hasn't happened . President Obama arrives at an event on the economy at the Paramount Theatre in Austin, Texas this afternoon . Current law requires children who illegally immigrate to the U.S. through the southern border and originate from anywhere but Mexico be taken into custody by the Department of Homeland Security. DHS then has 72 hours to turn them over to the Department of Health and Human Services. From there, the government requires that they are given court dates and hearings to determine if they qualify for refugee status before they can be returned to their home countries. The White House has admitted that very few of the children will actually obtain refugee status, so giving them due process, which can take months, is a mostly a waste of time and money. In a letter to congressional leaders last Monday, President Obama said his administration would be following up with an official request to have the 2008 law loosened. 'We are eager to work with the Congress to ensure that we have the legal authorities to maximize the impact of our efforts Government-wide strategy as the influx of migrants continues,' Obama said. 'Initially, we believe this may include...providing the DHS Secretary additional authority to exercise discretion in processing the return and removal of unaccompanied minor children from non-contiguous countries like Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador,' Obama said, 'and increasing penalties for those who smuggle vulnerable migrants, like children.' The president also forewarned congressional leaders that he would be asking them for additional funds for agencies that handle illegal immigration in order to pay for a variety of programs associated with the surge in unaccompanied minors crossing the border. More than 52,000 children, coming primarily from Central America, have crossed the border since last October, and the administration expects as many as 100,000 to come before year's end. President Obama meets with University of Austin student Kinsey Button, right, at the Magnolia Cafe in Austin, Texas this morning. The president is a short plane ride away from the border but has no plans to visit it before returning to Washington this afternoon . Yet, when the president made his request on Tuesday for $3.7 billion in supplemental funds for immigration authorities he did not include legislative language to reform the  2008 trafficking law. The president said in a letter accompanying his budget request that he would work with Congress to amend the law separately. At a press briefing later that afternoon, White House Press Secretary John Earnest played down concerns that the president was walking back his call for Congress to change the law. Earnest said the administration didn't include specific language simply because it wanted to give Congress the space to do its job. He also divulged that senior White House officials had been in touch with senior officials of Congress to discuss what the amended law might look like. Pressed to explain what the White House would like to see Congress give . DHS the ability to do other than have 'more discretion,' Earnest was unable to . come up with an answer. The president neither wants Central American children to bypass medical . care by HHS nor does he want them to be denied due process, he said, effectively ruling out changes to the main steps in the deportation process. At the time, the newly minted White House press secretary's comments were interpreted as either verbal ineptitude or evidence that the White House does not have a strategy to deal with the crisis at the border outside of throwing money at the problem. However, statements by members of Congress on Thursday suggest that the White House was in fact being purposefully opaque about legislative changes it would like to see to to the immigration law because its earlier proposition fell flat with members of the Democratic Party. In a speech on the Senate floor earlier today, Minority Leader McConnell accused the president of requesting a 'blank check' from Congress. 'He led Americans to . believe that the problem could be solved if only Congress would pass his . last-minute request. But it’s not that simple – much more needs to be . done, and the President knows it,' the Republican leader said. 'His original letter to Congress called . for reforms we all know are needed to address this crisis. Under . pressure from the Left, he has since backed away from those critical . reforms, but lawmakers in both parties have not.' In an interview on Fox News this morning, House Homeland Security Chairman McCaul also suggested that Obama changed his tune because he couldn't get his party, which controlled Congress when the trafficking law was passed in 2008, to get behind amending it. 'Well, initially he talked about changing . this 2008 law, which when Mexicans cross they are expeditiously removed. When other than Mexicans cross, like Central America, a different . policy,' McCaul said. 'All we wanna do is make the policy the same with Mexicans and . other than Mexicans.' 'The president was going to propose that idea, and . then for some reason - I think because he got hit by the Left - . retracted that policy and now is throwing it on the Congress to resolve . that problem,' he added. President Obama greets people as he arrives to buy BBQ at Franklin Barbeque in Austin . Obama cut two people in line, but made up for it by paying for their meals . Obama tried to pay for the meals with cash but had to pay with a card after he realized the bill was more than $300 . McCaul and McConnell's suspicions are backed up by comments made by members of the president's party. In an interview with USA Today published Tuesday evening, Democratic Rep. Donna Edwards came out against the president's proposal. 'You know what, it feels very piecemeal to me,' she said. 'I think one reason . we're in this crisis right now is we haven't dealt with immigration in a . comprehensive kind of way.' 'I would worry that if we start picking and . choosing which parts of the law we're going to enforce or repeal, that . we're not going to get to the core of what the problem is,' she continued. House Minority Leader Pelosi told reporters today that if Congress made any changes to the law at all, she would prefer that Mexican children be treated the same as Central American children and be given health screenings and court hearings instead of being automatically sent home rather than Central American children being shut of the court system. 'I would hope they would not make that change,' she said, referring to Central American children being sent home as soon as they reach the border. However, she said 'it's not a deal-breaker.' 'Quite Frankly, I think that Republicans would like to do worse,' she said, so 'let's mitigate with that change for increased resources' for things like due process, and pass a bill to help the children. House Speaker John Boehner was tight-lipped today about his position on Obama's request for additional funding and the absence of language in the request for changes to the 2008 trafficking law. 'Well isn't that convenient,' is all he had to say when a reporter brought up the president's backtrack. Asked by another reporter if he thought the law should be changed, Boehner said, 'I do, and I think the president agrees with it as well.' Boehner said he still needed to talk to his caucus before making a final . decision on whether to approve Obama's request for supplemental funding . but said the one thing he would not do is write the president a blank . check. Neither Bohener's office nor McConnell's offices returned requests for comments on whether the Republican leaders had discussed changes to the trafficking law with the White House in the last week. At a hearing this afternoon on the president's budget request, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson clarified that one of the changes the White House would like to see to immigration legislation is the authority to ask unaccompanied children who originate from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala to voluntarily return home without going through the standard immigration process. Johnson said the White House believes that would significantly speed up the rate of repatriation.","Obama sent a letter to Congress asking them to change a law barring the government from automatically deporting Central American children .

"He may be Mr Nasty on Strictly … but when it comes to his dog, Craig Revel Horwood has a much softer side. The star has spoken of his devastation after learning his pet has a serious heart condition and does not have long left to live. Sophie, a rescued cavalier King Charles spaniel, has just turned 13 – making her 68 in human years. Scroll down for video . Devastated: The Strictly Come Dancing judge, who shares Sophie with his boyfriend Damon Scott, said he is horrified at the thought of planning for their pet’s death . The Strictly Come Dancing judge, who shares Sophie with his boyfriend Damon Scott, said he is horrified at the thought of planning for their pet’s death. Revel Horwood, 49, said: ‘I am so upset. We don’t want her to go anywhere. She acts like a pup. You know it’s imminent, but you have to take one day at a time and enjoy it. ‘The love she gives back is enormous. It is going to be absolutely devastating. Damon is going to be an absolute mess because he is the one who saved her.’ Scott, 35, a 2007 runner-up on Britain’s Got Talent, rescued Sophie five years ago after finding her ‘lying in her own filth’. She has come close to death more than once and has to take eight tablets a day, at a cost of £150 a month. Revel Horwood said: ‘I have never been broody for children. So it comes as a complete surprise to me to find out how much I love her. ‘I never thought I’d miss a pet so much when I’m away. I have been on the road travelling so I have never been able to have a dog. Now I am unbelievably in love with her. We both think of her as our daughter. TV role: Revel Horwood is known for his icy persona and no-nonsense critiques as a Strictly judge . ‘And she has to take so many tablets, you have to look after her like a baby in a way.’ Sophie sleeps on her own full-size bed and was given a pink tutu for her birthday last week. Revel Horwood, known as ‘Mr Nasty’ on Strictly, admitted: ‘Having Sophie has calmed me down a little bit. It might be true that I’m less spiky on Strictly as a result.’ Sophie, who is deaf, has a badly inflamed heart and has no teeth, so her tongue lolls out of her mouth. But her sweet nature has won her many fans. She appeared on Strictly spin-off It Takes Two last week, and has her own YouTube video with 86,817 hits. The couple, who live near Andover, Hampshire, have been told she is unlikely to survive the year. They are on a waiting list to adopt another dog. Revel Horwood said: ‘All these dogs need is a little love and someone with enough money to look after them.’","Strictly Come Dancing judge has been told his pet dog Sophie will die soon .

"Gwyneth Paltrow has won numerous awards for her acting, but speaking apparently came with some difficulty Thursday with President Barack Obama standing beside her. 'You're so handsome that I can't speak properly,' the actress, singer and food writer gushed after introducing Obama to several hundred supporters seated on white fold-out chairs in the lush backyard of her home in the movie star haven of Brentwood, a neighborhood in Los Angeles. In a not-so-subtle reference to her 'conscious uncoupling' earlier this year from husband Chris Martin, Paltrow said it was a 'profound honor' to have Obama in the home she shares with Apple and Moses, her two children with the Coldplay lead vocalist.

Paltrow hosted a reception and dinner benefiting the Democratic Party that marked the start of a three-day, California fundraising swing for Obama. He is scheduled to attend three other Democratic National Committee fundraisers in Los Angeles and San Francisco before returning to Washington on Saturday. Tickets to the reception at Paltrow's home started at $1,000, while dinner tickets cost a minimum of $15,000. Actors Julia Roberts and Bradley Whitford were among those attending. In a brief introduction punctuated by 'ums,' Paltrow declared herself to be one of Obama's biggest fans and said he's an 'incredible role model.' Tickets to the reception at Paltrow's home started at $1,000, while dinner tickets cost a minimum of $15,000. Obama thanked Paltrow and children for 'letting us crash your house' before holding a fundraiser speech . Rambling: Gwyneth Paltrow gave an embarrassingly rambling introduction to President Obama on Thursday at a Democratic fundraiser she held at her home as celebrities like Julia Roberts looked on . Actors Julia Roberts and Bradley Whitford were among the star-studded crowd, who paid upwards of $15,000 or more to see and be seen . Obama heads to the reception bursting with Hollywood stars paying $15,000 for dinner with the President . 'I am one of your biggest fans, if not the biggest, and have been since the inception of your campaign,' she said, adding that she thinks both of his campaigns and his presidency will be one of the most important and most scrutinized of all time. Paltrow noted the approaching Nov. 4 midterm elections in which Democratic control of the Senate is at risk. She called it a 'critical time' for Democrats and seemed to urge everyone to vote. 'It would be wonderful if we were able to give this man all of the power that he needs to pass the things that he needs to pass,' she said. Paltrow mentioned equal rights for women in the workplace, an issue 'very important to me as a working mother,' said the actress, who Forbes says makes around $19 million per year. The GOOP entrepreneur, it appears, did not learn her lesson from the last time she invoked working mothers, saying in 2013: . 'I think it's different when you have an office job, because it's routine and, you know, you can do all the stuff in the morning and then you come home in the evening.' The comments sparked an instant internet backlash culminating in 'A working mom’s open letter to Gwyneth' in the New York Post.

He also thanked Paltrow and her kids for 'letting us crash your house' before launching into, according to a White House pool report, his standard fundraiser speech. However he was sure to mention Paltrow's famously named son and daughter in a bit about Ebola. 'I want to assure everybody that the likelihood of an epidemic here in the United States is extraordinarily small, but there’s a humanitarian crisis that’s happening right now in West Africa where children not much older, and in some cases younger than, Apple and Moses are dying on the streets alone.' As focus of the event, Obama managed to draw much of the pre-show ire on Thursday. The president's presence in Los Angeles wreaked havoc on the city's all-important vehicular traffic. And Paltrow had her Hollywood home targeted with a series of anti-Obama posters ahead of the fundraiser. The actress got full view of the posters as she arrived home on Wednesday. They’ve been plastered to electricity boxes and hung over the road for everyone to see around her upscale neighborhood of Mandeville anyon, Brentwood. Another poster depicts an image of the President that has been ripped down the middle to separate him from the American flag and features Gwyneth's infamous phrase 'conscious uncoupling' on it.","The $19M/year actress thanked Obama for helping push for equal pay for women, an issue 'very important to me as a working mother' she said .

"Alleged terrorist mastermind Tamerlan Tsarnaev was receiving welfare benefits in the lead up to the deadly attacks at the Boston Marathon. The Chechen immigrant lived off state aid while his wife, Katherine Russell Tsarnaev, worked as a home healthcare worker, sometimes clocking as many as 80 hours a week while her unemployed husband stayed at home, Massachusetts welfare officials revealed on Wednesday. Ultimately his wife's income made the couple ineligible for welfare and they stopped receiving state money in 2012. Scroll down for video . Aid: It has been revealed that Katherine Russell, left, her husband Tamerlan Tsarnaev, right, and their young daughter Zahara relied on Massachusetts welfare benefits . Breadwinner: Lawyers for Katherine Russell (pictured in high school yearbook photos) said the 24-year-old mother worked tirelessly as a home healthcare aid to support her young family. Her husband was unemployed . Sources who knew Tamerlan said that though he sported a flashy appearance, he failed to earn very . much money for his family and was essentially a stay-at-home dad. His younger brother, on the other hand, has been described as more entrepreneurial. Dzhokhar, who was a sophomore at . University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, attended the school on a . scholarship and earned petty cash selling marijuana, sources told the . Globe. Investigators are scrutinizing the . brothers' source of income, as they probe whether the pair received . outside assistance for their attack, either from a radical group or . foreign government. Security experts have noted though . that the modus operandi was relatively cheap, estimating that the . materials for each of the pressure cooker bombs used at the Boston . Marathon attack could have cost a total of $100 each. Wife: Katherine Tsarnaeva, pictured leaving her lawyer's office in Providence, R.I. on Tuesday, met Tamerlan in 2009 at a nightclub. They married in June 2010, when she was 21-years-old . Family. Katherine Russell Tsarnaev, center at the home of her parents in North Kingstown, R.I. on Sunday, has a 3-year-old daughter, Zahara, with her late husband . It is not known when Tamerlan and his wife, the mother of the couple's 3-year-old daughter, began receiving the aid. They 'were not receiving transitional assistance benefits . at the time of the [Boston Marathan blasts],' Massachusetts Office of Health and Human Services spokesman Alec . Loftus told the Boston Herald. Both suspects believed to be behind the bombings, Tamerlan and his brother, Dzhokhar, had also received welfare as children. Their parents, Anzor Tsarnaev and . Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, relied on state assistance when they moved to America from the Russian republic of Dagestan. Tamerlan, 26, . died early on . April 19 after a shoot-out with police in Watertown, Mass. His . 19-year-old brother was captured late on April 19 after an extensive . manhunt. State officials have been reluctant . to discuss whether the Tsarnaevs had received state money when they . immigrated to the U.S. in the early 2000s. Ultimately, after pressure from the press the state welfare benefits office divulged the information to the Herald. Marriage: Tamerlan Tsarnaev, in 2009 at Boston's Wai Kru Mixed Martial Arts center, was unemployed. Friends say he and his wife had a tempestuous relationship and said he would call Katherine a 'slut' and 'prostitute' Suspects: State officials will not comment on the taxpayer money that was shelled out in welfare benefits for bombing suspects Tamerlan Tsarnaev, left, and his brother Dzhokhar, right . Officials believe that Tamerlan became heavily influenced by radical Muslim ideology sometime between 2008 and 2009 before he met his future wife. A lawyer for the 24-year-old said she . was a student at Suffolk University in Boston when she was introduced to Tamerlan at a nightclub, believed to be sometime during 2009. Katherine Russell Tsarnaev converted to Islam to marry the terrorist suspect in June 2010, when she was 21-years-old . Around the same time, Russell became pregnant with Tamerlan's baby. She dropped out of school in her senior year and reportedly began pulling away from her friends and family. After their marriage, she lived with Tamerlan, 'raising her child and working long hours, caring for people in their homes who are unable to care for themselves,' her lawyers said in a statement. Her husband reportedly looked after their young child, Zahara. Tragic: Photos from the Boston Marathon show the brothers, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, center left in white hat,  and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, center right in black hat, in the crowd at the race just minutes before the blast . Friends have told the media that the couple had a tempestuous relationship. Three of Russell's friends told National Public Radio's Laura Sullivan that Tsarnaev would often insult Russell and call her names, such as 'slut' and 'prostitute.' He was known to fly into into fits of rage where he would throw objects, including furniture, friends said. Tsarnaev was shot during a dramatic gunbattle with cops in Watertown, Massachusetts on Friday, before police said he was run over by his younger brother Dzhokhar as he tried to escape. ABC News has reported that so far, neither his wife - Katherine Russell - nor other family members have claimed his body for burial.","Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, received welfare up until 2012 .

"Suspect: Police in Pakistan consider Muzaffar Hussain the chief suspect in the double killing . The father of a woman gunned  down with her Scottish businessman husband was last night named as the chief suspect in what is thought to have been an ‘honour killing’. Glasgow-based Saif Rehman, 31, and Uzma Naurin, 30, from New York, were shot dead on a trip to Pakistan, when their car was ambushed in the north-eastern city of Gujrat. Police in the country say Miss Naurin’s taxi driver father, 58-year-old Muzaffar Hussain, is being viewed as a chief suspect in the shootings. Mr Hussain, from New Jersey, was in Pakistan at the time of the killing but has now returned to his U.S. home. In an exclusive interview, he told . the Scottish Daily Mail: ‘I had no idea this might happen; everything . seemed fine. If it turns out this was an honour killing, it would be . horrific.’ The . Mail reported yesterday that a group of four gunmen stopped the car . carrying Mr Rehman and his wife on November 1 before killing them. Newlyweds: Saif Rehman and his wife Uzma had hoped to start in new life . Tragic: The couple were  murdered in Pakistan during an ambush on their taxi . The couple had been about to start a new life together in the U.S. after their trip to Pakistan for Mr Rehman’s brother’s wedding. They were married in Manchester three . years ago but another, fuller ceremony involving both sides of the . family took place in Glasgow in June. The . driver of the car in which Mr Rehman and his wife were travelling was . uninjured in the attack and is said to have been an associate of Mr . Hussain’s. Named only as ‘Adeel’, he was last night in police custody. The couple were accompanied in the car by Mr Rehman’s sister and her two-year-old daughter, who were also unharmed. Celebration: The couple, centre, were killed when a group of four gunmen . stopped the car, opened fire and killed Mr Rehman before bundling his . wife into their vehicle and killing her at a spot nearby - then dumping . her body by the roadside . Detectives in Pakistan are probing claims . that the couple’s marriage had caused upset among some members of Miss . Naurin’s family. Police sources in Gujrat last night said they had been . told she had been married previously to another man in England. Committed: The couple had been in a long-distance relationship, but had made it work . A friend of hers in Scotland last night said the marriage had been ‘approved’ by her family – but her first husband, who has not yet been identified, is said to have killed himself. She was later told to marry the dead man’s brother in another arranged match but refused to do so as he was too young. Last night, Pakistani police spokesman Nasir Butt said the deaths were being treated as an honour killing and Mr Hussain was chief suspect. He said: ‘Muzaffar Hussain came to Pakistan soon after he was informed that Mr Rehman and Uzma had arrived from Scotland to attend the wedding of Mr Rehman’s brother, Qari Shakir. Mr Hussain was also invited to this wedding. ‘Afterwards, he went back to his family home – where he is originally from – near Gujrat. ‘In the meantime, after staying for a day, he called his daughter Uzma and told her that he was not feeling well and was going to hospital. ‘Uzma rushed to the hospital along with her husband and started taking care of her father, who complained of severe chest pain.’ While in hospital, Mr Hussain is said to have asked his driver – ‘Adeel’ – to take her daughter and son-in-law to Gujrat for a shopping trip. At around 5.30pm, Adeel received a call on his mobile phone, he stopped the car and got out – then moments later the gunmen pounced. Police investigating the killings later found Mr Hussain was no longer in hospital. Officers say he drove to the port city of Karachi in a rental car and boarded a flight for the U.S. Mr Hussain, who lives in a £250,000 house in Jersey City, New Jersey, with his wife Munir Begun, 55, insisted he did not know who had killed their daughter and her husband. He said: ‘I can’t get over it. I had no idea this might happen. Everything seemed fine. She was looking to start a family with Saif and have children together. Now they’re gone. All we can do is pray.’ In Gujrat, Mohammad Zakir, Mr Rehman’s father, said: ‘My son was a respectable person. He lived in Glasgow for over six years with grace and honour. We are waiting for the final result of the police investigation.’ A friend of Miss Naurin’s, who asked not to be named, said:  ‘In September, the visa application for Saif came through and he was going to join her and live in New York. ‘They were basically looking forward to starting their new life together. For it to end like this is just awful.’ Gunned down: The couple were shot dead in Gujrat, in Punjab Province, Pakistan .","Taxi driver flew to U.S. after couple were shot dead .

"A 66-year-old Brazilian man has spent 35 years preaching the word of God - because he believes he is the reincarnation of Jesus. Inri Cristo has ‘hundreds of followers’ from around the world, including the UK, Britain and France, some of whom live with him at his ‘church’ compound outside Brasilia. Since 1979 he has travelled for 27 countries to spread his word, however his controversial views has seen him expelled from the US, Britain and Venezuela. Scroll down for video . I am Jesus: Inri Cristo speaks to his disciples from one of his mobile pulpits at his church compound outside the capital of Brasilia . They see me rollin', they hatin': When not giving sermons and tending to his flock at his Soust church, Inri Cristo likes to get around the grounds of his compound aboard his motor scooter . Son of god: Inri - which is a Latin acronym  that in English means 'Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews', believes that the location of his 'church' is the 'New Jerusalem' Most of the disciples who live at his church – mostly women - have followed Inri for decades, the eldest, Abevere, 86, has been following him for 32 years. His youngest disciple is now 24 years old and first met Inri when she was just a two years old. As ‘Jesus reborn’ he has even taken the name of Inri, which derives from the latin acronym said to have been written on the cross during Jesus' crucifixion, and stands for Iesus Nazarenus, Rex Iudaeorum, or in English: Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews' and Cristo, meaning Christ. His Jesus-like dressing and unorthodox views on capitalism, abortion and even Christmas has seen him detained by police more than 40 times. Faithful followers: A group of Inri Cristo's devoted disciples who live at the Soust compound gather to greet 'Jesus' in Brasilia, Brazil. Most of the disciples who live there have known Inri for over 20 years; the oldest now 86, and the youngest 24 . Leader's greetings: Despite being the home of Jesus, and home of a religious organisation, Inri Christo still has a kennel of dogs to protect them . Uniform uniform: Inri Christo's female disciples wear simple blue gowns with the compound's logo on, tied with a rope, and knitted hats . He said: ‘I know that there are countless people scattered throughout Brazil and the world whose hearts beat together with mine.’ But despite seeing himself as Jesus reborn, Inri refuses to celebrate Christmas saying it is just a day where 'the rich humiliate the poor'. ‘It is a day when the little sons of the rich can show the gifts they received while the poor children only get a crumb,’ he said. ‘So it is a very sad day for anyone who sees things with the eyes that I see.’ Inri says he first experienced the 'revelation' that he was Christ during a religious fast in Santiago, Chile, in 1979. Since childhood he had been following a powerful voice that 'speaks in his head' but it was only on this occasion that it told him: ‘I am your Father. The God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob.’ His holy word: Cristo speaks to his followers every Saturday morning from his pulpit at the 'New Jerusalem' compound . Long career: Inri Cristo, who has been preaching as 'Jesus' since 1979, surrounded by followers circa 1982 at Belem cathedral in Lisbon, Portugal . On display: Artifacts from the life of Inri Cristo are kept in glass cabinets at his chapel at the Soust compound near Brasilia . He's alive! Inri Cristo in a photo of himself wearing his own version of the Shroud of Turin, circa 1993, set to prove that he is the resurrection of Jesus Christ himself . Uncomfortable truths? Inri Christo's controversial views on everything from Christmas to capitalism has seen him arrested 40 times, and expelled from several countries . He now runs his own church, the 'Soust' (Suprema Ordem Universal da Santmssima Trindade), located on a lush farmland outside of Brasilia, the capital of Brazil, which he calls the 'New Jerusalem'. He and his followers survive on homegrown fruit like bananas, avocados and mangos as well as a vegetable garden. There's also a chapel where Ingra speaks to his followers every Saturday morning and a kennel for the dogs that guard the complex. His quirky life has led to critics saying he is mentally ill - an accusation he firmly denies. ‘I can be crazy but not dumb,’ he said. ‘Madness is different from dementia. It is the mother of philosophers, prophets and inventors. ‘My mission is to prepare the elect, the survivors of the inevitable nuclear hecatomb that will culminate in the end of this chaotic world, for the formation of the new earthly society, which will strive to fulfill the Creator's will.’ Preacher and leader: Inri Christo's loyal followers push his pulpit out into the garden in order to listen to his words as 'Jesus' Biker Jesus: Inri Christo takes his scooter for a spin around his vast compound where he lives with his followers, preaching 'the word of Jesus'","Inri Cristo, 66, from Brasilia, Brazil, believes he is a reincarnation of the son of God .

"As George Groves goes before another tribunal, this time at the British Boxing Board of Control, we have to wonder what kind of advice he is receiving. Or if he is listening. Even when he gets the verdict, the young man who believes he was robbed by Carl Froch still doesn't win. Not financially. Which tends to be what happens when you file a case in which even a victorious outcome cannot deliver the judgement you really want. Saint George went all the way to New Jersey to ask the IBF to enforce a return fight in the wake of that controversial stoppage by Froch in their world super-middleweight title clash. Up for the battle: George Groves is petitioning the BBBC to declare his fight with Carl Froch a No Contest . After they bent to his demand, Groves was reminded that as the mandatory challenger he would be entitled to only 15 per cent of the purse.  This after he had turned down a seven figure offer from the Froch camp. Sorry, said the IBF when he went back to them pleading for something more equitable, they had done all they could. Now Groves is petitioning the British Board to declare his fight with Froch a No Contest. Since the Board rarely, if ever, come to such a decision – and stood four-square behind their senior referee Howard Foster at the time - it is unlikely that the solitary blemish on Groves' record will be expunged at this Wednesday's meeting. But even if the Board were to take such action it would not improve his monetary bargaining position. Froch would remain the IBF world champion, as well as holder of the WBA 'regular' title, and still be entitled to 85 per cent of the booty. Groves might have been better served concentrating on his campaign to encourage the court of public opinion to embarrass Froch into giving him a second shot. His share of a voluntary match would have been greater. Now it could be economically shrewder for him, not Froch, to be the one who pulls out – for the moment. That would release Froch to defend his titles against Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr – namesake son of the Mexican legend - who enjoys huge Hispanic support in America. Chavez is preparing for a re-match of . his own – against Brian Vera - on March 1. If a Chavez victory would be . likely to put the seal on a Froch deal, the Nottingham Cobra might well . be at ringside in San Antonio's Alamodome that night. If . Froch were to lose in Las Vegas in mid-summer, the domestic rematch . would still be massive box office at an English football ground later . this year or early in 2015 – with Groves able to negotiate a purse much . closer to parity. In . the meantime, he can find other ways of cashing in on a reputation much . enhanced by his performance against Froch. Better that, maybe, than . shooting himself in the wallet. Calling the shots: Referee Howard Foster controversially stopped the title bout in the ninth round . Picture that: Tyson Fury mocked David Haye . Tyson Fury kept one critical eye on David Haye even as he finished sparring prior to his fight this Saturday night at the Copper Box in London's Olympic Park. A cut eye. Fury sustained damage to his left eyebrow while flexing his fists against American stable-mate Eddie Chambers – and could not resist a jibe at Haye for cancelling their Battle of Britain by publishing a photograph of a gash of his own on the same spot. Fury posted a picture of his wound on Twitter and wrote: 'Look. Should I do a Hayemaker and pull out. P***y. I'm still fighting.' That was Haye's second withdrawal from facing Fury – having cited a ruptured shoulder first time – but the 6ft 9in Manchester traveller seriously doubts he was injured on either occasion. With Haye now in semi-retirement, Fury and Dereck Chisora are vying to be become our next Brit home-boy to challenge multi-world heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko. Chisora tops Saturday's bill, with Fury as the main support. If both big men win they are scheduled to meet at West Ham's football ground in what could be a final eliminator for Klitschko's WBO title. Fury takes on US slugger Joey Abell – who either knocks out his opponents or gets flattened himself. Next challenge: Dereck Chisora will face American Kevin Johnson on Saturday . Chisora, who took Wladimir's brother Vitali the full 12 rounds in his one world title fight thus far, appears to have a slightly more complicated task against another American. Kevin Johnson is an experienced world title-challenging veteran who once lasted the distance against Wladimir. But both should win to set up their midsummer showdown. Chisora v Johnson, Fury v Abell will be live on BoxNation on Saturday night via Sky Ch. 437 or Virgin Ch. 546. Now that Floyd Mayweather has had his fun with that Twitter poll, an amusing charade in which he invited the fans to choose his next opponent, we can expect the long-awaited confirmation that the world's No 1 boxer will fight Britain's Amir Khan in Las Vegas on May 3. For what it was worth, Mayweather's spot of mischief ended with Khan way ahead of Marcos Maidana, the Argentinian hit-man who recently upset Adrien Broner but who has been beaten by Bolton's former Olympic silver medallist. Khan captured almost 60 per cent of the 35,000 votes cast. The poll served as useful propaganda to . help sell the fight on pay-per-view in America, although Mayweather-Khan . has been in the pipeline since October. Diplomat: Amir Khan (right) captured 60 per cent of the vote as to who should fight Floyd Mayweather Jnr next . It is being rumoured that Joe Bugner is about to announce a comeback in his Australian homeland – at 63 and 15 years after his last fight. Bugner took Muhammad Ali the distance twice but upset his British fans when given a narrow decision over the much-loved Henry Cooper. He hung up the gloves in 1999 after defeating Levi Billups. This smacks of a publicity stunt, or an early April Fool's joke. If not, at two years shy of pensionable age, say it ain't so, Joe.

"Prince William today suggested the growing threat of Scottish independence was more important than the news his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, was expecting again. The Duke said Catherine, who is suffering acute morning sickness, was ‘feeling okay’ after a ‘tricky few days’. But he added: ‘It’s important that we all focus on the big news and the big international and domestic things that are going on at the moment. That’s what my thoughts are at the moment.’ The remarks could be seen as a direct Royal intervention into the looming independence referendum just days after sources said the Queen was ‘concerned’ at the surge in support for separation. Prince William, opening The Dickson Poon University of Oxford China Centre Building, this morning urged voters to focus on 'domestic' news rather than the news that he and his wife were expecting again . The Duke said his wife was feeling 'okay' but had been through a 'tricky few days'. But he urged people to concentrate on other developments . Amid growing panic that the ‘Yes’ to independence campaign had taken the lead just over a week before the referendum, the Queen held talks with the David Cameron in Balmoral this weekend. The future of the Royal family has been a source of debate in the independence campaign, but the 'Yes' camp have insisted that the Queen will remain head of state in a future independent Scotland. But a poll in The Times found more ‘yes’ voters now want to ditch the Queen as head of state of an independent Scotland than want to keep her in place, according to a new poll. The YouGov poll found that 46 per cent of supporters of separation now believe that an independent Scotland should break its links with the UK royal family. A total of 40 per cent believe an independent Scotland should keep the Queen, with 14 per cent undecided. Among ‘no’ voters, the results are very different. More than two thirds of ‘no’ voters – 69 per cent – believe that an independent Scotland should keep the Queen, with just 18 per cent in favour of a Scottish republic and 13 per cent undecided. The future of the Royal family in an independent Scotland has been thrown into doubt in recent days amid claims that the Queen is concerned about future conflicts of interest. Pollsters today claimed that the Royal baby announcement could help tip support back in favour of the union. A spokesman for ComRes told MailOnline: ‘The Queen is generally very popular in the UK and so are the young royals like the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, probably more so than Prince Charles for example. ‘The royal family has not really played a part in the referendum debate until now but the Queen’s reported concerns and now Kate’s pregnancy will bring that into focus. ‘There are a number of reasons why the poll could swing back to no. It won’t be just because of the baby, but that and other issues about the royal family could influence the result’. Scroll down for video . The Queen, pictured at the Braemar Gathering in Scotland, is thought to be strongly in favour of the Union and will be in Scotland on September 18 – the day it could vote to break away from the rest of the UK . David Cameron, pictured with his wife Samantha and Prince Philip, held talks with the Queen amid panic at the prospect of the end of the 300-year-old Union . The Queen held talks with Mr Cameron yesterday amid panic at the prospect of the end of the 300-year-old Union. There was said to be ‘great concern’ at Buckingham Palace over the prospect of separation. The Queen, who is thought to strongly favour the Union, will be in Scotland on September 18 – the day it could vote to break away from the rest of the UK. Pro-Union MPs said her presence at Balmoral would be a sign of continuity. ‘There is a strong anti-monarchy element in the Scottish National Party,’ said former defence secretary Liam Fox. ‘You can bet your bottom dollar as soon as they get independence, their next target is going to be Scotland being a republic.’ Former defence secretary Liam Fox says there is a 'strong anti-monarchy element in the Scottish National Party' A YouGov poll yesterday put support for independence at 51 per cent, with the No camp on 49 per cent. The Better Together campaign has surrendered a 22-point lead in the space of a month. The shock survey came as: . SNP leader Alex Salmond, pictured with the Queen, who says says he plans to keep her as head of state, but the SNP’s John Mason is calling for a referendum to replace the monarch after the Queen steps down or dies . Yesterday Peter Kellner, YouGov’s president, said: ‘In the past four weeks, support for the Union has drained away at an astonishing rate. The Yes campaign has not just invaded No territory – it has launched a blitzkrieg.’ However, a separate poll for the Yes Scotland campaign by pollsters Panelbase put the pro-Union camp still four points ahead – by 52 per cent to 48 per cent. The three main Westminster parties have previously promised further devolution in the event of a No vote, telling Scottish voters they can remain in the UK and ‘have the best of both worlds’. But this week’s promise of a fixed timetable, an attempt to shift away from the widely-criticised negative messages of the No campaign, echoes a similar package offered to the Canadian province of Quebec before an independence referendum in 1995, that snuffed out a late surge in support for breaking away. Mr Osborne also insisted that if Scotland were to opt for independence then under no circumstances would it be able to use the pound as its currency, as Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond says he plan to do. Gordon Brown, and his wife Sarah were campaigning on the streets of his hometown of Kirkcaldy in Fife, in a bid to shore up the no vote . However, there were growing signs of strains in the cross-party coalition campaigning for Scotland to remain in the UK. Labour former prime minister Mr Brown blamed the Tories for the narrowing polls, claiming the No camp was finding it difficult because of anger over Government policies including the so-called ‘bedroom tax’ and the cut in the 50p top rate of tax. Dr Fox became the most senior Westminster figure to express concerns about Better Together, saying: ‘One of the problems has been that the No campaign has been trying to run a campaign based on logic and reason, while the nationalist campaign is entirely about emotion and sentiment.’ Mr Salmond dismissed the offer of a commission to hammer out new powers for Holyrood as a ‘panicky last-minute measure’. He says he plans to keep the Queen as head of state, but the SNP’s John Mason is calling for a referendum to replace the monarch after the Queen steps down or dies. Chancellor George Osborne, pictured, has announced an 11th hour guarantee to devolve further powers to Scotland over tax, spending, welfare and a host of other areas . Mr Cameron, at Balmoral yesterday with the Queen, was expected to reassure her that in the closing days of the campaign he intends to make the ‘emotional argument’ about all that England and Scotland have achieved together and what ‘we can continue to achieve’. Sources have confirmed that the monarch will continue with her annual holiday at her private estate in the Highlands, on September 18. The Palace insisted that the Queen was politically neutral, but one well-placed source said: ‘You don’t have to be a genius to work out the Queen is a Unionist. Is the Pope a Catholic?’ A senior royal source was quoted as saying: ‘The Queen is a Unionist. Lots of people were telling us that it was going to be OK but there is now a great deal of concern.’ A Palace spokesman said: ‘The referendum is a matter for the people of Scotland: the Queen remains strictly neutral on this, as she does on all political issues. The Queen has maintained a close interest in the referendum as she does with all major matters of public debate and is being kept informed by her ministers and officials in the usual way.’","The Duke  said focus should be on 'big international and domestic' news .

"'Viewed with red-green glasses, the active dust devils seem to float above the surface,' says the University of Arizona's Alfred McEwen . The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured three dust devils thundering across the surface of the planet - and if you happen to have a pair of red-green 3D glasses handy, you can even see them in 3D. 'Viewed with red-green glasses, the active dust devils seem to float above the surface,' says the University of Arizona's Alfred McEwen, . 'There are also some bright lines present in only the later image - those are the tracks of dust devils that passed through this region in the prior two weeks.' Despite the atmosphere on Mars being . desperately thin – one per cent of Earth’s pressure – the planet's winds . are strong enough to produce dramatic dust devils. The dust devils whirl at huge speeds and can be bigger than any tornadoes on Earth. The trio captured this week were tiddlers compared to some of the 'devils' seen this year - on March 14, . the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter snapped a 12-mile-high monster. The . 'devil' left a streak across the planet's surface - it's just 70 yards . wide, but higher than Earth tornadoes, a column of dust whirling so fast . it would sandblast anything in it. 'Because . the density of Mars' atmosphere is so low, even a high velocity dust . devil is unlikely to knock you over,' says the University of Arizona . team which posted the video. 'However, . you might be blasted by any sand or dust particles carried along by the . dust devil, which might scratch the visor of your space suit quickly if . you were caught outside by this monster.' The HiRISE camera on board Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured a 12-mile-high dust devil this month . Despite the atmosphere on Mars being desperately thin ¿ one per cent of Earth¿s pressure ¿ the planet's winds are strong enough to produce dramatic dust devils, say Arizona researchers . The dust devil is the same size as a tornado on earth, but is a plume of dust whirling at a speed that would sandblast a spacesuit's visor . The length of the shadow indicates that the dust plume reached a height of 12 miles above the surface. Dozens . of smaller dust devils were captured by the Mars Reconnaissance . orbiter's cameras, 'vacuuming' the surface around the monster 'devil'. Despite . its gargantuan height, the plume is only 70 yards in diameter, giving . it a snake-like appearance that is twisted by high altitude winds, . similar to another dust devil spotted recently in this region. The dust devil is actually only 70 yards wide despite its huge height . Just . as on Earth, winds on Mars are powered by solar heating. Exposure to . the sun's rays declines during this season, yet even now, dust devils . act relentlessly to clean the surface of freshly deposited dust, a . little at a time. Dust . devils occur on Earth as well as on Mars. They are spinning columns of . air, made visible by the dust they pull off the ground. Unlike a . tornado, a dust devil typically forms on a clear day when the ground is . heated by the sun, warming the air just above the ground. As . heated air near the surface rises quickly through a small pocket of . cooler air above it, the air may begin to rotate, if conditions are just . right. The Mars . Reconnaissance Orbiter has been examining Mars with six science . instruments since 2006 and has has returned more data about Mars than . all other orbital and surface missions combined. One of its cameras is so powerful they can reveal objects on Mars as small as an office desk. It has taken over 20,000 photographs of the Red Planet so far. The . Orbiter makes a complete circuit of Mars every 112 minutes, flying a . nearly circular orbit that ranges in height from about 255 kilometres . (160 miles) over the South Pole to 320 kilometres (200 miles) over the . North Pole.

The photograph reveals how the siblings were standing just yards from terror suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Following the bomb attack others are filmed standing around stunned but Patterson leaps into action. Just before the explosion he had been enjoying a meal with his girlfriend in a nearby restaurant. 'This child for some reason just jumped at me - it was tunnel vision,' he said. 'I could see the damage. I could see that she needed a tourniquet. She needed surgery, it was obvious from what I saw.' 'I go up to a business guy and ask for his belt, he hands it over without hesitation. I have to stop the bleeding. I am making the tourniquet and another man comes and I ask him to hold it for pressure. I'm looking up and down the street - looking for where I can bring the child to an ambulance or more care.' Patterson and the other man ran with Jane to a waiting ambulance. She has lost a leg and remains in a critical condition in hospital but is expected to survive her injuries. Yesterday it emerged she is an enthusiastic Irish dancer having attended classes at the . Clifden Academy of Irish Dance in Milton since the age of three. Several Irish dance groups are now raising money to support her. 'She is just a beautiful little girl. We taught her since she was a baby, pointing her little toe,' Eileen .

"Clutching a bottle of drink, grinning broadly and struggling to carry an armful of shoes, this woman was today one of many new riot suspects being hunted by police. In another image a man in Hackney stands in the road holding a house brick, not bothered by the fact his other arm is in a plaster cast and sling. The images are just two of more than 80 police released today in a bid to hunt down every last suspected rioter and looter who took to the streets earlier in the week. Despite initial fears that associates of the suspects would not want to 'snitch', the public have been 'inundating' the police with information about the swathes of yobs who ransacked England's streets, shops and homes. An armful of shoes, a bottle of drink and a house brick: What just two suspects clutched as they were caught on camera as riots broke out across the country . Another picture shows a man with tattoos decorating his right arm, grasping what appears to be a jagged glass bottle. All have been published by the Metropolitan Police, who are appealing to the public for help identifying people wanted in connection with the violent crimes that destroyed parts of the capital. So far they have made a . staggering 1,271 arrests and charged 745 people in connection with the . widespread looting and violence. As part of Operation Withern which is dealing specifically with the unrest they have set up a website, publishing 88 new images of those wanted in connection with the crimes that have shocked the country and the rest of the world. Police in Manchester have been 'inundated' with tip-offs from the public in response to their 'Shop A Looter' campaign, the force say. Greater Manchester Police said today that there had been 208 arrests so far in connection with the rioting and 134 people had been charged. Hoods, tattoos and big hair: Another half dozen suspects police want to identify . Pictures of suspected rioters are being . displayed on huge advertising vans being driven around Manchester and . neighbouring Salford, where hundreds took part in disorder earlier this . week. And while this resort is helping to identify suspects it is also prompting those involved to turn themselves in. A youth handed himself in after his friend saw his picture on the ad vans and called him to say his image was all over Manchester and he had no place to hide, a GM police spokesman said. And in Birmingham a mother frogmarched her 15-year-old daughter to the police station after she saw CCTV images of her released by police. Pursuit: These four people have had their photos published by Metropolitan Police following this week's riots . Also among the new arrests was a 14-year-old boy who was detained by Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan, who also recovered stolen trainers with the tags still on. The boy, who cannot be named, remains in custody on suspicion of burglary following a theft at the Foot Locker store in Manchester city centre. Mr Shewan said: 'We said we would be coming for you, and we are. 'Within minutes of the ad van being launched in Manchester with the faces of some of those people involved, we have been inundated with information from members of the public about who these people are. The faces of frenzy: These are just some of the people police want to identify in connection with the riots . 'These are just some of the good . arrests we have made. I have been told of countless more by officers who . are using every piece of information and every available avenue to find . these people and bring them in. 'With . the help of our communities we are identifying these people and . arresting them. This is just the start - we will not rest until we have . identified everyone involved.' West Midlands Police said they have arrested 509 people in connection with the disturbances, including 42 in the last 24 hours. A spokesman for the force said . officers on a raid found £30,000 in cash and arrested a 20-year-old . woman believed to have been involved in looting at Birmingham's Armani . store. He added that one . woman from Handsworth had escorted her 15-year-old daughter to a police . station having recognised her image in a CCTV media appeal. To deal with the stream of those charged, courts have been throughout the weekend. Magistrates, . clerks, ushers, lawyers and security guards have been working . consecutively for the last four nights to hear riot-related cases. An 18-year-old who broke into a London jeweller's shop during last week's riots handed himself in to police . after his picture was published in the media. Aaron Douglas went to Kennington . police station in south London accompanied by his sister to surrender . after being persuaded by his family, City of Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. Today, he admitted breaking into . Crystal Palace Jewellers in Church Road, Upper Norwood, south east . London, and stealing goods worth £6,100 in the early hours of August 9. The attack on the store came in the form of two raids - the first by 10 males who were later joined by a gang of 20 yobs. Catherine Wear, prosecuting, said . Douglas, of Gibbs Square, Norwood Park, was caught on CCTV lifting up a . security shutter to help other raiders in and out. He will be sentenced at Inner London Crown Court on an unspecified date after the hearing was adjourned for reports. The hunted: Can you identify any of the people in these pictures? If so, contact police . Meanwhile there is growing friction between politicians and police as Chancellor George Osborne signalled the Government's determination to press ahead with cuts to police budgets. He said that dealing with the violent disorder meant tackling 'deep-seated social problems', not scaling back austerity measures. 'We are committed to the plan we have set out for police reform,' he told the BBC - insisting that a 20 per cent real-terms budget cut need not reduce 'visible' policing. 'But this is not just about police budgets; this is about a far bigger challenge for our society, which is dealing with people who we have ignored for too long and helping them feel they have a stake in society.' He strongly backed the decision by Prime Minister David Cameron to bring in US 'Supercop' William Bratton as an adviser on how to prevent a repeat of the riots. The recruitment of the former New York police chief, who also dealt with riots in Los Angeles in 1992, has increased tension between politicians and the police.","Friends and families reporting suspects including a Birmingham mother who escorted her 15-year-old daughter to police after recognising her in a CCTV appeal .

"Criminal connections: Michael Jones, 17, is accused of being an accessory to first degree murder in the Lane murder case but police knew him because his name kept coming up in other investigations . One of the three 'bored' teenagers held over the murder of Chris Lane in a drive-by shooting was linked to a string of armed robberies allegedly committed with his pregnant girlfriend, MailOnline can reveal today. Michael Jones, 17, who was driving the car and brought in by cops repeatedly after a spate of raids, one of the investigating detectives said today. MailOnline can also reveal that James Edwards, 15, who Jones allegedly said pulled the trigger, was known to have a 'very short' temper and is 'incredibly violent'. Detective John Byers told MailOnline that investigators recognized Jones' Ford Focus from surveillance footage and that triggered their search for the killers of the Australian baseball player. While investigating three different armed robberies in March of this year, Byers said that the police 'kept seeing his vehicle, we got to know his vehicle'. '(It was) the Ford Focus used in the drive-by shooting. The vehicle was known to us. That was one thing that helped identifying the vehicle used in the killing of Mr Lane,' he told MailOnline. 'I’ve not known him to be claiming any gang...I’ve been watching Michael Jones, in reference to some other crimes previously, in some armed robberies and with another gentlemen who’s been doing some second-degree burglaries.’ There were three armed robberies in Duncan within days of each other this past March, and that is when Jones’ face and car became familiar to investigators. ‘Whenever we executed a search warrant on a house where the armed robbers lived, he showed up when we were at the front door. They contacted him, because he showed up at a parking lot that was real close to the house, with his girlfriend— and she’s pregnant with his child,’ Detective Byers said. Connections: Jones (seen right next to an unknown young woman) and his pregnant girlfriend showed up at three searches relating to earlier armed robberies in the town and police began recognizing his car . ‘As we were compiling everything on the armed robberies and arresting those responsible, his name kept coming up. We pulled him in two maybe three times, interviewed him and his girlfriend too.’ The girlfriend has not been identified but she was in court briefly on Tuesday before the hearing for Jones, Edwards and Luna. She was sitting near Jones’ relatives and allegedly broke down in tears. She became so emotional that she left the room before Jones even entered. Police knew Jones had ties to the individuals involved in the armed robberies, and apparently so did Chancey Luna. One neighbor whose son was allegedly the group’s next target claims that Jones, Luna and James Edwards perpetrated the seemingly random killing as part of a gang initiation - possibly the Crips since the infamous group has a growing presence in the town - but police say it is slightly less formal. ‘The close association with all of these people, the armed robberies, and the ones that committed the murder, are all associated, they are known to be contacted by law enforcement,’ Detective Byers said. Suspects: Jones said that he was driving when either Chancey Luna (left) or James Edwards (right) pulled the trigger killing Chris Luna . Heartbroken: Sarah Harper (left) has spoken out about her devastation following her boyfriend Chris Lane's (right) murder during a drive by shooting on Friday when he was jogging near her house . ‘I cannot say this is a gang, no. They knew each other, they hung out. They committed crime. Yes, by classification, to be called a gang, they have to have some kind of initiation and call themselves a certain name, but at this point I can’t say they are a gang. ‘The armed robbers are in jail, all three are in jail, I haven’t known them to be in gangs, they had their own group. These are closely associated, intertwined, between the armed robbery and the murder - known associates, with known contacts with law enforcement. Luna would be with this person at a traffic stop, and they were known to hang out together.’ Their full criminal histories have not been made public as they were treated as minors before the brutal killing. It also emerged today from court documents that security footage shows that after the shooting, the Ford Focus was parked behind a hotel for a little over ten minutes, and Edwards told investigators that the boys were smoking marijuana while they hid the murder weapon in the car's interior. Illegal: Edwards told officers that the group smoked marijuana behind a hotel after the shooting . The police report reveals that 17-year-old Jones admitted he was driving the car. ‘He stated to Lt Shoemake that Chancey Luna and James Edwards were in the car and that one of them had fired the gun and that he was not telling which had fired the gun but it was not him but it was either James Edwards or Chancey Luna,’ the report reads. An hour after their initial interview, Jones said that he wanted to speak to investigators again and he inquired whether his father or a lawyer had gotten in touch. When the police officer said that he could not tell him that information, the teen said that ‘he could not tell Lt Shoemake who had shot the male because if he did he would get killed’. The officer tried getting more information from Jones about the location of the gun - saying that he didn’t want it to get into the hands of a child - and Jones said that police would never find it because he gave it to someone else. ‘It is a .22 revolver and that is why you did not find any brass,’ Jones said. He would not reveal that person’s identity but said that individual had siblings in jail, which led police to believe that it was Odessa Barnes, a person whose name had come up during the armed robberies. Questionable ties: Detectives said that while there are pictures of Edwards (left) and Luna (right) throwing gang signs, they are not believed to be associated with any particular group, more like 'wannabes' Jones said that while they were smoking marijuana, he took out the cold air induction in his car and hid the gun there, presumably for the other individual to take it. While Jones did not seem to change his story dramatically during his police interviews, the new report shows that Edwards did tell two different versions of events - first saying that he wasn’t in the car at the time of the shooting and then saying that he knew who fired the shot but only because he was told who did and not because he saw. Tough image: Police also said that Edwards (pictured), who posted videos of him tossing around guns and looking threatening, was a big fan of a rapper who promotes violence . That change of heart came after he met with his father in between two police interviews. It was also not his only unusual behavior inside the police department, as officers saw him dance while he was being checked into the facility. When Edwards was standing behind a desk, he ‘began to dance, he did some kind of dance motion,’ Detective Byers told MailOnline. Mwanwhile, a 25-year-old woman named Christina, who would not give her . last name for fear of retribution, said that she has known Edwards through her . cousin and he was 'always around' growing up. She said that he could be violent and would get in 'a lot of . fights'. 'A lot of it gang related. He would fight over nothing,' Christina said. 'Gangs are always an iffy thing around here, and when you . don’t exactly have family to look up to - then for someone like that the gang can . be the only family he has.' Edwards' father has been raising his son while his mother is . in jail for an unspecified crime. Christina told of a recent incident where she ran into . Edwards near an apartment complex and either Edwards or one of his friends was . waving a gun around. 'I told him to put it away, there are three or four children . around and that is not acceptable at all and he put it in his pants and walked . away,' she told MailOnline. Besides fighting, Christina said that she knew he 'has sold . marijuana in the past'. When asked if she was suprised by his alleged involvement in . Lane's murder, she said: 'Not so much that, but I didn’t think he was possible . of taking it that far.' Different instance: A friend told MailOnline how she recently saw Edwards put a gun in his pants after she scolded he and his friends for waving it around when there were children nearby (Edwards seen here in a picture from his Facebook account) Edwards, 15, and Luna, 16 face first degree murder charges and will be tried as an adult but if found guilty, they still may not receive the death penalty even though it is allowed in Oklahoma. Jones faces a lesser charge of accessory to first-degree murder and using a vehicle in the discharge of a weapon. Duncan Police Chief Danny Ford said that rather than being part of any gang, which had been suggested before, authorities believe the boys were just wannabes who were emulating the thuggish beliefs of their idols, with Chief Keef the most popular among them. Today, Ford said: 'These boys were more into some rapper that goes around, his music is violent. More than gang stuff. One of the parents said something about rap. 'These boys have no respect for life or authority or society, it doesn't matter who it is. By one of their own words, they saw him go by, and they said, ""there's the target"" and they followed him and shot him. He could have been anybody walking down the street.'","Michael Jones, 17, is accused of being an accessory to first degree murder and driving the car that his friends James Edwards and Chancey Luna were in when one of them allegedly shot Chris Lane .

"A mystery woman who looked like the elderly widow who recently won the record $590million Powerball jackpot has surprised 180 people by picking up their restaurant tab. The woman, who appeared to be 84-year-old Gloria C. MacKenzie according to witnesses, paid almost $2,600 for the customers' dinners at Buddy Freddy's in Plant City, Florida on Sunday. Restaurant manager Stephanie Reaves told the Tampa Bay Times that the woman, who was with another woman and younger man, ate at the restaurant and then left before returning to pay the bill. She even left $50 each for each of the five servers, and Reaves said everyone in the restaurant got up and applauded. Generous: A woman fitting the description of Gloria MacKenzie, pictured center with her son, has picked up the tab for 180 diners enjoying dinner at a Plant City restaurant . The donor denied she was the lottery winner but Reaves said she 'fit the description'. 'It sure looked like her,' she said. 'She looked like the woman on TV.' MacKenzie is from Zephyrhills, which is about 15 miles north of Plant City. She  stepped forward last week to claim the largest single jackpot in American lottery history. If the dinner donor was indeed MacKenzie, it . appears the lottery winner is using her wealth generously after . herself struggling financially for decades. Scene: The customers stood up and applauded after the woman paid their bill at the restaurant, pictured . Since her win, it has emerged that . MacKenzie, who lived in a one-bedroom duplex with a tin roof,  had not . even been able to afford a hearing aid, according to the National . Enquirer. Friends said she was almost deaf and would simply wave at neighbors as they passed because she had been unable to hear them. 'She was too proud to beg for help . from anyone,' a source told the Enquirer. 'It's wonderful that she'll . now be able to hear properly again and never have to worry about where . her next dollar is coming from.' Each month, she scraped together $400 for rent and was recently reeling from the theft of her air conditioner unit. She stayed inside crocheting and watching television, friends said. Helping hand: Mrs MacKenzie denied she was the lottery winner but witnesses said she looked like her . Old life: The door on the left is Mrs Mackenzie's home. Before her lottery win, she lived in this squat, modest duplex with a tin roof in . Zephyhills, Florida . She claimed the prize two weeks after buying the winning ticket at a Publix supermarket in Zephyhills. She told lottery officials she received the lucky numbers -  10, . 13, 14, 22 and 52, with a Powerball of 11 - after buying a randomized . 'quick pick' ticket when someone allowed her to cut in line. Mrs Mackenzie, whose husband . Ralph died in 2005 at age 79, will split the winnings with her son Scott, 54, of Jacksonville, Florida. She . told lottery officials that before she won, she and her son made an . agreement to share any winnings, and she had been with him when she purchased the ticket. Buzz: News of the winning ticket being sold at a Publix supermarket in Zephyhills, Florida, brought international attention to the small city . Mrs Mackenzie has two sons and two daughters and at least four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Most of her family remains in her home state of Maine.

"Mike Tyson has a newfound respect for the IRS after revealing that they forgave some of his owed back taxes. The former boxing champ has famously struggled with his finances for years and declared bankruptcy in 2005, stating that he was $23million in debt. He has been working his way back to even with the IRS after failing to pay taxes for years. Putting the past behind them: Evander Holyfield (left) and Mike Tyson (right), seen together on Saturday, both told about how they struggled with the financial windfall of their success . That moment: Tyson infamously bit off a portion of Holyfield's ear during a 1997 fight (pictured) but only had kind words for his former competitor when they went to promote a documentary about themselves . At a Tribeca Film Festival talk over the weekend, he alluded to the fact that the debts were not necessarily paid off but he is working towards it, saying 'Just look at the IRS check I just sent!' 'The IRS was very kind to me the other day. They excused $2million off my bill. I like the IRS now,' he said. Tyson spoke about his newfound appreciation for the government agency during a talk that coincided with the launch of a documentary called Champs which profiles Tyson, his former rival Evander Holyfield and fellow boxer Bernard Hopkins. Holyfield, who had a part of his ear bitten off by Tyson during a fight in 1997, was by his side at the Manhattan event on Saturday and said that he had similar financial problems. 'All of sudden when I started making . $20million a fight . . . and they started talking about things I had . never heard of before so I just listened and figured they’d do the right . thing,' Holyfield said according to The New York Post. 'Unfortunately, . it’s not people you don’t know, it’s people you do know and people you . trust. A lot of the time we trust our family members, but you have to . forgive. Because I have forgiven.' Proud dad: Little is known about Tyson's seven living children but he was accompanied to the Tribeca Film Festival event with his son Miguel . Tyson has taken a similarly Zen attitude towards the issue, focusing on the positive aspects of his life and how his seven living children have been able to thrive. (One of his daughters, Exodus, died in 2009 after getting strangled by a cord on a treadmill at the age of four.) 'I didn’t spare any quarters any nickels or dimes either. I’m not regretful for that whatsoever,' the 47-year-old said, according to the Tribeca Film Festival. 'I had a 9th grade education. But my kids go to Ivy League schools. I’m dumb as s*** but I did something right.' 'I am a better parent than my mother and my father and that’s a victory in itself. 'Ten years ago, if you asked me where I’d be now, I’d have said f****** dead. But I’m not dead. I have an awesome life. And I’m just very grateful. That’s the one thing I try to convey.

"A beloved priest who was murdered in his Northern California rectory last week was brutally beaten with a wooden stake and a metal gutter according to autopsy results revealed Monday as hundreds gathered for the cleric's funeral. It is yet another startling revelation after parishioners of Eureka's St. Bernard Catholic Church were first horrified to learn Reverend Eric Freed was found killed at the hands of an intruder on New Year's Day. The plot only thickened once authorities nabbed their suspect, 44-year-old Gary Lee Bullock. The known criminal was stopped by police while lurking near the church with a stake in his hands just hours before the slaying but was allowed to go free. Murdered: Beloved Reverend Eric Freed, seen here giving a First Communion in St. Bernard Catholic Church in Eureka, California, was found brutally slain New Year's Day in the rectory of the church . Terrible: Police say Bullock had been in and out of custody in the hours before Freed died and was questioned near the church as he held a wooden stake in the hours before the slaying but was not detained . Grieving: Hundreds gathered for the celebrated priest's last rites on Monday. Here, Laura Martinez, center, prays at the interment at the St. Bernard's Cemetery in Eureka . Bullock was charged with murder with a special allegation of torture. He is also charged with burglary, arson and auto theft. Bullock pleaded not guilty and bail was set at $1.2 million, according to court records. Amid the horrifying new details of the friar's slaying comes one nagging question: why would Bullock have done it? 'I don't think we have a clear motive we are willing to speak about at this point,' said Police Chief Andrew Mills. 'There was significant evidence at the scene to suggest he tried to set the house on fire.' Unthinkable: A group pays its last respects to the beloved priest. Authorities say 44-year-old Gary Lee Bullock brutally beat Freed to death early New Year's Day with a wooden stake and a drain pipe before stealing his car . Trying to heal: Stanley and Martha Fosnaugh release doves at the Interment of Father Eric Freed at the St. Bernard's Cemetery in Eureka . Startling discovery: The casket of Father Eric Freed is moved after the funeral service. Freed's body was discovered by church staff when he didn't show up to say Mass the morning of New Year's Day. Authorities declined to give a more detailed description of Freed's murder but did reveal that there was evidence Bullock tried setting fire to the rectory . Authorities have said Bullock was released from jail on a disorderly conduct charge several hours before Freed was killed in the rectory at St. Bernard Catholic Church. The jail is near the church. Mills said Bullock was visible on surveillance video from outside the church and rectory, and the attacker got inside the rectory by breaking a side window. The slaying occurred in the early morning hours of Jan. 1, Parris said. A more precise time of death must await further analysis of the evidence. A passing security guard saw Bullock on church grounds at about 2 a.m. New Year's Day and called police. An officer confronted Bullock in front of the rectory, checked his jail papers, did a field sobriety test, and determined he was mentally competent to be in public, then directed him to a shelter several blocks away. Humboldt County Sheriff's Lt. Steve Knight said with no serious criminal behavior to hold him, and no evidence of a psychiatric problem, police had no reason to apprehend Bullock. Well-regarded: Father Freed was remembered by his friends and colleagues as a genuine and warm person who was easy to talk to and made God accessible for congregants . Caught: Gary Lee Bullock (left) has been . arrested in the killing of Father Eric Freed (right), who was found . slain in the rectory of St Bernard Church in Humboldt County . Nabbed: Bullock has a history of arrests in Humboldt County but not of violent offenses. He was arrested Thursday by sheriffs while his stepfather was driving to turn himself in to police . ‘This was standard practice,’ Knight said. ‘It was truly a tragic, tragic event that this happened after the fact. Unfortunately, we release people from our jail because we have to, and they go commit other crimes. There was no indication of anything unusual here.’ Freed's body was discovered when he didn't show up to say Mass the morning of New Year's Day. Bullock was arrested Thursday by sheriff's deputies outside Garberville. Deputies said his stepfather was driving him to Garberville to turn himself in. Bullock was well-known to authorities in Humboldt County, the heart of the Northern California marijuana growing region known as the Emerald Triangle. Vote of confidence: Police Chief Andrew Mills, pictured during a press conference Thursday, said he was satisfied his officers acted properly given the parameters of the law, which dictated they had no reason to detain Bullock after questioning him in the hours before the killing . He was on probation for misdemeanor convictions for cocaine possession and had no record of violent crime. Bullock was arrested for investigation of disorderly conduct at 1.27pm on New Year's Eve at his home town of Redway after a mobile home park resident noticed him hiding in bushes and ‘acting bizarre,’ said Knight. Because he was on parole, Bullock was taken to jail in Eureka. On the way, Bullock tried to kick out the patrol car windows, said Knight. When he calmed down enough for the jail nurse to examine him, his heart was racing - too high to be admitted to the jail. So two deputies took him to the emergency room at St. Joseph Hospital, where doctors pronounced him fit for jail. Police said he was held for eight hours - twice the normal time for a disorderly conduct allegation - before being released 42 minutes after midnight. He was not given a psychiatric exam. Crime scene: Police say Father Freed put up a fight inside the rectory of St Bernard Church but was struck dead by his attacker . Motive: Detectives are still trying to determine what prompted the suspect to kill the beloved cleric .

"A 34-year-old Julliard graduate leaped to her death from a 16th floor Manhattan apartment Thursday and in the process very nearly took a man passing by on the street below down with her. Samantha Cohn, who made a living as a Pilates instructor, took her own life around 10am. Seconds earlier, 59-year-old Matt Kovary passed by the very spot where the brunette beauty's body slammed into the sidewalk along Broadway. Perished: Brunette beauty Samantha Cohn plummeted to her death from a Manhattan apartment building Thursday and nearly too down a pedestrian passerby along with her . A police officer guards the section of sidewalk where Samantha Cohn fell . 'I thank God for sparing me because I would be dead too,' Kovary told the New York Post. 'I heard a loud explosion. It was right behind me.' There lay Cohn, who witnesses said was wearing her workout clothes, dead and crumpled in a pile. 'The sight was so horrific. She was just at my feet. She almost took me with her,' Kovary said. Cohn's suicide reportedly came after some recent bouts with mental health issues. In April, the former dancer reportedly disappeared for a week. 'They found her in the hospital, supposedly for heat exhaustion,' doorman and witness Jacques Tassy told the Post. 'When she came back, she seemed different. She wasn’t smiling as much.' A woman charged with checking in on the unwell woman from time to time arrived at the building just half an hour after the suicide and wept when she learned the victim was Cohn.

"The release of Roy Keane’s updated autobiography has confirmed his status as one of the most intriguing players of the Premier League era. The revisiting of his feud with Sir Alex Ferguson, that leg breaking tackle on Alf-Inge Haaland and a bust up with Peter Schmeichel have made the headlines. But the book has also recalled just how powerful a presence he was at Manchester United. The fearsome Irishman was a true midfield general, enforcing Ferguson’s will on the pitch, winning the ball, carrying it forward and pulling everyone around him into line. Here, Sportsmail considers Keane and some of the other most influential players in the 22-year history of the Premier League. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Keane describe Brian Clough as the best manager . Roy Keane was a midfield general for Manchester United... as his updated autobiography details . Keane clashes with Patrick Vieira during a game at Highbury, a common sight in the Premier League . 10. John Terry . Now in his 17th season as a professional at Chelsea, Terry’s longevity is testament to his talent and unwavering dedication to football. He has not always conducted himself well – appearing on the front pages of the papers as well as the back, but his ability as a footballer is unquestionable. He has an uncanny sense of positioning, rarely misses a tackle and last season made a staggering 600th Premier League appearance. John Terry is in his 17th season at Chelsea - he emerged from the academy to become a true leader . 9. Steven Gerrard . The 34-year-old has been criticised by some this season with Liverpool not firing on all cylinders. But there is no doubt that he has been consistently the most influential player at Anfield since making his Premier League debut in 1998. He cemented his status as a Liverpool legend when driving his side to Champions League glory in Istanbul nine years ago. He is an expert passer and has reinvented himself in recent years, leading his team from a deep-lying midfield role. His desire to succeed for his boyhood team remains undiminished. Steven Gerrard, celebrating scoring against Bolton in 2009, has excelled for Liverpool since 1998 . 8. Tony Adams . Adams spanned two eras at Arsenal, which can be summed up by his diet. The pre-Wenger years were sausage sandwiches. After the Frenchman arrived, it was lean meat and pasta but Adams was still at the forefront of the new Arsenal. A strong and commanding defender, he was an inspirational leader, encouraging the best from his troops like a wartime general. Fittingly, Arsenal won the double in the 2001-02 season, Adams’s final year at the club where he spent his entire career. Tony Adams finished his superb Arsenal career with a double in the 2001/02 season . 7. Ryan Giggs . Giggs racked up 963 appearances and 34 trophies over 24 seasons as a Manchester United player before retiring at the end of last season. He scored in 21 consecutive seasons and hit 109 league goals. The numbers speak for themselves. But few of Giggs’s many opponents over the years describe him as anything but humble. Although his powers waned over the years and his runs became less blistering, he was still an influential presence in the United dressing room. Ryan Giggs racked up 963 appearances for Manchester United and was still going strong in his final year . 6. Frank Lampard . Even when not permanently signed to a Premier League club, Lampard continues to be influential on loan for Manchester City. But it is 13 glittering years at Chelsea, which took in the most dominant period in the club’s history, that earn him a place on the list. Born into a footballing family, what marked Lampard out was his magnificent work ethic. He worked tirelessly and consistently – delivering quietly impressive performances and goals season-after-season for Chelsea and in this campaign became the first player to score against 39 different Premier League sides. As he gets older, he hasn’t been afraid to adapt, sitting back more and exerting his influence in different ways. Frank Lampard helped Terry, more so with his goals, to three Premier League titles in 13 years . 5. Roy Keane . Sir Alex Ferguson broke the British transfer record to buy Keane from Nottingham Forest – the £3.75m proving a bargain for the man who succeeded Bryan Robson as United’s driving force. For what he offered the Premier League in entertainment value, Keane was absolutely priceless. Amid all the controversy and fallings out, he defined an era at Manchester United. He was driven by a need to win and helped instill that hunger in the rest of the team. His rivalry with Patrick Vieira was captivating. Keane succeeded Bryan Robson as United's driving force and proved to be a bargain at £3.75m . 4. Alan Shearer . Simply the most lethal finisher in Premier League history and all time top scorer with 260 goals, almost all celebrated with that famous one arm salute. His goals lifted Blackburn to the title in 1995 and a year later signed for his beloved Newcastle for £15m, a world record signing at the time. Shearer was also completely nerveless, scoring 56 Premier League penalties – the most of any player, by some distance. Alan Shearer celebrates scoring one of his 260 Premier League goals... his record still stands . 3. Patrick Vieira . When his former team-mates speak of Vieira, one word crops up repeatedly – respect. The former France star engendered respect with his brutal, battling midfield performances. Vieira let the opposition know - he had an impeccable tactical awareness and during his nine years at Arsenal Wenger employed him as his brains on the pitch. Patrick Vieira, avoiding a carton of drinks after scoring against Tottenham, was a giant figure for Arsenal . 2. Thierry Henry . Henry had a slow start to Premier League life, failing to score in his first seven games. But he picked up with a vengeance and boasts the second best minutes to goal ratio (one every 121.8 minutes) of any player to grace the top flight. The Frenchman is the gold standard for strikers, tearing through defences with ease and making scoring goals seem so utterly effortless. In the Arsenal invincibles side that went uniquely unbeaten in the 2003/04 season, Henry was the shining star. Thierry Henry - one of the best finishers in Premier League history - scoring past Maik Taylor of Birmingham . 1. Eric Cantona . In late November 1992, the Frenchman strutted into Old Trafford with his chest puffed out and went on to shape the future of Manchester United. He made an instant impact in a side that hadn’t won a title in 26 years, helping them to win eight and draw two of his first 10 games. He helped United win four titles over his five years there, making goals, scoring and beating players in a fashion not seen before in English football. He had his controversial moments as well - such as when he kicked a spectator at Selhurst Park in 1995. But he made much more of an impact on the pitch. What more to say about Eric Cantona? He arrived with a swagger, which never disappeared .","Roy Keane releases updated autobiography, with several talking points .

"The woman at the center of the Vanderbilt University footballer rape scandal did not believe she had been assaulted at first because she was dating one of the four accused players, a new report has revealed. The female victim, who has not been identified, initially told police that she was romantically involved with one of the students and believed he would not have allowed anything bad to happen to her. She even admitted to having consensual sex with him in the days following the alleged sexual assault. It was not until she heard about the pictures and video of the three other players 'attacking her' that she found out about the alleged assault. Brandon Vandenburg is one of the four accused football players, and the young woman said that she met up with him at a local bar on the night of June 23. Scroll down for video . Defense attorney for Brandon Vandenburg (pictured) charged with raping a woman in a campus dorm last June are accusing prosecutors of destroying or not preserving evidence . '(The victim) advised she trusted Vandenburg and he would not let anything happen to her,' Nashville police Sgt. Mike Shreeve revealed new details in his investigative report, highlights of which were published by The Tennessean. The alleged victim did not have any recollection of being raped, and only had her suspicion raised after hearing that there was a video and pictures of her being assaulted while unconscious. '(The victim) advised she had been drinking heavily and has very little/no memory of events that took place,' the report stated. 'Advised she does not think she was sexually assaulted did not ""feel"" like she had sex.' She told police that she spoke with Vandenburg with no contention after June 23 and had 'consensual sex with him within a few days following this incident'. It was only after speaking with a victim's advocate at the police station that the young woman decided to submit herself for a rape kit. Cory Batey (left), Brandon Banks (center) and Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie (right) are the other players facing two counts each of aggravated sexual battery in connection to the June rape . Crime scene: Police say the star player brought his unconscious date to his second-floor room in the Gillette House dormitory, where he proceeded to rape her . One of the key pieces of evidence backing the police's charges is surveillance footage provided by the University. The . Tennessean reports that the footage shows three black men and one white . man- whose identities were not explicitly stated by the school . officials- are seen carrying a young woman wearing a short skirt. The skirt did not cover her throughout the video meaning that her 'private area was sometimes exposed'. That skirt and the other clothing she was wearing on the night of the attack are now being held by police and used as evidence. BuzzFeed previously revealed information about the night of the sex assault, during which Vandenburg and three other players allegedly smashed through a security door before one of the suspects covered a surveillance camera in the hallway with a towel. Several students later recalled hearing a loud bang that night, which turned out to be the sound of a door being knocked off the hinges in the second-floor hallway. The force with which the door was broken would eventually lead authorities to suspect that football players may have been involved. Investigators working on the case believe that Mr Vandenburg brought his passed-out date to his room and had sex with her without consent, with three of his teammates present at one point or another in the course of the night. According to BuzzFeed sources, unnamed objects were also employed to sexually penetrate the unconscious student, and Vandenburg used his cell phone to allegedly take graphic photos and record video, which he later sent to four people. Earlier appearance: The alleged rape is believed to have taken place in Vandenburg's room, and the victim did not think he would have allowed anything bad to happen to her (Vandenburg seen here on October 16) Warning: Vandenburg's new attorney Fletcher Long argues that the evidence is being exaggerated and his client is 'absolutely innocent' It remains unclear whether the alleged rape victim remained in Vandenburg’s room until the next morning, or whether she was carried to another room in the dormitory. Vanderburg spoke out for the first time on November 25, with his team of lawyers at his side. 'I'm innocent and I'm going to fight that to the very end,' the 20-year-old transfer student said to News Channel 5. 'It's been extremely difficult for me. I came to play football and a great education. That would be the reason to come to Vanderbilt and that's not what I got.' He was most recently seen at a hearing on Tuesday before Thanksgiving where his new attorneys claimed he is 'absolutely innocent' as the evidence against him has been 'exaggerated and completely oversold'. 'I believe that when the truth comes out, people who rushed to judgment in this particular case are going to have regret,' defense attorney Fletcher Long said according to ABC 6 of Knoxville, Tennessee. The other football players who face two counts of aggravated sexual battery are 19-year-olds Cory Batey, Brandon Banks and Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie.","Authorities say Brandon Vandenburg took 21-year-old to a bar June 23 and then brought her unconscious to his dorm room .

"Fernando Torres will turn down the chance to move Roma or AC Milan and stay at Chelsea, with Jose Mourinho insisting that the £50m striker still has a part to play in the squad despite not even making the bench for Saturday's 2-0 win over Leicester. Both Italian clubs have made inquiries about Torres but the striker is not keen on a move to Italy and Mourinho claims that the Spaniard, who has two years left on his contract, cannot leave as he needs three strikers for the season. Mourinho said: ‘I want three strikers in the team. Sometimes I want to play with two and have one on the bench. At other times, someone will be suspended, another will be injured.

"It's a gripe often levelled at Britain's frosty talent show judges: why don't you get up and do this yourselves? A beauty contest judge in Romania did just that - and duly out-danced her own contestants to win the £3,000 top prize. Cristina Pucean made headlines when she triumphed at the Miss Piranda contest, whose entrants have showcased traditional Roma music and dancing for more than 20 years. Scroll down for video . Joining in: Beauty contest judge Cristina Pucean joined her own show in Romania - and won the top prize . Dancing feet: Speaking after the show, she said she couldn't resist the thrill of the competition . The 19-year-old, who has thousands of fans and dances on the club scene in London, had won a previous title at the age of 16 and was invited back to be one of the judges. But when the contest took place at a packed sports hall in the capital Bucharest, she jumped over the judges' table to join in, according to a report by the Central European News agency. There were boos when her performances was given a standing ovation by fellow judge and music promoter Ion Petrisor, 46, dubbed the contest's equivalent of Simon Cowell. According to the report, he told the crowd: 'I don't know about you, but I thought she was amazing. As far as I'm concerned, she beat the rest hands down, and she definitely deserves the prize.' But his decision was instantly challenged by the third jury member, Adrian Cristea.

"British authorities say Aslam Awan was a member of a militant cell in northern England who had fought in Afghanistan . Two wanted Al-Qaeda leaders killed by U.S. drone attacks are believed to have travelled from Britain to launch terrorist attacks against the West. One, Aslam Awan, studied in Manchester but joined an Islamic terror cell then went to Afghanistan to fight coalition forces. By contrast, his brothers remain in Britain pursuing respectable careers – they are a surgeon, a GP, a banker and a software engineer. Awan rose to become a senior figure in Al Qaeda’s leadership, planning attacks on the West, but was killed in Pakistan’s inaccessible border area by a missile launched from an unmanned U.S. drone. His death was announced as it was claimed that an Al-Qaeda commander killed in a drone attack in Somalia was a British citizen. Insurgent group Al-Shabab said Bilal al-Berjawi grew up in West London before he too went to fight in Afghanistan, but the Foreign Office denied he had held British citizenship. Awan, who is thought to have been 29, came to Britain on a student visa in 2002 but became part of a committed terrorist cell based in Manchester. They filmed each other training in the Lake District, with police later finding clips of them crawling across a snow-covered mountain while firing imaginary guns. Awan had told his family he was studying at Manchester University, hoping to better himself just as his four elder brothers had done before him. But while his brothers remain here pursuing successful professional careers, Awan returned in about 2007 to his hometown of Abbottabad, Pakistan – ironically, later revealed as the hiding place of Osama bin Laden. On guard: Plainclothes Pakistani security men stand outside the family house of  al-Qaida militant Aslam Awan . He first came to prominence when letters he wrote from Afghanistan dubbed a ‘call to arms’ were seized from former schoolfriend and fellow plotter Abdul Rahman. One praised Taliban rule in Afghanistan and called on supporters to join him and spread the ‘fragrance of blood’ on the battlefield. Rahman later became the first person in Britain to be convicted of a charge of disseminating terrorist information and was jailed for six years. The cell was headed by Rangzieb Ahmed, who was later captured in Pakistan and jailed in Britain. Operating under the nom de guerre Abdullah Khurasani, Awan is understood to have been highly regarded within the Al Qaeda hierarchy for his education, computer skills and foreign contacts. According to U.S. intelligence officials, he rose to become a senior external operations planner, plotting attacks on the West. They do not believe he was in direct contact with bin Laden, who kept communication with his supporters to a minimum after going into hiding. Awan was among four people killed in a CIA drone attack on a militant stronghold on North Waziristan on January 10 but his death was only confirmed at the weekend. A U.S. official said: ‘His death reduces al-Qaeda's thinning bench of another operative devoted to plotting the death of innocent civilians.’ His father Khushal Khan, who lived in Britain in the 1970s and worked at a bank, was informed of his death in a phone call to his wife which said Awan had been ‘martyred’. However at the family home in Abbottabad he refused to believe that he had been a terrorist, telling how his other sons all had respectable careers in Britain - one is a surgeon, another is a doctor, the third an engineer and the fourth is a banker. Attack: An undated handout image courtesy of the U.S. Air Force shows a MQ-1 Predator unmanned aircraft . ‘I don't believe this is true, my son was not indulging in these things,’ he said. Another drone attack on Al Qaeda terrorists killed Bilal al-Berjawi on the outskirts of the war-town Somali capital Mogadishu. Militant group Al-Shabab said he was a Lebanese and British citizen who grew up in West London and fought in Afghanistan before going to Somalia in 2006. However the Foreign Office denied he had been a British citizen, refusing to comment on whether he had ever lived in this country. Berjawi is understood to have helped oversee recruitment, training and tactics for al-Shabab, who are fighting the weak UN-backed government in Somalia. In a statement on Saturday, the insurgents said he had been ‘martyred immediately’, receiving ‘what he wished for and what he went out for’. But Omar Jamal, the first secretary in the Somali mission to the UN, responded ‘Good riddance’, adding that he hoped it would help bring an end to fighting in his country. Last year one of Britain’s most wanted terror suspects was killed in another drone attack on Waziristan. Ibrahim Adam had fled after his brother Anthony Garcia was jailed for life for plotting to blow up the Ministry of Sound nightclub or the Bluewater Shopping Centre with a fertiliser bomb in 2004. He died along with a fellow Briton, Mohammed Azmir Khan.","He was one of four people killed in strike .

"It was supposed to be a routine job, police say. Move 69 prisoners from an outlying town to a jail in southern Baghdad. But before they arrived at their destination, every single prisoner had been killed. But mystery surrounds the massacre. According to some sources, it’s likely that they were killed to prevent them joining the rebellion. The official account, though, given hours after the killing on Monday by the governor of Hillah, 92km (57 miles) south of Baghdad, was that militants had attacked the convoy killing 10 prisoners and one policeman in the crossfire. Scroll down for video .

Fightback: Shi'ite volunteers march after completing their field training in Najaf . Massacre: Sixty-nine prisoners were shot dead on Monday, with officials blaming militants, but anonymous sources saying they were executed to stop them joining the rebellion. Pictured are terrorist fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) Iraqi soldiers take up position at Arar town, near the Iraqi borders with Saudi Arabia on Friday . Iraqi government troops launched airstrikes against Islamist-led insurgents in Tikrit on Friday, a day after the military claimed to have retaken the northern city's university from the rebels . ‘The convoy protection force fiercely responded to the terrorist attack,’ Governor Sadiq Madloul told reporters. But a police captain, a second police officer and a senior local official from where the prisoners died in Hilla, all speaking on condition of anonymity while giving an account that differed from the official line, told Reuters no attack took place, and the police had executed the 69 men. A third police source who would not contradict the account that the convoy had come under attack nevertheless confirmed that all 69 had been killed and said some had not died in the crossfire but were gunned down to prevent them from escaping. The deaths in Hillah came less than a week after the killing of 52 prisoners in Baquba, a regional capital north of Baghdad. The police account of that incident also said that the prisoners had died in crossfire during a battle with insurgents. But local Sunni officials including the mayor and the provincial governor, medical staff at the morgue and relatives of the dead all said the victims were gunned down in their jail cells. Iraq's government has long denied it summarily executes prisoners. Following a Reuters report on police executions in March, army spokesman Sa'ad Ma'an said: ‘If it happened, whoever committed it will be investigated, held accountable and sent to a military court.’ Location: The massacre took place in Hillah, to the south of Baghdad . Conflict: Members of the Al-Abbas brigades, who volunteered to protect the Shiite Muslim holy sites in Karbala against Sunni militants fighting the Baghdad government, parade in the streets of the Shrine city on June 26 . Ma'an and other Iraqi government spokesmen did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the latest killings outside Hillah. Unlike the Iraqi government, Sunni insurgents from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant make no attempt to hide mass executions of prisoners: they proudly proclaim that Shi'ites are heretics who must die, and boast of the killings. Days after they began sweeping through northern cities on June 10, they released videos showing their masked fighters machine gunning captive government soldiers lying in shallow graves. On Friday, Human Rights Watch said ISIS had executed at least 160 people in Tikrit this month. But the reports that government forces loyal to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki are also executing prisoners are becoming more regular as the conflict intensifies, calling into question Washington's stepped-up military support for the Shi'ite premier. Several police sources interviewed by Reuters said prisoners were being preemptively killed in Iraq to prevent militant groups from freeing them to rejoin the rebellion. Iraqi security forces patrol after clashes with the predominantly Sunni militants from the radical Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in the town of Dalli Abbas in Diyala province on Thursday . ‘We feed them and keep them healthy and if the Isis managed to free them, they will immediately resume fighting us,’ the police captain who acknowledged the executions in Hilla said. ‘We have to defend ourselves by executing those criminals.’ The second Hillah police officer said summary executions were routinely carried out by army and police forces. ‘First thing we do is to shoot them in the foot and then take their confessions. Then we kill them and write in report they were killed in action,’ he said, also on condition of anonymity. The third police officer, who denied that the Hillah prisoners were executed, nevertheless said the reason some of the 69 had been shot was to prevent them from escaping. He said the convoy had been hit by a roadside bomb and came under fire. ‘We are not an execution squad. What happened was that we were trying to transport high-profile, dangerous members of al Qaeda - most of them awaiting death sentences - to another secure detention centre south of Baghdad,’ he said. ‘The convoy came under attack by militants who set off two roadside bombs. Some of the prisoners wanted to use the attack to escape. We shot them dead as they were escaping.’ A senior local official in Hilla said the attack on the convoy had been staged to hide the execution. ‘The police brought the bodies of 16 other terrorists they had executed earlier to the scene and laid weapons by their corpses to pretend they had attacked the convoy,’ he said. One of Isis's main aims is to free Sunni prisoners from government jails, and Iraqi police and troops who guard them come under frequent attack. A year ago Isis launched its biggest military operation in years, attacking two jails. Hundreds of convicts, including senior members of al Qaeda, were freed from Abu Ghraib jail on Baghdad's western outskirts in the assault, which saw suicide bombers blast through the gates. When militants took Mosul city on June 10 at the start of their present offensive, they freed as many as 1,000 prisoners from a jail. The government's harsh justice towards prisoners did not begin with this month's Isis advance, however. In a Reuters investigation in March, a police officer, an army officer, a general and an Iraqi Special Forces member all said that in western Anbar province Iraqi troops had begun replying in kind to Isis, carrying out extra-judicial executions, torture and humiliations of their enemy and posting images of the results online. On June 4, a week before the assault on Mosul, the chief of police in Hillah held a news conference to display six captives, charged with a car bomb attack that killed 14 people. The prisoners confessed in front of cameras to having bombed Hilla hospital. Hours later, Police Chief Major General Riad al-Hikani posted pictures of the bullet-riddled bodies of four of the suspects on his Facebook page. He said they had been killed when unidentified assailants opened fire while they were being escorted to cells, but expressed no regret at the death of captives in his custody. ‘Delighted that divine justice has been achieved against them,’ Hikani wrote on Facebook.","Mystery surrounds the massacre with several accounts of the incident .

Sara Ylen, 38, of Lexington, Michigan, has admitted using make-up to make it look like she had been attacked.

"A shady online marketplace that anonymously sold drugs and guns has virtually disappeared, leaving illegal vendors believing they’ve been scammed out of as much as $100 million. Sheep Marketplace emerged as the go-to replacement to Silk Road, a similar bazaar shuttered by the FBI in October. Now users of the site, which operated outside the law to begin with and dealt only in anonymous Bitcoins, fear it was a scam all along. Fleeced: An illicit online bazaar where drugs, guns, and even hit men could be purchased went offline Sunday. Now its vendors and users fear they've been bilked out of as much as $100 million, all in anonymous Bitcoins through what may have been a scam website . Shielded from authorities and using special software to access the so-called ‘Deep Web’ site, buyers could find drugs, guns, and even hit men. Buyers would put their Bitcoins into the marketplace, where sellers would withdraw them, with all the transactions moderated by the website. Which is where the issue first arose. In the days before the site shut down, vendors suddenly found themselves unable to access the Bitcoins tied up in the site’s wallet. Down, but is it out? Sheep Marketplace posted a note claiming it was they who were the victims of a scam. But users have their doubts and fear no one will ever get refunds of their nearly untraceable, illicit money . As they complained, reports RT, they found their comments suddenly yanked from the site’s forums. Buyers also began to see suspicious things in the time leading up to this possible scam. Some vendors, though not all, began to list their drugs and other goods at prices far lower than ever before. Now, many believe they were being bilked out of as many of their Bitcoins—a difficult to trace form of online currency currently worth over $1,000 a piece—as possible before taking the money and running. On Sunday, visitors to the site found a note in place of the homepage that claimed a vendor called EBOOK101 had stolen from the site’s cache of Bitcoins. Shoddy replacement? The illegal bazaar rose to prominence after Silk Road was shut down by the FBI in October. While other marketplaces exist, users must now fear that each one is a scam like Sheep Marketplace appears to have been . ‘This vendor found bug in system and stole 5400 BTC,’ reads the brief note. ‘Your money, our provisions, all was stolen.’ However, according to a post on Hacker News, a wallet of far more Bitcoins has been traced back to the site. Tor - short for The onion Router - is a seething matrix of encrypted websites that allows users to surf beneath the everyday internet with complete anonymity. It uses numerous layers of security and encryption to render users anonymous online. Normally, file sharing and internet browsing activity can be tracked by law enforcement through each user's unique IP address that can be traced back to an individual computer. The Tor network on the Deep Web hides the IP address and the activity of the user. Most of the Web's information is buried far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines - sites or pages don't exist until created as the result of a specific search. An Internet search is like dragging a net across the surface of the sea - a great deal of information is caught, but a majority is deep and therefore missed. Valued at $45 million, 39,918 in Bitcoins could now be in the hands of a those behind the site after scamming untold numbers of hopeful drug users and gun toters out of their hard earned virtual cash. Or perhaps even more. According to the Daily Dot, one Redditor claims to have engaged in a virtual chase with Czech computer programmer Tomáš Jiřikovsky, who user sheeproadreloaded2 claims is behind the site and has absconded with 96,000 bitcoins, or about $95 million dollars. Despite a claim by Sheep Marketplace that they intend to refund users’ money to their ‘emergency addresses,’ none of the commenters on Reddit’s r/SheepMarketplace forum appear to have received any money thus far. Some, however, do seem to be seriously worried their money will never come. A commenter using the handle wrote: ‘I am a large vendor on Sheep Marketplace, or I was until recently. I sold hard drugs in reasonably large quantities. I have around $90k locked up in the site. I owe some money to some very nasty people, . ‘I have until monday evening. They have already threatened me with death. I have no doubt that they have killed before...I am 26 and I don't want to die.’ Whether this is a true story or not remains unclear. However, with no way to track what illicit money belongs to whom, it seems clear that no one will be getting their Bitcoins back even if the alleged thief ever gets caught. Bitcoins are a type of online currency that can be exchanged for dollars and vice versa. The main idea behind it is to facilitate cheap, anonymous transactions policed by its community of users. Much like gold, there are a finite number of Bitcoins - 21 million exist and are predicted to last until 2140. This number was designated by the inventor (or inventors) of the virtual coinage when it first came about in 2008. Also like gold, Bitcoins are mined. But instead of digging in the ground, Bitcoins are extracted online via complex algorithms like virtual pickaxes. The value of Bitcoins fluctuate like gold, too.","Sheep Marketplace, an anonymous marketplace accessible only with the help of software that hides its users' identities, virtually vanished Sunday taking its vendors' money with it .

Alexandra's parents said they had called paramedics after a local Catholic priest refused to perform an exorcism on the three because they were not regular churchgoers. The Ouija board - also known as a spirit board or talking board - is a flat board marked with the letters of the alphabet, the numbers 0-9, the words 'yes', 'no', 'hello' and 'goodbye' and various symbols and graphics. It uses a small heart-shaped piece of wood or movable indicator to indicate the spirit's message by spelling it out on the board during a seance. Participants place their fingers on the wood and it is supposedly moved around the board by the spirit to spell out words. Mainstream religions and some occultists have associated use of a Ouija board with the concept of demonic possession, and have cautioned their followers not to use one.","For an updated version of this article with new details, click here .

"Arsenal's powderpuff performance in Dortmund underlined their dire need to find a physical presence in midfield. A man willing to sacrifice himself for the team, to do the jobs that Arsenal's silky footballers seem unprepared to do. As Arsene Wenger this week admitted: 'I’m happy with the signings we have made but we still need a physical presence with prodigious ability like Vieira or Petit.' Here Sportsmail looks at some of the targets in his sights. Mikel Arteta (Per Mertesacker in the background) was disappointing during Arsenal's defeat at Dortmund . Arsene Wenger watched his midfield get completely over-run by Jurgen Klopp's side . LASSANA DIARRA . Former Portsmouth midfielder was in discussions over a deal to join QPR prior to the transfer deadline closing but delays in his acrimonious release from Lokomotiov Moscow slowed down the process. Harry Redknapp needed a guaranteed starter and pressed ahead with his bid for Sandro instead. Diarra is free and is willing to accept a role as a squad player on a short term deal. Arsene Wenger knows the former France international well after signing him in 2007 from Chelsea but he grew frustrated at lack of first team opportunities then. At 29, he still has enough quality to make a contribution and discipline to play the holding midfield role. Lassana Diarra (right, playing for Lokomotiv Moscow) was in discussions over a deal to join QPR . VICTOR WANYAMA . The Kenya international is unsettled at Southampton and has been on Arsenal's radar for two years. The 23-year-old is one of the unsung members of Southampton's coveted squad as he has the disciplined mindset to sit in front of the back four and allows his teammates to move forward. Has a knack of performing well against the bigger teams and was outstanding in their unfortunate defeat at Anfield on the opening weekend of the Premier League season. Wanyama is still only 23, is big, strong, good on the ball and has European experience from his time with Celtic. He could prove a good investment for Arsenal's future at £15million. Victor Wanyama is unsettled at Southampton and has been on Arsenal's radar for two years . WILLIAM CARVALHO . The Portugal international is overpriced but has potential. Sporting wanted £23.8million for him last month and Arsenal were reluctant to offer more than £18m. Indecision in the transfer market at Arsenal has often cost them and this could prove another example. Carvalho is 22 years old is powerful, versatile and has the physical attributes of a Vieira but lacks composure. He can be rash in the tackle but that could be put down to the over exuberance of youth. Sporting need the money and are willing to negotiate with Arsenal for January. A deal could be reached with the promise of greater add-ons based performances. William Carvalho is powerful in the middle of the park but the Sporting man is overpriced . LARS BENDER . The 25-year-old Bayer Leverkusen midfielder, twin of Borussia Dortmund defensive midfielder Sven Bender, is a more all-round player similar to the model Wenger has been searching for. However, the payer's injury record goes against him and Leverkusen still want big money for the Germany international who is one year into a six-year contract. Has good vision and passing skills to accompany great defensive workrate. He has strength and would fit into the Premier League well but may be too many risks for Wenger. Germany have favoured Sami Khedira and the emerging Christoph Kramer - another Leverkusen player on loan at Monchengladbach. Lars Bender is a jack of all trades in midfield and would provide Arsene Wenger with versatility . GIANELLI IMBULA . The 22-year-old has been watched by Arsenal since his days at Guingamp where he was also closely followed by Chelsea. indeed Arsenal came close to striking a deal with Guingamp two years ago before Marseille stepped in. He has continued to develop and Marseille are always open to striking a deal. He is opinionated which has cost him his place in the France U21 squad in the past but should mature with experience and the right advice. Is aggressive, likes a tackle and can pass. He is 6ft 1ins tall and athletic but may lack discipline at this stage. Marseille's Gianelli Imbula was watched by Arsenal while at Guingamp .

"His lifetime’s ambition was to remove Scotland from the United Kingdom and, in that endeavour, history will reflect that he failed. Not now, not at any time in the future, will Alex Salmond lead his native land to the political status that he calls freedom. The 59-year-old First Minister of Scotland knew there would come but one chance to fulfil his dream of independence and the determination and guile with which he set about the task was, at times, awe inspiring. Scroll down for video . Life's work: The former First Minister with a Tunnock's teacake. He bet his career on Scottish independence . For unionists – those people who Mr Salmond now knows still make up the majority of Scots – his efforts were terrifying too. Nobody but Alex Salmond could have led Scotland to the brink of divorce from the rest of the UK. In truth, it is highly unlikely that anyone but this man could have led the Scottish National Party into government, far less carve open the Westminster defence and set up a clear shot on goal. But, in doing so, he laid his leadership of the nation and his party on the line. If he did not score, he could not continue. Married to the reclusive Moira – 17 years his senior – childless and completely obsessive about politics, Mr Salmond is a man with few hobbies. But betting on the horses was one. Here was the biggest gamble of his life. Had the masterplan to break up the 307-year-old union succeeded, it could have been David Cameron announcing his departure from No 10 yesterday. Many of those who watched the premier’s highly emotional plea for a No vote earlier this week had the clear sense that, if Scotland left, the Mr Cameron was gone too. The referendum Mr Salmond fought for, and to which Mr Cameron agreed, was a career-ending shoot-out. And, in Mr Salmond’s case, it was the final stop in a 40-year journey. The joker and the husband: In a New York fashion show (left) and with his elusive wife Moira (right) It concluded not, as he had wished, with the promised land, a confident, assured Scotland entirely in control of its own destiny. It concluded, as perhaps he should have known it would, with his country renewing its historic bonds with its United Kingdom ‘family’. Should the West Lothian-born civil servant’s son have sensed as much when he attended St Andrews University during a time when Scottish nationalism was little more than a fringe movement? He was as Labour as his father Robert in those days – until he had a row with his girlfriend, a pretty English girl called Debbie Horton. Their ideological clash ended with her screaming: ‘If you feel like that, go and join the bloody Scots Nationalists’. Their faces tell the story. Clad in tartan and bearing flags, they were hoping for triumph – but ended up in tears. After Alex Salmond’s bid for independence was defeated, the sense of disappointment was felt keenly in Edinburgh and Glasgow. ‘My feeling was just crushing, quite devastating,’ said first-time voter Charlotte Darroch, 16, watching the count in the capital wearing a school uniform covered in Yes badges. ‘I genuinely thought the feeling on the ground was different.’ Near Edinburgh Castle, tearful tartan-wearing activists gathered, surrounded by Yes slogans. The party – meant to be a celebration of a new dawn - was definitely over. The following day the teenage student in economics and medieval history found himself in the Dundee offices of the SNP. Little would they imagine the constitutional ramifications of his conversion to their cause. In time, this cocky young man’s political powers would relegate the Conservative Party to also-rans in Scottish politics. And, in a few more years, the decades-long dominance of the Labour Party north of the border would be smashed. It was not merely through charm and persuasion – though Mr Salmond possesses both – that these were achieved. Last week, nationalist grandee Jim Sillars stood shoulder to shoulder with Mr Salmond on the campaign frontline. But, in less politically optimistic times, Mr Sillars had opposed his successful 1990 bid to lead the party. ‘After seeing him in operation as deputy leader,’ he said, ‘I knew that his penchant for disliking and denigrating those who disagreed with him would turn the SNP into a nest of vipers, poisoning its bloodstream. ‘I was not wrong. Among Salmond’s most vociferous supporters ten years ago you will find today his most vociferous opponents, all of them wounded when they would not toe the leader’s line, all discarded when they showed they had a mind of their own. You can always judge men by those they gather around them. Big men attract big men. Little men gather cronies, smaller than themselves.’ Those remarks came in 2000 when Mr Salmond had just resigned after a decade as leader. Mr Sillars did not reckon on the Salmond comeback four years later. He could not have dreamed the party colleague he cared little for would be by some distance the biggest political beast in the land – a figure so focused on his goal that some of the shrewdest strategists in the UK despaired of finding a way to stop him. Mr Salmond’s colleague, education secretary Mike Russell, once described the experience of walking down the street with his party leader. It was, he said, like watching a ‘crusade to personally convert every Scottish voter’. Others pointed to his bullying, domineering nature. It was even hinted at – unfairly perhaps – that the notorious cybernats and the Yes campaign’s over-aggressive campaigners were formed in the image of their party leader. Ever ready to play the ‘bully’ card against Westminster, Mr Salmond had little compunction about throwing his own weight around. He was the master of the skilfully worded put down, a politician who rarely seemed happier than when the joke was on his opponent. Ultimately, the smugness began to jar. Too fond, said commentators, of playing the man rather the ball. Despite the failure, the scale of what Alex Salmond has achieved in Scottish politics is immense . And yet the scale of what Alex Salmond has achieved in Scottish politics is immense. It was during his first spell of leadership that he campaigned alongside the Scottish Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats for devolution. It came in the form of a Scottish Parliament with powers over major areas of policy such as health, education, justice and local government. Lord Robertson famously said at the time the new constitutional arrangement would ‘kill nationalism stone dead’. Mr Salmond reasoned more astutely that it would breathe new life into the movement – that, ultimately, devolution would become the highway to Scottish independence. Even now, in failure, the leader of the SNP has wrested a raft of new powers for Scotland from Westminster. Alex Salmond may have said that independence referendums are ‘once in a generation events’ but his party’s next bid for independence could come sooner than many imagine. What now for the man whose last attempt to take a back seat and spend more time with Moira in Aberdeenshire resulted in a slump in his party’s fortunes? Mr Salmond contends that his wife had the veto on his standing for the leadership of the party in 2004. Had she used it, few believe the UK would have stood on the brink of being broken apart this week. As one fellow member of the Scottish Parliament observed: ‘Without politics, Salmond would have nothing. ‘He exists only for politics.’ If Scotland does one day cut its ties with the rest of the UK, there is little doubt that Alex Salmond will be credited with laying the groundwork. But that is not the goal he set himself. He is not a man who will take defeat easily.","Aged 59, First Minister has achieved more than many thought he could .
He staked his entire career on independence, a bet he knew he had lost .

"The 29-year-old woman who was escorted off a US Airways flight after her 'emotional support' pig started defecating on the floor and squealing uncontrollably has been identified by MailOnline. Rachel Boerner, from Wallingford, Connecticut, and her 80-pound pot-bellied pig, Hobey, were removed from the plane  before it left Hartford's Bradley International Airport on Wednesday. The pair had  already passed several security checks after Miss Boerner explained how her pet offered her emotional support and was travelling with her to her family's home for Thanksgiving. On Sunday, Victor Kinoian, the owner of My Pet Piggy in Rhode Island, where Miss Boerner bought Hobey seven months ago, said his customer had been left devastated by the airline's actions.

Above, Miss Boerner is pictured with Hobey . Escorted off: Miss Boerner (pictured, left, with Hobey and right, in a Facebook photo), from Wallingford, Connecticut, was removed from the plane before it left Hartford's Bradley International Airport on Wednesday . Leaving the plane: The pair had already passed several security checks after Miss Boerner explained how her pet offered her emotional support and was travelling with her to her family's home for Thanksgiving . 'She was excited to see her family in South Carolina,' he told MailOnline. 'She's really close to her pig and he is wonderfully trained. The airline had initially welcomed her on-board. 'She took Hobey through the airport on a leash and a harness and told members of security that she used him for emotional support. Hobey hadn't been destructive when they were kicked off.' Mr Kinoian, whose facility sells pigs to customers across the US, added: 'I think the pig got nervous and went to the bathroom  and that caused many passengers to become alarmed and confused. 'The pilot and stewardesses had to make a quick decision. And although pigs themselves don't smell much, their fecal matter does. The whole thing ruined Rachel's plans for Thanksgiving.' Pigs can't fly: Miss Boerner, who is pictured leaving the flight on Wednesday, was allowed to take Hobey onto the plane for 'emotional support' based on guidelines released by the Department for Transportation . Returning to Wallingford: However, during the flight, the pig reportedly started screaming 'three times louder than a child' as Miss Boerner coaxed it down the aisle with her feet because it struggled to move on its own . Upset: On Sunday, Victor Kinoian, the owner of My Pet Piggy in Rhode Island, where Hobey was purchased seven months ago, said Miss Boerner (seen with her boyfriend) had been left upset by the airline's actions . Miss Boerner, who also owns a smaller pig called Claudette, took to My Pet Piggy's Facebook page earlier this year to express her love for Hobey, writing: 'I feel a bit lost without Hobey with us'. The devoted owner, believed to be an aspiring actress and model, has also previously referred to the animal as her 'fat baby' and posted photos of her and her boyfriend holding their two pigs. On Wednesday, Miss Boerner was allowed to take Hobey onto the plane for 'emotional support' based on guidelines released by the Department for Transportation. However, prior to take-off, the animal reportedly started screaming 'three times louder than a child' as his owner coaxed him down the aisle with her feet because he struggled to move on his own.

Pig: Hobey is pictured with ice  cream on his snout (left) and playing in a pool at Miss Boerner's home (right) 'It was ridiculous,' 65-year-old passenger, Rob Phelps, who was with his wife at the time, told MailOnline on Saturday. 'It started to smell and flight attendants told her to clean the mess up.' Mr Phelps of Havenville, Western Massachusetts, said there was 'instant silence' then 'a mix of uncontrollable laughter and shock' when Hobey boarded the plane. 'I have seen dogs and cats in cages on a plane - but never a pig,' he said. 'This was not a small pig. When she held it over her shoulder it reached her waist. 'I don't even know how it got through. You have the TSA and intense security and yet it still was let on board.' Friends: Miss Boerner, who also owns a smaller pig called Claudette (seen with Hobey), took to My Pet Piggy's Facebook page earlier this year to express her love for Hobey, writing: 'I feel a bit lost without Hobey with us' Prioritizing customers: Mr Kinoian (pictured), who runs My Pet Piggy in Rhode Island, said: 'I think the pig got nervous and went to the bathroom and that caused many passengers to become alarmed and confused' He added that during the encounter the woman was talking to the animal like a human being, calling it a 'jerk' for not behaving. After five or ten minutes, a number of passengers began to complain as the pig got more and more distressed, Mr Phelps said. Once airline staff realized Hobey's presence on the plane was not going to work, the pig and Miss Boerner were led out of the cabin, a US Airways spokesman said. Mr Phelps said that the pig was the only thing the rest of the travelers spoke about the rest of the flight, and he was still laughing about it when he sat down for his turkey on Thursday. Angry: On Friday, Mr Kinoian posted this message to his Facebook page, describing the incident as 'not cool' Having a swim: Miss Boerner is pictured teaching Claudette the smaller pig how to swim in June this year . It remains unclear whether Hobey was a registered emotional support animal, or whether Miss Boerner provided airport staff with official documentation explaining his presence. In 2012 it was revealed that the Department of Transportation had certain guidelines allowing animals, including pot-bellied pigs, could be taken on flights. Along with monkeys and miniature horses, they could be designated as 'Emotional Support'. Transportation officers would have to determine whether the animal is permitted on the plane by running through a list of guidelines. Pigs are favored service animals for people allergic to dogs. Guidelines suggest they are intelligent companions and attuned to dangerous situations. American Airlines, the parent company of US Airways, said the woman had the pig as an emotional support animal and was asked to leave the plane after it became disruptive.

"Passengers headed home after Thanksgiving were met with a line for airport security reportedly more than a mile long. People hoping to fly out of Chicago Midway Sunday morning were left facing a chain which stretched the entire way through the airport terminal then doubled back on itself, on a day where 1,800 flights were delayed nationwide. Those stuck vented their anger at the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and many missed their flights, while slogging through the line which reportedly peaked at 1.2miles. Scroll down for video . Mile-long line: Passengers were stuck in enormous lines snaking through Chicago Midway airport Sunday . Long road to victory: One flier documented her journey during the line's peak, from 6.50am until getting through the gate at 7.30am . Keep on keepin' on: After 20 minutes, this passenger had reached the start of the regular line, and after 31 the gate itself was in sight . Finally: Just over 40 minutes after the first picture, @NessieCakes makes it through to her flight . Frustrated passengers found themselves queuing outside the airport itself, as the thick crowd of people snaked to the train station in front of the terminal. According to the Chicago Aviation Department, the line started early and had subsided by 9.15am. A spokesman said: 'This happens sometimes. There was a period of time earlier this morning, between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m., that lines were long because that is when most people are traveling for the holiday period.' 'This place is absolutely insane. Never seen an airport this busy', tweeted flier Amanda Dahl from the terminal. Another, posting a picture seemingly from inside the train station, said: 'Ever seen this part of Chicago Midway airport? Me neither.' Two long lines could be seen either at either side of a raised tunnel. Midway was not the only airport to be hit by thronging travel demands at the end of the holiday weekend. Nationwide around 3,000 flights were delayed and 190 canceled, according to CNN. Lengthy: The monster line, which left the terminal and snaked back, hit the airport from 6am to 8am . Heaving: Passengers say the intimidatingly long line managed to move quickly, though some did miss flights . Lines: Unimpressed travelers posted pictures of the enormous line this morning, which led some to miss their flight . Out and back again: The chain reportedly reached the train station outside of the terminal, where passengers doubled back to get a space . Fog and wind caused delays at Denver International Airport on Sunday, and 46 incoming flights were diverted to other cities on one of the busiest travel days of the year after bad weather knocked out three of its six runways. Most of the diverted flights landed in Colorado Springs, about 90 miles south. By the afternoon two-hour delays and shrunk to one hour, through departures were also slowing down. A spokesman for Denver Airport said: 'It's not turning out to be the best travel day.' Hold-up: The snaking line had reportedly dispersed by late morning . Clogged up: Travelers reported that the chain went the entire way through the terminal. Pictured is an aerial view of Midway . A cold front that moved through Denver and other cities on Colorado's Front Range helped create the fog, according to the National Weather Service. The temperature dropped 16 degrees in less than 30 minutes at the Denver airport because of the front, while 60 miles north in the city of Greeley, the temperature fell 21 degrees in 20 minutes. The Denver airport expected 166,000 passengers on Sunday and 157,000 on Monday as the Thanksgiving weekend wrapped up. Normally, about 144,000 passengers a day use the airport.

"David Cameron has claimed the fight against Islamist extremism was a 'generational' battle . A shocked David Cameron tonight hit out at the ‘absolutely disgusting, despicable’ murder of US hostage Steven Sotloff, after a video was posted online showing his apparent beheading. It comes just two weeks after an almost identical video was posted online showing the killing of US journalist James Foley. The Prime Minister was addressing Tory MPs in a private meeting in Parliament when gloating ISIS executioners released the footage. At the end of the meeting of the Conservative backbench 1922 committee, Mr Cameron was seen looking at his blackberry before emerging to address journalists. He said: ‘I’ve just seen the news. It is an absolutely disgusting, despicable act.’ The killer is believed to a British jihadist nicknamed ‘John’ by captives who was responsible for the first beheading. In the video he says: ‘I am back, Obama, and I am back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State, because of your insistence on continuing your bombings and ... on Mosul Dam, despite our serious warnings. ‘Just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.’ The extremist also warns other governments against entering ‘this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State’. It comes just 24 hours after Mr Cameron outlined a fresh crack down on extremists returning from the Middle East to wage war on Britain. He told MPs in a Commons statement that police will be given the power to seize the passports of terror suspects trying to join jihadists fighting in Iraq and Syria. He also revealed the Government was considering new powers to force jihadis living in the UK to relocate, while airlines will be compelled to hand over passenger lists before flights take off. New laws will be considered to prevent terrorists returning to 'wreak havoc' on the streets of Britain by removing their citizenship if they are fighting for ISIS abroad. The Prime Minister also admitted the Government would 'continue to consider' what further action Britain could take against the ISIS fighters in the Middle East - including what 'military measures we might take'. Mr Cameron was asked directly if he was 'open to the idea of direct military participation in airstrikes'. He replied: 'I don't rule anything out. I don't think we should.' He added: 'We should consider everything.' The Prime Minister only last week warned that ISIS was now a ‘greater threat to our security’ in Britain than ‘we have seen before’. American journalist Steven Sotloff was murdered by an ISIS extremist, according to a video released online . Mr Sotloff's murder follows the killing of his compatriot James Foley last month . US journalists Steven Sotloff (left) and James Foley (right) were held hostage for years by ISIS fighters looking to ransom them for millions of dollars . Mr Cameron said the first murder was ‘clear evidence, not that any more was needed, that this is not some foreign conflict thousands of miles from home that we can hope to ignore’. He said: ‘The ambition to create an extremist caliphate in the heart of Iraq and Syria is a threat to our own security here in the UK."" The first film showed Mr Foley, 40, who worked for organisations including Agence France-Presse and went missing in Syria in 2012, kneeling in a desert-like environment at an unknown location as an ISIS fighter stands by his side dressed in black and with his face covered. Speaking with an apparently English accent, the killer accused America of ‘aggression towards the Islamic state’, adding: ‘You have plotted against us and gone far out of your way to find reasons to interfere in our affairs. He said further actions in Iraq by America ‘will result in the bloodshed of your people’. Mr Cameron told MPs yesterday that the Government needed to tighten rules monitoring extremists at home and abroad . Mr Cameron said ISIS was trying to carve out a ‘terrorist state’ which posed a greater threat to Britain than al-Qaeda or the Taliban. He said: ‘The ambition to create an extremist caliphate in the heart of Iraq and Syria is a threat to our own security here in the UK.’ Mr Cameron added: ‘What we are facing in Iraq now with Isil (Islamic State) is a greater threat to our security than we have seen before.’","It comes just two weeks after compatriot James Foley was beheaded .

"Revelation: Professor Robert Stavins, said officials representing 'all the main countries and regions of the world' insisted on changes to the report . A top US academic has dramatically revealed how government officials forced him to change a hugely influential scientific report on climate change to suit their own interests. Harvard professor Robert Stavins electrified the worldwide debate on climate change on Friday by sensationally publishing a letter online in which he spelled out the astonishing interference. He said the officials, representing ‘all the main countries and regions of the world’ insisted on the changes in a late-night meeting at a Berlin conference centre two weeks ago. Three quarters of the original version of the document ended up being deleted. Prof Stavins claimed the intervention amounted to a serious ‘conflict of interest’ between scientists and governments. His revelation is significant because it is rare for climate change experts to publicly question the process behind the compilation of reports on the subject. Prof Stavins, Harvard’s Professor of Business and Government, was one of two ‘co-ordinating lead authors’ of a key report published by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) earlier this month. His chapter of the 2,000-page original report concerned ways countries can co-operate to reduce carbon emissions. IPCC reports are supposed to be scrupulously independent as they give scientific advice to governments around the world to help them shape energy policies – which in turn affect subsidies and domestic power bills. Prof Stavins said the government officials in Berlin fought to make big changes to the full report’s ‘summary for policymakers’. This is the condensed version usually cited by the world’s media and politicians. He said their goal was to protect their ‘negotiating stances’ at forthcoming talks over a new greenhouse gas reduction treaty. Prof Stavins told The Mail on Sunday yesterday that he had been especially concerned by what happened at a special ‘contact group’. He was one of only two scientists present, surrounded by ‘45 or 50’ government officials. He said almost all of them made clear that ‘any text that was considered inconsistent with their interests and positions in multilateral negotiations was treated as unacceptable.’ Many of the officials were themselves . climate negotiators, facing the task of devising a new treaty to replace . the Kyoto Protocol in negotiations set to conclude next year. Prof . Stavins said: ‘This created an irreconcilable conflict of interest. It . has got to the point where it would be reasonable to call the document a . summary by policymakers, not a summary for them, and it certainly . affects the credibility of the IPCC. The process ought to be reformed.’ He . declined to say which countries had demanded which changes, saying only . that ‘all the main countries and regions were represented’. Some deletions were made at the insistence of only one or two nations – because under IPCC rules, the reports must be unanimous. He . revealed the original draft of the summary contained a lot of detail on . how international co-operation to curb emissions might work, and how it . could be funded. The final version contains only meaningless headings, . however, with all details removed. IPCC reports are supposed to be scrupulously independent as they give scientific advice to governments around the world to help them shape energy policies - which in turn affect subsidies and domestic power bills . His comments follow a decision two weeks earlier by Sussex University’s Professor Richard Tol to remove his name from the summary of an earlier volume of the full IPCC report, on the grounds it had been ‘sexed up’ by the same government officials and had become overly ‘alarmist’. Prof Stavins’ letter provoked a response from Bob Ward, policy director of the London School of Economics’ Grantham Institute and a fierce critic of those who dissent from climate change orthodoxy. Mr Ward asked on Twitter whether it showed the ‘IPCC government approval process is broken’. Yesterday he admitted the affair showed that ‘the IPCC is not a perfect process, though it’s hard to imagine a better one’. Prof Judith Curry, the head of climate science at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, said that between them, Professors Tol and Stavins had shown the process was ‘polluted by obvious politics’. The IPCC headquarters in Geneva could not be reached for comment. By MAIL ON SUNDAY REPORTER .

Ministers have now withdrawn their promise to guarantee profits for the part of the plant using biomass. This wiped £400million off the company’s share price and prompted the firm to start legal action.

"Rival Star Wars and Doctor Who fans had to be separated by 'the force' after police were called to a fight at a sci-fi convention between the two squabbling groups. The family event, hosted at the University of East Anglia, threatened to head towards the dark side after the dispute erupted between members of Norwich Sci-Fi Club and Norwich Star Wars Club. More than a dozen fans from both groups - including several in fancy dress - were involved in a bitter exchange outside the venue, sparked by the arrival of Jim Poole, treasurer of the Norwich Sci-Fi Club.

'The two rival groups were spoken to and advised to keep out of the way of each other.' The row, which happened on Sunday at . around 2.30pm, dates back to a long-running dispute between Norwich Star . Wars Club and Norwich Sci-Fi Club and the annual events they organise. The animosity had escalated in recent weeks with allegations of offensive posts on social networking sites. Star . Wars organiser Richard Walker, 63, said: 'It has been a long running . saga. We aren’t a club to make waves and we have been going for 14 years . without any problems until the Norwich Sci-Fi Club started making these . demands. 'Mr Poole turned up with his three friends and were admitted because the person on the door did not recognise them.' Star Wars Club secretary Dominic . Warner added: 'We are a Star Wars club and they are mostly Doctor Who. We have our events and they have theirs. All this is very childish.

"The U.S Air . Force’s highly secret unmanned space plane will land in June - ending a year-long mission in orbit. The experimental Boeing X37-B has been circling Earth at 17,000 miles per hour and was due to land in California in December. It is now expected  to land in mid to late June. At launch, the space plane was accompanied by staff in biohazard suits, leading to speculation that there were radioactive components on board. Mystery tour: The mission of the X-37B space plane was extended after it spent nine months orbiting the Earth . The men and women of Team Vandenberg are . ready to execute safe landing operations anytime and at a moment's . notice,' said Colonel Nina Armagno of the U.S. Air Force's Space Wing. The plane resembles a mini space shuttle and is the second to fly in space. It was meant to land in March, but the mission of the X-37B orbital test vehicle was extended – for unknown reasons. The first one landed last December at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California after more than seven months in orbit. The 29-foot, solar-powered craft had an original mission of 270 days. The . Air Force said the second mission was to further test the technology . but the ultimate purpose has largely remained a mystery. The vehicle's systems program director, Lieutenant-colonel Tom McIntyre, told the Los Angeles Times in December: 'We initially planned for a nine-month mission. Keeping the X-37 in orbit will provide . us with additional experimentation opportunities and allow us to extract . the maximum value out of the mission.' Questions: The unmanned space plane is the second of its kind to be sent up by the U.S. Air Force - but its purpose has never fully been explained . Finishing touches: Scientists in protective suits inspect the solar-powered craft prior to its mission . However, many sceptics think that the vehicle's mission is defence or spy-related. There are rumours circulating that the craft has been kept in space to spy on the new Chinese space station, Tiangong. However, analysts have pointed out . that surveillance would be tricky, since the spacecraft would rush . past each other at thousands of metres per second. The top-secret robot plane is now expected to land in mid- to late-June . Keeping watch: An artist's rendition of the X-37B shuttle orbiting the Earth . And Brian Weeden, from the Secure World . Foundation, pointed out to the BBC: ‘If the U.S. really wanted to . observe Tiangong, it has enough assets to do that without using X-37B.’ Last May, amateur astronomers were able to detect the orbital pattern of the first X-37B which . included flyovers of North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, . heightening the suspicion that the vehicle was being used for . surveillance. Other industry analysts have . speculated that the Air Force is just making use of the X-37B’s amazing . fuel efficiency and keeping it in space for as long as possible to show . off its credentials and protect it from budget cuts.

"Speculation that the Duchess of Cambridge is expecting an early birth has been quashed after it emerged that Prince William plans to play in a charity polo match on Sunday, the Mail can reveal. The father-to-be will take part in the game at Cirencester Polo Club in Gloucestershire but he will not be accompanied by his heavily pregnant wife. She will not want to leave her London ‘safety zone’ so close to her due date. Kate herself let slip earlier this year that their baby was due in mid-July, a fact which has since been confirmed by palace officials. Due: Prince William plans to play in a charity polo match on Sunday, scotching rumours of an early arrival for the eagerly-anticipated royal baby. The Prince and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, are pictured last month . In recent weeks there has been increasing speculation, however, that the public had been misled and the new third in line to the throne was due earlier, even though it was vehemently denied by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s spokesman. Now palace aides have confirmed that William has committed to playing in the Jerudong Trophy match at the Cotswolds club this weekend, an annual event which raises thousands of pounds for charities he supports. This was corroborated by another well-placed source, who said the prince had changed his mind several times about whether to attend.  But as of today he was ‘definitely’ confirmed – ‘or as definitely as you can with a baby on the way’, the source joked. William’s decision suggests that he is now more confident that his first-born is not about to make an appearance this week. Sporty: Prince William and Prince Harry are pictured playing in the Jerudong Trophy charity polo match last year . ‘Initially his office said yes, then said no, and have now confirmed that he will be playing,’ the source said. ‘I think he was torn as, clearly, he wants to be with his wife at such an important time, but was all too aware how much the event raises for charities he is passionate about.’ Fortunately the polo ground is a manageable 94 mile, two hour trip - largely on motorway - back to London, should he suddenly receive a call from Kate. In that event, it is likely he will make the journey with a police escort, meaning he could make it back to the capital in little over an hour. Pregnant: Kate herself let slip earlier this year that their baby was due in mid-July . The Duchess is currently dividing her time between their cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace, where she is busy making final preparations for her baby’s birth as well as overseeing the redecoration of their new 20-room apartment in the main building, and her parents’ mansion in Bucklebury, Berkshire. Carole Middleton is likely to be at her daughter’s side should William struggle to make the birth in time. William will be joined at Sunday’s game by his brother, Prince Harry, another able polo player. The two brothers will be raising funds for Child Bereavement UK, which supports families and educates professional when a child dies or when a child is bereaved, and the youth homelessness organisation Centrepoint. William is patron of both charities. They will also be supporting WellChild, another charity of which Harry is patron. A Kensington Palace spokesman confirmed to the Mail that the prince intended to play polo this weekend, unless his wife went into labour. ‘The Duke will play at Cirencester on Sunday if he can and obviously he won't if he can't,’ he said. ‘The charities benefiting are Child Bereavement UK, Centrepoint and WellChild. ‘ . Desperate to be a ‘hands-on’ dad, William has made clear he is determined to make his son or daughter’s birth ‘by hook or by crook’. The Mail revealed earlier today that he even has a helicopter on stand-by in the garden of his Welsh farmhouse this week in case Kate’s waters break while he is on duty as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot. William’s father, Prince Charles, broke royal tradition when he was present at the birth of both his sons. Prince Philip, however, played squash with his friend and private secretary, Michael Parker, while the Queen – then Princess Elizabeth - was in labour with Prince Charles, although he took her champagne and carnations when it was all over.","Father-to-be will take part in game at Cirencester Polo Club .

The middleweight clash had been penciled in for May 2 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas - the same date as Floyd Mayweather Jnr's potential fight with Manny Pacquiao.

'He has to move on and resume his career and we have to lock down an opponent. He's still fighting May 2.' The fight had been expected to reignite the Mexico-Puerto Rico rivalry, one of the oldest in boxing. But this latest development also raises questions over whether Mayweather will indeed fight Pacquiao.

De La Hoya also said that he would only move Alvarez from the May 2 date if Mayweather fights Pacquiao.

"The Duchess of Cambridge's decision to have her mother present when she gives birth was proven to be a good one today as it was revealed that Carole Middleton is trained to help women in labour. The 58-year-old received emergency midwife training at a British Airways training centre in 1976. During the training Carole learned how to cope if a passenger should go into labour while onboard. Call the midwife? No need! Carole Middleton was trained how to cope with passengers going into labour during her air hostess training back in 1976 . Carole attended BA's Cranebank centre in west London in 1976, and learned to cope with a whole host of emergencies. According to OK! magazine's former royal correspondent Marcia Moody, who wrote Kate: A Biography, Carole's training was like 'an antiquated finishing school'. She wrote: 'They were taught how to be good listeners, how to maintain good eye contact and always have a smile on their face. 'Many people commented on how composed the Middletons were at the royal wedding and it struck me that Carole's training provided exactly the right sort of skillset you might need to be a member of the Royal Family. Fully trained: Carole attended BA's Cranebank centre in west London in 1976, and learned to cope with a whole host of emergencies, so could help daughter Kate when she goes into labour . 'I'm sure part of it has rubbed off on Kate.' In a break with royal tradition, . Kate, 31, has said she will not employ a maternity nurse after the . birth. Instead, she will live with her parents for at least the first . six weeks after leaving hospital.

"It was 'very sweet' of Bill to take on her critics, but she doesn't need her husband rushing to her defense when she gets bullied on the political playground, Hillary Clinton told PBS yesterday. 'I don’t need anybody to defend my record. I think my record speaks for itself,'  Hillary said after Bill's remarks yesterday at the annual Clinton Global Initiative America conference. Enough is enough: Hillary says she regrets saying she and Bill were 'dead broke, 'but my unartful use of those few words doesn't change who I am, what I've stood for my entire life, what I stand for today' Thanks but no thanks: Hillary told PBS' Gwen Ifill she doesn't need her political heavyweight husband fighting her battles . At the CGI America event yesterday in Denver, Colorado, Bill Clinton struck back at his wife's critics, telling NBC host David Gregory in an on-stage interview that Hillary is not 'out of touch.' In law school, she advocated for legal assistance . for the poor, and in the '70s she fought for paid leave for new mothers, he said. 'We go to our local grocery store on the weekend. We talk to people in our town. We know what's going on.' The former president was responding to complaints lodged against his wife since she told ABC's Diane Sawyer that she and Bill were 'dead broke' when they left the White House in 2001 and in debt. 'We . had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece . together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's . education,' Hillary told Sawyer in an interview earlier this month. 'You know, it was not easy.' Republican . National Committee Chair Reince Priebus pounced on Hillary's comments immediately after the interview. 'This is outrageous,' he tweeted. 'How out of . touch is Hillary Clinton when ""dead broke"" = mansions & massive . speaking fees?' Bill told Gregory yesterday, 'It is factually true that we were several million dollars in debt.' 'Someone is always trying to change the subject,' he said of people making attacks on he and his wife's finances. Republicans promptly criticized Bill as out of touch, too, pointing out that Clintons live in a wealthy neighborhood in New York. The people they talk to on the weekends from their town are most likely rich like them. 'The Clintons have lived in a 1 percent bubble for so long, their . experience has become warped, and that’s a major problem in a . presidential campaign,' America Rising PAC Executive Director Tim Miller told The Hill. 'The couple’s home is in Chappaqua, . N.Y.' By the time Bill did an interview with Bloomberg Television today, he had effectively been put back in his place by his wife. Asked about Hillary's 2016 plans, Bill told Bloomberg TV's Willow Bay, 'I don’t know, but I’m for whatever she wants to do. 'If . she were to run and become president, the last thing she needs is for . me to be under foot,' he said. 'She’s the ablest public servant I’ve . ever known.' Bill insisted . that if he were back in the White House, he'd mind his own business and . wouldn't attempt to stick his nose where it doesn't belong. He would only get involved in White House affairs, he said, if his wife requested him to. 'I . would help. Whatever I was asked to do, I would do. I believe -- just . like I do for President Obama, just like I did for President Bush. I . think that’s -- you’ve been a former president, you need to show up when . you’re summoned,' he said. In her PBS interview Hillary admitted saying she and Bill were 'dead broke' was a mistake but said the misstep shouldn't negate the time she's spent championing the causes of the less fortunate. 'I shouldn’t have said the five or so words that I said, but my unartful use of those few words doesn’t change who I am, what I’ve stood for my entire life, what I stand for today,' she said. 'Bill and I have had terrific opportunities, both of us, you know, have worked hard, but we’ve been grateful for everything that we’ve been able to achieve, and sadly that’s just not true for most Americans today.' Clinton proceeded to tell Ifill about the plight of middle class Americans and recounted her 'long record' of fighting for the downtrodden before accusing naysayers of trying to 'take things out of context or try to create some caricature' of her that's not accurate. When Ifill interrupted her to point out the similarities between the way she's being portrayed by Republicans to the way Democrats castigated 2012 Republican presidential nominee and wealthy businessman Mitt Romney, Clinton shut her down. 'That’s a . false equivalency,' she said. 'People can judge me for what I’ve done.' 'So I’m fully comfortable . with who I am, what I stand for and what I’ve always stood for,' she said.","In an interview with ABC that aired earlier this month Hillary Clinton said she and her husband Bill were 'dead broke' when they departed the White House in 2001 .

"Deontay Wilder, having taken the hallowed WBC heavyweight belt back to America on Muhammad Ali’s 73rd birthday, is ready to give Tyson Fury a shot at the world title. The big man from Alabama is even willing to bring that gift to England. Be careful how you unwrap it, Tyson. Think Trojan horses. Wilder is the most dangerous US heavyweight since Mike Tyson and is being hailed as the giant most likely to end the Klitschko domination of the ring’s marquee division. Deontay Wilder saw off Bermane Stiverne to be crowned WBC heavyweight champion on Saturday . Wilder was untroubled for large parts of the fight but when he was caught, showed he could take a punch . Wilder runs to the ropes to celebrate after the final bell (left) and shows off his new WBC heavyweight belt . After massively outpointing the first Haitian-born heavyweight champ, Bermane Stiverne, in Las Vegas on Saturday night, Wilder said: ‘I want Fury next, then Wladimir Klitschko for all the other titles by the end of this year. 'Me and Tyson would be one helluva fight. We’re both big punchers and entertainers. 'I would love to do it in the UK, where I’ve always enjoyed my visits. No problem for me.’ Those trips to Britain are reported to have included the occasional flattening of David Haye in sparring. Wilder had also knocked out all 32 of his opponents prior to this weekend inside four rounds. But it is the composed, complete style of his 12-round outclassing of Stiverne which heralds the prospect of a genuine all-American hero. Wilder worked so effectively behind a ramrod jab, with such mobility and such variety of follow-up punching, that he represents a real threat to Klitschko who, like the new champion, stands just two inches shorter than Fury at 6ft 7in. Tyson Fury (right) - who Wilder wants to fight next - easily beat Derek Chisora in a world title bout in November . Wladimir Klitschko's last bout ended with a fifth-round knockout win over Kubrat Pulev in November 2014 . Fury became the WBO mandatory challenger to multiple alphabelt champion Klitschko when he stopped Dereck Chisora late last year. But the younger of the two brothers is in negotiations to face another American, Bryant Jennings, in New York this April. There is also talk of Klitschko switching to Wilder for that date, perhaps in the hope of catching him before he benefits from more experience of the big time. If Wilder goes on to prove himself the first Real Deal since Evander Holyfield, this Bronze Bomber could be the saviour of heavyweight boxing. Wilder v Fury this spring, the winner against Klitschko in late summer, the loser versus Joshua in the autumn — now there’s a schedule to reinvigorate the hardest old game. Meanwhile, Wilder’s 33rd straight win will surely have brought a smile to Ali’s face if he was well enough to tune in upon his return home from hospital. It has also put paid to Don King’s amusing but nonsensical notion of dragging Mike Tyson out of retirement to fight Stiverne. All in all, a good Saturday night’s work.","Deontay Wilder is eyeing more success after his points win over Bermane Stiverne on Saturday night at the MGM Grand Garden Arena .
The 29-year-old became the first American in nine years to win a heavyweight world title .
Next up Wilder wants to face Tyson Fury - who remains unbeaten in his professional career thus far .

"A mother-of-nine who claims £38,000 a year in handouts who has slammed benefit slobs for giving large families like hers a 'bad name' wants a bigger house for her family. Cheryl Prudham says she and her husband Robert both work part-time, so they should be entitled to a larger property for them and their children. She admits her huge brood were not especially planned because she and her husband do not like using contraception. The couple rake in a total tax free income of £53,000-a-year - the equivalent of an £80,000 gross annual salary - of which 70 per cent comes from benefits. Cheryl and Robert Prudham pictured with their nine children. The mother says her family are need a bigger home because their current one is too cramped . But the couple claim they are entitled to a bigger council house - because they both work part-time. Cheryl, of Sittingbourne, Kent, yesterday said: 'I see other people in the paper and it makes me sick. They shouldn't just get a new home handed to them on a plate. 'It gives people with big families a bad name. I don't want people to judge us because we have so many children. 'If I sat on my a*** I would understand people would have something to say. We would probably earn more on benefits. 'You see stories about people getting bigger houses and never working a day in their life and it makes people with big families look bad. Cheryl Prudham, pictured with her daughters Caitlin, eight and Masie, seven, says her family can't scrape together the £1,000-a-month rent on a larger private property, but she has since booked a family trip to Menorca . 'You wouldn't keep animals in the confined space we live in. It's cruel and I don't think we're getting the help we're entitled to.' She added: 'In the past I have been on contraception but I got pregnant with the coil and the pill just doesn't settle well with me. 'We don't use condoms and me and Rob have never talked about it. 'I did rely on benefits before but I am motivated to be more than a mother.' And she admitted: 'I was surprised by the cost of our kids in the end.' Cheryl had her first son George, 13, when she was just 17 and was living in a homeless hostel in Kent in the summer of 2000. She soon moved into a flat with her ex-boyfriend and had second son, Jack, 12, and her eldest daughter Caitlin, eight. But the unemployed mum then had three unplanned pregnancies Maisie, seven, Lillie, five, and Madison, four. According to Mrs Prudham, her children, who are aged between nine months and 13, are too cramped in their current house, above . In March 2009 she met current husband Rob and they had Leon, now three. They then had Lenny, now two, before completing the family with daughter Lainey in January this year. Cheryl says her husband has always worked doing temporary jobs in a bid to provide for her family. She has now started working 20 hours per week a week as a carer and says this should entitle her to a bigger house. Neither pays any income tax because their earnings fall below the minimum threshold. Cheryl admits her family live 'comfortably' but can't scrape together the £1,000-a-month rent on a larger private property. The family currently live in a three-bed terraced home, which means their four girls are left to sleep in two bunk beds in the property's largest room. The family currently live in a three-bed terraced home, which means their four girls are left to sleep in two bunk beds in the property's largest room . Two-year-old Lenny sleeps in a cot in the middle while the three eldest boys are crammed into a box room. That leaves Cheryl and Rob sleeping in the only other bedroom with their infant daughter Lainey. A tight kitchen means there is no room for a dinner table and the youngest children are made to eat their food on the floor. Cheryl said: 'I know it's possible to have two houses knocked through into one big house because I've read they do that for people. 'I know by having nine children I've put myself in this situation, but I can't live like it anymore. I thought I could, but I can't. 'Realistically, we're not going to find anything bigger than four bedrooms. 'But even an extra bedroom would make the world of difference. It's depressing for me, and the kids argue all the time because there's no space to play.' Families in the county can bid for council homes through Kent Homechoice which works alongside Kent County Council. A spokesman for the housing association has now said they were 'working with the resident' in a bid to resolve the situation. He said: 'We're working with the resident to assist with her situation. We've very few four bedroom homes, so they rarely become available. 'It's also rare for adjacent properties to become empty, allowing us to create ""super-size"" homes.'","Cheryl and Robert Prudham say they deserve a bigger house because they both work part-time to support their huge brood .

More . than two years before the next presidential election, GOP officials . have sought to undermine Hillary Clinton's standing with working-class . families who have been supportive of the family's political campaigns in . the past.

'For . those who don't get a college education or even high school, most doors . just won't open, no matter how hard they knock,' the former first lady . said. A longtime child . advocate, Clinton also announced projects aimed at promoting brain . development and literacy for babies and toddlers. The . event took on the air of a Clinton alumni association, with several . former members of Clinton's White House team in attendance, including . former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and former Clinton economic . adviser Gene Sperling. An . afternoon news conference put Mr Clinton alongside longtime labor . allies such as AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka and Randi Weingarten, . president of the American Federation of Teachers union. Yet . even in a roomful of Clinton admirers, the debate got spirited at . times.

You declared the era of big government over,' Fiorina said. 'Yeah, but I didn't declare the era of weak government that had nobody at home at the SEC before the financial crisis,' Clinton said to roars of approval, referencing complaints that the Securities and Exchange Commission failed to effectively police Wall Street.

"Gangsters who planted a hand grenade in the bushes outside Kenny Dalglish's home were jailed for life today, ending a merciless campaign of violence across the north of England. The gang of five, led by Kirk Bradley and Anthony 'Fat Tony' Downes, both 26, was responsible for numerous shootings across Liverpool, a kidnapping in which they shot their victim and dumped him in woods and a string of bungled assassination attempts. But their weapon of choice was more often the hand grenade whether they were carrying out their own violent vendettas against rival crooks, or doing the dirty work for unscrupulous kingpins within Liverpool's criminal underworld. Jailed in absentia: Left, Anthony 'Fat Tony' Downes, 26, was recaptured in Amsterdam on Friday after a daring prison van escape, and right, Kirk Bradley, 26, received 22 years despite him not being in police custody . Grenade gang: Gary Wilson, 27, (left) was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years while Joseph Farrell, 23, (right) will serve a minimum of 12 years . Downes and Bradley were convicted in absentia having gone on the run following a daring prison van escape before their trial. Downes, who was described in court as the gang's 'chief executive' and known in criminal circles as 'Fat Tony', was snared by police in the Netherlands on Friday and will be flown to the UK soon to begin serving his time. But Bradley remains at large. At Woolwich Crown Court, they were both jailed for life with a minimum of 22 years after being convicted in their absence of conspiracy to possess firearms with intent to endanger life and conspiracy to cause damage with intent to endanger life. Thug: Craig Riley, 25, will serve a minimum of 14 years . Three others admitted possessing firearms and causing criminal damage with intent to endanger life and were jailed for life. Gary Wilson, 27, of Southport was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years; Joseph Farrell, 23, of Brandearth Hey in Stockbridge Village, Knowsley, will serve a minimum of 12 years and Craig Riley, 25, of Boode Croft, also in Stockbridge Village, will serve a minimum of 14 years. The gang carried out shootings and grenade attacks and operated on behalf of others in the Liverpool underworld. The grenade was left on Mr Dalglish’s front wall in July 2009, when he was not Liverpool’s manager, but it was not intended for him. Between 2009 and 2010 Bradley and Downes, who described themselves as blood brothers, ran their network but did not get their hands dirty with the numerous shootings and bombings they ordered. Downes was serving a seven year jail stretch for multiple attacks on cash machines but was the 'chief executive controlling and organising events from his prison cell,' said the judge Mr Justice Henriques. The gang carried out shootings and grenade attacks and operated on behalf of others in the Liverpool underworld. The grenade was left on Mr Dalglish’s front wall in July 2009, when he was not the five-time European cup winner’s manager, and it was not intended for him. It was believed to be intended for wealthy businessman John Ball who was also the target of two shootings and a neighbour of Mr Dalglish. Mr Ball hired a security guard to keep watch on his home in Selworthy Road, Southport, following attacks in March and June 2009. Close call: The grenade was left on Mr Dalglish’s front wall in July 2009, when he was not the five-time European cup winner’s manager, and it was not intended for him . The grenade was left on the wall by one of two men who ran off when police arrived - but another was arrested. Between 2009 and 2010 Bradley and Downes, who described themselves as blood brothers, ran their network but did not get their hands dirty with the numerous shootings and bombings they ordered. Downes was serving a seven year jail stretch for multiple attacks on cash machines but was the 'chief executive controlling and organising events from his prison cell,' said the judge Mr Justice Henriques. When he was arrested last week in Goes, Zeeland, he was checking into holiday accommodation but was caught with a loaded .44 Magnum revolver and two fake passports. Menace: An Uzi sub machine gun and silencer left by the gang following a shooting . The judge said of Bradley, who was convicted of robbery aged 15: 'Bradley is plainly a very dangerous man. 'There is a serious risk to members of the public of serious harm being occasioned by him of further specified offences.' He added: 'Any right-thinking member of the public would feel abhorrence and outrage at this merciless campaign which Bradley oversaw and co-managed.' Their other crimes involved shooting another man in a pub; spraying a victim's house with bullets, gunning down a man because he ejected gatecrashing troublemakers from a party as well as various grenade attacks. Between June 2008 and March 2010 there were only seven hand grenade explosions in the UK - but five were in Merseyside. One of those was launched into the home of a man targeted by the gang. He was asleep upstairs with his partner and two children when the gang struck - he later told police the bomb 'blew the place to bits'. 'It was remarkable no one was injured,' said Mr Justice Henriques. The judge described Wilson as Downes’s 'right hand man, furnishing him with information and receiving instructions from him'. There were more than 1,000 phone calls between them, investigators found. 'You were a most important cog in the workings of this conspiracy,' the judge told him. Dangerous: A Browning revolver left in a cab by the gang following a raid . Co-accused Riley, who has previously served four years for possessing Class A drugs with intent to supply, was a 'highly significant' gang member who played a part in several attacks and was responsible for moving around an Uzi machine pistol the thugs owned. Farrell admitted providing a firearm for the shooting of two men and providing another gun used to spray a house with bullets. Referring to the tragic murder of schoolboy Rhys Jones in 2007 who was caught in the crossfire of a Liverpool gang war, Mr Justice Henriques said: 'Merseyside has learned the hard way when it comes to stray bullets.'","Gang of five sentenced to prison terms ranging from 12-22 years .

"A man dressed as a clown bearing a striking resemblance to the notorious film monster Pennywise is spooking residents by posing late at night around a town and waving at passers-by. The figure has been spotted in full clown attire around Northampton - and one woman claimed he offered to paint her windowsills after knocking on her front door, despite having no equipment on him. There is no explanation for the appearances by the clown - who bears a striking resemblance to the demonic character played by British actor Tim Curry in the 1990 horror film Stephen King’s It.

"This weekend sees the return of one of Britain’s finest – WBA super-bantamweight world champion Scott Quigg. I’m a fight fan and one of the bouts I would love to watch is Quigg against Carl Frampton. Like other fight fans, I also want to drive the politics out of this sport and make it happen because after this weekend’s test, when Quigg faces a tough defence against Tshifhiwa Munyai, I want to make a huge fight for him. We are already in discussions with the likes of Leo Santa Cruz, the WBC world champion, and Kiko Martinez, the IBF champion, because Quigg will move on to a great fight, whether it involves Frampton or not. For fight fans: Scott Quigg (right) and Carl Frampton (left) is a bout boxing's faithful deserve to see happen . In defence: Tshifhiwa Munyai (right) is on a four-fight winning run and is a possible banana ski for Quigg . I am doing what I can behind the scenes. After increasing my substantial offer to Frampton at the end of last year, we are still no closer. That is because of the politics of boxing and they have a habit of cropping up. Don’t get me wrong, I’m blessed to be in a job like this but it does have a tendency to kick you in the nuts. The rollercoaster of matchmaking meant that Quigg’s original opponent for this next fight, Venezuela’s Nehomar Cermeno, pulled out. He had visa issues which required a trip to his embassy and a submission of fingerprints, which he failed to do. We looked at various options within the WBA rankings and Munyai looked a good, credible fight. He was already in the country because he has been sparring with Martin Ward. He has looked devastating on his other fights here, including stopping Martin Power twice for the Commonwealth bantamweight title and he also stopped Lee Haskins. He has also won an IBO world title and is on a four-fight winning streak. He is dangerous and awkward, a complete style change to Cermeno. That is a massive test for Scott, challenging his intelligence and his training to see if he can adapt accordingly. It is a potential banana skin. This is a sterner test than Cermeno. In terms of what will happen if Quigg comes through this, I am considering the options. I understand that Frampton’s agreement with another broadcaster restricts him from fighting on Sky. That’s the politics we talk about in this sport. I will do what I can to make it happen. Frampton has talked about options we would request - not true. As a voluntary challenger, I would be willing to have just a rematch clause and, if Frampton beat Quigg, we would do the rematch in Belfast. So, what is the problem? It’s a chance for both fighters to make huge money and a fight that the British public want to see. Alternatives: Spain's Kiko Martinez - along with Leo Santa Cruz - are other possible Quigg opponents . I don’t think for one minute that Frampton is afraid – both these guys are warriors. I just want to get it done. This is a chance for both to make a huge amount of money in a division where there are not many big-money fights. Frampton has his eyes on Santa Cruz, who has just had his mandatory defence. I don’t believe Santa Cruz will fight him next, or even this year. As it happens, we are talking with Santa Cruz ourselves about a fight and I think it’s more likely he will have a unification bout with Quigg than a fight with Frampton. Where does that leave Frampton? I think there will come a point where Team Frampton need to look at what is out there and, if they want it, there is a shot at Quigg’s title waiting for them. I am sick of these great fights not happening so I am on a mission to make this one go ahead. A fair bit has happened since my last column – we signed James DeGale. Just a few years ago his profile was huge, but I think he has fallen off the radar since he lost that tight decision against George Groves. He is what I call a buzz fighter – he is someone who needs his mojo to be firing and needs a crowd to perform. I think fighting in front of small crowds just wasn’t giving him that buzz. Let’s see how he likes 80,000 at Wembley. James has a real tough test in Brandon Gonzales and, if he comes through that, he will fight the winner of Froch and Groves. Motivation won’t be a problem for him. Bring back the buzz: James DeGale will have no problems finding motivation when he fights at Wembley . Mojo sapper: DeGale (right) may not have fully found his potential since that close points loss to Groves (right) We’ve had some good news. I can confirm we have an extra 20,000 tickets for Froch-Groves and I will announce next week how you can buy them. It will be one of the most spectacular events in boxing history. Great expectations: An extra 20,000 tickets will be released to see Carl Froch and George Groves at Wembley . Rematch: Groves lands a left on Froch's chin in his controversial loss in Manchester in November last year . Anthony Crolla fights John Murray in Manchester on Saturday on the undercard of Quigg-Munyai. What a fight. It is a city divided – Crolla from the red side and Murray from the blue side. Crolla is on a great run and is almost ready for a world title fight and Murray is on his way back. What has Murray got left? He looks in better shape than ever. And I believe Crolla is hugely under-rated on the world stage – he may look like a male model and be one of the nicest guys in the sport, but I think you will see a spiteful edge from Anthony in this one. Manchester derby: The undercard for Quinn-Munyai features locals Anthony Crolla and John Murray . These two used to work each other’s corner but I am starting to notice a bit of needle. This could be a special fight and I can’t call it either way. I like the idea of Ricky Burns eventually fighting the winner. Roll on Saturday. Speaking of Burns, I am looking at getting him back out on June 27 in Glasgow. I am looking at the WBC route and ultimately a shot at their champion, Omar Figueroa. We will pick an opponent who will put us in position for him. Javier Prieto is a fight I am looking at – we have made them an offer and Scottish fans can expect a great card – with another big domestic clash made yesterday. Watch this space. Next challenge: Ricky Burns could face the winner of Crolla and Murray, but Omar Figueroa is the ultimate aim . Four hours and 10 minutes for the marathon. I’m in bits.","Scott Quigg and Carl Frampton is a fight I and fight fans want to see .

"Oscar Pistorius was reportedly messaging glamour model Katie Price during his trial for the culpable homicide of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Price wrote in her Now magazine column in March that she was 'not going to judge Oscar on other people's theories portrayed via the media' and that 'we are all equal when it comes to judicial undertakings'. A month later, Pistorius started following Price on Twitter and messaging her, report the Daily Mirror.

'He was direct messaging me during the case. It’s weird, isn’t it? He was saying, ""Thanks for the support,"" and stuff. Just all general chit-chat,' Price told the paper's 3am column. 'Because I mentioned him in my column, he was referencing that. I wasn’t exactly supporting him, but everyone who goes through a trial will be the only one who knows what really happened.' Price, who was alerted to the messages by her brother, said she would love to interview the South African, who was sentenced to five years in jail last week after he shot Steenkamp through a toilet door at his home on Valentine's Day last year.

"Dereck Chisora wants to make amends for his ugly brawl with veteran American heavyweight Kevin Johnson by fighting Alexander Povetkin in Moscow this April. London’s Del Boy has asked promoter Frank Warren to lure Povetkin into the fight by offering the Russian home advantage. Be careful what you wish for, Dereck. Be careful about granting that wish, Frank. Slugfest: Dereck Chisora (right) lands a big right hand during his win against Kevin Johnson on Saturday night . Unconvincing: Chisora admitted afterwards that he was 'gutted' by his performance in the ring . Povetkin is not the best heavyweight on the planet but he is dangerous enough to place in jeopardy the final eliminator for a challenge to Wladimir Klitschko’s WBO title, towards which Chisora and Tyson Fury are supposed to be on collision course this summer. Chisora persevered for a lop-sided points win over Johnson and was man enough, also, to admit that he was ‘gutted’ by the deficiencies in his own performance. Raggedly though he boxed, Chisora was able to overwhelm the ageing Johnson with the non-stop aggression which is the most obvious benefit of his rededication to the rigours of the prize-ring.But Povetkin is younger, hungrier and as high on work-rate as Chisora. His only defeat was to Klitschko himself and of his 26 victories 18 have been inflicted by knockout.Nor is it all likely that Chisora would get away in Moscow with all the rabbit punches to which British referee Terry O’Connor mostly turned a blind eye in the Copper Box at London’s Olympic Park on Saturday night. It is not beyond Del Boy to come home from Moscow with a win but this fight would be no stroll in Gorky Park. There is a lot of money to be made fighting in Russia these days, if perhaps not quite as much as for a slugfest with Fury at a London football ground. So although Chisora is still talking of how ‘me and Tyson will still get it on in mid-summer,’ he may be calculating that a spectacular KO of Povetkin could fast-track him straight to Klitschko.If that were to happen, Tyson really would be Furious. The Manchester giant fulfilled his part of the elimination bargain by knocking out US journeyman Joey Abell in the co-feature at the Copper Box and is scheduled to return there for another tune-up on April 11. He has been expecting Chisora to do the same. That way they could monitor each other’s progress -  Chisora in re-sharpening his skills, Fury in shedding the surplus poundage. In . the process of getting fight-fit again Chisora seems to have mislaid . his jab and become reliant on round-house swings to the back of the . head. It's a knockout: Tyson Fury (right) beat Joey Abell in a comfortable return to the ring . Very heavyweight: Fury was visibly carrying excess baggage during his fight at the Copper Box . While kept out of action for almost a year by David Haye’s double withdrawal from their big-money showdown, Fury has put on too much weight even for his 6ft 9in frame. He came in on Saturday at nigh-on 20 stones, a career high. That was OK for a KO against Abell in . four slam-bang rounds but when it comes to more threatening opposition . he needs the motivation to hone down to the 18 stones at which he beat . Chisora in their first encounter. Fury . is a true entertainer and Chisora can exude menace. But if they do . complete the elimination journey then whichever of them goes on to . challenge Klitschko needs to do so in prime physical condition and razor . sharp. Risky business: Alexander Povetkin (right) would represent a seriously tough test for Chisora . Khan still on course for Mayweather megafight . Speculation continues to swirl like wild fires in California about Floyd Mayweather’s next fight, for which Amir Khan has signed a contract to meet the world’s pound-for-pound king on May 3. But one piece of conjecture, at least, has been doused by Richard Schaefer, chief executive of Golden Boy whose job it is to oversee the organisation of Mayweather’s mega-million-dollar nights on the Las Vegas Strip. Rumour had it that either Khan or Marcos Maidana – who the British fighter has already beaten in the ring, and who was also in Mayweather’s Twitter poll to let the fans choose his next opponent - would step down to meet Adrien Broner on the same bill. Who's your Money on? Amir Khan is in pole position to fight Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas on May 3 . Bone shuddering: Khan rocks Marcos Maidana during his win over the Argentine in December 2011 . Schaefer says: ‘No, not all. I am waiting on Floyd but have a pretty good idea what’s going to happen and what the undercard will look like.’ For Khan, the long wait goes on and he is pondering a quick trip to Vegas from his training camp near San Francisco this week to seek confirmation. Froch and Groves rematch has already started... in words . George Groves and Carl Froch are both claiming victory in the wars of words and negotiations which are preceding their much-anticipated rematch on May 31. No surprise there. It was exactly the same prior to their first world super-middleweight title fight. Groves says he has forced Froch to meet him a second time, with the help of soaring public demand. Froch says he is doing this for the public, as well as to ‘stop Groves whining’ about the premature way he was stopped last year. No love lost: Geroge Groves (left) and Carl Froch (right) will go toe-to-toe again - after plenty more fighting talk . Jaw-dropping: Groves (right) lands a punch on Froch during their first fight in November last year . Whatever the reason, the public to whom they both refer are the winners.

"Just looking at the photograph is enough to make you feel queasy. So spare a thought for the poor passengers inside this ferry, pictured as it battled through a violent storm off the Sussex coast. And perhaps spare a thought for the photographer too who was also at sea during the rough seas. Stormy seas: David Lyons' black and white image of a ferry, with passengers on board, leaving Newhaven harbour, East Sussex, in a violent storm won the Your View category in the Take A View - Landscape Photographer Of The Year Awards . Top prize: This beautiful image, called Mist And Reflections taken on Crummock Water, Cumbria, by Tony Bennett was the overall winner of the competition . David Lyons captured the dramatic black and white image of the vessel as it left Newhaven harbour in East Sussex. It shows the ferry, barely visible through mist and spray, being pummelled by huge waves. The striking photograph was declared the winner of the Your View category in the Take A View Landscape Photographer Of The Year Awards. The overall winner was an image of mists drifting across a still English lake on an autumn morning. Derbyshire-based photographer Tony Bennett captured the poignant image of Crummock Water in Cumbria through his camera lens.

The image, dubbed Mists And Reflections, earned Mr Bennett £10,000 prize money. Mr Bennett said capturing moments like the one he did was what drew him to photography. 'Every second the scene was changing, creating a hundred memorable images but this moment particularly caught my attention,' he said.'The still night mist began rolling and tumbling, as if in protest, as the heat of the sun vapourised and dispersed it forever.'

"An alarming number of young women are misinformed when it comes to contraception, according to new research. Bayer HealthCare have released results from a survey of 1,500 British women aged 25-34 that reveals a number of myths continue to exist around family planning. The survey suggests that better communication may be needed during GP consultations to help women understand the variety of contraceptive options available, with only 58 percent of women saying their doctor had explored all options with them. Oh, baby: Many young women are risking unwanted pregnancies due to a lack of awareness on contraception . Many of the women were risking an unwanted pregnancy as one in 10 believed it's impossible to get pregnant during their period. Meanwhile if condoms weren't available, a quarter had heard of faith being put in 'alternative' barrier methods such as cling film, latex gloves or even a plastic sandwich bags. Meanwhile, 17 per cent of women had relied on the withdrawal method in the past. As a result of using no or insufficient protection, 30 per cent had needed to take the morning after pill. Despite recent scares over the increased risk of blood clots when taking some contraceptive pills, the Pill remained the most popular method of contraception, as four out of five of the women surveyed had taken it at some point and nearly half (48 per cent) said it is their most regular form of contraception. But results indicated that some may be selecting the Pill as a 'default' option due to low awareness of alternative methods. Nearly a third of women had never heard of the hormonal implant, 27 per cent had not heard of the contraceptive injection and more than a third were unfamiliar with the intrauterine system (IUS or 'hormonal coil') and the intrauterine device (IUD or 'copper coil'). Unsafe sex: An alarming number of women had heard of household goods like sandwich bags being used when condoms weren't available . Default option: Many women are using the Pill because they don't know enough about alternatives . Just under half of women did not realise that intrauterine methods are placed in the womb and can be removed at any time. Of the 15 per cent who had considered using an intrauterine method but decided against it, nearly one in five had done so due to a lack of information. Dr Diana Mansour, consultant in community gynaecology and reproductive healthcare at Newcastle Upon Tyne, said: 'The healthcare professional has an important role to play in ensuring that all contraceptive options are discussed with women, including Long-acting Reversible Contraceptions (LARCs), which offer convenience and reliability as women do not need to think about taking them every day. 'Many women might be surprised to hear that LARCs are more effective in practice than user-dependent methods such as the Pill and have a number of additional lifestyle benefits. 'Despite many women expressing clear preferences for the qualities associated with LARC, use of these methods is low and women could be selecting the Pill merely as a default option.' You can't get pregnant while on your period . The withdrawal method is a fool proof method of contraception . You can't get pregnant if you have sex standing up . Contraception…that's basically just the Pill . Household items make great barrier methods . Cola is an effective spermicide . Long acting reversible contraceptives can't be removed . With awareness of LARC methods so low, it's unsurprising that only 36 percent of women surveyed had ever tried a LARC method and less than 1 in 10 had tried an intrauterine method. This is despite expressing clear preferences for features associated with LARC methods: 77 percent of women said they would like a method they did not need to think about regularly and 67 percent would prefer a contraceptive to last several years. Additional knowledge gaps and misconceptions identified in the survey concerned the use of certain LARC methods in specific groups of women. For example, nearly half of women did not know whether an IUD, an IUS or an implant can be used in younger women or whether it can be used in women who have not had children. Some were also unclear about when fertility would return and many thought that it would take several months. However, fertility returns to the women's usual level within a matter of weeks with all these methods. Natika Halil, director of health and wellbeing at sexual health charity FPA, said: 'This research highlights some important knowledge gaps and misconceptions that continue to exist around contraception. 'At FPA, our aim is to encourage positive conversations between women and healthcare professionals to ensure that all methods are communicated and any myths are accurately dispelled. Greater awareness of all the available options, including LARC, could not only help to reduce rates of unintended pregnancy, but also help women in search of a contraceptive that could suit their needs more than the method they may be using.' The FPA have information on all methods of contraception on their website and have a tool where users can identify which would suit them best, visit www.fpa.org.uk .","1,500 British women aged 25-34 were quizzed on contraception .

"Arrest: Laura Elizabeth Whitehurst, 28, allegedly had sex with three high school students . A third former student has stepped forward . to claim he had a sexual relationship with a teacher who has been . arrested for having a baby with one of her 16-year-old students. The latest victim was just 14 when he allegedly had sex with Laura Elizabeth Whitehurst, then 23, in her classroom before school, as well as her apartment and in her car in 2007. The teacher, now 28, was arrested on Monday in Redlands, California after she gave birth to a baby allegedly fathered by a student, who is now 17, last month. She met the student while acting as his adviser at Citrus Valley High School and they allegedly had a year-long relationship. She was released on Monday night after posting bail. After reports of her arrest surfaced, another student stepped forward to claim he had sex with Whitehurst in 2007 when he was a 16-year-old student in her English class at Redlands High School. The victim, who identified himself to NBC4 as 22-year-old Michael Cooper, said the class had been told to write about their dreams and afterwards, Whitehurst told him she had dreamed of kissing him during a school field trip. 'I didn't have anything to say . really,' he said. 'I was like, ""Oh really, that's crazy,"" and a couple . of days later, we ended up actually kissing.' With child: Whitehurst, 28, gave birth to a baby last month who was allegedly fathered by a student, aged 16 . He . said that they kissed in her classroom and two weeks later, she invited him to her apartment and . he spent the night. They . continued to have sex a few times a month but he said he never felt as . if they were in a relationship, but when they contacted each other, they . both knew what was going to happen, he said. 'When . it happens, you're kind of like, . all right, this is pretty badass,' he said. 'You know, my teacher is . into me. I was 17 and I was having a good time is what it was. 'I didn't feel like a victim; I'm not . scarred for life or anything. To be honest, I had a . good time when it was going on.' But . in spring 2008, he said he stopped returning the teacher's messages and . calls as he had a girlfriend and had started to feel guilty. They . eventually broke the relationship off amicably, he said. He added that he did not get preferential treatment in class because of their relationship. 'Former flame': Michael Cooper, now 22, said he had sex with the teacher when he was just 16. He said that she told him she had dreamed about kissing him and they later had sex at her home . 'Lovers': Images show Cooper, then 16, and Whitehurst, then 23, at the time of their 'relationship' in 2007 . Cooper . has filed a police report but told authorities he does not wish to . press charges. He told NBC4 that he wanted to share his story to . encourage other victims to come forward.

"A Chinese care worker cut off four patients' testicles because they didn't share their meatball stew with him, it has been claimed. Wang Fan, 46, who was described as mentally disabled, was given a job helping to feed and clean at the care home in north-eastern China's Heilongjiang Province. Although he was not paid, he was given a place to sleep and was allowed to eat the food left over after the patients had been fed. Medical staff treat two of the patients whose testicles were cut off during an attack by their care worker . However, he was apparently furious after the patients were given a meatball casserole and ate the lot, meaning there was none left over for the hungry care worker. Furious at the treatment, he had extracted revenge on four of the patients in his care before he was finally discovered and stopped by other staff. Police said that he tied down the men and used a razor blade to cut off their testicles in the attack at the end of last week. Victim Chi Liang, 62, said: 'I thought he was tying me down because of some medical procedure but then I realised actually something was wrong and I yelled and screamed, but nobody came.' Recovering: One of the patients who was attacked by his care worker in China's Heilongjiang Province . Liang and another man, aged 70, lost both their testicles and two others, aged 81 and 53, lost one testicle each. Police said that the attacker had been drinking and added that he had reportedly planned to cook and eat the testicles, which as well as being food he also thought had medicinal properties. The case has illustrated poor management at some of China's nursing homes, which are troubled by insufficient funding and personnel despite rising demand from an ageing population.

"Shooter: Police have identified Michelet Polynice, 33, seen from a previous arrest, as the gunman who allegedly shot three women early Thursday morning at two Orlando hotels . Two women are dead and a third in critical condition after a crazed gunman, allegedly seeking revenge on his ex-girlfriend for taking out a restraining order, launched shooting attacks in two hotels in Orlando. Police in Central Florida say Michelet Polynice, 33, fatally shot himself after a short pursuit by police that ended dramatically on Thursday morning with the suspect's car hitting a tree and catching fire. Just before 8am Polynice allegedly walked into a Quality Suites hotel off International Drive, a major tourist hub, and waved his gun around before firing a single shot in the air and taking his first two victims. The two clerks at that hotel, both . aged 28, were apparently killed immediately after suffering wounds to their heads and upper bodies. One of the women who died was Carlene Pierre, the gunman's ex-girlfriend and mother of his child, who recently took a restraining order out against him. The other, Vanessa Gonzalez-Orellanes, did not known Polynice and was just a co-worker of Ms Pierre. State records show Polynice may have been known by police, having served . time in prison between 2004 and 2005 for aggravated stalking, felony . battery and battery by detainee. Police say the shootings follow a . domestic violence injunction served against Polynice on Wednesday . evening over an incident that happened on September 11. Victims: Carlene Pierre, left, was killed and her friend Jean Guerline, right, injured in the deadly rampage . Tragic ending: The early morning shooting ended tragically before the alleged gunman shot himself in the head and crashed his white Camry into this tree . 'There had been an altercation at the . place of work, the hotel where she was working, where apparently he . tried to run her over with a vehicle,' Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. 'Very likely, he . could have been facing arrest soon in that case.' 'It does stem from a relationship that went bad,' Demings said according to FOX35. 'A child . was involved, but the child has been located and is in good  health.' Both women were taken to Dr Phillips Hospital where they were pronounced dead, Local 6 reports. Traveling 2.5 miles down the road to the Westgate Resort, the suspect located his third victim, 31-year-old housekeeper Jean Guerline, who was arriving to start her work day. Guerline was apparently targeted because she was best friends with Carlene Pierre. Using caution: Police are seen carefully approaching the white Camry after a deputy reported seeing its driver pull out a gun and raise it to his temple before firing what he said were multiple shots . Motive: Only one of the victims have been named with police saying the issue stemmed from a domestic dispute involving a restraining order filed on Wednesday . Pierre's sister, Judith Delchere, spoke of her anger that authorities had failed to save the domestic violence victim even though she had faced repeated death threats. 'We had faith in the system,' she said. 'We were like, the system will protect the woman, because that's what they always say.' Pierre told police at the time of obtaining an injunction that she feared she could be die at the hands of her estranged lover, according to court documents. 'He told me the only way he is going to leave me alone is by killing me,' she said. 'I am very afraid for my life.' Chase: The man was spotted by police driving several miles from the second hotel where he allegedly took his third victim . Police officer Mark Waltrip told the Orlando Sentinel Guerline was shot while outside the hotel’s security gate. She later identified Polynice to . police saying he was a former Westgate employee himself and confirmed that he was her best . friend's ex-boyfriend. Guerline underwent surgery at the Orlando Regional Medical Center this morning. Fleeing the scene in a white Camry, . police say the suspect was later spotted around 9.34am before crashing . into a tree, setting it on fire with him still inside. Shooting: Police say the suspect entered this Quality Suites hotel just before 8am and fired shots at his first two victims . Second trip: Minutes after the first shooting the gunman travelled to the West Gate Resort, pictured, shooting a third woman as she was beginning to start her work day . Demings told FOX that the suspect 'put something to his right temple' before a deputy reported seeing several flashes. He said the man was pronounced dead at the scene. The Orlando Sentinel reports that in addition to Polynice's string of previous charges, court records show a woman claims he previously threatened to kill her after she gave birth to his baby. In 2010 she sought an injunction against him claiming he nearly made her crash her car after running into her. In January that same year he allegedly also spat on her while she was in a hospital. The woman claimed that he promised he would kill her while making police believe she died over birth complications.","Police say Michelet Polynice, 33, entered two hotels within three miles of one another early on Thursday morning while firing shots .

"A Fatwa has been issued against living on Mars by clerics who say that trying to set up home there would be un-Islamic. The fatwa – or ruling – was issued by the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowment (GAIAE) in the UAE after the Mars One organisation announced that it would try and establish a permanent human settlement on Mars. The committee argued that an attempt to dwell on the planet would be so hazardous as to be suicidal and killing oneself is not permitted by Islam. Forbidden: A Fatwa has been issued against travelling to Mars (above is a Hubble Space Telescope image of the Red Planet) According to Khaleejtimes.com it said: ‘Such a one-way journey poses a real risk to life, and that can never be justified in Islam. There is a possibility that an individual who travels to planet Mars may not be able to remain alive there, and is more vulnerable to death.’ The astronauts, the committee said, would end up dying for no ‘righteous reason’ and would face the same punishment in the afterlife as someone who’d committed suicide. The committee, led by Professor Dr Farooq Hamada, said: ‘Protecting life against all possible dangers and keeping it safe is an issue agreed upon by all religions and is clearly stipulated in verse 4/29 of the Holy Quran: Do not kill yourselves or one another. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful.’ However, Mars One pointed out that the Quran encourages exploration. In a written response to the Fatwa it highlighted a verse that says 'and among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the variations in your languages and your colors: verily in that are Signs for those who know (Quran 30: 22)'. It said: 'The Muslim world has a rich tradition of exploration. The verse from the Quran above encourages Muslims to go out and see the signs of God’s creation in the ""heavens and the earth"". The most influential example of this was the Moroccan Muslim traveller Ibn Battuta, who from 1325 to 1355 travelled 73,000 miles, visiting the equivalent of 44 modern countries.' Mars One also disputed that the mission was tantamount to suicide. The organisation said: 'Space exploration, just like Earth exploration, will come with risks and rewards. It may seem extremely dangerous to send humans to Mars today, but the humans will be preceded by at least eight cargo missions. 'Robotic unmanned vehicles will prepare the habitable settlement. Water and a breathable atmosphere will be produced inside the habitat and the settlement will be operational for two years, even before the first crew leaves Earth. 'If we may be so bold: the GAIAE should not analyze the risk as they perceive it today. The GAIAE should assess the potential risk for humans as if an unmanned habitable outpost is ready and waiting on Mars.' It added: 'Mars One respectfully requests GAIAE to cancel the Fatwa and make the greatest Rihla, or journey, of all times open for Muslims, too. They can be the first Muslims to witness the signs of God’s creation in heaven, drawing upon the rich culture of travel and exploration of early Islam. 'The lives and journey of the first Mars settlers will tell us more about our place in the universe than any other humans before us. As Ibn Battuta also wrote: ""Travelling - it leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller.""' The GAIAE has issued around two million Fatwas through its Official Fatwa Centre since its inception in 2008. Colony: Mars One hopes to establish a human colony on the Red Planet by 2025 . The multi-billion pound Mars One mission hopes to establish a human colony on Mars in 2025. Over 200,000 people, including 500 Saudis and Arabs, have applied to take part in the missions so far. In December Mars One short-listed 1,058 people to take part in trials for the ambitious project. Co-founder Bas Lansdorp said: ‘We’re extremely appreciative and impressed with the sheer number of people who submitted their applications. 'However, the challenge with 200,000 applicants is separating those who we feel are physically and mentally adept to become human ambassadors on Mars from those who are obviously taking the mission much less seriously. We even had a couple of applicants submit their videos in the nude!’ Mars lies on average 141.6million miles from the Sun and has an average temperature of -85F (-65C). Its atmosphere is desperately thin - one per cent of Earth's pressure - and is 95 per cent carbon dioxide.","Clerics in the UAE have deemed a colony on Mars as being un-Islamic .

"Vandals today destroyed an art sculpture in central Paris ‘because it looked like a giant sex toy’. Looming above the city's Place Vendome, the 24ft tall piece, created by American artist Paul McCarthy, was meant to look like a green inflatable Christmas tree. But the artwork, simple entitled 'Tree', raised eyebrows in the French capital because of its uncanny resemblance to a certain type of sex toy. Scroll down for video . Deflated: Vandals destroyed the sculpture, which loomed above the city's Place Vendome, leaving it as a pile of green plastic, pictured. Police said that every effort was being made to catch those responsible . Target: The sculpture, which the artist insists was meant to resemble a tree, was erected ahead of next week's Contemporary Art Fair. It was not clear whether 'Tree', pictured earlier this week, could be repaired . Courting controversy: The artwork by American artist Paul McCarthy, pictured left, raised eyebrows in the French capital because of its uncanny resemblance to a certain type of sex toy . Today it was left as a giant pile of deflated plastic after vandals apparently took a number of sharp objects to it overnight. The incident came after claims that it 'humiliated' the French capital. A police spokesman said: 'The attack happened in the early hours this morning. ‘The attackers ignored metal fences surrounding the object, and effectively destroyed it.' He added that  ‘every effort was being made’ to catch those responsible for destroying the work. It was not clear whether the piece, which was erected ahead of next week's Contemporary Art Fair, could be repaired - but many argued that it should not be. ‘With luck it will be cleaned up and thrown in a dustbin,’ said Marjorie Klein, a 55-year-old visitor to the city who was among many inspecting the damage today. French kiss: Some social media users said that the sculpture 'humiliated' the French capital. Artist Paul McCarthy was himself physically attacked last Thursday, soon after unveiling the sculpture . ‘It was a disgusting work – it’s clearly been destroyed because it looked like a giant sex toy, and Parisians don’t want a giant sex toy in one of their most beautiful squares.’ Jerome Dubus, of the opposition UMP party, also had tough words for Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo, saying she should ‘end this provocation and remove the art work’ for good. Artist Paul McCarthy was himself physically attacked last Thursday, soon after unveiling the sculpture. The 69-year-old was slapped in the face as an unidentified assailant shouted: ‘You’re not French, and your work has no place in this square.’ McCarthy was left ‘very shocked', before asking ‘does this sort of thing happen a lot in France?’ He confirmed, however, that the comparison to a sex toy was not far wrong, explaining that it had started with a joke. The artist said that he thought it had a shape 'similar to the sculptures of Romanian artist Constantin Brencusi'. He added that people could be offended if they wanted to think of it as a sex toy, but said that to him 'it is more of an abstraction'. A spokesman for conservative group French Spring had complained that the sculpture 'disfigured' and 'humiliated'. McCarthy is no stranger to controversy and is known for artworks corrupting innocent symbols of youth, from Disney to Hollywood.

"Confessed: Darwin Jackson, 16, pictured much younger on his MySpace profile, allegedly shot dead his mother . A 16-year-old Bronx teenager told police that he was responsible for the death of his mother, hours after her body was found discarded in a plastic container on a nearby street, police sources said. Sources told the New York Post that Darwin Jackson confessed to shooting dead his mother, Tihesha Savage, 34, after the two of them got into a dispute about his curfew. Her remains were discovered early Wednesday morning in a grey bin on Macombs Road in the Mt Eden neighbourhood of the Bronx. She had been shot in the back of the head, officials said. Ms Savage’s remains were found by the building’s superintendent this morning; at first officials were unsure of who committed the heinous crime. Jackson later told investigators that the woman was his mother, but only confessed to the crime after NYPD officers took him in for questioning, the Wall Street Journal reported. It is unclear if Jackson had an attorney; he was arrested twice this year for marijuana possession. He was charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter, and criminal weapon possession.

"Reunited for the first time since June 2 1953, some of the most sumptuous outfits and gems worn at the Queen’s Coronation are about to go on show at Buckingham Palace. Featuring the young monarch’s breathtakingly beautiful Norman Hartnell-designed gown, her 21-foot purple velvet, Ermine-trimmed Coronation Robe and Queen Victoria’s dazzling diamonds - some as large as pigeon’s eggs - the display is a colourful and vivid re-creation of the 60-year-old ceremony. Open to the public from Saturday, visitors will also be able to see the Coronation brought to life by charming colour private home movies shot on the Queen’s instructions, some of which have never been seen in public before. Scroll down for video . Impossibly lavish: A woman admires Queen Elizabeth II's coronation robe at the exhibition in Buckingham Palace . Sumptuous: The dress the Queen wore to take the throne. The exhibition brings together an unprecedented array of dresses, uniforms and robes worn at the historic event . The Queen's white satin coronation dress, the undoubted centrepiece of the exhibition, was created by couturier Hartnell, who also designed the sumptuous outfits of the Queen Mother, Princess Margaret and the maids of honour. The monarch's gown – which was loosely based on her wedding dress - incorporated embroidered national and Commonwealth floral emblems in gold, silver and pastel-coloured silks, encrusted with pearls, crystals and sequins. Visitors are sure to be surprised at how tiny it is. Her robe, worn when the Queen left the Abbey for the Palace, is of English purple silk-velvet and took members of the Royal School of Needlework 3,500 hours to embroider the robe with wheat ears and olive branches, representing peace and prosperity. Elaborate: The monarch's gown incorporated embroidered national and Commonwealth floral emblems in gold, silver and pastel-coloured silks, encrusted with pearls, crystals and sequins .

In order to get the commission finished on time, the school employed a policy of ‘never a seat goes cold’, so if an embroiderer left the workroom she was immediately replaced. Exhibition curator Caroline de Guitaut said: ‘I just admire the incredible craftsmanship and the design of Hartnell's dresses, and to produce that incredible beautiful unified look for not only Her Majesty the Queen but other members of the Royal Family was really an incredible feat.’ Several gowns and coronets belonging to peers of the realm are also included, as well as the adorable outfits made for Prince Charles, then four, and two-year-old Princess Anne. Some of the eye-catching jewels worn by the royal women are also on display, including the diamond Halo tiara worn by Princess Margaret and later loaned by the Queen to the Duchess of Cambridge for her wedding in 2011 as well as the Queen’s Diamond Diadem, which was designed and made for George IV to wear at his coronation in 1821. It is one of the most recognisable of the Queen’s jewels. Dieu et mon droit: The Coronation Glove, worn on Queen Elizabeth II's right hand during her Investiture .

The order of service used by Queen Elizabeth II at her coronation, complete with signed message . Objects from the sacred moment the Queen was anointed with oil on her ‘head, breast and hands’ during the ceremony can also be seen. The anointing was not filmed or photographed and was shielded from view by a canopy, made for George VI's coronation in 1937 from a cloth of gold embroidered with silver eagles. The plain white linen anointing dress also designed by Hartnell has never been seen in public before. ‘This is worn over the coronation dress for the moment of anointing,’ said Mrs de Guitaut. ‘It had to be very carefully thought through because the Mistress of the Robes, the Duchess of Devonshire, had to put the garment on (the Queen) and remove it while wearing kid gloves, so, after a certain amount of trial and error, it was decided that poppers down the back of the dress would be the best thing.' Alongside official black and white photographs, the exhibition features private movies filmed behind the scenes for the Queen, that show the personal story behind the pomp and ceremony.

"The mother of a millionaire Premier League footballer has been left heartbroken after her son claimed that she was practising black magic on him. Emmanuel Adebayor has found himself in the middle of a bizarre family feud after suggesting that his mother was a witch. The Tottenham Hotspur striker’s family, who live in Africa, accused the star of kicking his mother out of her home. Scroll down for video . Mother and son: Emmanuel Adebayor (pictured with his mother Alice in Togo at the BBC African Footballer of the Year 2007 awards) has found himself in the middle of a bizarre family feud . They claim that the footballer’s decision to cut ties with his mother has left her earning just £1-a-day from selling tomatoes. The 30-year-old star, who earns £170,000-a-week, accused the family of performing ‘juju’ on him, a term given to the practice of witchcraft in West Africa. But his family, who are from Togo, hit back by claiming that the star had been ‘brainwashed’ by Islamic spiritual healers who told him that his poor form on the football pitch was down to black magic. While Adebayor scored 14 goals in 25 games last season for Tottenham, he has only managed two strikes in 12 matches so far this campaign. The Christian footballer denied that he had mistreated his mother Alice, 62, and said that the family was using advisors in black magic against him. He told Ghanaian radio station Peace FM: ‘Obviously I’m not a pastor, I am a footballer so I cannot point out a witch. I never sacked my mum from the house — she decided to leave the house. ‘But how am I going to be in touch with my mum if my mum is the one telling everyone that my work will not go forward. ‘They should stop talking, talking, they should stop doing juju on me — they should leave me alone.’ Spurs star: Adebayor's family, who are from Togo, claimed that he had been ‘brainwashed’ by Islamic spiritual healers who told him that his poor form on the football pitch was down to black magic . He accused his family members of plotting what to do with his wealth when he dies and said they were using advisors he referred to as ‘juju people’. ‘They have already shared all the things I worked for,’ he said. ‘They shared my houses, they shared my cars. They say, “If he dies this car is for you, this house is for you”. Can you imagine?’ Millionaire striker: Christian footballer Adebayor denied that he had mistreated his mother . Adebayor had phoned the station to angrily respond following an interview with his sister Maggie in which she claimed that the star had not financially supported his family. As well as claiming that he had driven his mother out of the home believing she was a witch, she also claimed that he has refused to take a phone call from his family members for over a year. But the riled sportsman said that he did give money to his mother and said his six siblings should do more to look after her. He said: ‘If they claim I am not looking after my mother, we are seven and so why can’t the rest do it…they should go and work...I remit my mother every month.’ His lorry driver brother Kola said: ‘Every day my mother is crying. She told me, ‘Emmanuel has accused me of being a witch’.’ He said that Muslim advisors known as ‘alfas’ were manipulating his brother and had convinced the footballer that his mother is a witch. Kola, 42, who lives in Bremen, Germany, said: ‘My mother is very sad. Every day she is crying. I just talked to her on the phone and she was crying again. ‘Emmanuel will not even talk to her. He’s been brainwashed by these Muslim alfas — spiritual men — who prophesise when he scores goals and why he is not playing well. ‘My family is Christian but it is not unusual to visit Muslim spiritual healers. He is seeing bad alfas and they are manipulating him.’ Looking up: The footballer was unable to walk for the first four years of his life and has claimed that he was cured when his mother took him to a church . He told the Sun: ‘This is the woman who suffered for all of us and carried him in her stomach for nine months. This is the son she gave birth to and looked after all his life. ‘And this is how he treats her. I am so angry with my brother.’ ‘Eight months ago he kicked his own mother out of her house. She is having to sell tomatoes to survive. She makes one or two euros a day — which is not enough to live on.’ The sibling said that he sends his mother 400 euros a month to rent an apartment and accused his brother of leaving the family in poverty. He said: ‘In my culture you are supposed to help your family. But Emmanuel only takes care of himself and his friends.’ Adebayor has played for some of the world’s biggest football clubs, including Manchester City, Arsenal and Real Madrid. The footballer was unable to walk for the first four years of his life and has claimed that he was cured when his mother took him to a church. After a week of prayer he said that he was finally able to move when somebody kicked a football into the church’s yard and he wanted to chase it. His agent and Tottenham did not comment today.","Tottenham striker's family accused him of kicking mother out of home .

"It's every child's fantasy - a night spent camped out in a massive IKEA showroom. Single mum Brigid O'Connor's kids, Alice, 7, and Sophia, 10, had always wondered what it would be like to do just that. Their dreams came true on Sunday evening when they were given the opportunity to hold a sleepover in the Swedish furniture giant's premier store in Tempe, in Sydney's south. Scroll down for video . Peaceful slumber: Mum Brigid O'Connor and Sophia Foster, 10, and Alice Foster, 7, appeared to have enjoyed a relaxing evening in the Tempe IKEA showroom. Soft puppies were plopped into their laps as part of a 'surprise' wake-up call. Lucky family: Sophia (10), Alice (7) and mum Brigid were given a surprise wake-up call - with soft puppies delivered straight to their laps. Adorable: Sophia cuddles her new pooch friend in the IKEA showroom. She was given the soft puppy as part of a surprise IKEA wake-up call. Brigid O'Connor's daughters Sophie and Alice were 'thrilled to bits' to be shacked up in IKEA. 'They (my children) have always said since they were little, ""imagine if we were locked in here overnight, we could run around, sleep on the beds, play with the toys, they always said that""', Ms O'Connor, 42, told Daily Mail Australia. 'I think it's something everyone imagines at some point'. Along with two other lucky families, Ms O'Connor and her daughters, from Camperdown in the city's inner west, won a competition run by IKEA and travel rental company Airbnb to sleep in the warehouse. Ms O'Connor's children bolted into the store to claim their bunk beds at around 5pm last night. Her 'thrilled to bits' kids were given access to a games room featuring a Playstation, circus toys, juggling implements and craft supplies. Ms O'Connor, who was shacked up in a bedroom display surrounded by a curtain, said it did not even feel like she was sleeping in a huge warehouse. 'The weirdest part is it didn’t even feel like a shop,' she said. 'It was just like a really beautiful hotel room.' The competition winners were treated to a communal Swedish meal in the centre of the store - a smorgasbord whipped up by chefs at the IKEA restaurant. Dishes including the furniture chain's famous meatballs, a main of fresh salmon and a lemon tart dessert. The families snuggled under thick Swedish bedspreads and security escorted them through the labyrinth store when they needed to go to the bathroom. IKEA gave each family a different surprise wake-up call. IKEA gave each of the families a 'surprise' wake-up call. Competition winners Heather Noakes, Gary Preuss and nine-year-old Nathan Gates were woken up by an orchestra. Sophie and Alice Foster were very excited to stay in Tempe's IKEA store, often known colloquially as the suburb's 'big blue box'. IKEA gave each of the families a 'surprise' wake-up call. Competition winners Heather Noakes, Gary Preuss and nine-year-old Nathan Gates were woken up by an orchestra. Breakfast in bed: Three families staged an unusual sleep in at an IKEA store in Sydney last night. Pictured are Kimberley Ross, Robin Schrijvers and children Ella and Benjimen. Welcome to IKEA: The Schrijvers family are served breakfast in bed at the IKEA showroom in Tempe, in Sydney's south-eastern suburbs. Life as part of a showroom: One of the three families who joined in the festivities. The Schrijvers family was roused with a scrumptious breakfast and bed. Another family - Heather Noakes, Gary Preuss and nine-year-old Nathan Gates - woke up serenaded by an orchestra. And when Ms O'Connor's children woke they were given soft puppies to cuddle and pat. 'They were tiny little caramel gorgeous things,' she told Daily Mail Australia. The girls even asked if they could keep them. Each family stayed in a room with a different design theme - rustic, modern elegance or inner-city living. IKEA marketing manager Kristen Bengtsson said she hoped the sleepover would spotlight ways to make neglected bedrooms and bathrooms 'look fabulous'. According to research produced by the company, homeowners often neglect their bedrooms and bathrooms the most. The Swedish furniture giant has been in Australia since 1975. It has five stores on the east coast as well as two in Adelaide and Perth respectively. Ms Bengtsson said IKEA was not planning to open up one of its stores for a mass sleepover - but 'never say never'. Ms O'Connor, who even found the fluffy bathmats and hand towels in the bathroom impressive, said her stay at the store was like staying at a five star resort - with a catch. 'You didn't have to pay for the minibar.'","Every child's fantasy: Three lucky families given the opportunity to spend a night in IKEA's Sydney store .

"A French team of engineers has developed an artificial tree that can generate electricity using the wind. 'The idea came to me in a square where I saw the leaves tremble when there was not a breath of air,' said Jérôme Michaud-Larivière, the founder of the Parisian start-up which will market the Wind Tree in 2015. He added the energy 'had to come from somewhere and be translatable into watts'. It uses tiny blades housed in the 'leaves' that turn in the wind - regardless of its direction - and has the added advantage of being completely silent. Scroll down for video . Green energy: A French start-up has developed a 'Wind Tree' that generates power from air currents . Innovative: It uses tiny blades housed in the 'leaves' that turn in the wind - regardless of its direction . After three years of research, the team of engineers developed a 26ft prototype, which is now installed in the Pleumeur-Bodou commune in Brittany in northwestern France. He hopes they can eventually be used in people's own homes and in urban centres. The tree, which will sell for £23,500, can reportedly generate electricity on twice the number of days as a conventional wind turbine because it can generate power on winds of just 4.5mph. Mr Michaud-Lariviere said the tree - which has not yet been tested by an independent laboratory - is profitable after winds of 7.8mph on average over one year. 'The idea came to me in a square where I saw the leaves tremble when there was not a breath of air,' said Jérôme Michaud-Larivière, the founder of the Parisian start-up which will market the Wind Tree in 2015 . He hopes the tree can be used to exploit small 'deposits' of air currents flowing into town along the buildings and streets to feed, for example, LED street lamps, or a charging station for electrical cars. He admits there are more consistent winds 160ft in the air but they require 'monstrous machines', far from where energy is consumed, he added. He hopes the tree can be combined with other means of power generation such as photovoltaic, and geothermal, combined with energy-efficient buildings. In the future Mr Michaud-Larivière hopes to develop a 'perfect tree that has leaves with natural fibres, roots that could generate geothermal energy and 'bark' covered with photosensitive cells. However, Robert Bellini an engineering expert at the Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME), says the potential of small wind turbines in the city remains 'quite low'.","The 'Wind Tree' uses tiny blades housed in the 'leaves' that turn in breezes .

"Animal rights campaigners in Russia are furious after a circus allegedly attached hamsters to balloons and dropped them down to children in the audience as 'live gifts'. The rodents were apparently dead by the time they reached the crowd below, leaving the children in the audience 'acutely distressed'. Some parents have complained the animals were placed inside bottles and thrown into the audience and, in some cases, rats were used instead of hamsters. Siberian-based circus allegedly attaches hamsters to balloons and drops them down to audience members . Parents say their children were upset and distressed by the rodents, some of which are dead on arrival . The circus, based in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, takes this controversial act all over Russia, according to the Siberian Times. 34,000 animal lovers have so far signed a petition calling for them to stop using hamsters in such a way. Olga McManaman, who organised the petition, said: 'I invite all animal lovers and caring people to protest against this outrageous practice of inhumane animal treatment.' The animal rights campaigner from Siberia has urged people not to donate hamsters to the circus because they will be mistreated. 34,000 people have signed a petition organised by Olga McManaman (pictured), which calls for an end to the inhumane practice . She is not the only one incensed by the act, which sees hamsters dropped from up high in the big-top circus tent. Yevgenia, a mother, said: 'My child really did get a small dead hamster. I want to complain about this. 'My daughter experienced huge stress. She cried for hours.' Another parent, Svetlana, said: 'It was just torture, throwing live hamsters straight into the crowd for kids to catch. 'Children pushed each other, someone stepped on a girl's hand and one hamster was crushed.' A third mother from Smolensk said: 'They throw the hamsters from the top to the ground but also horizontally. 'They put hamsters in some sort of bottles and throw them so that kids have to catch them. It looks awful.' The performer responsible for the abuse has since been punished, according to the circus in question. Its art director, Yuriyi Karnaukhov, said: 'We sincerely apologise to all kids and their parents who were upset.' Campaigner Olga McManaman has attacked the circus. One mother said: 'It was just torture, throwing live hamsters straight into the crowd for kids to catch. The circus art director has apologised to upset parents and children, and claims the performer responsible has since been punished . But animal rights organisations aren't convinced. Viktor Donzhenko, head of Krasnoyarsk animal rights group Friend, said: 'It is a horrible case of abuse and I am very happy that so many people signed the petition.' He says Russia does not currently have laws protecting animals who belong to individuals. 'The owner of the animal can treat it as he wants as it's his property,' he said. 'We have been fighting to pass a law that protects the animals owned by people from abuse.' 'I hope this case will help not only to stop the cruelty with which the animals are treated in this particular circus, but also speed up a new law which will stop such things in the future.'","Children in the audience left 'acutely distressed' by dead rodents .

"As Brazil gears up for the World Cup this evening, 230 miles above Earth, astronauts are having their own microgravity kick-about. U.S. astronauts Reid Wiseman and Steve Swanson, and German astronaut Alexander Gerst, will be watching the action from aboard the International Space Station. And to celebrate the opening ceremony, the three astronauts showed off their microgravity football skills by performing impressive bicycle kicks, spins and somersaults while kicking a ball. Scroll down for video . Astronaut Steve Swanson attempts to kick the ball, but Flight Engineer Alexander Gerst is able to get to it before Swanson has the chance . The weightless movement of the astronauts is because they are in a continuous state of freefall, resulting in several amusing, slow-motion attempts at tackling their crewmates. The astronaut also sent down a special message to all the players and teams as they compete in World Cup 2014 which kicks off in Sao Paulo today and finishes on July 13. From left, Expedition 40 Commander Steve Swanson and Flight Engineers Alexander Gerst and Reid Wiseman wish football fans and the World Cup 2014 'peaceful games' The weightless movement of the astronauts is because they are in a continuous state of freefall.

May the best win and viel Glück.’ The astronauts have trained for years to work together as a unified crew, but the U.S. astronauts and their German crewmate are feeling a little friendly competition. Many people think gravity doesn't exist in space. However, typical orbital altitudes for human spaceflight vary between 120 - 360 miles above Earth's surface. The gravitational field is still quite strong in these regions, since this is only about 1.8 percent the distance to the moon. Earth's gravitational field at about 250 miles 0 about the distance of the ISS - is 88.8 percent of its strength at the surface. The condition of microgravity comes about whenever an object is in free fall. Objects in a state of free fall or orbit are said to be weightless. The object's mass is the same, but it would register '0' on a scale . Their home countries will play against each other for a chance to advance out of Group G of the World Cup matches. USA and Germany face off on June 26 at Arena Pernambuco in Recife, Brazil. This isn’t the first time a sporting event has been broadcast in space. The Super Bowl XLVIII was recently viewed aboard the ISS with Nasa astronauts supporting the Denver Broncos. While the crew members of the ISS are unable to watch the World Cup games live, Nasa said it will upload the matches shortly after they are broadcast on terrestrial TV. Reid Wiseman, of Nasa, and Alexander Gerst, of the European Space Agency, arrived at the space station on May 28 as part of the Expedition 40/41 crew.

"Nicolas Sarkozy has claimed that gay marriage ‘humiliates families’ in his first TV interview since announcing a return to politics. The former French president, 59, said he detested the way equal marriage was forced through by Francois Hollande’s government last year. Mr Sarkozy – who has begun his attempt to be re-elected as president in 2017 – said on French television: ‘The government is humiliating families and humiliating people who love the family.’ Mr Sarkozy, 59, who has launched his bid to be re-elected as president in 2017, said he 'detested' the socialist government's gay marriage legislation . Asked if he would get rid of the law if he was to become president again, Mr Sarkozy said it would not be a priority when so many were jobless. His wife Carla Bruni said in a separate interview with French Vogue that she disagreed with her husband over marriage equality. The former model said: ‘I’m rather in favour because I have a lot of friends – men and women – who are in this situation and I see nothing unstable or perverse in families with gay parents. ‘My husband is opposed for reasons linked to his political vocation, because he sees people as groups of thousands rather than people we know personally.’ Mr Sarkozy launched his comeback to politics in a message on Facebook on Friday, declaring he is joining the race to lead the right-wing UMP party. The former leader had told journalists they would ‘never hear from him again’ after he lost the election to socialist Francois Hollande in the 2012 election. The former leader, who is married to Carla Bruni (right), had told journalists they would ‘never hear from him again’ after he lost the election to socialist Francois Hollande in the 2012 election . He said: ‘Looking at the disastrous state France risks finding itself in, I will have no choice.’ Friends say Mrs Bruni had begged him not to run again. Sarkozy has faced several legal investigations since leaving office, including charges that he allegedly took campaign funds from former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The leadership bid could also be hindered by a raft of corruption charges he faces over illegal campaign funding. He is accused of accepting illegal party funding payments from France's richest woman, the L'Oreal heiress Lilian Bettencourt, in return for tax breaks. He has accused the country’s socialist government of framing him with ‘grotesque’ accusations. While Sarkozy's supporters are desperate for him to return to politics, the wider French population is less enthusiastic. A poll by OpinionWay found that 64 per cent of French people are not interested in his upcoming comeback announcement.","Sarkozy claimed in a TV interview that gay marriage 'humiliates families'

Far-right protesters wave a flag of the French student political group GUD (Groupe Union Defense) as they face riot policemen . France’s gay marriage law, making it the 14th country to allow same sex unions, was passed in the French parliament on May 18. ‘Traditional France has been . threatened by these new measures and that’s why we have taken to the . streets,’ said Jerome Martin, a 23-year-old protester. ‘The violence highlights the frustration we feel at having been betrayed by liberal politicians.’ Mr Martin spoke as hundreds threw rocks and smoke bombs at the police, who responded with tear gas and baton charges. There were numerous injuries on both . sides, with the worst fights breaking out on the grass esplanade . opposite Les Invalides, and in surrounding streets. Journalists were also attacked, with at least two seriously injured. The area is next door to the French . parliament, where President Francois Hollande’s Socialist government . introduced and then passed the gay marriage bill.

There were an estimated 200 hardcore violent demonstrators who refused to disperse . A protester taunts police. Many hid their faces with scarves, hoods and masks to prevent identification . It meant that France became the 14th country in the world to allow same sex unions. The protests, which are strongly . backed by the Roman Catholic Church, have become a chance for the French . right to rally against the left. Interior Minister Manuel Valls said some 100 known far-right protesters were among those arrested in the early hours of Monday. Some 4,500 police officers were on duty in Paris on Sunday to deal with the huge crowds. France’s first gay wedding is due to take place on Wednesday in Montpellier, in the south of the country. Despite the violent rally, a survey published on Sunday showed 53 per cent of French people support gay marriage and adoption. Protesters run in the streets. Some hung a banner urging Hollande to go . Crackdown: Policemen arrest a far-right protester after the demonstration turned violent . A tear gas grenade drops into the midst of protestors.

The reform has often sparked violent street protests and a rise in homophobic attacks . Resistance: A gay marriage opponent waves flags at the Esplanade des Invalides . But the mass rallies have contributed to President Hollande’s low popularity ratings. His administration has been plagued . by economic recession and unemployment has now hit more than 10 per . cent, but Hollande got some welcome news on Sunday, after his popularity . inched up four points to 29 per cent this month. Although . it failed to block gay marriage, the protest movement hopes its show of . force will delay or stop further laws allowing assisted procreation and . surrogate motherhood for gay couples. The situation began to escalate on Tuesday when writer Dominique Venner, who is linked to a far-right French nationalist party, shot and killed himself inside Paris’ Notre Dame Cathedral. Non: People wave trademark pink, blue and white flags at the Esplanade des Invalides as they attend a protest march against France's legalisation of same-sex marriage . The protest was called 'La Manif pour Tous' (Demonstration for All) He had called for 'spectacular' action to protect France’s identity, and was denouncing same-sex marriage law. Hollande’s Socialist Party denounced . the protest, highlighting the fact that the law has already passed in . parliament and was validated by the Constitutional Council. The conservative opposition UMP party was split over whether to continue the rallies. UMP President Jean-Francois Cope and several other party leaders joined the march and urged young protesters to join his party as a 'new UMP generation' and campaign against the left-wing government. But several other UMP leaders, including former conservative prime ministers Francois Fillon and Alain Juppe, kept their distance, saying lawmakers should exercise their influence in parliament rather than march in street protests. The protests have grown into a wider opposition movement against the unpopular President Hollande .","French capital marred by second day of protest over gay marriage .

"A rogue's gallery of some of Britain's most notorious petty thieves has revealed how they targeted railway stations to steal luggage, whisky and ladies' shoes from unsuspecting passengers. The British Transport Police's History Group has published mug shots of those frequently caught stealing at stations across the country between the late 19th Century and early 20th Century. The majority of offenders targeted distracted passengers - swiping their luggage from rest rooms, carriages and waiting rooms. Caught in the act: North British Railway employee Thomas Drummond stole 12 bottles of whisky from a wagon and was jailed for 20 days . Tea time: John Moir, a goods checker at Leith Walk Goods Yard, stole some tea and was fined £3 or 10 days imprisonment in April 1920 . Wanted: Margaret Leck was a travelling railway thief from Kendal, Westmorland, and was wanted for stealing a trunk from Edinburgh Waverley station in 1904 . John Yates, alias John Hewitt, Patrick Hines, John Miller and John Roy, was sentenced to six months imprisonment with hard labour in March 1921 for theft of a parcel of clothing . Thief: Arthur Dunn was jailed for one month with hard labour in February 1920 for stealing dead rabbits from Wellington station . Mitchell Steadman-Turner was sentenced to six months in prison after stealing a Japanese basket from the waiting rooms at Waverley Station in Edinburgh in 1920. While James Wilton - alias Charles Wharton - was sentenced to six months imprisonment with hard labour for stealing a bag at Paddington Station in 1887. But some of the thieves were a bit more daring - and attempted to steal more unusual items. North British Railway employee Thomas Drummond stole 12 bottles of whisky from a wagon and was sentenced for 20 days. Over-exposed: Jack Graham-Parker was convicted of indecent exposure at Edinburgh station on three days in March 1920. He was sentenced to 60 days imprisonment . Robert Lewis, who had already been convicted five times of stealing coal from the railways, pictured left, was sentenced to one month in prison with hard labour at Bristol Magistrates for theft of a registered postal packet. James Wilton, alias Charles Wharton, pictured right, was convicted of stealing a bag at Paddington Station in 1887 and sentenced to six months imprisonment with hard labour . William Slater stole a Portmanteau from Edinburgh Waverley station and was sentenced to four months in jail in April 1917 . Notorious: Leslie Hines was sentenced to six months imprisonment with hard labour for theft of a bag at King's Cross station in July 1904 . Fine or the time: Private Roy Crooks, of the 2nd Battalion Australian Forces, stole a suitcase from Edinburgh Waverley station in January 1918 and was fined £7 or 30 days imprisonment . Adenan Zacarianoer was sentenced to 30 days in prison before being deported for stealing three pairs of ladies' shoes in 1922. While Patrick Woods was convicted of card sharping and sentenced to 60 days in prison in 1917. Other punishments seem a little heavy handed by today's standards, with Edward Meitchie sentenced to three months in prison with hard labour for loitering at Derby Station in 1922. Viv Head, a retired Detective Inspector with the British Transport Police, helped carry out the research to uncover the 'Rogue's Gallery'. He said: 'One of the major problems with policing the railway network is that it always has been, by definition, a transient population. This applies as much to the victim as it does to the offender and especially to witnesses. Margaret McConnell, while employed at Edinburgh Waverley station, stole parcels from an office and was fined £5 or 30 days imprisonment . Private Gordon Marr, of the 16th Battalion Canadian Scottish Regiment, was sentenced to 10 days imprisonment for theft of a box of fish from Edinburgh Waverley station on 22 January 1918 . Scaling justice: John Calvert was jailed for six months for stealing a parcel containing a pair of brass weighing scales from Sheffield station in 1922 . Servant Mitchell Steadman-Turner stole a Japanese basket from the waiting rooms at Waverley station in November 1920 and was sentenced to six months imprisonment . 'With better communication and digital images, it is a great deal easier to track and arrest offenders these days. It is one reason why thefts of luggage are significantly less prevalent than they used to be. 'Before the digital age it was still important to circulate details of when and where offences were being committed and suspects. 'When offenders were arrested and went on to repeat their crimes it was quite common to circulate their photographs by way of bulletins and printed booklets. 'Copies were also kept at headquarters of course so that photograph ""identity parades"" could be held. They were a real rogues gallery and often looked exactly what they were - a rum bunch.' Benjamin Crowd, alias Cowd . Crowd who had 22 previous convictions, was jailed for three months hard labour for stealing a gents watch from the SS Hittery berthed at King George Dock, Hull . Patrick Reilly was convicted of cutting ladies skirts with a razor at Edinburgh Waverley station in February 1918 and was sent to Morningside Asylum . Helen Nicholson, 43, was jailed for six months in 1903 for theft of a parcel from the ladies waiting room at Edinburgh Waverley station .","The British Transport Police's History Group have published mug shots of notorious transport criminals between 1880 and 1950 .

"At long last, it may actually happen. Boxing’s first $200million spectacular. The mega-fight we’ve all been waiting for. The most reliable hint thus far that Floyd Mayeather and Manny Pacquiao will finally get it on began rustling around the American rumour mill as the PacMan flew into Los Angeles from Manila in the early hours of Monday morning, London time. Book the date, at least provisionally: September 13 this year. The place: The MGM Grand Garden, Las Vegas. WATCH Scroll down to see Manny Pacquiáo beat Brandon Rios . Show him the money: Floyd Mayweather could be set for a mega-fight with Manny Pacquiao . Kings of the ring: Mayweather versus Pacquiao has been pencilled in for September 13 in Las Vegas . We’ve heard it all before but this time the word comes from close to Mayweather’s Money Team. The . same YouTube source which revealed that Mayweather would fight Robert . Guerrero and Canelo Alvarez months before the official announcements of . those bouts last year is claiming now that the biggest one of all is a . done deal. Mayweather keeps . his cards closer to his chest than a world poker champion. He continues . to play games by asking his Twitter followers to vote on who should be . his next opponent. However, . his date with Britain's Amir Khan is expected to be confirmed any day. It has been in the works since October, as revealed by Sportsmail. Not . that it would be reasonable to expect him to disclose his plans for . September before that fight, which is earmarked for the same Vegas venue . on May 3. Pacquiao also has . a hurdle of his own to overcome at the MGM, on April 5, if the . Mayweather bonanza is to have any chance of becoming reality. He is back . in master-trainer Freddie Roach’s Wild Card gym in LA preparing to . avenge the miscarriage of judging which gifted Tim Bradley a split . decision victory over him 20 months ago. If . Khan or Bradley spring a major upset, it would derail the Money train . which is seemingly en route now to the biggest pay-night in ring . history. But with the casino . odds heavily against either of them losing this spring, Mayweather and . Pacquiao appear to be manoeuvring towards an autumn showdown which has . been the best part of a decade in the making. Pacquiao . began clearing the decks by agreeing to Mayweather’s demands for . Olympic blood-standard drugs testing as well as the lion’s share of the . purse. When his offer to . accept just 40 per cent of the loot was followed by Mayweather’s . insistence that he cut his promoter, Bob Arum, out of the deal, Pacquiao . upped the moral ante. In . keeping with a proposition put in this column a few weeks in the wake of . the typhoon disaster in the Philippines, his home land in which he is . eyeing a run for the presidency, Pacquiao challenged Mayweather to fight . him entirely for charity. The . silence which has greeted that proposal thus far suggests that . Mayweather may indeed be considering a negotiation which could include a . slice of the huge proceeds going to good causes in America as well as . the Philippines. Another . temptation for Mayweather to risk his cherished unbeaten record in a bid . to seal his legacy of greatness – as well as bank an absolute fortune - . has come with a perception in the US that Pacquiao is in decline. Revenge mission: Pacquiao is first set for a rematch in April with Tim Bradley (left), who beat him 20 months ago . 1)    Floyd Mayweather . 2)    Manny Pacquiao . 3)    Andre Ward . 4)    Timothy Bradley . 5)    Wladimir Klitschko . 6)    Guillermo Rigondeaux . 7)    Adonis Stevenson . 8)    Sergio Martinez . 9)    Juan Manuel Marquez . 10)   Carl Froch . The . controversial defeat by Bradley was followed by a shocking, one-punch . KO by Pacquiao’s arch-rival Juan Manuel Marquez, whom Mayweather had . beaten with ease. Although . Pacquiao came back to out-class a tough young Brandon Rios, he failed to . finish the job with the knock-out which used to be his trademark. Even . if Pacquiao looks back to his best in the Bradley re-match, the dye . may already be cast by then for September. Albeit in private. As . recently as two years ago Mayweather-Pacquiao would have been . universally recognised as a duel between the two greatest . pound-for-pound fighters in the world. That . may well be the case by the time they do meet. Mayweather still reigns . supreme and in my view Pacquiao is back up there, just one place below . him. But even if Pacquiao is less than awesome against Bradley, a clash with Mayweather would still be huge box office. Better late than never. The people's choice: Mayweather asked his Twitter followers who he should fight next . Winner: Mayweather (left) lands a blow on Canelo Alvarez during his victory last September .

"A French comic who is considered anti-Semitic was banned from performing just hours after a court in Nantes said he could go ahead with his show. Riot police carrying shields last night blocked access to the Zenith theatre in Nantes, where Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala was due to perform the first show of his national tour. Thousands of stunned ticket-holders in the nearly sold-out show chanted and hissed. Up in arms: Comedy fans protest outside the Zenith theatre in Nantes after a French comic who is considered anti-semitic was banned by a court just hours before he was due on stage . Controversial: Fans perform a 'quenelle' gesture, a hand movement M'Bala M'Bala is credited with inventing which has been criticised as being anti-Semitic . Heavy response: Riot police carrying shields blocked access to the Zenith theatre in Nantes after the decision . The 47-year-old comedian has been convicted more than a half-dozen times for inciting racial hatred or anti-Semitism in performances in which the Holocaust has been derided. He also has popularised the 'quenelle' hand gesture, which interior minister Manuel Valls has criticised as an 'inverted Nazi salute'. Dieudonne, as he is known, denies that his act and the 'quenelle' are anti-Semitic. Tensions have played out on national television for days as they reached all the way to the pinnacle of the state, raising sometimes uncomfortable questions about free expression and anti-Semitism in today's France. Vows to continue fighting: Comedian Dieudonne M'bala M'bala (centre) leaves the Zenith arena after being told he couldn't perform just hours after a court said he could go ahead with the show . Denial: M'Bala M'Bala (pictured at a previous show) says that his act and the 'quenelle' are not anti-Semitic . The tug-of-war over last night's show involved a multitude of French authorities - the Council of State, the country's highest administrative body, the city of Nantes, a court in Nantes and Mr Valls. Mr Valls wants Dieudonne kept off all stages in France, denouncing what he calls the 'mechanics of hate' relayed by the comic. The city of Nantes had banned the comic's performance, but a Nantes court overturned that ban earlier yesterday. Mr Valls then took the matter to the ultimate authority, the Council of State, asking for an unusual urgent decision. 'In the face of the mechanics of hate... we need firmness and determination and great calm,' the interior minister said. A fan performs the 'quenelle' and holds a pineapple, which symbolises the comic's conviction for using the word 'Shoananas' - a mash-up of the Hebrew word for Holocaust and the French word for the fruit . Citing a risk to public safety, the council banned the performance only two hours before the show was to begin. It brushed aside claims that Dieudonne would change his show to avoid offensive language and said a 'serious risk' of 'grave attacks' to fundamental French values could not be dismissed. Mr Valls declared that France had been made stronger by the decision to keep Dieudonne off the stage in Nantes. '(But) the combat against the nauseating words of this personage continues,' he said. 'Citizens should not go to these shows.' There was no immediate reaction from Dieudonne, who had arrived expecting to perform after winning the first court battle. Outrage: A woman holds a shirt showing a drawing of French controversial humorist Dieudonne M'bala M'bala as people gather in front of the Zenith venue in Nantes . Mr M'Bala M'Bala calls the gesture 'la quenelle' - the word for an elongated creamed fish dumpling - and says it stands for his anti-Zionist and anti-establishment views, not anti-Semitism. The gesture, said to resemble a Nazi salute, was brought to international attention last month when Nicholas Anelka (pictured above with Mr M'Bala M'Bala) made it after scoring a goal for West Bromwich Albion. The salute involves extending one arm, as in a Nazi salute, but keeping it by your side as you touch your shoulder with the other arm. The gesture has gone viral on social media in recent weeks, with mostly young fans displaying it at parties and sports events. Some do it while in the audience at live television shows. Two soldiers were sanctioned by the army in September for making the gesture in uniform in front of a Paris synagogue. The 'quenelle' is a key component of the Dieudonne act, and he has himself threatened to sue those who object to it. However, his Facebook page advised . fans to avoid confrontation and go home 'singing the Marseillaise,' the . French national anthem. His fans and police eventually dispersed without serious incidents after the show was cancelled. Yesterday's legal drama may be just the beginning of a longer battle. The . Nantes show was to kick off a national tour. At least eight of the . nearly 30 French cities where the comic's tour is planned through June . are known to have banned his performances. Dieudonne has said he will fight them one by one. Well-known Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld said it would be 'intolerable' for the comedian to be allowed to stage last night's show, given what already is happening in France. 'We have a country in which anti-Semitism is freely accepted,' he said. Mr Valls is the most popular minister in France's Socialist government, but his adamant stance against Dieudonne, while drawing praise from leading conservative rivals, has left some mystified. Fears have been expressed that any bans on the show could prove counter-productive or even illegal. The comic was convicted last fall for using the word 'Shoananas' a mash-up of the Hebrew word for Holocaust and the French word for pineapple. A song containing the word is seen as deriding Holocaust survivors and victims. Some fans hoping to see yesterday's show carried pineapples. Last week, an investigation was opened after Dieudonne allegedly made an anti-Semitic slur toward a Jewish journalist on a radio programme. 'When I hear him (the journalist) talk, you see ... I say to myself, gas chambers ... a pity,' Dieudonne said during a performance last month.","Riot police block theatre where Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala was due on stage .

"Britain's share of households where no one works is among the worst in Europe, shock figures revealed yesterday. The finding suggests that in an economy far more resilient than those of the stricken eurozone, many Britons appear to continue to prefer a life on benefits to work. There may be particular concern over the workless rate among UK single mothers. Only Ireland and tiny Malta among the other 26 EU states have a higher proportion without work. Shocking: Britain's share of households where no one works is among the worse in Europe . The analysis will further fuel the row, with Labour over the Coalition's proposed cap on benefits increases. The figures from the EU statistical arm Eurostat cover 2011 and show the share of homes where no adult wokrs more than a day a week. In Britain the level has fallen from 13.1 per cent in the previous year to 11.5 per cent. The reduction may be due to an earlier tightening up of sickness benefits by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. Yet even with the fall, Greece and Spain - where steeply rising unemployment rates have been linked to social unrest and riots - are only slightly worse off. Britain's lower unemployment rate hides the many people who have signed off work permanently due to sickness or disability. Greece and Spain (people queuing up outside a job centre in Madrid pictured) - where rising unemployment rates have been linked to social unrest - are only slightly worse off . In Spain the workless home rate has risen to 12.2 per cent, while in Greece it stands at 11.8 per cent. Only Belgium and three eastern European countries are ahead of the UK. Ireland has yet to report overall workless figures for 2011. And more than 43 per cent of single parents in Britain do not work for more than one day a week - higher than anywhere except Ireland. This suggests that the tax credit system introduced 15 years ago has failed in its aim of getting any single parents into work. Critics of benefits in Britain have long complained that the system means work does not pay for millions. The Tories have been attacked by Labour for suggesting that the cap is designed to reward strivers rather than shirkers.","May be particular concern over workless rate among UK single mothers .

Woman's Day claimed that the coronation of Mary and her husband, Prince Fredrick, could be announced in 'just weeks', in their latest publication on Monday.

"West Midlands Police have received 71 reports of witches ghosts and zombies over a three year period - however the Black Country is officially werewolf-free. Between 2011 and 2013, the force was obliged to investigate reports of paranormal activity in what has now been dubbed The Black Country Triangle. According to Nick Duffy of the West Midlands' Ghost Club, much of this upsurge is probably due to poor quality American television shows dealing with the paranormal. According to police figures, between 2011 and 2013 there have been 15 ghosts, 55 witches, and two zombies reported to officers in the West Midlands, however, the Black Country is officially free of werewolves . The Black Country Triangle: West Midlands Police have received 71 ghoulish reports between 2011-2013 . Nick Duffy of the West Midlands Ghost Club, pictured, said much of the increase could be down to impressionable people watching television shows such as Charmed featuring witches and the paranormal . According to figures released under the Freedom of Information Act, West Midlands Police have received 15 reports of ghosts, 55 incidents of witchcraft and a pair of zombies roaming the area over a three year period. The paranormal researcher asked for the number of reports of ghosts, werewolves, witches and zombies over the past three calendar years received by West Midlands Police. The unnamed person wanted to know especially 'any other details included in the calls? ie seven werewolves attacking people' and what action was taken by police. According to the FOI document: 'The reports include ghost, zombie and witch sightings, hearing and communicating with the aforementioned, the use of witchcraft, claims to be a witch and witch hunters. I have not included terms such as ""she called me a witch"", ""he was in a zombie-like state"".' However, according to the figures, 2013 featured record complaints of incidents involving ghosts and witches and worryingly the first two reports of zombies in the region. No reports of werewolves activity were made by the region's 2.8 million population. The paranormal reports were spread across Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Solihull, Sadwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton. Mr Duffy said: 'I am very surprised by the number of reports of witchcraft. I guess that is down to the popularity of TV shows such as Charmed. 'We set up the West Midlands Ghost Club in 1989 and we have received thousands of reports of paranormal activity. It is fair to say that there is a Black Country Triangle. 'We investigate each case on its own individual merits. It may seem surprising but we do not go to a house to either prove or disprove the presence of a ghost or spirit. There are charlatans out there who arrive with psychics who claim they can talk to the spirits or the little boy who had been murdered in the corner, but that is utter bunkum. 'Our job is simply to reassure people who are facing a problem. In may cases, it doesn't really matter if a house is haunted or not, if the person is convinced and they are in danger, then they will want to move.' Mr Duffy said he received one report of a werewolf in Solihull. He added: 'She was convinced a werewolf was feeding in her bins but it turned out to be a dog. We have had other cases of people convinced they could hear voices and they've turned out to be the neighbours.' Force spokesman, Billy Corrigan, said: 'Our officers routinely see the consequences of spirits when things go bump... but that tends to be of a night when the pubs have closed their doors and we’re making sure people get home safely. 'While the figures can seem amusing, behind some of these ""supernatural"" calls may be a deeply troubled individual or a person wasting valuable police time which would be better spent preventing real crimes. 'West Midlands Police always take action against those found to be knowingly making false and malicious calls to the emergency services.' In May, mother-of-three Michele Bardsley, 35 claimed she filmed UFOs above her home in Solihull, West Midlands. The video she made shows a formation of three or four lights, rising and falling together in the night sky. She claimed she filmed the phenomenon for at least 40 minutes - only breaking off for to put on her slippers when her feet got cold. Ms Bardlesy said she spent 40 minutes filming the unidentified flying object outside her home in Solihull . She said: 'I was painting upstairs then went to the back door for a cig. I looked up and there were these shapes, like red orbs, in the sky. 'They didn't look like stars or planes or helicopters, they were just hanging there. I thought I'd had a few too many rum and cokes. 'I got my phone and zoomed in on them. I was there for about 20 minutes, my feet were freezing but I couldn't come away.

"Shamari Jenkins was a few months pregnant on April 29 when she was shot and killed while driving in Hartford, Connecticut. Her unborn son was also killed. The man who allegedly shot her was Matthew Hall-Davis, a friend of her boyfriend - 21-year-old Carlton 'CJ' Bryan, who was in the car with his girlfriend when the shooting happened. But in a surprising turn in the case, Bryan may have actually been behind the shooting, according to court documents released Friday. Arraigned: Carlton Bryan, right, in court on Friday after he was charged in the murder of his pregnant girlfriend . Apparently Bryan had asked Jenkins to get an abortion, and she refused. He told a friend that she was 'trying to ruin his life and he wanted her killed.' Bryan 'begged' Hall-Davis to shoot his 20-year-old girlfriend, according to his arrest warrant. Apparently he 'wanted to stay with...his other girlfriend,' Hall-Davis told the police. The warrant goes on the explain the plan Bryan and Hall-Davis had for carrying out the murder. Murder for two: Two men are being tried in the murder of Shamari Jenkins, her boyfriend Carlton Bryan, left, and his friend Matthew Hall-Davis, right. Jenkins was shot on April 29. She and her unborn son were later pronounced dead at St. Francis hospital . Hall-Davis would take Bryan's car and drive it to Enfield Street, park the vehicle and walk to Magnolia Street via a short cut where he would wait in the dark for the right time to shoot Jenkins. Jenkins and Bryan would be waiting at Magnolia Street, while another friend would observe from a house and call police, saying the shooter ran away. But Hall-Davis couldn't muster it. He talked to Bryan who was smoking outside of the car where Jenkins was sitting. He told Hall-Davis to 'go back to Enfield Street and carry out the plan they had to kill Jenkins.' Motive: Bryan had apparently told a friend that Jenkins was ruining his life by keeping their baby, and that's why he wanted her killed . Hall-Davis agreed but planned to shoot Bryan instead of the girlfriend. He missed, however, and shot the original target. Jenkins was taken to St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center where she and her unborn baby boy were later pronounced dead. She had already picked out a name for the child: Ja'seon Carlton. In the aftermath of the shooting, Bryan apparently lied twice to police about his girlfriend's death. Explanation number one was that he and Jenkins were waiting for a cousin to bring them $50 dollars and that he didn't know who the shooter was. On second questioning, he changed his tune saying that they were waiting to buy marijuana, and that their dealers never showed up. He blamed someone called 'Low' who he met in jail for shooting Jenkins, but the man had an alibi. The case changed course May 20 when the lookout for the shooting told police it was Bryan who orchestrated the event. Another confidante, Kingsley Minto, was arrested with Hall-Davis for a few jewelry store robbings and told police about helping to hide the gun used to shoot Jenkins. Bryan was arraigned Friday. He was charged Thursday night with murder, conspiracy to commit murder, carrying a pistol without a permit and second-degree making a false statement. Family members of Jenkins were quite surprised by the turn of events. Jenkins' cousin Shakaria Matthews told Fox Connecticut that Byran attended Jenkins' funeral and vigil and said he didn't do it. At the vigil he was was even caught on camera acting distraught. 'It was hard - real hard - to see him knowing he used to come to my house and stay the night and talk with me, and then for him to turn around and do something like this,' Todd Jenkins, the victim's father, told Fox Connecticut. Bryan is currently being held on $2.5 million bail.

'Justin said something when he came in which was aimed at Orlando, who then jumped onto a sofa to try and get at Justin.' she recalls. She added to the Daily Mirror: 'When Orlando punched Bieber, everyone started clapping. Lindsay was laughing. It was amazing. The whole table he and DiCaprio were on were clapping. Afterwards, I don't know if people were congratulating Orlando or trying to calm him down.'When security saw that when they got separated, Bieber and Orlando tried to punch each other again, security were like, 'Bieber came, Bieber provoked this fight', so they took his hands behind his back and took him away from the restaurant.' Anastasia, who was sitting next to Orlando's table where he dined with actor Leonardo Dicaprio before the fight broke out, filmed Bieber allegedly yelling, 'What’s up, b***?' to Bloom in the video.

Representatives for Bloom and Bieber have refused to comment on the restaurant fight, despite the in-depth eye witness accounts. Meanwhile, Bieber has continued to provoke the English actor by posting a picture of his former wife Miranda in a bikini with a crown symbol caption, followed by a picture of Orlando Bloom wiping his eyes as if to cry. Miranda on the other hand, has used Instagram to prove that she's not getting involved. Posting a series of model shots from recent campaigns and a sweet mother-son picture with the couple's little boy Flynn Bloom, the former Mrs Bloom can be seen to turn her back on the whole situation.

"The reforms are part of David Cameron's scheme to promote gay equality . Same-sex couples will be able to get married in register offices or in ceremonies at stately homes or hotels under sweeping reforms of marriage law put forward by ministers yesterday. But the laws on wedding ceremonies that allow only men and women to marry in church will remain untouched in David Cameron’s scheme to promote gay equality. Equalities Minister Lynne Featherstone said: ‘I believe that if a couple love each other and want to commit to a life together, they should have the option of a civil marriage, whatever their gender. ‘Marriage is a celebration of love and should be open to everyone.’ However, the Church of England launched a fierce condemnation of the reforms. It accused the Coalition of misunderstanding the law of marriage and confusing wedding ceremonies with the institution of marriage. The reforms were published in a Home Office consultation paper that will allow three months discussion before legislation is drawn up and MPs get a free vote on whether to legalise gay marriage. For same-sex couples, the proposals will mean those who want to formalise their relationships will have choice between civil marriage and civil partnerships, which have been open to gay and lesbian couples since 2005. Civil partnerships will continue to be available, but civil partners will have the option to convert their relationships into marriages. There will be minor changes to bring civil partnerships and marriages into line in the remaining areas of legal difference between them. For example, in future civil partners will be able to end their partnership on grounds of adultery, an option for divorce currently open only to married couples. Same-sex couples will be able to get married in register offices or in ceremonies at stately homes or hotels under sweeping reforms of marriage law . The new marriage law will also allow people who undergo sex changes to stay married. At present, people who change their sex in law by taking out a Gender Recognition Certificate must divorce, but when same-sex marriage is legalised they will not be required to end their own marriage. Ministers said the new law would not affect religious marriage, which they say will become a different legal concept from civil marriage. ‘Marriages conducted through a religious ceremony and on religious premises can only be between a man and a woman,’ the Home Office paper said. The laws on wedding ceremonies that allow only men and women to marry in church will remain untouched in David Cameron's scheme to promote gay equality . But the Church of England said: ‘The issue of whether marriage should be redefined to include those of the same-sex is a more complicated picture than has been painted. ‘Arguments that suggest “religious marriage” is separate and different from “civil marriage”, and will not be affected by the proposed redefinition, misunderstand the legal nature of marriage in this country. They mistake the form of the ceremony for the institution itself.’ The CofE added that it is ‘committed to the traditional understanding of the institution of marriage as being between one man and one woman.' Earlier this week it was claimed that parents could be legally referred to as  'Progenitor A' and 'Progenitor B' under the same sex marriage plans. Leading lawyer and Labour peer Lord Brennan QC, an opponent of same sex marriage, said, if the institution of marriage is . redefined, the erosion of traditional words such as 'mother' and . 'father' from British law could have 'Orwellian' consequences. He also claimed the removal of such words from the statute books could result in legislative chaos. More than 200,000 campaigners have signed a . petition on the No 10 website in support of keeping marriage between . husbands and wives, making it the biggest active campaign in Britain. The petition was launched by the . Coalition for Marriage (C4M), with 7,500 people signing it every day.",Church of England accuses the Coalition of misunderstanding the law of marriage .
"Facebook and Apple are offering women employees the chance to put their dreams of motherhood on ice – by paying for them to freeze their eggs. The extraordinary perk is aimed at boosting the number of women staff by allowing them to focus on their careers without sacrificing the opportunity to have children later in life. The Silicon Valley giants – the first major employers to offer the procedure for non-medical reasons – are willing to pay £12,500 a time to cover the cost of putting the eggs on ice plus an additional £300-a-year for deep freeze storage. Scroll down for video . Payout: Women working for Facebook can receive £12,500 a time for freezing their eggs so they work longer . The eggs can then be planted into the patient’s uterus at time of her choosing when she may no longer be producing them naturally. According to NBC News, Facebook has begun paying for egg freezing and Apple will start in January. Preserving eggs has been described as a key to ‘levelling the playing field’ in the male-dominated tech industry and a possible game-changer for women who have traditionally had to choose between their careers and starting a family at a time when their male counterparts are climbing the ladder. ‘Having a high-powered career and children is still a very hard thing to do,’ Brigitte Adams, an egg-freezing advocate and founder of the patient forum Eggsurance.com, told NBC. ‘By offering this benefit, companies are investing in women and supporting them in carving out the lives they want,’ she added. Paying for the procedure can be seen as rewarding women employees for their commitment, said San Francisco specialist Philip Chenette. Women who know they want children someday ‘can go on with their lives and know that they’ve done everything that they can’. In the past year, fertility doctors in New York and San Francisco report that egg freezing cases have nearly doubled. In a 2013 survey published in the journal Fertility and Sterility, a majority of patients who had their eggs frozen reported feeling ‘empowered.’ Bank: The eggs will be put in deep freeze so women can continue their careers, the technology giants said . The fact that two of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies are introducing the initiative is no coincidence. Tech giants are fighting for talented staff in what has become known as the ‘perk arms race’. Facebook’s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, in particular, is known for her pro-women stance. The social media firm gives new parents £3,000 in so-called ‘baby cash’ to spend however they like. Both firms also offer generous wellness-orientated benefits to staff. Critics say the move is simply a ploy to persuade women to stay with the company. Last night an Apple source indicated the company had no plans to extend the policy to the firm’s UK workforce. An Apple spokesman in the US said: ‘We want to empower women at Apple to do the best work of their lives as they care for loved ones and raise their families.’ However Harvard Law School academic Glenn Cohen, asked: ‘Would potential female associates [staff] welcome this option knowing that they can work hard early on and still reproduce, if they so desire, later on? 'Or would they take this as a signal that the firm thinks that working there as an associate and pregnancy are incompatible?’","Silicon Valley giants willing to pay £12,500 a time to put eggs on ice .

"At least 35 inmates of an overcrowded Venezuelan jail have died and 20 more were in comas last night - after what officials said was a mass drug overdose by prisoners who stormed an infirmary. But pressure is building on the government to fully investigate the rising number of deaths at David Viloria Prison in Lara - with human rights activists questioning the officials’ story of what happened. After days of conflicting reports from the government and relatives, the scale of the tragedy became clearer as authorities said 20 of the 100 inmates still being treated for intoxication were in comas. Scroll down for video . Disaster: A relative of a inmate cries while waiting for information outside David Viloria Prison in Venezuela . Pointing out: Relatives of inmates gather to read a local newspaper as they stand by the David Viloria Prison . The government has said the troubles at the prison began last Monday with a hunger strike for better conditions, when a group of violent inmates raided the prison infirmary. They, they are said by officials to have drunk a deadly mix of pure alcohol with drugs used to treat diabetes, epilepsy and high blood pressure. William Ojeda of the ruling socialist party said, after visiting the jail, that many of the intoxicated inmates were drug users with withdrawal symptoms due to the prison's strict regime of abstinence. Prisoner rights activists have doubted the official version, saying that as deplorable as Venezuela's jails are, no inmates would voluntarily end their lives or poison themselves as a form of protest. Watching on: National Guard officers stand guard outside the prison following the deaths of at least 35 inmates . Waiting: Family members have been wondering whether loved ones could have been poisoned to restore order . The lack of information and access to the prison has added to the mystery, with family members wondering whether loved ones could have been poisoned to restore order. Ligia Bolivar, a human rights expert at Andres Bello Catholic University in Caracas said ‘counting the deaths now requires going to the morgue’ as government information is so incomplete. President Nicolas Maduro has yet to comment, even as calls for a thorough investigation have come from Roman Catholic Church leaders in Venezuela and from the United Nations human rights agency. On Thursday, police arrested the jail's warden, Julio Cesar Perez, who is expected to be charged in connection with the deaths.

The government says the situation at the prison is under control after it called in the National Guard and transferred hundreds of inmates to other facilities. All prisoners' rights are being respected, said Nr Ojeda, who is president of a congressional committee that oversees the penitentiary system. Venezuela's prisons are among the world's most violent. Overall, the country's 32 correction facilities are the fifth most-crowded in the world, housing almost three times their intended capacity, according to the London-based International Centre for Prison Studies. The prison population has doubled since 2008 as a result of rampant crime and stiffer mandatory sentences. The David Viloria jail is named for a guard who was one of 58 people killed at the facility last year during the second-deadliest prison riot in Venezuela's history. The prison, previously called La Uribana, was built to hold no more than 850 inmates but was believed to be holding around 3,000 when the latest disturbances broke out. Last year, 506 inmates died in the country's jails, according to the Venezuelan Observatory of Prisons, a watchdog group.","Pressure building on government to investigate rising number of deaths .

"Twitter users have hit back at the GOP staffer who called Malia and Sasha Obama classless - by reminding her of Jenna Bush's more unseemly moments while her father was in office. Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Rep Stephen Fincher, issued a groveling apology on Friday after slamming the President's girls, aged 16 and 13, for wearing casual clothing and looking sullen during the Thanksgiving address. Calling for the self-professed media expert to be sacked, thousands of people responded by tweeting the renowned picture of George W Bush's daughter Jenna drunkenly tumbling over her friend on to the floor of a frat party, cigarette in hand. The 2001 photo, which earned the then 19-year-old the nickname Jenna And Tonic, has gone viral with the hash tag '#classy'. Scroll down for video . Hit back: Twitter users have been sharing pictures of former First Daughter Jenna Bush (left) looking bored and raucous after a GOP staffer slammed Sasha and Malia Obama (right) for 'classless behaviour' 'Classy': Images of George W Bush's daughter have gone viral since the outburst on Thanksgiving Day . Open letter: Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Rep Stephen Fincher, wrote this to the girls . Other responses included a picture of the moment Jenna, one of the former president's twin daughters, stuck out her tongue at White House photographers while riding in the presidential limousine. 'Did you forget that jenna bush got photographed at the age of 19 knocking someone over at a FRAT party? good lord,' one Twitter user wrote. Another commented: 'The Bush twins used fake ID's to get into bars. & Jenna Bush stuck out tongue at press. Is that ""classy?"" @DCGopGirl #tcot #UniteBlue.' One wrote: 'Where were your ignorant comments on the Palin family brawl, the Bush girls (Jenna & Tonic).' 'So Sasha and Malia Obama have no class? Two words: Jenna Bush. #ElizabethLauten,' one tweet read. And one said: 'I have a feeling that Jenna Bush & sister are a little ticked off at #ElizabethLauten for bringing their past behavior into the spotlight.' By Saturday evening hundreds of people had demanded that Lauten lose her job as communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.) under the #FireElizabethLauten Twitter hashtag. Lauten had apologized for her post, writing that 'judgmental feelings truly have no place in my heart', saying that 'hours of prayer' had shown the error of her ways. 'Dear Sasha and Malia,' she wrote in the post, recorded by The Root reporter Yesha Callahan, 'I get you're both in those awful teen years, but you're a part of the First Family, try showing a little class.' Lauten, communications director for Rep Stephen Fincher of Tennessee, added: 'Act like being in the White House matters to you. 'Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar. 'And certainly don't make faces during televised public events.' Reaction: They prompted soft criticism for sullenly scowling at their father, the President, on Thanksgiving . Twitter users rushed to defend the girls who Lauten said 'deserve a spot at a bar' rather than the White House . Sasha, 13, was dressed in a short maroon dress with a long cream cardigan that matched her thick cream socks, worn over bare legs. Her sister Malia, 16, wore black tights under a mini kilt with a grey and cream jumper. After the President had pardoned the designated bird, a four-month-old 49-pounder called Cheese, he asked Malia if she wanted to pet the turkey. 'Nah', she replied, in a rare departure from her usual, gracious disposition, which prompted a flurry of remarks from viewers. Unimpressed: The First Daughters looked bored and unimpressed by their father's jokes about turkey . Clothing: Sasha wore a maroon dress and cardigan while Malia wore a mini kilt with black tights and boots .

'I’ve seen tacky people…but rarely seen someone as tacky as #ElizabethLauten for slamming the children of the #POTUS' she tweeted. One commenter, whose username is Eclectic John, wrote: '@RepFincherTN08 There is nothing that excuses what #ElizabethLauten posted re the children of our President. That's off limits. Fire her now.' The incident was not Lauten's first social media slip-up. In August, she posted a tweet from her boss's verified Twitter account about 'shagging'. Apology: Hours later she removed the original outburst, issued an apology and set her page to private . Firing: Many Twitter users directed messages to Lauten's boss, Stephen Fincher . Stephen Fincher's followers were baffled when he tweeted: 'God I love this song. And beach music. AND shagging #pandora,' in reference to an Embers playlist on Pandora radio. Lauten later deleted the post and apologized for the 'accident' - but insisted 'shagging' is a dance term rather than a sexual reference. 'It had nothing to do with Stephen Fincher. I don’t think he knows what Pandora is; he certainly doesn’t have it,' she said, according to Politico. Following mass outrage to her post on Thursday, Lauten deleted it, set her profile to private, and issued an apology: 'I reacted to an article and quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager. Other accusations: Lauten also took aim at Barack and Michelle Obama, saying they 'don't respect their roles' Her critique was in response to a national broadcast of the annual White House turkey pardon . The national Thanksgiving turkey Cheese is seen in front of Barack Obama and his two daughters . 'After many hours of prayer, talking to my parents and re-reading my words online, I can see more clearly how hurtful my words were. 'Please know that these judgmental feelings truly have no pace in my heart. 'Furthermore, I'd like to apologize to all of those who I have hurt and offended with my words, and pledge to learn and grow (and I assure you I have) from this experience.' This year, Malia and Sasha were declared by TIME as two of its 25 Most Influential Teens of 2014. In an interview earlier this year with Today, Michelle Obama told Jenna Bush Hager their family emphasizes health over appearance: 'We don’t talk about weight. We don't talk about physical appearance. 'We talk about health. We talk about what's on the inside. We spend so much more time talking to our girls about being kind and treating others well, and being passionate and respectful.' Reaction: Twitter users were outraged by Lauten's attack on the young girls on the national holiday .

"Alatan Hsia needs £17,000 to have the pins and needles, pictured here in a doctor's x-ray, removed from her body . A Chinese woman ended up with a real case of pins and needles - after doctors found nine of them embedded in her body. Medics x-rayed Alatan Hsia, from Jarud Banner in north China’s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, in a bid to get to the bottom of incredible pains she had suffered from for more than a decade. But after identifying that pins and needles had been inserted into her body, she now needs to come up with £17,000 to pay for them to be removed. She said: ‘I have suffered from the pain for years. I guess a little while longer before I finally get free of it is something I can bear.’ Some of the needles were easy to remove but others need a complicated medical procedure. One needle is embedded in a lung, one in a kidney and one in the liver. Pins were also found in a leg joint and one was located just three centimetres from her heart. Alatan, a herdswoman on the Mongolian steppe, added: ‘I used to have a terrible marriage. 'My ex-husband Chung Hsiao frequently beat me. Finally, at the end of 2002, I went to my parents’ home to avoid him. ‘One day when I was there and my folks were out he came around and gave me a beating.  He shouted: “If you won't return to me I will kill you.” I was beaten into a coma. 'When I woke up five days later my parents said that there had been no sign of him, and they had put me in bed until I recovered. ‘None of us thought much of it but they also said that they had found nine needles on the ground lying alongside my body.

However, she always felt incredible pain in her body in the following years but it was only when she had an x-ray that she finally discovered the cause.","Medics found nine pins and needles in Alatan Hsia's body after an x-ray .

"A robot that can print itself new 'body' parts and adapt to environments has been made. In a video, the machine is shown struggling - but succeeding - to crawl along the ground after having one of its four limbs removed. And it could herald future robots that can learn how to overcome difficult conditions on other worlds like Mars. Scientists at University of Oslo have created robots that learn to adapt. The multi-limbed machines can overcome environmental challenges. In a video a robot with a limb removed learns how to walk (shown) The robots were created by a team of scientists from the University of Oslo. To make them a 3D printer is fed a list of parameters for the robots including desired speed, size and efficiency. A simulator then pits several different creations in 'fights to the death' before the winning robot is sent to the 3D printer for production. The robot was then 'taught' that it was missing a limb and told to try and walk across the floor. In the video it can be seen how the robot adapts to its situation, and still manages to 'walk' or rawl across the floor. The 3D printers used by the university cost up to £280,000 ($430,000) and are capable of an extremely high level of precision. The robots were created by a team of scientists from the University of Oslo. To make them a 3D printer is fed a list of parameters for the robots including desired speed, size and efficiencies. A simulator then pits several different creations with different limbs and features in 'fights to the death' before selecting a winner . Robots of the future won't just be smart, they could also have ninja-like reflexes. Researchers in the US are studying the way cats and athletes rotate their body mid-air, and hope to recreate that movement in droids. The aim is to reduce the impact on falling robots - especially those that may one day be used for search-and-rescue missions in hazardous conditions. Professor Karen Liu at Georgia Tech University has been simulating the physics of everything from falling cats to the mid-air orientation of divers and astronauts. The study involved using a small robot consisting of a main body and two symmetric legs with paddles. According to IEEE Spectrum, the potential benefits of such a robot are numerous. For example, a Mars rover equipped with a 3D printer could autonomously get itself out of sticky situations. 'In the future, robots must be able to solve tasks in deep mines on distant planets, in radioactive disaster areas, in hazardous landslip areas and on the sea bed beneath the Antarctic,' said Professor Kyrre Glette, from the Robotics and Intelligent Systems research group. 'These environments are so extreme that no human being can cope. Everything needs to be automatically controlled. 'Imagine that the robot is entering the wreckage of a nuclear power plant. It finds a staircase that no-one has thought of. 'The robot takes a picture. The picture is analysed. The arms of one of the robots is fitted with a printer. 'This produces a new robot, or a new part for the existing robot, which enables it to negotiate the stairs.' The research team (shown with some of the robots) say that the technique of autonomously creating parts could be used by future robots on other planets in the solar system .","Scientists at University of Oslo have created robots that learn to adapt .

"Jeb Bush has given himself a deadline of the end of this year to decide whether or not he will made a bid to follow his father and brother's footsteps by running for president. The former Florida governor says all the speculation about whether he'll run in 2016 is actually getting him more attention than if he had already entered the race. Bush has antagonized many Republicans by supporting an immigration overhaul- a topic that he has worked on for years and co-authored a book on immigration reform last year. Scroll down for video . Cooling expectations: Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, seen here in January, has said that he is giving himself to the end of the year to decide about whether or not he wants to run for president . On . immigration, he said that those who come into the country illegally . generally do so because they had no other means to provide for their . family, and what they did is 'not a felony'. 'It's an act of love. It's an act of commitment to your family,' Bush said. 'I . honestly think that that is a different kind of crime. There should be a . price paid, but it shouldn't rile people up that people are actually . coming to this country to provide for their families.' He denied that he's purposefully trying to ramp up the speculation, and expects it will continue until he makes his decision before year's end. He told Fox News Channel in an interview airing Sunday that the state of politics is 'crazy right now'. Side projects: While his brother is now in the political spotlight, former President George Bush (right, with his wife Laura) unveiled a gallery of his work at his presidential library in Texas last week . Outspoken: Former First Lady Barbara Bush, Jeb's mother, has said in the past that she does not think another member of her family should be in the White House . Family portraits: The release of George W. Bush's painting of his father George H.W. Bush (left and right) coincided with the 25th anniversary of the elder George Bush's presidency . Bush says one factor in his decision will be whether he can deliver an optimistic, hopeful message without getting drawn into a political 'mud fight'. He says the other main factor in his decision will be whether his family approves of a run. The interview with Bush occurred at his father's presidential library during the celebration of the 25th anniversary of George. H. W. Bush's presidency. This is just the latest in a series of non-denial denials that Bush, 61, has issued over the past few months. In November, he told CNN: 'There's a time to make a decision. You shouldn't make it too early, you shouldn't make it too late. There's a time. There's a window. And this is not the time for me. This is the time to show a little self-restraint.'","Former Florida governor is considered one of the top contenders for the Republican nomination in 2016 .

"The Premier League proved itself to be the richest league in the world as figures released show how the £1.5 billion of prize money was shared out - with bottom club Cardiff earning over £62million and Liverpool earning more than champions Manchester City. The Merseyside giants earned £97,544,336 from Premier League funds for their 2013-14 campaign, pushing champions Manchester City into second place. City earned £96,578,329. Liverpool earned more than City because 28 of their 38 league games were screened live on TV as opposed to only 25 of City’s and TV appearances are one factor considered. The top five earners were completed by Chelsea (£94.1m), Arsenal (£92.9m) and Tottenham (£89.7m). Last season’s champions and top earners Manchester United were seventh in this season’s Premier League but sixth highest earners with £89.2m. Top of the table: Manchester City's captain Vincent Kompany lifts the Premier League trophy . How the money was divided: Official Premier League payments . At the other end of the table, bottom placed Cardiff City earned £62,082,302 for a campaign in which they ended up relegated to the Championship. Astonishingly this was £1.2m MORE than United pocketed in 2012-13 for winning the title - with the huge increases this season a result of the lucrative new TV deals now in place. Sky and BT Sport are paying £3.018 billion between them to show Premier League matches live in the UK across three seasons from 2013 to 2016 inclusive. Foreign broadcasters around world are paying another £2.3 billion combined, on top, for the same period. TV turn on: Luis Suarez and Liverpool were the side who were featured most on television . The Premier League also earns money from the sales of highlights (on Match of the Day) and near-live rights (on Sky) and brings in further sums from commercial deals like the one with headline sponsor Barclays. All that cash goes into one big pot and the sums announced today are the hard eye-watering rewards for the clubs. Every club gets an ‘equal’ share of £52,198,111, which derives from domestic TV income (£21,631,444 per club), overseas income (£26,295,817) and commercial income (£4,270,850). Every club then gets another sum depending on league position, worth £1,236,083 per place in the table, from that sum for bottom-placed Cardiff to £24,721,600 to winners City. Bottom of the list: Stoke's games were broadcast the least in the Premier League . Fall from grace: Manchester United went from Champions last season to seventh this . Each club also gets a variable amount depending on how many times they were shown live on Sky or BT this season. Every club got a minimum of £8.6m from this pot, even if they were shown as rarely as Stoke (just seven live televised games). Liverpool, shown 28 times, got £21.9m in these ‘facility fees’. This season’s rewards are a huge leap on last season’s TV income, with Liverpool earning £42.7m more than season than last, for example.","Liverpool earned more prize money than champions Manchester City .

"A former college teammate of Dallas Cowboys running back DeMarco Murray unleashed a string of furious tweets that allege his wife is sleeping with the NFL star. Brennan Clay played alongside Murray, 26, for the University of Oklahoma Sooners in the 2010 season. Before heading off to church Sunday, Clay, 22, told the world his wife of just five months, Gina D'Agostini, is having an affair with Murray.' Scroll down for video . Love triangle: Dallas Cowboys running back DeMarco Murray (right) has been accused of having an affair with Dallas fitness instructor Gina D'Agostini -- who also happens to be the wife of his former college teammate, Brennan Clay . Left in the cold? Murray's accuser was the former teammate and spurned husband himself, 22-year-old ex Oklahoma Sooners running back Brennan Clay (pictured in 2013) 'So Demarco Murray was having an affair with my wife...I'm done...' Clay wrote Sunday afternoon to his nearly 25,000 followers. Clay did not specify how long he believes his wife and the NFL player were together, nor did he say whether the affair has ended. However, he did offer a couple of reasons their alleged affair is so wrong. '1 has a baby momma and she has 2 kids,' he wrote. Michigan native D'Agostini does not have children with Clay. Murray has a baby with former Passions actress Heidi Mueller. Clay failed to mention what might make such an affair so painful for him, besides the obvious feeling of betrayal: he and D'Agostini have been married just five months according to a Facebook profile that appears to belong to Clay. Clay did not fail to convey how he feels about the alleged breach of trust, however. 'I'm disgusted...' Clay wrote, before heading off for some spiritual consolation. 'I'm disgusted': Clay (left) and D'Agostini (right) have been married just five months, according to the 22-year-old former college football player's Facebook page .

"There are two options open to Chris Avalos when he enters the cauldron of Belfast’s Odyssey Arena this Saturday night to challenge Carl Frampton for the super-bantamweight championship of the world. ‘Fight or flight,’ says Frampton. ‘It’s up to him. ‘I hope it’s fight because that will be more entertaining for the fans and better for me. ‘But this is the hottest atmosphere for any sporting event in Ireland these days and there’s no telling which way my opponents will react when it hits them.’ Carl Frampton attends a press conference ahead of his world title defence against Chris Avalos . The IBF world super bantamweight champion exchanges words with the Mexican-American challenger . The fight will be broadcast on ITV in big-time boxing's first return for nearly a decade . Frampton sits with his young daughter, Carla, and mother, Flo (left), ahead of the press conference . Frampton knocks down Martinez during their IBF super-bantamweight world title bout in September . Frampton is optimistic that Avalos, an archetypal Mexican-American warrior by reputation, is coming to play his part in a spectacle which will carry the fanaticism for The Jackal across to mainland Britain as well as expand the audience for boxing in this country. The excitement surrounding Frampton has encouraged ITV to bring prize-fighting back to mainstream terrestrial television here for the first time in almost a decade. It gives Frampton’s promoter and mentor – Belfast’s legendary former world champion Barry McGuigan – the chance to generate wider public interest in his protege not just in Britain but around the world. This fight is being broadcast live in 55 other countries, including the United States where expectation is mounting for a title unification match between Frampton and Cuba’s ex-amateur genius Guillermo Rigondeaux. Before travelling to America, Frampton is more than willing to hop over to Manchester this summer to put his IBF belt on the line in a battle of Britain with Bury’s ‘regular’ WBA champion Scott Quigg. Both those fights have the potential to elevate Frampton from Belfast folk hero to global stardom but he knows that depends, firstly, on a stellar performance against Avalos. Avalos is expected to provide a stiff challenge for the reigning champion in Belfast on Saturday . The Northern Irishman is managed by former boxing great Barry McGuigan (left) The challenger engages in some word sparring with Frampton ahead of the main event on Saturday . Avalos defeats Khabir Suleymanov in round 10 of their super bantamweight clash in 2011 . ‘I’m under no illusions about this,’ he says. ‘I’m on the brink of something big now. I can’t afford any slip-ups at this stage and I need to continue to impress. There’s too much at stake.’ In that realisation Frampton has worked harder than ever under his trainer, McGuigan’s son Shane, in the intense confines of their gym in London’s increasingly fashionable Battersea. At just turned 28 – last Saturday - and with13 KO’s in his perfect 19-win record – he stands ready to deliver again. ‘I’m pretty confident of knocking Avalos out,’ he says thoughtfully, without bombast. ‘He’s a very good fighter and I expect him to be tougher than Quigg when we get round to that one. Certainly more aggressive. But because he usually comes on the offensive and leaves himself open to be hit I do think I will stop him.’ Frampton has put in more than 200 rounds of sparring against high-quality fighters, some of them markedly bigger than himself. With none of them proving able to go 12 rounds with him, that chore has been shared among them when he insists boxing the full championship distance. It is not only to ensure victory over Avalos, his mandatory challenger, that Frampton is living the Spartan life demanded of all who would be great champions. Frampton poses for pictures ahead of a public workout in Victoria Square, Belfast . Avalos takes part in the public workout in the Belfast shopping mall . ‘My ambition is not celebrity but to become acknowledged as the best super-bantamweight,’ he says. ‘And at some point soon that will mean beating not only Quigg but Rigondeaux, who everyone considers the greatest and I understand why at the moment. ‘Then, if I can do that, I will move up in weight in the hope that being a two-division world champion might be enough for me to be elected to the Hall of Fame.’ Frampton would like to add a win over WBC super-bantamweight belt holder, Leo Santa Cruz, to that resume but that US-based Mexican no longer appears as willing to face him as Avalos. Since joining the growing stable of top fighters in advisor Al Haymon’s stable, Santa Cruz has not only veered away from a big fight with Rigondeaux but also seems to be losing enthusiasm for taking on Frampton in either a Belfast stadium or in America. That increases the demands on Frampton to impress this weekend and then, probably, against Quigg in early summer. But he says: ‘I’m used to the pressure because I know I carry so many hopes for Belfast and Ulster with me into the ring.’ Frampton works out as he sets his sights on a unification fight with Guillermo Rigondeaux . Frampton poses withSportsmail's Jeff Powell (left) and  McGuigan (right) in a Battersea gym . Frampton’s title-winning triumph over Kiko Martinez drew a 20,000 crowd to an open-air pop-arena in the historic dockyards where the Titanic was constructed – drawn from both sides of the sectarian divide, with men, women and children united in their vociferous support for this young Protestant who is happily married to a Catholic. But it is within the confines of the Odyssey that they raise the roof. Expect the crescendo to come with Frampton landing his KO in or near the eighth round.

"Major Richard Streatfeild before he gave evidence in the inquest into the death of Lance corporal Michael Pritchard, which he claims was caused by a lack of proper equipment and training . The poster boy for the Ministry of Defence has lifted the lid on the 'poor training and equipment' that soldiers were given during combat in Afghanistan, stating that it simply 'wasn't good enough'. Major Richard Streatfeild, 40,described how he felt ashamed at how defended kit and training he knew to be inadequate on reports on the war for the BBC, sticking to lines given by the MOD. The former army commander was a senior officer in the Sangin insurgent stronghold, who commanded A Company, 4 Battalion, The Rifles, during a seven-month tour, which saw some of the fiercest fighting in the war. According to the Major Streatfeild, the problems with equipment and training was a major factor in the death of Lance Corporal Michael Pritchard in the winter of 2009 - 2010 in Sangin, where he was killed when a British sniper mistook him for a Taliban fighter. Streatfeild said 22-year-old's 'blue on blue' death was indicative of the of the problems the British army faced in in fighting the Taliban, and he called on the MoD to give Pritchard's family an apology. 'In an interview with the Guardian, Streafeild said: 'It's true to say we were the best trained we'd ever been, and we did . have the best equipment we'd ever had. 'But it is also true to say it . wasn't good enough in relation to the operation we were going on and the . tasks we were being asked to do. Michael Pritchard in Afghanistan, the young soldier who was accidentally shot dead by a comrade while on active service by a sniper who thought he was a Taliban fighter. Streatfeild claims 'battlefield beacons' could have been used to save Pritchard's life . 'Undoubtedly the core equipment has been found to be inadequate. Before I went out there I felt ready. Hindsight suggests we were far from being the finished article.' Lance Corporal Michael David Pritchard 22, of the 4th Regiment, Royal Military Police, who was killed as a result of small arms fire in Afghanistan . Streatfeild criticised the way the MoD decided to buy their kit at short notice because they did not have it ready when they began conflict in Afghanistan. Following his command in Afghanistan, Streatfeild took a position in Whitehall as an MoD procurement officer, where he noticed defence budget cuts add to the army's existing problems. He said he was frustrated by the cuts, and that they procured the minimum level every time, but could not say anything externally because he was still in the army. When he brought it up internally, he was largely ignored, and instead would have to publicly defend the kit provided during training and on operations commanding British troops in the Helmand Province. During his time as a commander in the British army, he lost five men in the tour of the Helmand Province, and blamed, in part, poor communication due to a lack of radios. According to Streatfeild, the army gave misleading evidence in an inquest into the death of Pritchard, by saying that they were going to buy battlefield beacons, which would have saved his live. Streatfeild said that it was important to recognise that while the army might have intended to buy the battlefield beacons, the money was simply not there to buy it. In reference to Pritchard's family, and in particular his mother, Streatfeild said that she could get a formal apology from the MoD, calling on them to take responsibility for the mistake. Prtichard's mother, Helen Perry, told the Guardian that the revelations by Streatfeild into army equipment and training confirmed the worst fears she had about her son's death. Among Streatfeild's revelations into the problems facing the army was that they lacked proper equipment for the field of battle, a claim that the MoD rejects . She believes that her son's death was not only completely preventable, it was caused through complete incompetence, in both leadership and equipment. The MoD responded to the circumstances that led to Pritchard's death, saying they were constantly reviewing equipment requirements, and since 2003 the Urgent Operational Requirements process, which buys emergency new equipment for the army, has delivered more than £5.8 billion worth of equipment to the front line, which has saved countless lives. They also claimed that no soldier is sent to the theatre of war without necessary training. MoD didn't to upgrade essential parts of the army's core kit . despite pledging billions of pounds to pay for the Royal Navy's two new . aircraft carriers and Typhoon jets for the Royal Air Force. The MoD took too much time deliberating about . spending money on beacons that allow commanders to identify their own . troops on the battlefield, tech that could have prevented Pritchard's 'blue on blue' death. Streatfeild identified the way the MoD bought their equipment at short notice was a morally dubious way to equip the army. The MoD lacked basic equipment during training, including, but not limited to, metal detectors for hunting IEDs .","Major Streatfeild commanded soldiers in Helmand Province and Sangin .

"A graduate student who shamed his insurance company into agreeing to pay his mounting cancer bills by targeting its CEO on Twitter has died. Arijit Guha's wife Heather Ehlers set up a tribute page to the 32-year-old on Facebook, where his battle with cancer is described as 'spirited, graceful, and inspirational'. He was diagnosed with colon cancer aged 30 and vented his frustration at insurance company Aetna on Twitter when he was told he had exhausted his policy's $300,000 lifetime limit - despite having at least $118,000 of medical expenses still to pay. 'Inspirational': Arijit Guha, who shamed his insurance company on Twitter into paying his medical bills, has died . But the firm eventually backed down and told Mr Guha, who had taken out the policy under Arizona State University's health plan at $400 a month, it would pay 'every last penny'. A close friend told ABC News that Mr Guha had run out of treatment options and had been in hospice care for 'many months'. Ms Elhers said he died at home. She wrote on Facebook that 'his life was one of love, optimism, joy, humor, and compassion' and described him as a 'rabble rouser, do-gooder, mustache enthusiast'. She added: 'My heart is aching, but . the pain is eased a bit knowing that he has the support of such an . amazing community of people, so many of whom have never met him.' 'Life and hope': Family and friends have been leaving tributes to Mr Guha on the Facebook tribute page . Facebook user Naveen Rao, from Austin, Texas, wrote that Arijit's life story and what he achieved on Twitter . would stay with him 'forever', and Mario Gastelum added: 'May his . message of affordable health care live long.

The Phd student discovered he had . cancer after returning from a trip to India. Stomach pain, which he . initially thought was bug picked up on his trip, was diagnosed as stage . four colon cancer a month later. However, it was only after his diagnosis that he learned Aetna were to restrict payment for his treatment. While he was still able to receive . life-saving treatment, Mr Ghua had no way of paying for it and was . facing potential medical bankruptcy. He discovered soon after undergoing surgery and chemotherapy, he had exhausted his policy's lifetime limit. Despite the law abolishing lifetime . limits, under the Affordable Healthcare Act, this did not include . student health plans until August 1. Out of desperation and frustration, furious Mr Guha took to Twitter to highlight his case. The company responded with this tweet: 'We care about members. We want you to be empowered to be healthy and make informed decisions.' To which Mr Guha replied: 'That's so sweet that you want me to be . empowered. Does [Mark Bertolini] care to empower me by paying my $118k - . and counting - in bills?' Other Twitter users waded in on the argument, many mocking the choice of words used by the patient. One user, @Chris_Ashworth posted: . '[Aetna} want you to be *empowered to be healthy*! They are denying you . coverage to *empower* you. See?' Another, @ItsLerema tweeted: 'My . bud, a PHD students with Stage 4 [cancer] was shamefully kicked off his . insurance. Btw congrats [Mark Bertolini] on the $10.6m CEO salary.'

It was at this stage Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini responded to the tweets, denying Mr Guha had been kicked off his policy. Mr Guha asked him: 'True or false: I am in this situation because your company offers a crappy product?' And Bertolini replied: 'False. Why do you think the premium was so low? Do you look at your policy limits when you buy other insurance (auto)?' The cancer sufferer then asked: . 'Moreover, isn't it morally reprehensible that you offer such a limit . product? One that caps benefits so low?' After a flurry of angry online exchanges continued between the two and their discussion then moved to the telephone. However, the next day Mr Guha made the announcement via his Facebook page that Aetna had backed down. Wading in: The online exchange prompted a series of angry tweets from other Twitter users . He wrote: 'Breaking news: Aetna just agreed to cover the full extent of my bills. Every last penny.It's a battle I never should have been waging, but things were what they were and I'm so absolutely thrilled we won!' Before his victory with Aetna, Mr Guha had launched a fundraising campaign called Poop Strong - based on the cancer survivor Lance Armstrong's slogan of Live Strong. He had managed to raise more than $100,000 by selling t-shirts with the Poop Strong logo on them to pay for any ongoing and future treatment - a sum he planned to donate to charity when Aetna agreed to pay his bills. CEO Bertolini - a former paramedic - later tweeted: 'The system is broken and I am committed to fixing it.

"The Iranian Revolutionary Guard today went on to a war footing as its commander upped his troops' readiness for operations. The move by General Mohammed Ali Jaafari, coming after the shooting down of a U.S. drone and the ransacking of the British embassy in Tehran, will raise fears among citizens in the West that the Islamists are escalating towards major conflict. But following on from mysterious explosions at Iranian nuclear sites, the kidnapping and assassination of scientists and possible sabotage of computers using a virus, an increasing number of experts are suggesting that combat has already broken out - a '21st century war'. Operational status: Iran's Revolutionary Guard have been put on a war footing by the country's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei over fears of an attack by the West on its nuclear facilities . The key area of dispute is Iran's rapidly expanding nuclear programme from which President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad insists he will not budge 'one iota'. Sanctions and mounting international pressure appear to have failed to persuade the country  to slow down its pursuit of uranium enrichment. And many observers believe the blowing-up of facilities and targeting of key scientists is a more direct way of halting their ambitions. Patrick Clawson, of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said he was under no illusion as to what was occurring. He told the Los Angeles Times: 'It looks like the 21st century form of war. 'It does appear that there is a campaign of assassinations and cyber war, as well as the semi-acknowledged campaign of sabotage.' What is not clear is whose hand is behind the 'attacks' on Iran's nuclear sites. Under attack? A satellite image of the Revolutionary Guard base near Bid Kaneh taken in September. A mysterious explosion destroyed many of the buildings last month . Sabotage? The same base after the explosion on November 12, which some have claimed was the work of U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies . One retired U.S. official, with up to date intelligence, told the National Journal: 'It's safe to say the Israelis are very active.' He added about U.S. efforts: 'Everything that [GOP presidential candidate] Mitt Romney said we should be doing - tough sanctions, covert action and pressuring the international community  - are all of the things we are actually doing.' On November 12, a huge explosion flattened the Revolutionary Guard base at Bid Kaneh, killing 17 people including a founder of Iran's ballistic missile programme. A separate blast last week badly damaged the uranium enrichment facility in Isfahan. Two nuclear physicists were killed and Fereydoun Abbasi-Davani, head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, were wounded by bombs attached to their cars or detonated near them last year. Advanced: Iran claimed yesterday to have shot down a U.S. high-tech RQ-170 drone. There are fears the regime could gain stealth technology information if they have secured the drone . Mark Hibbs, a nuclear expert at the Carnegie Endowment in Germany, said the intensity of the covert war indicated that this is where the U.S. and Israel are putting their energy for now. He said: 'If the U.S. or Israel were determined to take Iran’s nuclear installations out they wouldn’t be wasting time pinpointing individual scientists like this.' But, he pointed out, Israel’s 1981 attack on Iraq’s Osirak reactor was also preceded by assassination attempts on Iraqi scientists. Hibbs said: 'Some of the concern in the expert community is that in going down this route we’re unleashing forces we cannot control.' That is seen as a reference to the Stuxnet computer worm which infected the nuclear facilities in 2010, and was believed to be the work of U.S and Israeli engineers. But a source senior within the Obama administration indicated that the U.S. was not involved in every action. He added: 'I wouldn’t assume that everything we do is coordinated.' Tensions: Protesters set fire to the British and Israeli flags during demonstrations in the Iranian capital Tehran last week . Anger: A protester breaks the emblem of the British embassy in Tehran after a mob of students attacked the building . Abbasi-Davani accused Great Britain, Israel and the U.S. of conducting attacks on him and other Iranian scientists. He told a news conference at the annual conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna: 'Six years ago the intelligence service of the UK began collecting information and data regarding my past, my family, the number of children.' It was the IAEA which produced a report detailing how close Iran was to producing the bomb that has racheted up tension between Washington and Tehran in recent weeks. It culminated last week with the storming of the British embassy, during which time staff were held hostage and more than £1 million of damage caused, and led Britain to expel Iranian diplomats. Seeing pictures of the Royal Family torn and historic paintings broken only served to fuel the enmity between the countries. Dominick Chilcott, Britain's ambassador to Iran who lost his dog in the incident, accused the Iranians of supporting it. That theory appeared founded when the handful of protesters arrested were released without charge earlier this week. Damage: A shattered window in the office of the British Embassy. Several other countries withdrew their ambassadors after the attack last week, which came in response to further sanctions on Iran's nuclear programme . Then, on Sunday, Bahrain's interior ministry announced that an explosion occurred inside a minibus parked near the British Embassy. However, there were no injuries. Furthermore, a plot to kill the Saudi Ambassador to Washington was uncovered and foiled in the U.S. with America blaming the Iranians, who were celebrating at the weekend the latest in the round of tit-for-tat propaganda victories with the downing on a U.S. drone so hi-tech that no pictures of it have ever been released. 'This is a big prize in terms of technology,' a senior U.S. military source said after the downing of the RQ-170 drone. Defiant: President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said he country will not budge from its nuclear programme, which he insists is for peaceful means . The Iranian news agency said it was show down after illegally crossing the country's eastern border, although a U.S. military official said it had 'absolutely no indication' the drone was shot down. Neither the Air Force nor manufacturer Lockheed Martin has released much information about the plane, which was dubbed The Beast of Kandahar in 2007 when its existence was finally confirmed. Early reports suggested that the plane - which supposedly has a wingspan of about 65ft and can fly at around 50,000ft - would be made almost entirely without metal to help it dodge radar. The White House declined to comment but officials did not seem unduly alarmed, suggesting that the drone's capture would not provide Iran with significant information about U.S. surveillance technology and techniques. Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council in Washington, said the build-up of incidents 'add up to a very worrisome picture'. This was, he said, in part because 'the Iranians are absorbing all of these assassinations without seeing the pace of their nuclear program slow down to the extent it would be acceptable to the West.' But if Iranian retaliations grow serious enough, he said, they could provide 'the pretext for a much larger war' in which the Israelis, and possibly the Americans, launch a full attack on Iran. Gen Jaafari responded by ordering Revolutionary Guard units to move long-range Shahab missile to prevent them being targeted. A protest slogan opposite the Houses of Parliament in London. Many fear Israel could take preemptive action to halt Iran's nuclear programme . The Iranian air force has also been carrying out exercises to respond to any attack from the air and says it will deal seriously with any further incursions into its airspace. Amid all this comes a report today compiled by the American Enterprise Institute for Publc Policy Research (AEI) that suggested Western efforts to stop Iran getting nuclear weapons had a real chance of failing. The report says the U.S. would have to 'lead an international effort to contain Iran and deter the Islamic Republic from using its nuclear capability'. The conservative think-tank will release its report, 'Containing and Deterring a Nuclear Iran', later today. Vice President Danielle Pletka told Foreign Policy Magazine: 'The report is very much an acknowledgement of the very real possibility of failure of the strategy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and any responsible party should recognise that failure is an option.' The report says Iran could realise its nuclear ambitions before the 2012 U.S. presidential election, with the Obama administration reticent to sanction action before the November ballot. But other Middle East countries have insisted Iran does not represent a threat to the West. UAE Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum told CNN: 'I don't believe that Iran will develop a nuclear weapon. Will they hit Israel? How many Palestinians will die? And you think if Iran hits Israel, their cities will be safe? They will be gone the next day.' Backlash: Sanctions on Iran's nuclear industry were heightened after a report was published last month which revealed the Islamic Republic was likely to be developing nuclear weapons .","Iran moves long-range missiles to prevent them being targeted in an attack .

"For traffic policeman Tony Lepore, going on the beat is more than just a job... he takes the term quite literally. The twinkle-toed officer has become a crossroad sensation in Providence, Rhode Island, after turning his daily car management duties into a highly-choreographed dance routine. He spins on his heels, drops to his knees, falls back on his hands and springs back upright, all while blowing his whistle rhythmically as he points his white-gloved fingers frantically from side to side. Scroll down for video. On the beat: Tony Lepore has become a crossroad sensation after turning his daily car management duties into a highly-choreographed dance routine . Mr Lepore has been entertaining motorists since 1984 when he came up with the moves to alleviate boredom after he was transferred from night shifts foiling crime to traffic duties. At the age of 65 he is now retired, but has become such a hit in the town that the mayor invites him back to the same busy intersection every Christmas to bring a extra holiday cheer to commuters. He says he was inspired by a prank shown on TV classic Candid Camera, and decided to add his own fancy footwork, gyrating and flamboyant arm movements to his traffic direction. Speaking in 2009, he said: 'I saw Candid Camera and I thought, ""Gee, maybe tomorrow I'm going to try a couple of spins and hand movements""... But I didn't know if my bosses were going to like it.' Cop a load of this: Mr Lepore is now retired but his act had become so popular that he was invited by the mayor to reprise his act specially for the Christmas season . Fancy footwork: He spins on his heels, drops to his knees, falls back on his hands and springs back upright . Feel the rhythm: He keeps the beat by blowing on his whistle rhythmically as he points his white-gloved fingers frantically from side to side . Hero: The Vietnam veteran has had his share of serious police work, spending nine years on night duty in Providence and being decorated for valour in the line of duty . However, amused motorists loved him so much, police chiefs allowed him to carry on. The Vietnam War veteran has had his share of serious police work, spending nine years on night duty in Providence. He has even been twice decorated with the coveted Medal of Valor for bravery in the line of duty. He once saved two teenage girls by diving into the freezing river after their car overturned into the water. On another occasion he pulled workers from the rubble of a building levelled by an explosion - just in time to save them from a second blast. Candid camera: Inspired by an old set-up on TV classic Candid Camera, Mr Lepore began adding fancy footwork and flamboyant arm movements to his traffic direction . Popular: He began the routine in 1984 and motorists liked it so much police chiefs allowed him to carry on . But a transfer to day duty and directing traffic left him bored, he says. Three years after inventing his trademark dance routine, Mr Lepore retired and went into catering with his brother, but the mayor of Providence asked him back in 1992 after a local newspaper interviewed him for a 'Whatever happened to' feature - and he is still doing it now. Indeed, he even offers himself as a 'Tony-a-gram' for birthdays, graduations and office parties in which he will perform his famous 'traffic hop' for guests. He also performs at schools across America with lessons on 'School Bus Safety, Stranger Danger, Halloween Safety, Street Crossing Safety', according to his website.","Tony Lepore has delighted  Rhode Island drivers with his moves since 1984 .

"The Moscow billionaire who recruited Lord Mandelson as a director of his major Russian company has been held under house arrest and accused of money laundering. Vladimir Yevtushenkov, 65, chairman of AFK Sistema, is being probed in Russia for obtaining shares in an oil company by 'criminal means'. The move against one of the country's most successful and respected tycoons stunned business circles in Moscow, already reeling from the impact of Western sanctions and a plunging rouble which sank this week to its lowest-ever level against the dollar. Russian Billionaire Vladimir Yevtushenkov, left, who recruited Lord Mandelson, right, as a director of his Russian company has been held under house arrest and accused of money laundering . There are fears that the action is 'political' and it has been likened to the arrest in 2003 of oil baron Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who held in jail for more than a decade. Yevtushenkov - who has a fortune of £5.5 billion - recruited the Labour peer - a former senior government minister and EU commissioner - last year to the board of Sistema, a conglomerate with significant interests in the energy, technology, banking, retail, telecoms and tourism sectors. The tycoon strongly denies any wrongdoing, saying the accusations are 'completely groundless'.  'We are going to use all our energy to contest it,' said a spokeswoman. He has been placed under house arrest for two months and barred from any external contacts except with his lawyers and investigators. If found guilty he could face up to seven years in jail. Analysts say that Yevtushenkov was embroiled in a battle with close Vladimir Putin associate Igor Sechin - head of the Rosneft energy giant - for control over oil company Bashneft. 'Investigators . have reasonable grounds to believe that Sistema Board Chairman Vladimir . Yevtushenkov is involved in the legalisation of property acquired by . criminal means. He was accused of money-laundering,' said the powerful . Russian Investigative Committee. Row? Analysts say that Yevtushenkov was embroiled in a battle with Igor Sechin, right, a close associate of Vladimir Putin, left, for control over oil company Bashneft . Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was 'wrong and absurd' to claim political motives behind the arrest. He acknowledged the Kremlin leader was following developments. 'The president expressed hope that investigators would conduct an unbiased probe and find answers to all questions,' he said. However, the head of a big business lobby group directly compared it to the Khodorkovsky case 'because the charges apply to the head of a company that paid $2.5 billion for assets and is now accused of stealing shares and money-laundering'. Khodorkovsky's oil company Yukos was dismantled with Rosneft the main beneficiary of its assets. 'Without doubt this looks very like 'Yukos Mark Two,' said  Alexander Shokhin, head of the Russian Federation of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. Khodorkovsky said that Yevtushenkov was 'stubborn' in rejecting an offer for his shares. 'So it was decided to use the familiar old method,' he said. The case is bound to further dent business confidence in Russia which has taken a pounding since the start of the Ukraine crisis.","Vladimir Yevtushenkov, 65, is chairman of holding company AFK Sistema .

"ITV's first night of World Cup coverage was beset with problems as protesters hurled rocks at its beach-side studio and the channel's online service went down during the opening game.

He said: ‘This demonstration materialised about 10 minutes before the end of the game. ‘We were all sitting up here and then suddenly sharp clattering sounds started greeting our ears, and that was them pelting the glass of our studio and other studios around here. We did try to explain to them that none of this is our fault at ITV Sport.’ Football legend Gary Lineker also voiced his opinion on the attack. He . posted a picture on his Twitter profile of police in full riot gear at the scene after the . protest broke out and captioned it with: 'Best defence on show this . evening, right outside the TV studios'.

"Tyson Fury says his father's release from prison next month will further inspire him to win the world title this year. 'Gypsy' John Fury, himself a former professional heavyweight, has been inside since being given an 11-year sentence back in February 2011 after gauging a man's eye out in a brawl. Fury had been young Tyson's trainer but he has not watched his son fight live for almost five years – when he beat John McDermott for the vacant English title in 2010 . Tyson Fury (right) takes on Christian Hammer at the O2 Arena in London next month . Fury will be a short favourite against Hammer who has lost three of his 20 fights . The 26-year-old has come a long way since that night, now under the tutelage of John's brother and highly respected trainer Peter, and has worked his way into the mandatory position for Wladimir Klitschko's WBO title. Fury's next test comes against Christian Hammer on February 28 at London's 02 Arena, after which he will pursue that shot at Klitschko or even a showdown with American knock-out artist Deontay Wilder, who is now the WBC belt holder. It is unclear whether Fury senior, who has spent time at his son's gym while on day release, will be allowed to attend the Hammer clash due to the terms of his release, but he will be able to watch the fight as a free man for the first time since 2010. Fury said: 'My father gets out on February 11. 'I'm not too sure if he will be allowed to come to the Christian Hammer fight. I don't know the rules and regulations of his release will be but it is something I'm not focusing on. Fury is fighting for the first time since his emphatic win over Dereck Chisora last November . Fury dominated Chisora for 10 rounds of their rematch before the Londoner retired on his stool . 'He is out in three weeks now so he will be coming down to the gym and helping out - doing whatever the governing bodies say - that's what he will have to do. 'It has been good having him around in the gym and stuff - it's my dad isn't it? We have a close relationship so it's always good and inspiring to have him about.' February 28 will be Fury's first outing since he outclassed Dereck Chisora at the ExCeL Arena with a fine boxing display, much of which was spent in the southpaw stance before his opponent was retired at the end of the 10th round. That bout came on November 29 and allowed him to spend some time out over Christmas before focusing on a huge 2015. But he has now returned to the 'brutal' schedule arranged by uncle Peter at their gym in Bolton, which they live above during camp. The 26-year-old said: 'I had about five weeks off over Christmas and New Year and indulged in a lot of nice foods. I took advantage of what I had just done in the Chisora fight and appreciated being around my family and kids. Fury is the mandatory challenger to world champion Wladimir Klitschko and hopes to fight him this year . 'You don't realise what you miss when you're away until you spend a lot of time with them. I'm now back in training camp and that was hard in the beginning because I was used to waking up and being with the kids and taking them to school. 'Being back in strict training camp with three sessions a day is a hard regime but work has got to be done and bills have got to be paid. 'I'm back in Bolton, living above the gym, five days a week up there and home for the weekend and then back to Bolton on Sunday night. It's a good scheduled routine for me.' Fury added: 'In the past I've made very bold predictions but I'm starting to become very correct in what I say. So I am not going to predict something unless I truly believe it is going to happen. 'I believe it's my destiny from being born to become heavyweight champion of the world. After having one amateur fight I thought so. Nothing has really changed. I don't aim low when I aim to achieve, it's all or nothing.'","Tyson Fury takes on Christian Hammer in London next month .

"Actor-comedian Tracy Morgan has been moved from a hospital to a rehabilitation facility as he recovers from a serious auto accident in New Jersey, his spokesman said Friday. The former star of 30 Rock is showing signs of improvement, but has a long road to full recovery, spokesman Lewis Kay said in an email. Morgan suffered a broken leg and broken ribs in the June 7 accident. Kay didn't identify the rehab facility where Morgan is staying, saying only that it is in New Jersey. Legal action: Tracy Morgan was released from rehab on Saturday as he is suing Wal Mart after one of the company's truck drivers smashed into his limo leaving him seriously injured . Not guilty plea: Kevin Roper (leaving court on June 11), a Wal-Mart truck driver from Georgia, was charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto on the New Jersey Turnpike on June 7 . Morgan's limousine van was hit from . behind by a Wal-Mart truck on the New Jersey Turnpike. Morgan's friend . James McNair, 62, of Peekskill, New York, was killed and Morgan and two . other men were seriously injured. On . Thursday, a report by federal transportation safety investigators said . the truck driver was speeding before he slammed into the limousine van . on a stretch of the turnpike where the speed limit was lowered to 45 mph . due to construction. The . report also raised anew questions about driver Kevin Roper's work hours . and whether they were in conflict with federal safety guidelines. The . 35-year-old Roper, of Jonesboro, Georgia, has pleaded not guilty to one . count of death by auto and four counts of assault by auto. Devastating damage: Investigators have released images that show the extent of the damage to the Mercedes Benz limo van Morgan was riding in when the accident happened . Returning to strength: A report on the crash that seriously injured the comedian says the driver of a tractor-trailer was speeding before the crash . Roper had been on the job about 13 1/2 hours at the time of the crash, the report concluded. Federal rules permit truck drivers to work up to 14 hours a day, with a maximum of 11 hours behind the wheel. Had Roper continued to his eventual destination in Perth Amboy, he would have been pushing the 14-hour limit if he drove at the speed limit. A Wal-Mart spokeswoman didn't comment Thursday on Roper's hours or his itinerary. Messages left Thursday at several phone numbers listed for Roper's attorney were not immediately returned. Morgan's assistant, Jeffrey Millea, of Shelton, Connecticut, has been upgraded from serious to fair condition, according to Kay. Hospital officials said this week that comedian Ardie Fuqua, of Jersey City, remains in critical condition.","Tracy Morgan has been moved from hospital to a rehabilitation facility .

"Enormous knitted mittens, bizarre hats made out of wooden planks, models with 'blacked out' faces, and men sashaying down the catwalk in frilly dresses. This year's Men's Fashion Week has been nothing if not outlandish. The three-day event, which started at the MAN show on Monday with the aforementioned plank hats and blacked-up faces, has seen designers from Vivienne Westwood to J.W. Anderson via MAN, Topman and Shaun Samson seemingly compete to out-crazy each other on the catwalk. The London event, sponsored by Topman, sees 60 menswear . designers showcase their wares for autumn/winter 2013 in front of assembled press and buyers from over 45 countries - and is a showcase for what is a £6.5bn fashion industry.

And things never recovered from there. Martine . Rose's A/W 2013 collection took inspiration from the traditional pub . with garments made out of beer mats and bar towels. Sibling, a . collaboration between designers Joe Bates, Sid Bryan and Cozette . McCreery described as being 'all for one and one for all', sent out embarrassed-looking models clad in enormous, loose-knit jumpers and mittens, complete with snoods that pulled up over their heads.

"PSG boss Laurent Blanc has admitted his side is not in a good state ahead of their clash with Barcelona. 'We'll be against our masters, almost, tomorrow,' Blanc told a news conference as he prepared to host Luis Enrique's side at the Parc des Princes.

"Amir Khan is considering setting aside his reluctance to box on Floyd Mayweather's undercard so he can seek revenge against the fighter whose drug-fuelled victory put the skids under his career for a couple of years. Lamont Peterson, who was gifted a scandalous home-town decision over Khan, was found later to have been on steroids that dodgy night in Washington. That revelation came as Peterson tested positive during the build up to their re-match. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Khan in training, and Fury and Chisora interviews . In the zone: Amir Khan is considering fighting on Floyd Mayweather's undercard in Las Vegas in May . Training days: Khan has returned to England to continue preparation for his comeback fight . Now, ironically, Peterson may be the man to offer Khan a route back to the top and perhaps even renewed hope of the mega-millions bout with Mayweather from which he has just been unceremoniously dumped. That door has been opened by Peterson signing a management deal with Al Haymon, the secretive Svengali to a galaxy of star fighters, Mayweather among them. Haymon works closely with Golden Boy Promotions, whose stable includes Khan and who also organise Mayweather’s big shows. Even more significantly, now, Haymon is believed to be in talks with Khan about his future. Khan remains hungry to avenge the Peterson robbery and the re-match would appear to be a natural at this point in time. Bolton’s still-young, former two-time world champion is indicating that he will return to the ring on May 3 – the night he should have been fighting Mayweather in Las Vegas in the richest bout ever contested by a British boxer. Mayweather suddenly switched to Marcos Maidana, then urged Khan to fight his protégé Adrien Broner on that bill to prove he deserves a September bout against the world’s best pound-for-pound boxer. Not unnaturally, since one promise had been broken already, Khan was unconvinced. However, he explored the Broner possibility but then reported: ‘He doesn’t want the fight.’ The Peterson connection brings the option of an opponent Khan knows he is capable of beating, especially under conditions  of rigorous drug testing. Devastating: Khan lost a controversial decision to Lamont Peterson in 2011 but could be in line for a rematch . Doubts: Khan was twice deducted a point for pushing during his fight with Peterson . Khan says: ‘It looks like I will be back on May 3 and it might be a good idea to keep in Mayweather’s face as the chief support on his card. Don’t get me wrong, Floyd’s a great fighter. Probably the best of his era. But as he gets older he might need pressing to take on a younger, explosive fighter like me with real speed.’ Devon Alexander and Luis Collazo are among other candidates for Khan’s first fight in almost a year spent waiting on Mayweather. But Peterson is emerging as the favourite. The light-welterweight belt which the IBF allowed him to keep despite the failed drugs test would not be on the line. Peterson would move up to welterweight, where Khan needs a convincing win to prove himself a worthy challenger for Mayweather’s title. However, the history of controversy between Khan and Peterson would make for a fascinating box-office fight in its own right. Main main: Khan looks set to fight on the undercard of Floyd Mayweather's fight with Marcos Maidana on May 3 . As promoter Frank Warren shrewdly manoeuvres either Tyson Fury or Dereck Chisora towards a big money shot at Wladimir Klitschko, the hottest of all the heavyweight prospects is closing fast on the next available world title. Fury and Chisora are heading for a domestic collision this summer in a final eliminator for one of the younger Klitschko’s collection of belts. Meanwhile Deontay Wilder, the American knock-out artist who has yet to be taken beyond the fourth round, has already become the challenger-in-waiting for the WBC crown, which has been left vacant by Vitali Klitschko as he fights the far greater battle for the future of Ukraine. Wilder stepped yet more heavily on the gas on Saturday with a first-round flattening of Malik Scott, to take his professional record to 31 straight KOs. That positions the Bronze Bomber from Alabama to take on the winner of the up-coming WBC title fight between Bermane Stiverne and Chris Arreola, of whom he says: ‘I could knock both those two out on the same night.’ It's on: Tyson Fury (right) will take on Dereck Chisora (left) for a shot at world champion Wladimir Klitschko . Rematch: Fury will be looking for a repeat of his points victory over Chisora in London three years ago . Warren, who had been contemplating one more warm-up fight each for Fury and Chisora next month, is now fast-tracking them to their WBO eliminator. Big Wlad, who has a routine defence of all his titles in April, might then be pinned down to fight the winning Brit before the end of the year. Should either Chisora or Fury prove capable of ending Klitschko’s seemingly ever-lasting run as multiple champion that should set up, in turn, a unification mega-bout with Wilder next spring. Wilder appears open to that proposition. Remembering his quick stoppage of Audley Harrison in Sheffield last year, he says:  ‘I would be happy to cross the Atlantic again. Not only do I know I would beat either of them but I love going to England.’ He spices the prospect further by adding: ‘As for Fury, he’s a joke of a heavyweight.’ Careful, Deontay. A cavalier traveller Fury may be but he is even bigger than you and punches almost as hard. And, by the way, the reborn Chisora is a more dedicated, determined and dangerous fighter than the reluctant heavyweight who was knocked out by David Haye. Game over: Deontay Wilder continued his stunning run of knockouts with a first-round stoppage of Malik Scott . Down and out: Scott lasted for a little more than 90 seconds against the unbeaten Wilder in Puerto Rico . Kid Galahad was born Abdul Barry Awad but changed his moniker to that of the boxer played by Elvis Presley in a movie. On Saturday, in his home town of Sheffield, the Kid has the chance to start making a name for himself. Galahad takes on former Spanish champion Sergio Prado at the Ponds Forge Arena in a bid to become the European super-bantamweight champion. He does so 20 years on from the night Prince Naseem Hamed won that same title, in the same arena, and he says: ’I’m looking to do an even better job than Naz did on Vicenzo Belcastro. ‘That means I will have to be unbelievably good and take this guy apart.’ If he can deliver a performance of that quality, the Kid will propel himself towards Scott Quigg and Carl Frampton in the echelon of British world title contenders at super-bantamweight.

"North Korea's late leader Kim Jong-Il was reportedly the biggest client fro cognac brand Hennessy and spent £700,000 on the drink. The fact was dug out in research into leaders' favourite tipple, which has suggested politicians success might have something to do with their preferred drink. Some of the UK's top leaders have all opted for whisky, while across the Atlantic in America, they have a sweeter tooth, preferring a cocktail. Whisky verses pints: Tony Blair was one of a number of successful politicians who prefer to drink whisky, as opposed to John Prescott who opted for a pint . The research, carried out by online drinks firm 31DOVER.com, revealed that Churchill, Thatcher, Blair and Cameron have all shown a mutual affection for whisky, with Churchill setting himself up for a day of success by rounding off breakfast with a whiskey soda. He was also partial to the odd drop of Pol Roger, which led to Cuvée Sir Winston Churchill champagne being named after him. Tony Blair was a little more measured in his love of his chosen liqueur as he was 'never sure' if his daily scotch before dinner would be good or bad for him. No such uncertainty for the late Margaret Thatcher, whose fondness for Bell’s was legendary. Whisky also worked its magic for the current Prime Minister, though his taste is a little more expensive. Expensive taste: North Korean leader Kim Jong-il (R) was reportedly the biggest single customer of Hennessy cognac. The late leader is pictured in 2000 with then South Korean President Kim Dae-jung . David Cameron, who counts Thatcher as one of his greatest inspirations, enjoys Bruichaladdich’s organic single malt, priced at £41 a bottle. While whisky has helped politicians prosper, pints have led MPs to their peril, the researcher claim. John Major, David Milliband and John Prescott all have a passion for a pint but have faced troubles in their political career. John Major famously presided over a string of political embarrassments including the 1992 Black Wednesday financial collapse; the older Milliband was defeated by his brother in the Labour party’s leadership contest; and Prescott, the former Deputy Prime Minister tried to resurrect his political career but failed after losing out as then Police and Crime commissioner. Similar tastes: British Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured last week in Kabul Afghanistan, likes to drink pricey whisky Bruichaladdich, while Margaret Thatcher loved cheaper Bell's . Across the Atlantic, political success is about mixing it up. Former U.S. presidents John F Kennedy and Bill Clinton both enjoyed a feminine cocktail with Kennedy sipping on a Daiquiri and Clinton a La Señorita, containing tequila, pineapple juice, lime juice and Tabasco sauce. Famous teetotalers include former President George W Bush and Adolph Hitler. Presidential candidate Bill Clinton, pictured in 1992, and the late President John F. Kennedy, in 1961, both enjoyed feminine cocktails . David Laurie, chief executive of the online drinks firm, said: 'It’s interesting that so many famous political figures have had such a strong penchant for a particular tipple. 'Equally notable is that so many of them drink or drank neat spirits which is a trend we’re seeing return among men and women today.'","Kim Jong-Il was reportedly Hennessy's biggest customer .

"Ricky Burns faces a make-or-break test in his comeback fight following his world-title defeat, according to promoter Eddie Hearn. The 31-year-old faces unbeaten Montenegrin Dejan Zlaticanin on June 27 at Braehead Arena in a WBC eliminator, in his first fight since losing his WBO lightweight title to Terence Crawford. The unanimous points loss followed two unconvincing defences and Hearn knows the Coatbridge fighter needs to answer his critics, even if his confidence does not appear to have been hit. Raring to go: Ricky Burns is looking to put his defeat against Terence Crawford behind him . Make or break: Burns must put in a convincing display against Dejan Zlaticanin . Hearn said: 'We had a meeting a couple of weeks after the Crawford fight and I told him the thing to do now was to get a fight to position himself for a world title fight. 'In short I said I wanted him to go out and win and look fantastic because that’s something he hasn’t been doing lately. 'The last thing he needed was to go into another deep fight like Crawford because, although he doesn’t appear to have low confidence he should do because of the performances he’s had. Warning: Promoter Eddie Hearn has warned it's crunch time for Burns . 'Any normal person would look at them and say ‘I haven’t boxed well’ and your confidence wouldn’t be that great, but he’s happy to fight anyone.' Burns split with trainer Billy Nelson after the defeat and is now working in Essex under Tony Sims. Hearn added: 'Ricky is on the comeback trail to a world title shot, he’s got a new trainer, so this is all about putting what he’s learned into practice, getting his confidence back, and showing people he’s still there. Big Blow: Burns was well beaten by Crawford back in March . 'And he might not be. Maybe he goes out and struggles against this kid. He could quite easily lose to this kid because he can fight. 'If he’s still got it he’ll look good against this kid, who’ll come forward and forward and just think ‘what an opportunity’. 'But really Ricky Burns should take care of him, but if he doesn’t then it’s over. This is the acid test - it’s make or break.'","Scotsman set for make-or-break clash in Glasgow on June 27 .

"Global warming five million years ago may have caused parts of Antarctica's large ice sheets to melt and sea levels to rise by approximately 65 feet, according to a new study. Researchers from Imperial College London studied mud samples to learn about ancient melting of the East Antarctic ice sheet. They discovered that melting took place repeatedly between five and three million years ago, during a geological period called Pliocene Epoch, which may have caused sea levels to rise approximately 32 feet (ten metres). The ice sheets in East and West Antarctica melted approximately five to three million years ago . Scientists have previously known that the ice sheets of West Antarctica and Greenland partially melted around the same time. The team say that this may have caused sea levels to rise by a total of (65 metres). The academics say understanding the glacial melting during the Pliocene Epoch may give us insights into how sea levels could rise as a consequence of current global warming. This is because the Pliocene Epoch had carbon dioxide concentrations similar to now and global temperatures comparable to those predicted for the end of this century. Study co-author Doctor Tina Van De Flierdt, from the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial, said: 'The Pliocene Epoch had temperatures that were two or three degrees higher than today and similar atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to today. The ice sheets of Greenland also partially melted around the same time, possibly making the sea levels rise by 20 metres . 'Our study underlines that these conditions have led to a large loss of ice and significant rises in global sea level in the past. 'Scientists predict that global temperatures of a similar level may be reached by the end of this century, so it is very important for us to understand what the possible consequences might be.' The East Antarctic ice sheet is the largest ice mass on Earth, roughly the size of Australia. The ice sheet has fluctuated in size since its formation 34 million years ago, but scientists have previously assumed that it had stabilised around 14 million years ago. The Imperial researchers were able to determine that the ice sheet had partially melted during this 'stable' period by analysing the chemical content of mud in sediments. These were drilled from depths of more than three kilometres below sea level off the coast of Antarctica. Analysing the mud revealed a chemical fingerprint that enabled the team to trace where it came from on the continent. They discovered that the mud originated from rocks that are currently hidden under the ice sheet. Researchers from Imperial College London studied mud samples to learn about ancient melting of the East Antarctic ice sheet . The only way that significant amounts of this mud could have been deposited as sediment in the sea would be if the ice sheet had retreated inland and eroded these rocks, say the team. The academics suggest that the melting of the ice sheet may have been caused in part by the fact that some of it rests in basins below sea level. This puts the ice in direct contact with seawater and when the ocean warms, as it did during the Pliocene, the ice sheet becomes vulnerable to melting. Carys Cook, co-author and research postgraduate from the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial, added: 'Scientists previously considered the East Antarctic ice sheet to be more stable than the much smaller ice sheets in West Antarctica and Greenland, even though very few studies of East Antarctic ice sheet have been carried out. 'Our work now shows that the East Antarctic ice sheet has been much more sensitive to climate change in the past than previously realised. This finding is important for our understanding of what may happen to the Earth if we do not tackle the effects of climate change.' The next step will see the team analysing sediment samples to determine how quickly the East Antarctic ice sheet melted during the Pliocene. This information could be useful in the future for predicting how quickly the ice sheet could melt as a result of global warming. The findings were published in the journal Nature Geoscience.","Imperial College London researchers studied the East Antarctic ice sheet .

"Anthony Dirrell has told his mandatory challenger George Groves that he must 'prove himself' before he is given a shot at his WBC super-middleweight title. Since being knocked out by Carl Froch at Wembley in May, Groves has responded with back-to-back victories, the first of which made him the No.1 contender in the WBC's 168lb rankings. In a Sportsmail exclusive in September, Dirrell described Groves as a 'fraud' who did not deserve a crack at his title. Anthony Dirrell (right) may sidestep George Groves and make a voluntary defence of his title . The Saint has since won twice, outpointing Christopher Rebrasse to claim the European title before knocking out Denis Douglin in November. But, despite those victories, Dirrell's attitude has not changed and he insists he will not be agreeing to a fight with the west Londoner. When asked about Groves, Dirrell said: 'Who? I don't know that guy. 'Oh that guy who fought Carl Froch and got knocked out by him twice? Oh that guy. 'There's no interest. Why would there be? He got knocked out twice. Dirrell wiith Muhammad Ali's daughter Laila Ali at WBC convention in Las Vegas on Monday . 'Why would you get a shot if you got knocked out twice? He's a good fighter but you got knocked out twice. 'You need to prove yourself. You haven't fought anybody yet to prove yourself and won. 'He still has to prove himself. You have to fight, that's how you prove yourself. 'He got knocked out twice. Who deserves a shot after that? That's like me saying, if he had the championship and I got knocked out twice by Carl Froch, they wouldn't want to see me fight the champion. 'Vice versa it's the same thing.' Groves' promoters, Team Sauerland, have attempted to make contact with Dirrell's representatives to get the ball rolling on their mandatory challenge. George Groves is No 1 contender for WBC super-middleweight title after back-to-back victories . It is unclear whether the Americans are considering their options but Dirrell seems relaxed about the possibility of being stripped of his belt, should he fail to meet his mandatory requirements. Groves and his promoters are in Las Vegas this week for the WBC convention and are expected to force the issue with the governing body about their plans for the super-middleweight strap. But Dirrell will be allowed to make a voluntary defence of his title as late as March before being forced to turn his attention to Groves. Dirrell, the self-styled 'Dog' added: 'We're looking to make money, that's what this business is about. I got the belt, I got what I came here for and now it's time to get paid. 'Me and my management team need to go and see who we want to fight but not yet. We should have one soon and that's what I'm waiting on.' Dirrell has dismissed Groves as a 'fraud' after being knocked out twice by Carl Froch . When asked whether he would consider facing Groves in the UK, considering how much money the Saint generated in ticket sales in 2014, Dirrell replied: 'Never. Why have I got to go over there to fight him if we have to fight? He has to come and see me. That's just how it is. I'm not going to go over there just because. That's not how it works. 'Floyd [Mayweather] never went anywhere and he's selling out arenas. You've got to come to the Us to fight, to get your name known, before you can you're somebody.' Eddie Hearn has revealed that Groves could be in line to fight for the vacant IBF title, should Carl Froch vacate it, in an all-British grudge match with James DeGale, meaning the mandatory shot at Dirrell could be put on the back-burner. On DeGale Dirrell added: 'He's a good fighter, he's an Olympian I heard. He's a good fighter also.'","Anthony Dirrell considering options for his first title defence .

"Josh Warrington won the vacant European featherweight title in his home city with a fourth-round TKO of Davide Dieli at the First Direct Arena in Leeds. Roared on by a boisterous partisan crowd, the unbeaten Warrington knocked his Italian opponent down in the fourth with a straight right before a barrage immediately after prompted the referee to halt the contest. It was just the 23-year-old's third victory inside the distance in 19 fights and the victory has ensured Warrington is now the British, Commonwealth and European champion.

Warrington celebrates his victory against Dieli to win the European Featherweight title in Leeds . Warrington lands a punch on Dieli on his way to winning in the fourth round in Leeds . Dieli had no answer to Warrington and was knocked down and later stopped by the Leeds favourite . Warrington admitted keeping his concentration in the midst of such raucous support proved crucial to his hopes of victory. 'That was unbelievable and it's hard not to get carried away but I had to keep my focus and I think that's the difference between being at a championship level and not,' he said. 'Just keep my focus and take that energy off the crowd into the ring.' As for who he would like to face next, the Yorkshireman added: 'It's all about progression so whoever wants to come over to Leeds, I'll fight anybody.' His promoter Eddie Hearn was taken aback by the reception Warrington was given, but is keen to keep the pressure of his young charge's shoulders. 'He's 23 years old. That's the thing we have to look at in managing his career now,' said Hearn. 'People will want him to go, go, go, go but sometimes we've just got to rein him in a little bit and make sure he progresses and learns his match properly, because with his position now and his ranking, he can move forward to the world level. There's no rush to do so, the fans here will want him to progress and he will progress. 'We've got something major here.' Warrington, roared on, said: '(I had to) just keep my focus and take that energy off the crowd into the ring' Warrington secured the vacant European featherweight title in his home city Leeds against Dieli . Earlier, Ricky Burns got back to winning ways on his light-welterweight debut but was thoroughly unconvincing in a points decision victory over the lightly regarded Alexandre Lepelley. Burns had lost his last two fights and decided a move up to the 140lbs division would breathe fresh life into his career, but the Scot looked a pale shadow of the fighter that had won world titles in two weight classes. He dropped his opponent in the opening round but struggled to impose himself after a decent start and although he deserved his victory, a 79-71 scoreline will do little to quieten the doubters who believe the Coatbridge fighter's best days are behind him, despite recording his 37th win from 42 fights. The 31-year-old, who lost his WBO lightweight title to Terence Crawford before suffering a surprise points decision defeat to Dejan Zlaticanin last time out, was fighting outside of Scotland for the first time since November 2011. Desperate to impress on his first foray into the light-welterweight division, Burns made a strong start and was by far the busier fighter in the opening round, landing a couple of crisp jabs before felling Lepelley with a hard right near the bell. Ricky Burns (left) got back to winning ways on his light-welterweight debut but was thoroughly unconvincing . He continued to use his superior height and reach advantage to beat Lepelley to the punch although the Frenchman grew steadily stronger as the second round wore on. It was more of the same in the third as Burns found some success behind his jab but was also guilty of swinging wildly. The fighters were both looking to land a knockout shot and Lepelley had his best round in the fourth, landing a hard shot that drew gasps from the crowd, but from then on the bout descended into a cagey scrap, with neither fighter really asserting themselves in the closing rounds. Lepelley (17-2-1, 3KOs) was deducted a point in the seventh for leading with his head but it mattered little to the overall proceedings, with Burns doing enough to win the remaining rounds without landing any significant blows. Brian Rose also bounced back from his world title defeat with a first-round stoppage against Ignacio Lucero Fraga. The Blackpool fighter, who was beaten by WBO light-middleweight champion Demetrius Andrade earlier this year, floored his Argentinian opponent three times for a confidence-boosting victory. Hot prospect Callum Smith continued his rise up the ranks by claiming the 14th win of his professional career with a third-round TKO of Rafael Sosa Pintos.

"The complimentary superlatives were being heaped on Kevin Mitchell after he reduced a seasoned Mexican to pulp to set up the third world lightweight title challenge of his career. Brilliant, devastating, lightning, punch-perfect, clinical…world-class even. The 30-year-old Londoner himself kept using a different buzz-word: 'Security.' Kevin Mitchell (left) produced a sensational performance to stop experienced Mexican Daniel Estrada . The 30-year-old is now the mandatory challenger to Venezula's Jorge Linares's WBC title . For the first time in a major fight, Mitchell revealed after his eighth-round stoppage of Daniel Estrada at the 02 Arena, he felt comfortable in his skin. It was the rejection of a drinker's lifestyle and the dedication to boxing which made that possible. 'Security,' he said. 'That's what giving up the booze, eating right and training proper have given me.' The London fighter stopped Estrada in the eighth-round to set up a future clash with Linares . He had used the same word in the build up to the stunning victory which establishes him as the mandatory challenger to Venezuela's WBC champion Jorge Linares: 'I'm fighting for the security of my sons.' Those boys sat proudly next to him in his dressing room as he said it about his retrieval of his career from two previous world tiitle shots squandered in the bar: 'Because I prepared properly I felt secure throughout the fight. 'I felt strong, confident in what I could do. Sure of winning. Without doubts. I knew I had what it takes to go the distance if necessary. Mitchell says the rejection of his previous lifestyle and having 'security' has helped turn his career around . It was a blistering display by Mitchell, who boxed superbly throughout and was too much for his opponent . 'Before big fights in the past I would be so tense and nervous for days that I would catch myself with my hands shaking even when I was just chatting with my mates. Not now.' A new trainer, Tony Simms, and a steadying girlfriend, Jodie, have kept him on the straight and narrow: 'They won't let me go off track again. Not that I want to.

"While Floyd Mayweather was sat courtside watching Los Angeles Clippers play Brooklyn Nets and listening to the deafening chants of 'we want Pacquiao, we want Pacquiao', the Filipino fighter that the world of boxing is so desperate to see him take on was far away, dining in a palace. It sounds akin to the lavish lifestyle that Mayweather needs no encouragement to flaunt on his Instagram page, but Manny Pacquiao was demonstrating the opposite characteristics as he and his wife Jinkee took Prince Harry up on his invitation to dine with him at Buckingham Palace. Pacquiao has a formidable reputation in the boxing ring; his record of 38 knock-outs in 55 victories could be enough to deter the usually brash Mayweather from engaging in a bout that could raise at least £200million for the pair.

"Big-time boxing will make a welcome return to terrestrial television when ITV broadcast Carl Frampton’s defence of his world title in Belfast on February 28. The hard old game has been striving for a way to reclaim its huge free-to-air box office appeal for five years. There has been a strong feeling that a powerful renaissance of the sport has been failing to capitalise on the massive cross-over audience available on terrestrial network television. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Carl Frampton: ITV coverage is huge for me and for boxing . Carl Frampton will defend his world super bantamweight title live on ITV on February 28 . Frampton will take on mandatory challenger Chris Avalos at the Odyssey Arena in Belfast . Ali vs Frazier (BBC, 1971) Over 27million watched the unbeaten Muhammad Ali surrender his record after 15 rounds with Joe Frazier. McGuigan vs Pedroza (BBC, 1985) Barry McGuigan’s defeat of reigning WBA featherweight champion Eusebio Pedroza drew 18m viewers. Benn vs Eubank (ITV, 1993) After Chris Eubank beat Nigel Benn three years earlier, 16.3m watched the rematch end in a draw. ITV are answering that call by screening Frampton’s IBF super bantamweight championship battle with mandatory challenger Chris Avalos at what will be a wildly atmospheric Odyssey Arena in Belfast. The Northern Irishman’s legendary mentor, manager and promoter Barry McGuigan said when making the ITV announcement: ‘This is as crucial for boxing as it is important for Carl. ‘This is a great showcase for Carl to show the whole of Britain and much of the world what an exciting fighter he is. But on top of that our sport has been needing major exposure on terrestrial television.’ This will be the first world championship fight on one of the major networks since Carl Froch beat Jean Pascal for the super middleweight title seven years ago. Frampton beat Kiko Martinez in Belfast in September to win the IBF super bantamweight title . Frampton's mentor and manager Barry McGuigan said that this is crucial for boxing and important for Carl . The last live terrestrial broadcast featured Amir Khan’s non-title bout against Paulie Malignaggi in New York in 2010. ITV executive Niall Sloane said: ‘This is a first step back into boxing for us and it is very exciting. It used to be that fighters were built up on terrestrial television before going on to pay-per-view with the likes of Sky. ‘But lately the wider public have been deprived of the chance of seeing brilliant youngsters like Carl.’ Carl Froch's victory over Jean Pascal in December 2008 was the last world title bout on terrestrial TV . Amir Khan beat Paulie Malignaggi at Madison Square Garden in New York  in May 2010 live on ITV . ITV’s re-entry into the prize ring may push back plans for a title-unifying Battle of Britain between Frampton and Scott Quigg, who is committed to Sky through his promoter Eddie Hearn. However, assuming he sees off Avalos as expected, Frampton will be looking first at other huge multi-belt duels with Leo Santa Cruz and Guillermo Rigondeaux, the brilliant Cuban who is generally regarded as the Floyd Mayweather of the super bantamweight division. For a fight against Rigondeaux, for example, it is not inconceivable that McGuigan, now as shrewd in his negotiating as he was when a world champion in his own right, can pull together a multi-channel deal like those being discussed by US networks HBO and Showtime for Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao. The undercard in Belfast will be aired on ITV4, followed by Frampton v Avalos on the main ITV channel.","Carl Frampton to fight Chris Avalos in Belfast on February 28 .

"These shocking photos show child immigrants crammed inside cages and tiny rooms at a U.S. Government border facility - further highlighting the humanitarian crisis along America's border with Mexico. The images were taken at a holding center in Texas which can no longer accommodate large numbers of children and mothers traveling alone with their kids, forcing the federal government to open more facilities. Congressman Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat, took the photos on his camera phone to highlight the terrible conditions children are being kept in. Caged: Congressman Henry Cuellar took these shocking images to highlight how overwhelmed the US authorities are with the recent tide of illegal immigrants . Young faces: The pictures, taken recently, show just how many of the illegal immigrants are children - many of whom have no supervising adult. Up to 400 a day are pouring over the border . In one snap, taken during a tour of the Customs and Border Protection facility in South Texas, a large group of immigrants are locked in a wire mesh cage. In another, tiny children run around a packed room and foil sheets – the only blankets they have – cover the concrete floors. Up to 40 people a time - most appearing dirty and dejected - can be seen in filling rooms only large enough for ten. This comes as the MailOnline learns that overworked border patrol officers struggling to cope with the huge influx are separating diseased child immigrants with make-shift quarantine methods - yellow evidence tape. Don Ray, the Executive Director of the Texas Border Sheriffs Coalition, said border guards were simply running a strip of tape down the center of the detention facility to separate the children. ‘The diseased kids sit on one side and the healthy children on the other,’ he said. 'Hardly the best way to go about things'. Mr Ray went on to describe the relocation of immigrants as akin to the displacement of people following Hurricane Katrina. 'You can’t have an influx of people like that without having an impact,’ he said. Flood: Don Ray, the Executive Director of the Texas Border Sheriffs Coalition compared the situation to the displacement of people following Hurricane Katrina . Cheek-by-jowl: The immigrants are crammed in tiny rooms and forced to sleep on the floor with aluminium blankets as their only comfort . More than 400 children a day are flooding illegally in to the U.S. and the tide of border crossings by unaccompanied children mostly from Central America is not expected to end anytime soon. Today it emerged that despite the influx Vice President Joe Biden believes more, not fewer, immigrants should come to America. Speaking to a National Association of Manufacturers’ crowd this week he called for a 'constant, unrelenting stream' of new immigrants — 'not dribbling (but) significant flows,' to bolster the national economy, The Hill reported. ‘We need it badly from a purely — purely economic point of view,’ Mr Biden said, The Hill reported. Later, on Twitter, he wrote: ‘The final thing we need to do together is pass immigration reform … We need it badly. -VP at manufacturing summit.' His comments come as border patrol agents are appealing to the federal government to help with the thousands of illegal children pouring across the border. Conditions: The images were taken at a holding center in Texas which can no longer accommodate large numbers of children and mothers traveling alone with their kids, forcing the federal government to open more facilities . Appeal: Border patrol agents are appealing to the federal government to help with the thousands of illegal children pouring across the border . Yesterday the MailOnline saw lines of children being corralled by staff at a makeshift border patrol warehouse in Nogales, Arizona being used as a central hub to process the flood of immigrants. There were serious concerns for the health of the 1,100 children being held at the Nogales facility after MailOnline learned paramedics were called out three times in a day. We witnessed a teenage girl being wheeled out of the make-shift detention warehouse on a stretcher and loaded in to a Nogales Fire Department ambulance. A spokesperson for the Nogales FD said: 'We were dispatched to a 911 call at the Border Patrol station to attend to a female minor who was feeling sick. 'Depending on the evaluation of the paramedic we will make a decision as to whether the patient will require a higher level of medical care. If so we will transport the patient to a local medical hospital.' The spokesperson confirmed that the call out was their third of the day to the Border Patrol facility and the eighth since June 1. Blame game: Obama has come under fire for a change in the immigration rules two years ago which sent a message out to Central and South Americans that if you are a young illegal immigrant you will not be deported . Unprecedented: More than 160,000 immigrants have been . apprehended in Texas' Valley sector in the first eight months of this . fiscal year, eclipsing the total for all of last year . Disease: A border guard said the resources are so slim that diseased children are separated simply by yellow police evidence tape . We . witnessed the youngsters being processed in a yard outside the normally . unused facility in an industrial area on the outskirts of the border . town. Staff set up tents and giant fans in the 100 degree heat and large green screens were used to keep the children hidden. A . border patrol officer manning the main gate at the U.S Border Patrol . location told MailOnline that 200 extra officers had been drafted in to . help. Local hotels were also packed out with the influx of government officials here to tackle the problem. The much needed response came after pictures of unaccompanied children lying on the floor of the large barren facility raised concerns of a humanitarian crisis. And now these latest photos out of Texas increase the urgency of the situation. A wave of unaccompanied child immigrants have been arriving at the giant holding center in Texas at an alarming rate. More than 160,000 immigrants have been apprehended in Texas' Valley sector in the first eight months of this fiscal year, eclipsing the total for all of last year. Emergency: A girl is taken out on a stretcher from the Nogales camp - the third taken to hospital on Thursday . Health problems: There have been many reports of health problems amid the crush of people at Nogales . This figure includes more than 33,000 unaccompanied children. It’s . believed as many as 90,000 unaccompanied children will cross the . Mexican border illegally this year in total — up from an average 6,500 . over years past. As many as 1,100 children are currently at the holding center in Nogales. The children are sleeping in plastic cots but about 2,000 mattresses have reportedly been ordered, and medical supplies and other basics are being shipped. Conditions are slowly improving, with shower facilities being added and donations of clothing being collected for the children. Vendors are being contracted to provide the children with nutritional meals, while the Federal Emergency Management Agency will provide counseling and recreational activities. Yesterday MailOnline witnessed a large FedEx truck making a delivery to the rear of the warehouse. Nogales Mayor Arturo Garina insists the site is simply addressing the immediate need for shelter. ‘I'm very comfortable with what I saw,’ he told CNN. Sickness: Thousands of children have been transported to Nogales, Arizona, and have reportedly become sickened by the food they have been given at the shelter . PR disaster: Large green screens were used to keep the children hidden at the Nogales Border Patrol station in Arizona . He said there are makeshift cafes and medical centers and that telephone banks and computers have been set up to process people and contact relatives. Unaccompanied children and partial families from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala make up the majority of those crossing the border. Of the 1,200 or so crossing the Rio Grande in eastern Texas every day, up to 400 are unaccompanied children, said Rep. Henry Cuellar, who represents the district where most of the crossings occur. 'This is a humanitarian crisis,' he said. It’s believed many of the immigrants use rafts to cross the Rio Grande, equipped with instructions to follow the river until reaching the Border Patrol site to surrender. The illegal immigrants include a group of Honduran girls, some as young as 14, according to CNN. Many in Congress have blamed President Barack Obama for policies they claim opened the floodgate of unaccompanied child immigrants. According to the Houston Chronicle, several advocacy organizations have lodged complaints with Department of Homeland Security officials on behalf of more than 100 unaccompanied youths alleging mistreatment by Customs and Border Patrol agents within the past year. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson testified Wednesday before a Congressional committee that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has 70 personnel dedicated full time to coordinating humanitarian relief efforts for the surge of unaccompanied children caught at the border. The government has resorted to using three military installations to house an overflow of child immigrants, including an Air Force base in San Antonio, Texas. Nogales Border Patrol station: Staff set up tents and giant fans in the 100 degree heat . Conspiracy: An association of former border guards has accused the government of deliberately 'orchestrating' the flood of minors for 'political reasons' The Obama . administration is attributing the huge influx to violence in poverty . stricken nations such as Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. But some members of Congress say Obama's policies and a lack of enforcement are to blame. ‘The . President has sent the message out he is not going to enforce the law,’ Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican whose commentary on immigration . reform drew sharp criticism, told CNN. ‘That message has echoed out.’ Critics, . such as King, point to Obama's decision in 2012 to stop most . deportations of young people brought to the United States as children. After . the children at Nogales have been processed, they will be transferred . to Department of Health and Human Services run facilities at Lackland . Air Base in Texas or Ventura County Naval Base in California. The administration announced that a third facility in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, which will house up to 1,200 minors. U.S. law prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from immediately deporting the children if they are not from Canada or Mexico. Instead, the children are turned over to Department Health and Human Services supervision 'within 72 hours of DHS taking them into custody,' an official said. Relatives living in the U.S. are searched for and contacted and the immigrant is given a court date.But very few actually show up and the children often become one of the millions of undocumented immigrants. Last night an organization of former Border Patrol agents charged that the federal government, under the administration of President Obama, is deliberately arranging for a flood of immigrant children to arrive in America for political purposes. 'This is not a humanitarian crisis. It is a predictable, orchestrated and contrived assault on the compassionate side of Americans by her political leaders that knowingly puts minor illegal alien children at risk for purely political purposes,' said the statement released by the National Association of Former Border Patrol Officers.","Democrat congressman took the images at a holding center in south Texas to highlight the terrible conditions .

Pacquiao is the WBO welterweight champion and ranks third on the pound-for-pound list. Mayweather had a courtside seat next to the Heat bench, directly across from Pacquiao's seat on the opposite sideline. And after finally meeting on the side of the basketball court, the two fighters may be getting closer to a long anticipated bout in the ring, which would be the richest in boxing history. Pacquiao is a noted basketball fan and is friends with Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, who is of Filipino descent, while Mayweather has been a regular attendee at Heat games for several years. According to Pacquiao's adviser Michael Koncz, the meeting between the two boxers was not planned as the Pac-Man was due to fly to Los Angeles on Tuesday but his flight is believed to have been cancelled, so he went the game instead. Koncz told Yahoo Sports: 'Floyd walked over and he and Manny had a nice little talk. I'm not at liberty to say what they said, but it was a good conversation.' Pacquiao's close friend Bernard Cloma told radio station DZMM on Wednesday that after the game Mayweather visited the Flipino's hotel and the pair had a lengthy discussion in the presence of Pacquiao’s wife Jinkee and Koncz. Clomad said: 'Yes, Mayweather went to the hotel and visited Manny. They had a long talk.' Pacquiao has been in Miami for several days because he was judging the Miss Universe competition and he is now due to fly to LA on Wednesday. A mega-fight between the two has been in the offing for a number of years – but suggestion is that it could finally be announced for this year.

Pound-for-pound king Mayweather is rumoured to be announcing his next opponent this weekend during the Super Bowl in order to gain maximum exposure. Mayweather is due to fight again on May 2 in Las Vegas, and aside from a mega-fight with Pacquiao, other potential opponents include a rematch with Miguel Cotto or a meeting with Britain's Amir Khan. But Mayweather said last month that he's ready to fight the Pac-Man in May. Mayweather won his rematch with Marcos Maidana in September and is due to fight again in May . Mayweather is undefeated in his 47-fight career and considered the best pound-for-pound boxer on the plane . Pacquiao responded a few days later on social media, telling Mayweather that it's time to 'give the fans the fight they want.' In recent days, another tweet was posted on Pacquiao's account where he said: 'I can easily beat @FloydMayweather, I believe that.' Pacquiao has previously said that he's agreed to all of Mayweather's terms and conditions for the fight, including a 60-40 purse split in the American's favour and agreement on drug testing. But as yet no contract has been drawn up. One of the options open to Mayweather for the May 2 date is a rematch with Miguel Cotto . If Mayweather opts to fight Cotto then Pacquiao could turn his attentions to Amir Khan . And with Mayweather and Pacquiao pictured in the same room together for the first time, staff at the American Airlines Arena in Miami were happy to add to the speculation by putting pictures of the two boxers on the big screen with the question 'Coming in 2015?'. Mayweather, the WBA and WBC welterweight champion, hasn't lost in 47 fights, while Pacquiao, the WBO welterweight titleholder, is 57-5-2 in his career. If, however, Mayweather opts for a rematch with Cotto, that paves the way for Pacquiao to possibly fight Khan. The former stablemates met last week in London to discuss a potential 2015 showdown.","Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather met at Miami vs Milwaukee .

St James's Palace have appealed to British newspapers not to run the pictures, arguing that Harry has a reasonable expectation of privacy since he was on a private holiday. Only The Sun chose to run them arguing that the photographs - which were taken by fellow revellers with the knowledge of his police protection officers and then sold to a US celebrity gossip website - were an issue of press freedom and in the public interest. Their decision has prompted 3,600 complaints to the Press Complaints Commission but the palace has not made a decision over whether to take legal action yet.","He will give a speech at the WellChild Awards in London this afternoon .

"Humans can work out a dog's mood just by the sound of its bark, according to new research . Humans can work out a dog's mood just by the sound of its bark, according to new research. People use the same rules to work out how their dog is feeling, as they do to determine the emotional state of friends. The study found that owners listen to the length and pitch of the barks their dogs make to understand their canine companion. Researchers from Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, said that shorter barks sounded more positive and higher pitched noises more intense. Dr Tamas Farago, part of MTA-ELTE Comparative Ethology Research Group based at the university, said: ‘Humans are extremely good at recognising other's emotions based on their behaviour or even voice. ‘We were curious when they hear a human laugh, cry or the calls of our close companion the dog, whether they use the same acoustical rules to assess the caller's inner state. ‘We found the most important features of both dog and human sounds were the length of the sound and its pitch.’ The findings confirm what many dog owners have long claimed, that they can tell if their pet is happy, sad, angry or afraid, based purely on its different barks. Scientists used to believe that barking is a random noise without any specific information or content. But evidence at Dr Farago's Family Dog Project Lab - one of the world's first facilities dedicated to the human-dog relationships – has revealed that there is more to it. A study found that owners listen to the length and pitch of the barks their dogs make to understand their canine companion. Shorter barks were found to sound more positive and higher pitched noises more intense . In the study, 39 volunteers listened to 200 recordings of dogs and humans (where the humans made noises but did not speak) and were then asked to score them on a scale measuring emotions. Dr Farago said that in both dog and human samples the shorter the calls the more positively they were rated. Higher pitched samples were also marked as ‘more intense in both species' vocalisations.’ The research, published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, is the first to directly compare how people perceive human and dog sounds. Previous studies found that humans can assess the emotions of dogs based on their barks, but the new research involved a much wider range of noises. ‘We used several different dog calls like growls, whines, moans and similarly the human sounds we played back were pretty diverse,’ Dr Farago told MailOnline. The research enabled him to directly compare what parameters can affect the assessment of emotions in dogs and humans. Dr Farago said: ‘We show humans use similar acoustical parameters to attribute emotional valence and intensity to both human and dog vocalisations.’ Together with earlier studies, the . research suggests the general rules discovered could be applied to other . mammal noises and bird sounds, although this has yet to be proven. He believes the findings may even be used in the future for improving interactions between people and artificial intelligence. ‘Using these rules we can develop artificial emotion expressions that can be easily recognised and can be used in social robots or other devices,’ he added. This week scientists revealed that the 'puppy dog eyes' expression that dogs make taps into our subconscious. Research by the University of Portsmouth found dogs that raise their inner brows, to make their eyes appear larger, are chosen by prospective owners more quickly than other dogs. The study suggests that dogs have evolved in response to the human preference towards childlike faces. In conjunction with the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition, researchers used a newly developed tool called DogFACS to analyse dogs’ facial expressions. They studied every muscle movement made by 27 dogs in re-homing shelters when a person came and stood in front of their pen. The tool counted the number of times the dogs raised their inner brows and widened their eyes as a prospective owner approached. Dogs that produced more of these movements attracted an owner quicker with their ‘child-like’ expression than those that did not. Lead author, Dr Bridget Waller, an expert in the evolution of social communication at the university, believes the results of the study suggest that wolves which produced childlike expressions may have been more tolerated by humans, and so modern dogs have inherited these features.","Researchers from Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, said shorter barks sound more positive and high pitched noises seem more intense to humans .

"3D printing has already begun blurring the lines between amateur designers and professional engineers. But now the fashion world is hoping to get a slice of the action. London-based designer Catherine Wales has used technology that was once the preserve of large engineering industries to create striking bespoke fashion accessories. Project DNA uses 3D printing and white nylon to create designs such a scaffolded corset, a blossoming feathered shoulder piece and a waist bracelet . Her collection, Project DNA, is designed to ‘push the boundaries of digital fabrication within the luxury market.’ It uses 3D printed white nylon to create designs such a scaffolded corset, a blossoming feathered shoulder piece and a waist bracelet. The collection is complemented by . four transformative headpieces that hide key areas of the face; . including a guilded horn and a mirrored mask, and a cut out visor . helmet. London-based designer Catherine Wales hopes that her collection will show how 3D printing can sustainably solve sizing issues and cut down on wastage while better supporting consumer demand . Inspired by identity and the visual structure of human chromosomes, Project DNA is created almost entirely with individual and interchangeable ball and socket components . ‘Advances in technology have allowed me to utilise my expertise as a pattern cutter to approach current complications surrounding garment sizing and manufacturing restrictions,’ said Ms Wales. ‘3D technology can sustainably solve sizing issues and cut down on wastage while better supporting consumer demand.’ The collection is complemented by four transformative headpieces that hide key areas of the face; including a guilded horn and a mirrored mask, and a cut out visor helmet . Ms Wales started her collection by scanning the body of the wearer and then importing the data into 3D modelling software . Each piece is bespoke and can be designed to fit any body shape. Once a computer model is produced, it is sent to a SLS 3D printer which produces the designs from powdered nylon . Ms Wales started her collection by scanning the body of wearer and then importing the data into 3D modelling software. The computer models were then sent to a SLS 3D printer. The technology, also known as rapid prototyping, works by using software to divide these computer designs into triangular facet. This allows a 3D printer to read the designs and then deposits successive layers of material which can either be in liquid, powder or sheet form. The layers are jointed together automatically to create the final design, corresponding to the initial computer model.

"Amazing pictures show life in Sydney in the 19th century which tell the extraordinary story of Chinese immigrants and the lives of Australian women in the late 1800s. From upper class ladies to tea room waitresses and young women of 'mixed race' integrating into society at a time when there was strong anti-Chinese sentiment, the photographs were taken at a time when Sydney was a 'rough man's town', the opium trade was flourishing. The pictures follow the story of an extraordinary man who became a much loved and respected figure on the Sydney scene, despite his humble beginnings starting out as a nine-year-old immigrant with his uncle transporting a shipload of Chinese coolies as labour to the goldfields at Braidwood in the NSW Southern Tablelands. Tea room revolution: Before Chinese immigrants and entrepreneur Quong Tart, pictured, above in 1891 outside his luncheon grill room at 777 George Street, Sydney, opened tea rooms and eateries Australian women had nowehre to go and socialise because no respectable woman could go into a hotel and Sydney was 'a real man's town' Man's town: Sydney in the 1880s was a town of pubs, oyster saloons and chophouses, with not much on offer for women. This changed with the opening of the refined tearooms owned by eccentric Chinese immigrant Quong Tart, which allowed women of all classes like these suffragettes in 1892 to meet and congregate . First visit to Sydney: This was the first visit by Chinese ambassadors to Australia and shows Generals Ho and Tsing (pictured with an unidentified Chinese man) at a time when Chinese people were regarded as 'not white' historian Dr Nicola Teffer says. Because of his efforts in integrating into Australian society and making  asuccess of himself, Quong Tart was visited by Ho and Tsing and awarded the honour of Fifth-class Mandarin for valuable services rendered on behalf of his countrymen . Mei Quong Tart, whose great grandson is Syndey actor Josh Quong Tart, transformed himself into an 'English gentleman'  who transformed Sydney in the 19th century in a way which liberated Australian women to mix and circulate among different classes. Josh Quong Tart told MailOnline the photographs showed a forgotten life in colonial Sydney, which his legendary ancestor helped transform. 'He was an amazing character,' said Josh Quong Tart, who is currently playing in The Lion King in Sydney's Capitol Theatre. 'He became the quintessential gentleman who loved everything Scottish from his early days around the Australian goldfields and who yet had all the Chinese accolades such as [the ancient Chinese honour] by the Dragon throne of the Peacock Feather. 'My father, Ian Tart, told me stories about him and when I was about 12, I decided to change my last name to Quong Tart to honour his memory.' Historian and curator of the exhibitions, Dr Nicola Teffer, said Sydney In the 1880s was 'a cowboy town of pubs, oyster saloons and chophouses, a rough place with not much on offer for women. This changed with the opening of the refined tearooms owned by Chinese immigrant Quong Tart'. Quong Tart's tearooms in King street and the onetime Sydney Royal arcades 'allowed women somewhere to go when they were out shopping. No respectable woman would go to a pub and there were even very few public toilets for women'. 'Quong Tart had become a merchant trading int tea and silk from China and he saw a business opportunity in providing space for women who could not meet up except in each other's homes and then that was only if they came from the same class. 'The tearooms offered women of all classes a place to meet, socialise and collaborate on social causes such as the right to vote, temperance, the right for all children to attend a kindergarten and other women’s rights. 'They were a place for ladies who lunched, the social reformers and a source of employment for women - the waitresses who served them all.' Proud descendant: Josh Quong Tart (left) says of his ancestor, 19th century Chinese immigrant and successful businessman, Quong Tart (right) , 'it's such a fanastic story, a Chinese man who became the quintessential English gentleman, loved all things Scottish' English society: Chinese immigrants and women in Sydney like Ellen Shing, pictured (above) in the south-0western Sydney suburb of Canterbury either in 1902 or 1903 were able to integrate into society and become gentlewomen. Ms Shing's father was a Chinese draper who serviced the NSW goldfields and her mother was half-Chinese . Family snap: Quong Tart pictured in 1889-90 with his wife, Elizabeth, and children (left to right), Henrietta, baby Florence, Maggie (at front), Vine, and Arthur. The photograph was taken in the garden of their family home, Gallop House, in the inner-western Sydney suburb of Ashfield . The Celestial Sydney exhibition, Dr Teffer said, captures life in 1890s Sydney for Chinese immigrants. 'From opium dens, race riots to mixed marriages, it captures both the darkest moments of Australia’s multicultural journey and the triumph of one of our most influential and respected communities,' she said, 'and Quong Tart was a big part of Chinese people being accepted.' Arriving in 1959, the young Quong Tart went to live at Bell's Creek with a Scottish store holder. He thereon had a love of all things Scottish, quoted Robbie Burns poetry, and later wore a kilt on formal occasions. Quong Tart also promoted the cause of Chinese immigrants to Australia at a time of strong anti-Chinese sentiment and campaigned against the opium trade which flourished in Sydney in the late nineteenth and early 20th century.

Hustle and bustle: This is Sydney in 1889 on King Street with Quong Tart's Loong Shan Tea House on the right . Quong Tart married English-born, Margaret, and enjoyed a successful marriage and had four children at a time when Chinese people were not considered 'white' in Australia and Quong Tart managed to battle racial prejudice with his charm and intelligence, Dr Teffer said. He acted as a consul to what was at the time the imperial Chinese government, which made him an honorary Mandarin in 1887. When Chinese ambassadors made their first visit to Australia , Generals Ho and Tsing personally bestowed upon Quong Tart the honour 'for valuable services rendered on behalf of his countrymen'. 'Chinese immigrants had been brought over to NSW primarily as cheap labour from the late 1840s and there was a very strong anti-Chinese sentiment,'  Dr Teffer said. 'Quong Tart transcended that. He became a successful businessman and something of a celebrity who enjoyed the spotlight. He fought the trade in opium which was legal in NSW until 1906. 'He fully assimilated and became westernised it was in neutral territory like his tea rooms that women met and formulated electoral reforms and formed groups like the launderers' and typewriters associations.' Two exhibitions of artefacts and old photographs of Josh Quong Tart (pictured, above, with staff in one of his Sydney tearooms in the 1890s) and Chinese people in Sydney are on display at the Museum of Sydney . Happy marriage: Quong Tart and his English-born wife, Margaret, enjoyed a successful marriage and had four children at a time when Chinese people were not considered 'white' in Australia and Quong Tart managed to battle racial prejudice with his charm and intelligence . Challenging role: Josh Quong Tart is currently playing the role of Scar (above, left) in the Lion King at Sydney's Capitol Theatre. He says his great grandfather Mei Quong Tart is an inspiration.

"Hundreds of patients are being given potentially deadly organs from drug addicts, cancer sufferers and the elderly. At least a quarter of all transplants that took place last year involved ‘high-risk’ organs that could be damaged or infected. One surgeon was even put under pressure by officials to give livers to patients from donors dying from liver failure. Bryon Jaques, who worked for Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals before emigrating to Australia, warned the NHS drive to increase donations was flawed. Darren Hughes, 42, left, and Robert Stuart, 67, right, both died after receiving kidneys infected with meningitis-causing parasitic worms . Earlier this month, it emerged that two patients had died after being given kidneys from a homeless alcoholic infected with a rare parasitic worm. The relatives of Darren Hughes, 42, and grandfather Robert Stuart, 67, say they were never told about the lifestyle of the donor by doctors at University of Wales Hospital in Cardiff. The figures obtained from NHS Blood and Transplant, the authority which oversees donations, show that last year, 333 patients were given high-risk organs. This represented a quarter of the 1,320 transplanted and included donors who were former addicts, cancer sufferers or those aged over 71. Mr Stuart and Mr Hughes both underwent the operations at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff (pictured) last year and died within three weeks . The 333 figure was almost certainly an underestimate because it does not include donations from smokers, the obese or the very sexually active who may have HIV or other infections. The numbers of ‘marginal’ organs has almost doubled in three years – there were just 181 in 2011/11. A planning document published by the transplant authority last year stated: ‘As the number of marginal donors increases, surgeons are working increasingly at the extremes of what is acceptable.’ Experts say organs are declining in quality with more now coming from the elderly or those damaged by lifestyle. Mr Jaques, who is a transplant surgeon and liver specialist, said: ‘We were regularly offered donors that I considered to be very high risk. We were offered organs of patients who were dying of widespread sepsis (blood infection). ‘I was offered organs from patients with a history of recent and significant high grade cancer, which has a high risk of transmission. ‘We were offered livers from patients who were actually dying of liver failure. The vast majority of transplants that do take place in the UK are successful and that’s due to the dedication and hard work of the whole transplant community. ‘But this drive to increase organ donation is fundamentally flawed. The idea is that every patient dying in hospital should be a potential donor but there are too many ‘ands’ or ‘buts’ about a lot of patients who are dying in hospitals.’ Although his transplant unit refused high-risk organs, they may well have been accepted by other hospitals, Mr Jaques added. He said hospitals were under pressure from the transplant authority to accept as many organs as possible. Those that frequently turned them down were ‘named and shamed’ in monthly league tables and threatened with closure. The figures from the investigation – obtained by BBC Radio 5’s 5 Live Investigates – relate only to donors who died and do not include living kidney donors who can survive with just one. One unnamed trust rejected 72 per cent of kidneys compared with another that turned down 28 per cent. The NHS is trying to increase the numbers of willing organ donors because so many patients are dying waiting for transplants. Last year – 2013/2014 – there were 4,655 transplants, an increase of 10 per cent on the year before. Professor James Neuberger, a medical director for the transplant authority, said: ‘Hundreds of people each year benefit from transplants from organs or donors that could be considered higher risk. ‘Risks are considered against a background where many people die without a transplant and where transplant outcomes are improving. It’s the responsibility of transplant surgeons and the transplant team to discuss the risks associated with a transplant with their patients and to gain consent for procedures.’ Darren Hughes and Robert Stuart died after being given kidneys from a homeless alcoholic. Disabled father of six Mr Hughes, 42, and 67-year-old grandfather Mr Stuart were not told about the lifestyle of their donor at a Welsh NHS hospital. They died within weeks of receiving the kidneys in November last year. The organs belonged to a 39-year-old alcoholic with cirrhosis and had been rejected by hospitals in England and Scotland before they were accepted by the University of Wales Hospital in Cardiff. The man had died of meningitis from an unknown cause and the mystery behind his death had stopped surgeons in Leeds, Newcastle, Sheffield, Birmingham and Edinburgh from accepting his kidneys. It later emerged that the meningitis had been caused by the halicephalobus worm – which lives in soil and is found in horses – infecting his kidneys and brain. Mr Hughes’s father Ian told an inquest into the two men’s deaths at Cardiff Coroner’s Court earlier this month that the families were under the impression the donor had died in a car accident. Both families say the men would have been happy to stay on dialysis for the rest of their lives if suitable kidneys had not been found.","Hundreds of patients are being given potentially lethal organs from addicts .

"A Saudi preacher who tortured his five-year-old daughter to death has been released after agreeing to pay 'blood money', activists said.

The child had also been repeatedly raped and the burned. Lama suffered multiple injuries including a crushed skull, broken ribs and back, bruising and burns. She had also been raped repeatedly . Her father Fayhan al-Ghamdi, a prominent Islamist preacher who regularly appears on television in Saudi Arabia, served only a few months in jail despite admitting having used a cane and cables to inflict the injuries. Activists from the group Women to Drive said the preacher had doubted Lama's virginity and had her checked up by a medic. Randa al-Kaleeb, a social worker from the hospital where Lama was admitted, said the girl's back was broken and that she had been repeatedly raped. Her injuries were then burned. Rather than the death penalty or a long prison sentence, the judge in the case ruled the prosecution could only seek 'blood money', according to activists. The money is compensation for the next of kin under Islamic law. Torture: Saudi preacher Fayhan al-Ghamdi admitting beating his daughter with a cable and is said to have been concerned about his five-year-old daughter's virginity . Activists said the judge ruled the few months al-Ghamdi spent in prison since his arrest in November was sufficient punishment. He has reportedly agreed to pay £31,000 ($50,000), which is believed to have gone to Lama's mother. The amount is half that would have been paid if Lama had been a boy. Activists say under Islamic laws a father cannot be executed for murdering his children. Husbands can also not be executed for murdering their wives, the group say. Three Saudi activists, including Manal al-Sharif, who started the women's right to drive campaign, have raised objections to the ruling. A social media campaign is now gaining momentum after the ruling was publicised. Manal al-Sharif has launched a campaign on Twitter using the hashtag 'Ana Lama', which is translated as I am Lama, calling for better protection for children and women. Local reports say public anger in Saudi Arabia is also growing and authorities have said they will create a 24-hour hotline to take calls about child abuse.

"The Royal Bank of Scotland is in danger of failing within the next decade and putting the British taxpayer's £45 billion stake at risk, a new study has claimed. The book, by financial expert Ian Fraser, warns there is a £100 billion 'black hole' in the disgraced bank's finances despite the massive bailout it received. Fraser blames 'five broad areas of alleged criminality and wrongdoing' and said Gordon Brown and David Cameron's governments failed to reform it properly. Disgraced: Fred Goodwin, the former Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive who was at the helm when the bank needed a massive bailout . RBS, which had a bonus pool of £900million last year, brought the UK to the brink of financial ruin under the stewardship of Fred 'The Shred' Goodwin in autumn 2008. Since then RBS has been at the centre of a string of scandals that have cost the bank – still 81 per cent owned by taxpayers – billions in fines and settlements. It has already paid out £2.2 billion on PPI loan insurance, £750 million for interest rate swaps and £390 million for its role in the Libor scandal and some £60 million for violating US sanctions. In Shredded: Inside RBS, The Bank That Broke Britain, Fraser wrote: 'The result has been that, at the time of writing, RBS is probably a worse bank than it was under Fred Goodwin. 'If the right moves are now made, RBS could become a great bank again. If they're not, I doubt it will even exist in 10 years' time. 'Whatever happens, it now seems impossible that British taxpayers will ever see a return on their £45.5bn investment in the bank.' Bailout: RBS brought the UK to the brink of financial ruin under the stewardship of Fred 'The Shred' Goodwin in autumn 2008 . Fraser claims Goodwin, who in 2012 was stripped of the knighthood given to him by Gordon Brown, squandered billions of pounds on overpriced acquisitions, fleets of Mercedes and extravagant buildings and decor. The book alleges that Goodwin and his wife, Joyce, avoided tens of thousands of pounds in personal tax liabilities over their repeated use of a controversial £20 million Dassault Falcon 900EX private jet bought by RBS in 2002, The Independent on Sunday reported. The book also claims most senior RBS executives dreaded going on the plane with Goodwin because of his lack of social skills. Fraser quotes one former RBS insider who criticised the amount of money the bank spent on sponsorship of Formula One motor racing. He described it as 'a vanity thing for Fred and because he liked motor sport'.","New study says bank has £100 billion black hole in its finances .

"Parents have hit out at a high school's 'ridiculous' dress code after dozens of girls were turned away from their homecoming dance. Some arrived at Bingham High School in South Jordan, Utah, wearing floor-length gowns, others in high-necked ensembles. But one by one, around 24 girls were forced to sit in a line for inspection - before being ordered to leave. Scroll down for video . Distraught: Erika Shepherd was wearing a high-necked, floor-length gown when teachers turned her away . They are now calling on the high school to apologize, sending in  pictures of their gowns and asking teachers to analyze why they are inappropriate. One of the girls who was turned away on Saturday, Erika Shepherd, arrived in a floor-length dress. She told Fox 13: 'They pulled me to the side and asked me to twirl around to see if I was immodest, then made me sit against the wall.' 'And while I was sitting against the wall there was about ten other girls that were sitting there being embarrassed.' Eventually, a teacher told her 'it's too low in the back' and that she 'needed to get a jacket or go home and change clothes'. Her classmate Taylor Gillespie was also sent home in her knee-length purple halter-neck dress. Taylor had made sure her dress did not come up past mid-thigh when she sat down - one of the school's strict rules. Sweeping: Despite the length, officials at Bingham High School in Utah deemed Erika's dress 'inappropriate' Strict: She was told to go home and get a jacket or to leave the homecoming dance on Saturday altogether . But when she arrived, teachers would not let her in. 'They just took a wild guess and said, 'You're not admitted in.'' Her father Chad Perhson told Fox 13: 'I asked them why they turned her away and then showed them a picture of her on the phone I'd taken myself of her sitting down where the dress meets her knees.' The school has rebuffed criticism, claiming its guidelines are clearly stated on the website. The code, posted online, reads: 'Dresses should cover chest and back at the top of the armpit and should be secure and stay in position. 'Hemlines should go no higher than the mid-thigh when seated. 'Boys should be in collared shirts and no jeans. Vetted: Taylor Gillespie had checked her dress against the guidelines before arriving but was turned away . Too short? The school rules dresses must not come up above mid-thigh when sitting down . Angry: Taylor left the dance and refused to return because she was so embarrassed by the incident . 'Behaviour/dancing should be safe and appropriate. 'Students who fail to follow these guidelines will be not admitted or removed from the dance.' However, the students and their parents insist they were singled out for no reason while other students were allowed to go in. Maddi Rowley, another student upset by the situation, told Fox 13: 'Other girls were admitted into the dance wearing my same dress in different colors. I was in high heals (sic), as you can see, and I am a taller girl. 'I am very angry, especially because my date couldn't get his money refunded. Surely you can understand the injustice. I'm nearly an adult, and my parents allowed me to go out in this dress.' The incident comes two years after nearby Stansbury High barred dozens of girls from the homecoming dance for wearing dresses that were 'too short'. However, days later, the principal issued an apology.","Around 24 girls sent home from Bingham High School dance on Saturday .

Hannah Murray, head make-up artist for Topshop beauty, talked MailOnline through the look she created for yesterday’s hot-ticketed Unique show. Murray, one of fashion week's coolest and most collected make-up artists, went back to beauty basics this season and you'll be pleased to hear it's really simple to replicate at home. ‘We’re doing a rebellious boarding schoolgirl. She’s a good girl gone bad, tough but pure at the same time,’ she said of the inspiration. Schoolgirl: Jourdan Dunn showcases the results of Hannah Murray's work: boarding school girl gone bad . ‘The idea was to do this beautiful, almost choir boy like skin – so very velvety with a lovely flush that comes quite low on the cheek. ‘I then toughened it up with a black kohl eyeliner right in the waterline and quite low down on the eye so it gives the models a darkness. They’re a bit dark and quite dangerous for a young girl,’ she explained. Hannah then hooked the eyeliner into the inner corners above the eye and clumped together the lashes with tonnes of 3D curve mascara to achieve a ‘cloggy’ effect. ‘This is a girl who has done her make-up for the first time so she’s experimenting’, added Hannah. Smudged up: The idea was to do a beautiful, almost choir boy like skin with a flush of velvet on the cheeks and lashings of eyeliner and mascara . Beauty aficionados can look forward to the new Topshop Check Gels, a light gel-based cream cheek colour due to hit stores this summer, which Hannah road-tested backstage on the likes of fashion week stalwarts, Jourdan Dunn and Sam Rollinson. ‘They look like pots of jam, which I love,’ said Hannah, who used them to create a ‘blood just rushed to the cheek’ effect. Hannah flew straight into the show from a stint at New York Fashion Week and she was glad to be back on home ground. She said: ‘I just love the buzz and excitement here in London. I love the new talent and generation of designers; it’s a really exciting time here.’ All eyes on the models: Hannah flew straight into the show from a stint at New York Fashion Week to create this striking look .","Show opened with a sea of blue, followed by mustard, beige and camel .

"The family of a 35-year-old mother who died under NHS respite care have accused doctors of  making no attempt to save her life because they assumed she was dying anyway. Andrea West was suffering from cancer but had been told she could live for a further two years. But the mother of six died within days of being admitted to a palliative care centre last month with what her family thought was a routine infection. Tragic: Andrea West who passed away at Priscilla Bacon Lodge in Norwich, Norfolk, with son Honiahaka . The day before her death last month, she had been looking forward to going home, chatting with her children, eating crackers and drinking cola, her family claim. But when her husband Chris visited her the following day he found her heavily sedated. When he urged unit staff to send her to hospital for treatment, they refused – saying she would only die in the ambulance. Mr West had already become concerned about his wife’s treatment after finding she had been labelled with a ‘do not resuscitate’ notice. The notice, which meant she would not be revived if she suffered a medical crisis, went against the wishes of Mrs West and her family, who were desperate to prolong her life so she could spend precious months with her children, aged between one and 17. Yet Mr West said he and his wife had to ask five times to have the notice removed. After her death, Mr West claims he was told by a nurse and his GP that despite being expected to live for at least 18 months, his wife had been put on the Liverpool Care Pathway, the controversial system designed to ease the suffering of the dying in their final hours. Last night the clinic denied that Mrs West had been placed on the LCP. Marriage: Andrea West, pictured on her wedding day in August 2006 with her husband Chris . But the case will reignite debate over the treatment of those who are believed to be dying. Thousands of patients are placed on the LCP every year, which some medics say leads to the premature deaths of more than 100,000. Mr West said: ‘Andrea had a lot of things she wanted to do for the children. She didn’t get a chance to say goodbye to them.’ 'Andrea had a lot of things she wanted to do for the children. She didn’t get a chance to say goodbye to them' Chris West . The Norfolk Community Health and Care NHS Trust, which runs the unit where Mrs West died, declined to give further information on the case before Mrs West’s inquest. The LCP was devised in the 1990s and involves the heavy sedation of a patient and the removal of tubes providing food and fluid. However its use was criticised in the summer by a senior consultant, Professor Patrick Pullicino, who told a medical conference that nearly a third of NHS deaths now involve patients on the pathway. He said a decision to put a patient on the LCP has become ‘a self-fulfilling prophecy’, adding that ‘factors like pressure on beds and difficulty with nursing confused or difficult-to-manage elderly patients cannot be excluded’. Mrs West, who had two children from a previous marriage and four – aged seven, four, three and one – with her husband, was diagnosed with cervical cancer in January last year which later spread to her lymph nodes. Mother-of-six: Mrs West (pictured left, and right with other people at her wedding), had two children from a previous marriage and four - aged seven, four, three and one - with her husband . Her husband said she had been given between 18 months and two years to live. Mr West, a former care worker who now looks after his children full-time, said a nurse had advised him last month that his wife should be admitted to Priscilla Bacon Lodge in Norwich for palliative care. The Liverpool Care Pathway was devised in the city in the 1990s to make the dying as comfortable and free of pain as possible. It was recommended to hospitals across the UK by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in 2004. The Pathway is designed to come into operation when doctors believe it is impossible for a patient to recover and death is imminent. Patients on the pathway are sedated with drugs and deprived of nutrition and hydration by tube. On average a patient will die 33 hours after entering the pathway. Critics of the system claim it is increasingly being applied to patients without their families’ knowledge. ‘I believed she had an infection,’ he . said. ‘She had had the same symptoms in the past with infections. I . didn’t think it was serious at all.’ Mr West and the children visited Mrs West on September 19. ‘She was active, cheerful and looking forward to going home,’ Mr West said. ‘She spoke to her children, she was eating cheese and crackers, and she was drinking Coke with lemon.’ However, he said, his wife was concerned because she had been told doctors had placed a ‘do not resuscitate’ notice in her notes. Mr West said his wife told him: ‘I have fought this far. Why would I want to die now?’ However, he said, it took five requests from himself and his wife before medics removed the DNR notice. The following day, at 6.30am, Mr West was phoned by nurses to be told his wife had been bleeding and vomiting. He was, he said, told she was likely to die that day. ‘I couldn’t understand it at all,’ he said. ‘I couldn’t understand why they assumed she was going to die so quickly.’ On arriving at the unit he said he found that his wife had been heavily sedated and no tubes for artificial hydration or nutrition had been connected. Sad case: Her husband said she had been given between 18 months and two years to live . He said he was later told she had been placed on the LCP. ‘I asked a nurse and she said, “We are treating her on the Liverpool Care Pathway. The papers have been prepared by the doctor and she is being treated as a dying lady on the LCP”.’ He said he ‘argued with’ doctors to provide his wife with intravenous fluid and this was done. As her condition worsened he threatened to call an ambulance to take her to hospital. 'I couldn’t understand it at all. I couldn’t understand why they assumed she was going to die so quickly' Mr West . ‘They said I shouldn’t do that,’ he said. ‘They said it would disturb her dignity and she would die in the ambulance.’ His wife died at 8.30pm that evening. ‘Her death was sudden and very unexpected,’ he said. ‘She would have been shocked at the idea that she was dying. We all thought she had a year, probably a year and a half. She wanted to make boxes for the children, with pictures and other things to remember her by.’ He added: ‘One day she was eating and drinking. The next she was dead. It makes no sense to me.’ A spokesman for the Norfolk Community Health and Care NHS Trust said: ‘We can confirm this patient was not on the Liverpool Care Pathway. However, we have been advised by the coroner that it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time as it may be subject to a coroner’s inquest.’","Mother-of-six Andrea West, 35, went into palliative care centre last month .

"American war vet-turned-aid-worker Peter Kassig talked about his hopes and dreams, and what motivated him to return to the Middle East as a medical worker, in an inspiring 2012 profile. Sitting down with CNN Senior International Correspondent Arwa Damon, the Indianapolis, Indiana, native referred to himself as a 'hopeless romantic' and 'idealist,' eager to do as much as he could with his life. The 26-year-old has been held captive by ISIS for the past year, and the terrorist organization is now threatening to kill him in response to increased attacks on the group by the United States. Scroll down for video . Idealist: In a 2012 interview, Peter Kassig (above), revealed his hopes and dreams and why he decided to become a humanitarian worker . Captured: He has been a hostage of ISIS since October 1, 2013, and the terrorist group is now threatening to kill him after releasing a video of him yesterday (above) Inspiration: Kassig says devoting his life to aid work is 'what he was put here to do' 'The way I saw it, I didn't have a choice. This is what I was put here to do,' the young man told CNN of his decision to travel to Beirut and help Syrian refugees fleeing to Lebanon. He then added, 'I guess I am just a hopeless romantic, and I am an idealist, and I believe in hopeless causes.' A member of the U.S. Army Rangers, he was deployed to Iraq in 2007 and honorably discharged for medical reasons after a brief tour. After returning home however, and studying political science at Butler University in Indiana, something felt off the Kassig. 'I was going to school with kids who look the same, were the same age as me, but we weren't the same,' he said. 'I wanted more of a challenge, a sense of purpose.' Humanitarian: Kassig put his certification as an emergency medical technician to use by providing medical relief to refugees .

This is something for me that has meaning, that has purpose.' He also founded SERA (Special Emergency Response and Assistance) around this time, a medically-oriented emergency relief organization that serves refugee populations and internally displaced persons. It was while working on a project for SERA almost exactly a year ago, on October 1, 2013, when he was detained by members of ISIS as he headed to to Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria. U.S. officials confirmed yesterday that Kassig was being held by Islamic State militants but declined to give any more details of his capture.

"Despite a collection of seemingly racist rants about 'negros,' slavery and 'picking cotton,' not everyone thinks Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy is a racist, and one of the people defending the one-time far-right-wing folk hero is one of his bodyguards - who happens to be black. Jason Bullock has been at Bundy's side since his battle with the federal government began heating up in late March. According to Bullock, the man he's come to know over the last month is not a racist. In fact, Bullock says he would take a bullet for Bundy. Jason Bullock (left) says he would take a bullet for Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy (center) despite his recent racially insensitive rants . Not racist: Bullock says he is not offended by the comments Bundy has made and says he looks at him as a grandfather figure . Bullock was recently interviewed by CNN and asked, 'You're protecting this man and he's wondering whether African-Americans would be better off as slaves. How does that strike you?' 'It doesn't strike me any kind of way,' Bullock answered. 'This is still the same old Mr. Bundy I met from the first day of all this happening.' Bullock says the things Bundy has been saying - 'wondering' if 'negros' were better off under slavery, and comparing himself to civil rights hero Rosa Parks, for example - don't offend him. 'Mr. Bundy is not a racist. Ever since I've been here he's treated me with nothing but hospitality,' Bullock told the reporter. 'He's pretty much treated me like his own family.' He goes on to say that 'I would take a bullet for that man, if need be,' and that he 'look(s) up to him just like I do my grandfather.' The cause: Bullock says he believes in Bundy's cause, which is why he is willing to give his life to defend him . 'I believe in his cause and after having . met Mr. Bundy a few times, I have a really good feel about him and I'm a . pretty good judge of character,' Bullock said. However, Bundy's racist rants have led to public outcry and political allies distancing themselves - but Bundy doesn't see what all the fuss is about, claiming he is just like Rosa Parks and 'standing up against laws which destroy our freedom'. Bundy has become something of a celebrity in his frontier, Nevada stronghold since his showdown over cattle-grazing land with federal authorities earlier this month. He was quickly upheld as a hero by the right with Senator Rand Paul dubbing him a 'patriot'. However, that reputation is now in tatters after Bundy's series of racist rants - and it appears he just can't help fanning the flames with further remarks. On Friday, he invoked the heroic actions of Rosa Parks, the civil rights icon who was arrested in 1955 after refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man in Montgomery, Alabama. Her actions sparked the Montgomery bus boycott and were a defining moment of the civil rights' movement. Scroll down for new video . Nevada Cattle rancher Cliven Bundy held up his boot today for the cameras as he said he 'didn't want to put his foot in his mouth with the boot on' following the uproar over his racist remarks . On the Bundy Ranch Facebook page on Friday, he wrote: 'I . am doing the same thing Rosa Parks did - I am standing up against bad . laws which dehumanize us and destroy our freedom. Just like the . Minutemen at Lexington and Concord, we are saying no to an oppressive . government which considers us to be slaves rather than free men. 'I . invite all people in America to join in our peaceful revolution to . regain our freedom. That is how America was started, and we need to keep . that tradition alive.' Bundy earlier said that if people were offended by his use of the word 'negro' or 'slave' then 'Martin Luther King hasn't got his job done yet'. The Conservative father of 14 told CNN: 'If I say Negro or black boy or slave, if those people cannot take those kind of words and not be (offended), then Martin Luther King hasn't got his job done yet....We need to get over this prejudice stuff.' Later in the rambling interview, he whipped off his cowboy boot and said: 'I didn't want to put my foot in my mouth with the boot on.' Officials had tried to round up Bundy's . cattle and evict him on April 12 after 20 years of not paying federal taxes. However they were forced to give up after a militia of several hundred . people, some of them armed with sniper rifles, turned up and threatened . to open fire. When asked by CNN host Bill Weir whether he was a 'welfare queen' on Thursday, Bundy responded: 'I might be a welfare queen. But I'll tell you I'm producing something for America and using a resource that nobody else would use or could use. I'm putting red meat on the table.' Bundy was forced to abandon his speeches about the 'overreaching' federal government on Thursday when his racist remarks emerged in a New York Times' article. Flanked by armed supporters, rancher Cliven Bundy speaks at a protest camp near Bunkerville, Nevada on April 18. He was adopted by the right as a hero but many public figures are now distancing themselves following his racist remarks . During his speech, Bundy shared a story of driving through a housing project in Las Vegas, according to a report by the New York Times, beginning his tale with the words: 'I want to tell you one more thing I know about the Negro.' He said: 'In front of that . government house the door was usually open and the older people and the . kids - and there is always at least a half a dozen people sitting on the . porch - they didn’t have nothing to do. They didn’t have nothing for . their kids to do. They didn’t have nothing for their young girls to do. 'And . because they were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they . do? They abort their young children, they put their young . men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. And I’ve . often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having . a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government . subsidy? They didn’t get no more freedom. They got less freedom.' Rancher Cliven Bundy (center with his arm around his granddaughter Jerusha) greets supporters during a Bundy family 'Patriot Party' near Bunkerville, Nevada, on April 18 . Mr Bundy, a 67-year-old father-of 14 and registered Republican, is . accused of not paying federal grazing taxes for his cattle for 20 . years, and reportedly owes the government $1million. A federal taskforce . has been setup to deal with him, Senate majority leader and Nevada Democrat Harry Reid said last week, branding Bundy a 'domestic terrorist'. Reid accused the militia supporting Reid of deliberately putting women and children into the firing line so that, in the event of violence, they got hurt first ensuring the worst possible headlines. Meanwhile Bundy has warned that he will never back down down from his fight. 'They will come, and I don't care,' he told MailOnline earlier this month. 'The people and citizens of America will win this fight. We have God on our side and we will be better prepared for them next time.' He said supporters from across the U.S., many of the armed a prepared to defend themselves, were heading for the remote town of Bunkersville, about 80 miles from Las Vegas in southern Nevada. He said: 'People have been mobilized by what they have seen and heard and they will come here because they see it as their right to defend the land.' Officials tried to round up Bundy's cattle and evict him on April 12 but were forced to give up after a militia of several hundred people, some of them armed, turned up and threatened to open fire . Bundy won the first round of his fight with agents from the Bureau of Land . Management after they released several hundred cows they had seized as . part of a long running dispute over grazing rights in Nevada. Craig Leff, from the Bureau of Land Management, told the Times: 'The gather is now over. Our focus is pursuing this matter . administratively and judicially.' Fears . of an armed confrontation with dozens of armed militia who had camped . out in a field leading to Bundy's ranch led federal officials to call . off their operation. Supporters . of Bundy hailed the decision as a victory - but the decision was taken . in part because Clark County Sheriff's feared violence could erupt at . any moment. Many . of the militia, who wore camouflage clothing and stalked the roads . around the Bundy home carrying automatic weapons,said they were prepared . to take on the federal agents in a fire fight. One was overheard boasting that he had two agent in his gun sight and could 'take them down'. The . dispute between Bundy and federal land managers began in 1993 when he . stopped paying monthly fees of about $1.35 per cow-calf pair to graze . public lands that are also home to imperiled animals such as the Mojave . Desert tortoise. Surrounding Bundy's ranch, one armed man (not pictured) was heard saying he had officials 'in his sights' during the heated stand-off earlier this month . Land managers limited the Bundy herd to just 150 head on a land which the rancher claims has been in his family for more than 140 years. The government also claims Bundy has ignored cancellation of his grazing leases and defied federal court orders to remove his cattle. Last week, they began an operation to seize his cattle prompting the stand off and mini invasion by militia members from California, Arizona, Montana and Utah to rush to his support. Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie was able to negotiate a resolution after talking with Bundy. It has not been revealed if Bundy would pay the estimated $1.2million he owes to the Government. The dispute that ultimately triggered the roundup dates to 1993, when the bureau cited concern for the federally protected tortoise in the region. The bureau revoked Bundy's grazing rights after he stopped paying grazing fees and disregarded federal court orders to remove his animals. The fight between Bundy and the Bureau of Land Management widened into a debate about states' rights and federal land-use policy.","Cattle rancher Cliven Bundy's black bodyguard, Jason Bullock, says he would take a bullet for him .

"The White House announced $254.6 million in new aid for Central American countries today. The money will go toward returning unaccompanied minors who travel to the U.S. illegally to their families and fostering youth centered programs in their home countries, the White House said this afternoon. The assistance to the governments of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras announced today is in addition to the $130 million in aid the U.S. already provides those countries in economic assistance. The U.S. has also decided to begin detaining families at the border instead of giving them court dates and releasing them. The new aid package and the illegal immigration crisis at the U.S. border will be the subject of Vice President Joe Biden's meetings this afternoon in Guatemala with senior representatives of the Central American countries. Scroll down for video .

(age 17 or younger) apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol, fiscal years . 2008-2014; statistics show a dramatic increase in children coming across . the U.S.-Mexico border since 2012 . Misconceptions about the Obama administration's illegal immigration policies have caused mammoth numbers of Central American children to embark on the dangerous journey to the United States throughout the last two years. The president's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy initiative only applies to illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. under the age of 16 before June 15, 2012 and had lived in the U.S. continuously for five years before that dates. But teens and children from Central America have been flooding the United States guided by the belief that they too will receive amnesty. Roughly 47,000 unaccompanied minors have made the trip from Mexico to Texas since . October. The Obama administration expects a total of 80,000 illegal immigrant children to come to the U.S. this year alone, according to a report in the Christian Science Monitor. The White House says U.S. immigration officials repatriated 47,769 illegal immigrants from Guatemala, 37,049 from Honduras, and 21,602 from El Salvador last year. That makes up approximately 29 percent of all U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency deportations. The White House did not say how many of the illegal immigrants being sent back to those countries were ages 17 and younger. Overcrowded: Children sleep under red cross blankets on the floor of a Border Patrol center in Texas . The White House sent Biden, left, to meet with Molina, right, and other regional leaders to warn against the perils of illegal immigration and announce that the U.S. will start detaining families at the border instead of releasing them on their own recognizance . The White House rushed to publicly address the issue this week after photos of children sleeping on floors in cramped quarters and reports of unhygienic conditions in the detention centers surfaced several weeks ago. Today the White House announced that it would . provide additional resources to the Department of Justice and DHS so that they can process removals of illegal immigrants more . rapidly. In a letter to President Obama, House Speaker John Boehner called on the president to go one step further and 'immediately deploy the National Guard.' 'The National Guard is uniquely qualified to respond to such humanitarian crises, 'Boehner said. 'They are able to help deal with both the needs of these children and families as well as relieve the border patrol to focus on their primary duty of securing our border.' President Obama has not yet responded to Boehner's letter, but it divulged this afternoon that it would give Central American countries $9.6 million to expand their repatriation centers so that they can intake returned migrants more quickly. The U.S. will give another $40 million to Guatemala, $25 million to El Salvador and $18.5 million to Honduras for at-risk youth services that are intended to slow the rate of gang growth and migration to America, in addition to the $161.5 million it is giving to the region for similar programs.

Young boys, mostly of Central American descent, wait for medical appointments in a holding area at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Nogales Placement Center . Last weekend the White House announced that Biden would tack on a trip to Guatemala to his Latin American trip to speak to leaders of Central American countries about the 'root causes' of the mass migrations and find out how the U.S. can help the countries 'try to make life better . for these families and children in all of the countries of Central . America.' This afternoon Biden met with Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina and Guatemalan Vice President Roxanna Baldetti. Later he will meet with Salvadoran President Salvador Sanchez Ceren. 'The surge of unaccompanied minors making . the very perilous journey from Central America to the United State and . often if not primarily in the hands of smuggling networks that engage in . physical and sexual abuse of these children,' Biden said in a statement . after his meeting with the Guatemalan government. 'This is a serious . humanitarian issue standing alone all by itself, and … it is a . fundamentally shared problem for the United States, Mexico, and this . entire region.' In his remarks, Biden acknowledge that 'the current situation is not sustainable.' 'It is unacceptable,' he said. But it is important that Guatemala recognize and address the root reasons children are fleeing the country, Biden said. 'Especially poverty, insecurity and the lack of the rule of law, so the people can stay and thrive in their own communities,' Biden said, 'so a parent doesn’t feel so desperate that they put their child in the hands of a criminal network and say take him, and take her to the United States.' Guatemala's president said in his own statement that he had asked the U.S. to give illegal immigrants from Central America a 'temporary protected status' that would allow them to stay in the United States because of how dangerous it has become to live in their home countries. The U.S. has already denied to give Central Americans any sort of special immigration status and that is unlikely to change now. Yesterday, President .

Koppenhaver arrived unannounced to my home in Las Vegas, NV, after he . broke up with me in May he moved out of my house and back to San Diego,' Mack wrote on Twitter. 'When he arrived, he found myself and one other fully clothed and unarmed . in the house. Without a single word spoken, he began beating my friend; . once he was finished, he sent my friend away and turned his attention . to me. 'He made me undress and shower in front of him, then dragged me . out and beat my face. I  have . no recollection of how many times I was hit, I just know my injuries . that resulted from my beating. My injuries include 18 broken bones . around my eyes, my nose is broken in 2 places, I am missing teeth and . several more are broken.'

Mack said that Koppenhaver had long been abusive in their relationship but that this beating had made her fear for her life . 'After some time, the knife broke off of the handle and continued to threaten me with the blade. I believed I was going to die. He has beaten me many times before, but never this badly. He took my phone and cancelled all of my plans for the following week to make sure no one would worry about my whereabouts. He told me he was going to rape me, but was disappointed in himself when he could not get hard. After another hit or two, he left me on the floor bleeding and shaking, holding my side from the pain of my rib.' Mack writes that she made her escape when Koppenhaver went into her kitchen where she assumed he was searching for a new knife. 'I ran out my back door, shutting it . behind me so the dogs didn't run inside to tip him off. I hoped the . fence to the golf course behind my house and ran to a neighboring house. Naked and afraid he would catch me, I kept running through the . neighborhood knocking on doors. Finally one answered and I was brought . to the hospital and treated for my injuries.' Mack concluded that she had been living in fear of Koppenhaver for months, and that the pair had an abusive relationship in which she tolerated beatings and infidelity in the past.

I can't believe what I found and can't believe what happened. 'I'm so heart broken...in all ways. I will always love you.' TMZ reports that Mack is 'in very bad shape' after the attack and can barely speak from her injuries. A representative for the porn actress told TMZ that Mack's friends and relatives are offering a $5,000 reward to anyone who can provide clues as to Koppenhaver's whereabouts. Koppenhaver has also taken to Twitter about the incident, writing that he wanted to surprise Mack with an engagement ring but couldn't 'believe what I found.' 'I love you and hope you're okay. I came him (sic) early to surprise . you and help you set up for your convention. I can't believe what I . found and can't believe what happened.

His mom Andrea Kelly, the singer's ex-wife and star of reality series 'Hollywood Exes', has been supportive of his transition and has proudly shared pictures of them together online.

"Once considered a taboo, online dating has become the go-to way of finding love in the twenty-first century - with over 9m Brits logging on in the last year, the stats speak for themselves. But could the likes of Tinder, Match and OkCupid actually be ruining your love life rather than boosting it? One psychologist thinks so. New research shows that despite so many of us are logging on to find love, we are actually staying single for longer and one psychologist believes that because we are so dependent on communicating online, we've lost the ability approach potential love interests in real life. Is Tinder ruining YOUR love life? Research has revealed that more people are single in this day and age and one psychologist thinks online dating is to blame . Speaking to Look magazine's Jenny Stallard, Emma Kenny explained the theory behind the rise of the 'Tinderella syndrome'. She said: 'The problem is, online dating breeds impatience and insecurity. You're suddenly inundated with so many potential love interests that you stop investing the same amount of effort into meeting actual people offline. 'Of course, it's going to be harder to take the plunge to start up a conversation with a stranger in a bar than sending an anonymous message to a man with a witty dating profile - especially because you can just log off if it gets uncomfortable, rather than finding yourself trapped in an awkward conversation. 'But online dating was designed to enhance your love life - not replace it altogether.' Kate Taylor, Match's resident relationship guru, isn't convinced and believes that online dating helps our love lives enormously. Defending online dating, she told MailOnline: 'Mobile dating apps are actually helping people flirt and chat with each other - they make people feel more confident when they end up talking face-to-face. 'You already know so much about each other - from favourite foods, to films, job and hobbies - that conversation in person is much easier and less stilted. You’re not starting from scratch. Vicious circle? One psychologist believes that online dating breeds impatience and insecurity. 'You're suddenly inundated with so many potential love interests that you stop investing the same amount of effort into meeting actual people offline,' she said . 'Plus, meeting someone through your mobile gives shy people a helping hand. They’re no longer forced to stammer out a chat-up line, but have time to think about the perfect conversation opener.' Kate, who met her fiancée on the website, maintains that people can't get addicted to using online dating sites and apps. She said: 'Remember people use the service to help them meet new people - not to hide behind a screen forever. It can be exciting to see how many singles are in your area, and receiving new emails is always a thrill, but that’s usually with the objective of getting to know someone in person.

"There was no escaping the soggy weather for fashionistas in London on Saturday morning as designer Orla Keily added umbrellas and a rainy day soundtrack to her show. Irish designer Kiely, one of the Duchess of Cambridge's go-to labels for smart daytime dressing, was one of the first shows of the second day of the fashion extravaganza. Instead of a standard catwalk she created a retro set at the Central Saint Martins building where models wrapped up in teddy bear coats, pastel-coloured wool and pretty swing dresses. Orla Kiely's AW14 London Fashion Week show mirrored the city's wet weather . The Irish designer's signature style is 'colour, pattern and texture with a Sixties twist' Kiely describes her signature style as . 'colour, pattern and texture with a 60s twist.' Here . white tights, chunky shoes and oversized Peter Pan collars gave the . looks that sweet Sixties edge that Alexa Chung channels so well, while knee-length hems, safe cuts and lots of sleeves will no doubt keep the Duchess coming back for more. Chunky shoes, thick tights and oversized Peter Pan collars injected a retro vibe into a very wearable, if not very glamorous, collection . Kiely's Sixties take on the furry teddy bear coat, which has been a huge hit this winter . Meanwhile, designer Emilia Wickstead seemed to be doing everything she can to move away from that pretty pink dress that Duchess Kate once chose to wear for a Buckingham Palace tea party. Her smouldering AW14 collection took influence from film noir with edgy looking models stomping down the catwalk in leather dresses, snakeskin coats and embellished socks. So far so NOT Kate. The Duchess of Cambridge in an Orla Kiely . bird-print dress at a charity event in London (l) and a pale pink Emilia . Wickstead dress for a Buckingham Palace garden party . Waists were nipped and skirts were flared managing to be incredibly sexy despite a serious absence of flesh: a calf here, a flash of midriff there. Pops of colour came in fuchsia gowns and rainbow-coloured lace and most looks were finished with spiked, metallic Manolo Blahnik heels, slicked hair and a scowl from the models. Dramatic snakeskin pieces and spiked Manolo Blahnik heels added edge to Emilia Wickstead's LFW show . Pops of colour came in mustard and cerulean lace . Turtle necks and slicked hair gave the show a more serious vibe than previous collections . The standout piece for most of the attending fashion press was a fuchsia gown which has already enjoyed a red carpet moment as model Suki Waterhouse wore a pastel version of the dress to a BAFTA party. Suki didn't make an appearance on Saturday's front row, but London Fashion Week regulars Laura Bailey, Olivia Palermo and Poppy Delevingne were there to up the glamour factor, with Bailey choosing a bright striped dress from Wickstead's spring/summer collection dressed down with a casualparka, in her signature English eccentric style. A fuchsia gown was the standout piece of the show . (L-R) Laura Bailey, Olivia Palermo and Poppy Delevingne front row at Emilia Wickstead . Max Factor's lead make-up artist, Mel Arter, created, what she described as, a raw nude look for the Emilia Wickstead show today. For the base, she prepped with the brand's newly launching primer, which coated the skin with a Velcro effect and added longevity. She then neutralised and corrected the skin with each of the brand's five new CC sticks, which were hand-picked by the legendary Pat McGrath and are due to launch in April. 'These sticks neutralise any imperfections, so if you're quite sallow, we've got the purple to bring skin back to life and the green stick, which helps with redness, and we have a highlighter stick too,' explained Mel. Raw nude: Mel Arter created a very subtle and matte complexion for today's show . She then applied a warm nude highlighter to the cheekbones with her fingertips and completed the look with the new Lipfinity shade, Always Delicate, a lovely warm nude that really brings the lips to life. 'We don't want it to be too glamorous, the clothes do the talking so we wanted the look to be quite a contrast,' she said. There was a difference backstage this season, Mel was wearing the brand new Google Glass, which captured exactly what she saw as she created the beauty look. Mel said: 'Being backstage is an exciting time for a make-up artist. It’s a prime opportunity to get really creative and use the latest products for the first time. 'By using Google Glass this season, you’ll be able to see exactly how I’m creating the look; a make-up artist view on camera that has not been seen before. 'Women can then follow this process and create all or parts of the look themselves at home. 'I think we are going to be seeing them a lot more in the world of make-up artistry. I am chuffed to be pioneering it.' Now THAT's cool!

"A Christian-run bakery that triggered a discrimination row when it refused to bake a cake with a pro-gay marriage slogan will fight the case in court rather than pay a 'modest' settlement. Ashers Baking Company refused in May to bake the cake printed with the words 'support gay marriage'. The cake was also to have had pictures of two characters from Sesame Street, the name of the group, Queerspace, and the year it was founded, 1998. Scroll down for video . The cake was ordered to mark the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia, but Daniel McArthur (left) refused to bake it citing his religious beliefs . The order, placed by gay rights activist Gareth Lee, was originally accepted by employees but the bakery later decided it was against its beliefs. The bakery's owner, Daniel McArthur, said he should not have to promote a cause he does not believe in. Mr McArthur - who is being financially backed by the Christian Institute - has refused the compensation request. 'We’re continuing to hold to the stand that we took originally because we believe it’s biblical, we believe it’s what God would want us to do,' he said. 'We feel that the Equality Commission are pursuing us because of our beliefs that marriage is between a man and a woman,' he said. 'We also think that if we do cave in to the Equality Commission at this point it’ll put pressure on other citizens who are defending their view of traditional marriage.' He said God's 'purposes will prevail' as the case unfolds. The Equality Commission wrote to baking company last month stating that they would be seeking compensation on the grounds of discrimination. 'Biblical stand': Daniel McArthur said his family bakery shouldn't have to promote marriage equality. They said on October 27 that Mr McArthur had a week to pay or civil action would be launched. The Christian Institute says the Equality Commission has 'dreamed up' its case against the bakery. 'It is simply baffling for a body supposedly working for equality to be threatening a Christian family, all because of a cake,' said spokesman Simon Calvert. 'The Equality Commission has taken four months to dream up new grounds on which to pursue the McArthur family, claiming that they’ve breached political discrimination laws.' He told the MailOnline: 'You can't put a price on conscience. 'The Equality Commission seems to think that some people's conscience is worth more than others.' Mr Calvert said the bakery had received support from people who do not believe the McArthur's views, but nevertheless respect his right to voice them. He also said thousands of dollars had been raised to support the bakery in its legal fight. 'This is a David-verse-Goliath battle against a state-backed organisation,' he said. In a statement the Commission said: 'In its letter the Commission stated that they would prefer not to have to litigate these issues and sought an acknowledgement that there has been an unlawful breach of the equality laws and an assurance that this will not be repeated.' Ashers Baking Company has seven outlets and said it has received community support in its fight . In the past the courts have said it is wrong for Christians to refuse to serve gay people on grounds of their sexuality. Judges have also said it is right for Christians to be fired from their jobs for refusing to take part in same-sex civil partnership ceremonies or for saying they would not give sex therapy to same-sex couples. But the challenge to the Christian-run Ashers Baking Company is the first likely legal case in which anyone has been told it is against the law to refuse to take part in gay rights publicity campaigns. A July ComRes poll found that six in 10 Britons though it was ‘disproportionately heavy-handed’ to drag the bakery company to court because of its beliefs.","Ashers bakery won't apologise or pay settlement for refusing service .

"The woman who had her claims of being raped as a child overturned by Hillary Clinton in Arkansas in 1975 has accused the former Secretary of State of being a hypocrite. The unnamed victim says Clinton should not be known as a champion of women's rights after the then-attorney found a way for her attacker to get off on a lesser charge and lighter sentence. As newly released tapes of Clinton discussing the case surfaced, the woman, who was a 12-year-old virgin at the time of the attack, told the Daily Beast her character had been smeared in the trial. Scroll down to listen to the audio interview . Accusations: Hillary Clinton, pictured with daughter Chelsea earlier this month. The victim of a sex offender she represented has spoken out about how Clinton treated the case . She accused Clinton of misrepresenting her as a child who sought out the attention of older men and who had made false claims of abuse before. 'Hillary Clinton took me through Hell,' the victim said, after hearing how Clinton had laughed as she discussed . the trial in a recorded interview. Legal past: Hillary Clinton, pictured in 1980, helped a man accused of child rape get a lighter sentence . Denying claims in the trial that she was 'emotionally unstable' and had a tendency to seek out older men, the victim said she would call Clinton a hypocrite if she met her again, and said she would be concerned if Clinton ran for President. 'If she . becomes president, is she gonna be telling the world the truth? No. She’s going to be telling lies out there, what the world wants to hear,' the victim said. She added that if she met her again she would tell Clinton: 'You took a . case of mine in '75, you lied on me… I realize the truth now, the heart . of what you’ve done to me. 'And you are supposed to be for women? You . call that [being] for women, what you done to me? And I hear you on tape . laughing"",' the victim told the Daily Beast. In an interview that was recorded but never released, Clinton had discussed the case, which was her first as a criminal defense lawyer. During the course of the conversation . which dates from the early 1980s, Clinton, then 27, outlined how she . used a mistake by the prosecution to get 41-year-old Thomas Alfred . Taylor a lighter sentence. Taylor, who died in 1992, pleaded guilty . to unlawful fondling of a child and was sentenced to one year in . prison, which was reduced for time served. Shockingly, Clinton laughed as she indicated that she knew he may have been guilty, and discussed how she got him to take a lie detector test. 'I had him take a polygraph, which he passed – which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs,' Clinton said with a laugh. Career path: Bill and Hillary in 1969. In 1975, the year the couple were married, Clinton represented Thomas Taylor in her first trial as a criminal defense lawyer . The victim said her experiences and the way she was treated in court left her scared of men for years. She never married or had children, and turned to drugs at one point. Although she managed to get her life back on track, the woman said she remains angry at what she called a 'miscarriage of justice'. 'It’s proven fact, with all the tapes, [Clinton] lied like a dog on me. I think she was trying to do . whatever she could do to make herself look good at the time,' th ewoman said. 'She didn’t care if those guys did it or not. I do not think . justice was served at all.' The woman added that before the rape trial she had never previously accused anyone of attacking or harming her. Distressed: The victim has accused Clinton, pictured at the Children's Defense Fund's 40th anniversary last year, as a hypocrite for calling herself a champion on women's rights . She claimed that when she spoke to a Newsday reporter in 2008, she was misquoted when she said she was 'sure Hillary was just doing her job'. 'If I had known that day what I know now, I would have told him exactly what I'm telling y'all today,' she told the Daily Beast. After hearing the tapes of Clinton discussing her case, the victim said she was moved to tears. '[Clinton] owes me a big apology, [but] I’ll . probably never get anything from her,' she said.

"President Barack Obama announced his intention today to send up to 300 U.S. military advisers into Iraq to help train the country's military. The president expressly stated that the move does not 'foreshadow' a military intervention and said sending troops back into Iraq to fight radical extremists would not benefit the U.S. 'American forces will not be returning to combat in Iraq,' Obama said, ' but we will help Iraqis as they take the fight to terrorists who threaten the Iraqi people, the region and American interests, as well.' The president also said the U.S. was currently ‘identifying targets’ associated with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria terrorist group and that the U.S. would take ‘targeted and precise military action if and when we determine that the situation on the ground requires it' - an obvious nod to air strikes.

Already, the president had deployed 275 armed marines to protect State Department personnel working at the embassy in Baghdad. He had also sent the USS George H.W. Bush aircraft carrier with . its usual battleship escort, the USS Mesa Verde, an amphibious transport . ship that can carry 550 marines and helicopters and armed F-18 Super Hornet warplanes to do surveillance. Obama told members of Congress during a meeting on Wednesday that he did not need their permission to take the actions he was considering. However, he said on Thursday that he would continue to work with Congress to provide additional equipment to the Iraqi military through his newly created Counterterrorism Partnership Fund and that he would consult Congress, as well as Iraqi leaders, if he decided to pull the trigger on air strikes. Iraqi . Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, a Shiite, has asked President Obama for air . strikes against the Sunni Islamist militants who have been carving a . wide swath through his country, but Obama has been slow to comply. The President told congressional leaders yesterday that the U.S. does not have strong enough intelligence at this time to carry out the strikes, an aide with knowledge of the discussion told the Huffington Post yesterday. Obama also expressed anxiety about the number of civilian casualties that the strikes could cause, as well concerns about instability within Iraq's government. The president said last week that he would not provide Iraq with military assistance until the country's leaders made serious moves toward putting their sectarian differences aside. Standing up for themselves: More than 200,000 Iraqis have volunteered to defend their country, including this group of farmers . Vice President Joe Biden spoke on Wednesday with Maliki, the country's Sunni parliamentary speaker and the the . president of the country's self-ruled Kurdish region. He . praised their efforts to bring together their respective communities in . a televised show of unity against ISIS, the White House said. Lawmakers . have been putting pressure on Obama to call for Maliki's resignation . for days, and the Associated Press said reported Thursday morning that . Obama might ask Maliki to resign as a Hail Mary effort to stop the . country's civil war. However, Obama repeatedly said on Thursday, 'It's not the place for the United States to choose Iraq's leaders.' There . is an 'urgent' need for Iraq to convene a new parliament that gives all . Iraqis the sense that they are part of a unity government, though, Obama said. 'Right now what is happening is the fate of Iraq hangs in the balance.' The U.S. president hedged when asked at a presser Thursday after his statement if he had lost faith in Maliki to lead . the country and referred back to his previous statements. US President Barack Obama meets with Congressional leadership including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (2nd R), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (L), House Speaker John Boehner (2nd L), and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (R), in the Oval Office of the White House on June 18, 2014 in Washington, DC. The leaders met to discuss strategy on Iraq . Former U.S. general David Petraeus, . who led the 'surge' that finally brought calm to Iraq, struck a cautious . note on Western intervention on Wednesday. Speaking . at a conference in London, General Petraeus said the Iraqi government . needed to reach out to the Sunni minority before the US got involved . militarily. He said: 'If . the US is to support the Iraqi government it would have to be a . government against terrorism, rather than one side in a civil war.' 'This . cannot be the United States being the air force for Shia militias, or a . Shia on Sunni Arab fight,' he told the Margaret Thatcher Conference on . Liberty. President Obama . expressed concern at doing just that on Thursday and again called on . Iraq's government to come together to fight the common treat to their . nation. He also fired a warning shot at Iran. The . U.S. welcome's the country to play a 'constructive role' in Iraq, he . said, but 'If Iran is coming in solely as an armed force on behalf of . the Shia, and it is framed in that fashion, that probably worsens the . situation.' 'Obviously . what has happened in Syria in part is the result of Iran coming in hot . and heavy' on one side, Obama said, referring to the upheaval in that . country. Obama said he hopes Iran will take a 'more promising path' in Iraq, 'but old habits die hard.' Deployment: F-18 launches off the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS George H.W.

MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter lands on the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush during flight operations in the Arabian Gulf on June 17, 2014 .

Reports . first surfaced on Twitter from ABC, NBC and Fox News about the sorties, . which are taking off and landing on the USS George H.W. Bush, an . aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf. The Obama administration had already authorized 'manned and unmanned' surveillance flights, Fox News reported. But F-18s are not surveillance aircraft. They are attack planes. A . U.S. official hinted to Fox that part of the strategy is to project . strength by rolling out the big guns even on routine video and photo . missions. 'It's not so much about looking as it is being seen,' the official said. The White . House told reporters on Wednesday afternoon that the president is still . undecided about whether to commit military force to the country that . once hosted 143,000 American servicemen and women. Obama said on Thursday that he would prefer Iraq's neighbors in the region step up instead. On that note Obama said he would be sending Secretary of State John Kerry to the Middle East and Europe to meet with the U.S.'s allies abroad about working together to quell the violence in Iraq. 'Rather than play whack-a-mole where these terrorist networks pop up,' the president said, the U.S. has to be able to build effective partnerships.

"Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will be formally sentenced to death on June 24 at a hearing that will offer survivors of the 2013 attack and family members of the three people who died an opportunity to confront him. The same federal jury that found Tsarnaev, 21, guilty of killing three people and injuring 264 in one of the highest-profile attacks on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001, last month voted to sentence him to death. On Thursday U.S. District Judge George O'Toole announced that he will formally hand down the sentence on June 24. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will be formally sentenced to death on June 24 . The June 24 hearing will offer survivors of the 2013 attack such as Celeste Corcoran, left, Marc Fucarile, center, and Rebekah Gregory, right, together family members of the four people who died an opportunity to confront him . Prosecutors say at least 20 victims of the explosions have asked to speak at the sentencing hearing. Tsarnaev, who did not testify in his own defense during the guilt or sentencing phases of his trial, will also have the right to speak, though he is under no obligation to do so. Tsarnaev's trial evoked memories of the darkest days in recent memory in Boston as victims testified of being hurled through the air by the twin pressure-cooker bombs, struggling to save the lives of those who had lost limbs amid screams of pain and fears that additional explosions would follow. Martin Richard, 8, 23-year-old Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu and 29-year-old restaurant manager Krystle Campbell were killed in the attack. Tsarnaev was also convicted in the slaying of Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier, 26. His family will also get an opportunity to speak at the sentencing. Meeting his fate: This court sketch shows Tsarnaev, emotionless, listening to a Boston jury sentencing him to death earlier this month . Victims: Eight-year-old Martin Richard and Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager, were among the victims of the bombing . Killed: Chinese student Lingzi Lu, 23, (left) also died in the bombing, while Somerville police officer Sean A Collier (right) was killed in a firefight with the Tsarnaevs days later . Defense attorneys, who are expected to appeal the death sentence and conviction, argued that Tsarnaev was the junior partner in a scheme hatched and driven forward by his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan, who died four days after the bombing following a gunfight with police that ended when Dzhokhar inadvertently ran his brother over with a stolen car. O'Toole has given Tsarnaev's lawyers until August 17 to file any post-trial motions along with all supporting material. Just three of the 74 people sentenced to death in the United States for federal crimes since 1988 have been executed. The first was Timothy McVeigh, put to death in June 2001 for killing 168 people in his 1995 attack on the federal government office building in Oklahoma City. No federal prisoners have been put to death since 2003. Several court cases related to the bombing are due to draw to a close over the next month. Three college friends of Tsarnaev who were found guilty of impeding the investigation into the attack are due to be sentenced next week. Confession: Tsarnaev's defense do not dispute that he (left in white cap) and his brother Tamerlan (right in black cap) carried out the bombing . Destruction: One of the two explosions at the marathon is pictured above. Three people died from the bombs and hundreds were injured . Tsarnaev may not be executed for his crimes for another 18 years, experts have claimed. At 21, he is the youngest inmate on Death Row. But he could be 40 by the time he put to death by lethal injection. This is due to the appeals process, which will likely take years for Tsarnaev's legal team to exhaust. Indeed, the bomber's defense attorney has already indicated she wants to take full advantage of it. Judith Clarke has argued it was prejudicial to her client to hold the trial in Boston, Massachusetts, and that her team was given 'insufficient time' to prepare their arguments against the death penalty. Legal expert Jim Fedalen said of Tsarnaev's time on Death Row: [He] may be the youngest inmate on death row at 21 but he could be pushing 40 by the time they march him to the death chamber. ‘We are looking at 18 years, possibly longer, before his appeals process is exhausted. By then, who even knows what the legal landscape on federal executions will look like?’ Robert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC), added: 'Because there is a death verdict, there will be a thorough appeals process. 'If he had gotten a life sentence, this would be over with.' The jury's decision does not mean that Tsarnaev's death is imminent. U.S. District Judge George O'Toole, who presided over the trial, will formally sentence Tsarnaev to death at a yet-to-be-scheduled hearing sometime in the next few months. Defense attorneys are likely to appeal the decision, which will trigger more legal wrangling before any sentence can be delivered. The death penalty remains highly controversial in Massachusetts, which has not put anyone to death in almost 70 years and abolished capital punishment for state crimes in 1984. Tsarnaev was tried under federal law, which allows for lethal injection as a punishment. Polls had shown that many Boston residents opposed executing Tsarnaev. Opponents included family members of victims Martin Richard and Sean Collier. Just three of the 74 people sentenced to death in the United States for federal crimes since 1988 have been executed. The same jury which today sentenced Tsarnaev to death found him guilty last month of all 30 federal charges brought against him - 17 of which were eligible for capital punishment. They are listed below. Those highlighted in bold were those on which the jury delivered the death penalty: .","Tsarnaev will be formally sentenced to death on June 24,U.S. District Judge George O'Toole announced on Thursday .

"A father  was just 'seconds from death' after a bite from a false widow spider triggered a heart attack. Eugene Murphy, from Dublin, was bitten three times on the shoulder by the spider - while his four-year-old son was on his lap. The 28-year-old said he stopped breathing as the pain ripped through his body and he went into cardiac arrest after the attack at his parents' house. At one point during his seizure the father-of-one was convulsing so badly he had to be tied to a bed for his own safety, the Daily Star reports. After he was rushed to hospital, he spent 24 hours in intensive care while medics battled to save him. He said: 'I have never felt pain like it. I pulled off my shirt and saw the spider getting stuck in. 'I ripped it off my shoulder and its fangs tore a lump of my skin away with it.' At one point during his seizure the father-of-one was convulsing so badly he had to be tied to a bed for his own safety . He said the pain ripped through his body, making him feel like he was on fire before he fell unconscious. Mr Murphy said he woke up in intensive care but was later told he had been injected with adrenaline to doctors tried to restart his heart. At one point Mr Murphy was hooked up to seven drips in an attempt to flush the venom from his system. He said: 'The doctors said I’d have died if I was alone when I was bitten. 'I was once knocked down by a car and I got up after it hit me but this thing laid me out.' They've inspired terror into millions, sparking complaints that their danger has been over-hyped. So what are false widow spiders? Much of their reputation is thought to be thanks to the black widow, which although similarly named is far more dangerous and has been known to kill children, ill or elderly people. Although its bites can be intensely uncomfortable - swelling hugely when infected - the false widow (above) is not known to have caused any deaths in Britain. By comparison, around four Britons each year are though to die from bee or wasp stings when they have an allergic reaction. False widow spiders are distinctive with their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns. Millions of false widows, Britain's most venomous spider, are found across the UK and the population is growing. Also known by its Latin name Steatoda Nobilis, its first British sighting was in Torquay, Devon, in 1879 and is thought to have remained largely in southern England. But the Natural History Museum says warmer summers mean the spider is spreading north, a theory backed by wildlife sightings.

As Britain's most venomous spider species, false widows made headlines last year when victims told how they had suffered huge wounds and almost lost limbs. An entire secondary school was shut in October last year in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, after an outbreak of the arachnids in its ICT block had to be fumigated. In the worst cases, suspected bite victims have been treated in hospital or complained of ongoing health problems several months later. But many experts insist the spiders are not particularly dangerous and will only bite if approached or handled. There have been no reported deaths from the spiders in Britain, where they are believed to have arrived on crates of fruit from the Canary Islands in the 1870s. It is thought many of the worst reactions happen when bites become infected, rather than being linked to the spider's venom itself.","Eugene Murphy, from Dublin, was bitten three times on the shoulder .

"A morbidly obese man dubbed ‘The Human Doughnut’ has lost 29 stone with the help of a low calorie diet and counselling. Rob Gillett, 27, hit the headlines in March 2012 when he appeared on Channel 4’s ‘Supersize vs. Superskinny’ weighing 41st 10lbs. At just 25 years old and 5ft 3ins, his BMI was an incredible 104 – the healthy range is between 18 and 25. Scroll down for video . Rob Gillett, 27, weighed 41st 10lbs and had a BMI of 104 by the time he was just 25 years old . Doctors became increasingly concerned about his health and now, in just 17 months, he has turned his life around by losing 70 per cent of his body weight. He has dropped to a healthy 12st 9lbs. Mr Gillett, from Bridgend, said: ‘Taking the decision to lose weight wasn't easy as I knew I had to tackle my demons, and still can’t believe I have lost the same amount of weight as two grown men. ‘I have a new lease of life now. I ran a 10k race, do Nordic walking and have a personal trainer.’ Mr Gillett, whose waist measured 6ft 6ins, decided to take part in ‘Supersize vs. Superskinny’ as his first bid to lose weight. He . said: ‘I wanted to do Supersize as I thought that it could help me deal . with my weight, however, I just felt humiliated at the media . headlines. Mr Gillett (pictured at 28st) was morbidly obese and doctors were seriously concerned about his health . Mr Gillett has now lost 29st and weighs 12st 9lbs. In just 17 months he lost 70 per cent of his body weight . ‘The attention I got from the show . was just horrendous at times too. Somebody sent me a big box of Krispy . Kreme doughnuts and put jagged pieces of metal in them. ‘The police never caught the person who sent the box, but needless to say my family and myself were distraught. ‘I . know that I was the person putting food into my mouth, but the reality . is that food was not the issue - I was battling with underlying, . deep-seated problems and I was using food to dull the pain. Mr Gillett said: 'I know that I was the person putting food into my mouth, but the reality is that food was not the issue - I was battling with underlying, deep-seated problems and I was using food to dull the pain' Mr Gillett's first attempt at weight loss saw him appear on Channel 4's 'Supersize vs. Superskinny' (pictured). He lost 4st but quickly regained the weight and says he was shocked by the negative attention he received . ‘I felt the show really didn't help at all, and I ended up putting on the four stone I lost quickly after filming stopped.’ Mr Gillett started to pile on the pounds at the age of eight as a result of childhood abuse. By the time he was in his early 20s, he was eating 7,000 calories a day and was addicted to fizzy drinks and cake. Before his weight loss, Mr Gillett . ate two slices of toast with poached eggs for breakfast, with a cup of . tea and a glass of orange juice. He would then have a breakfast baguette, a bag of crisps, biscuits, an apple and 500ml of coke for lunch. For dinner he would eat a chicken curry with rice and chips washed down with 500ml of coke. Mr Gillett has now lost weight by adopting a . very low calorie diet and by attending LighterLife counselling sessions . to help him understand the underlying psychological issues contributing . to his overeating . Mr Gillett said: 'The attention I got from the show was just horrendous at times too. Somebody sent me a big box of Krispy Kreme doughnuts and put jagged pieces of metal in them' He would also snack on cake and would drink another two cups of tea and 1.5l of coke each day. He said: ‘I was a healthy, happy child up until the abuse started. It went on until I left school and included every type of abuse. ‘It was horrific and something that I am only just coming to terms with. I don't want to make excuses, but I know that my issues with food are directly linked to these events. ‘If I had not turned to food, I would probably have used drugs or alcohol.’ During his teenage years, Mr Gillett gained about 2st each year and at just 17 he suffered a mini-stroke. He also had such bad sleep apnoea that even breathing apparatus could not always keep him breathing normally. After 'Supersize vs. Superskinny' failed to help him lose weight, Mr Gillett joined LighterLife which saw him revolutionise his diet and regain his self-confidence meaning he shed the pounds rapidly . He said: ‘I know people will be shocked by how much weight I put on, but it was the only way I knew how to deal with my emotional issues. ‘I look back now, and can’t believe that I put my life in so much danger. The sleep apnoea was terrifying and the reality is I could have died at any time.’ At his heaviest, Mr Gillett was almost housebound and he was unable to drive because his stomach got in the way. He had to get a taxi to take him to . the bus stop and he had to be given a bucket when he was on a plane as . he couldn’t use the bathroom. Mr Gillett also lost nearly all of his teeth because his gums became so weak. After failing to maintain his weight loss after taking part in ‘Supersize vs. Superskinny’, Mr Gillett joined LighterLife. Mr Gillett says he hopes his weight loss will inspire other people to realise that they too can lose weight . Before his weight loss, Mr Gillett had severe sleep apnoea and he had suffered a mini-stroke. He was also housebound and had to take a taxi to his local bus stop . He . said: ‘I knew I had to do something about my weight, and had seen . people like Pauline Quirke lose weight on LighterLife and thought it . could work for me. ‘I . had tried so many diets in the past that I was sceptical it could work, . but it was like a light bulb came on for me when I went to my first . session. ‘For the . first time I was on a weight loss programme that tackled the emotional . issues of eating, and it allowed me to see why I was basically eating . myself to death.’ The programme saw him adopt a very low calorie diet as well as having cognitive behavioural therapy and counselling. The youth worker said: 'I was named ""The Human Doughnut"" because of my shape and size. 'My addiction was mostly for sweet stuff, like chocolate, biscuits and cakes - and I quite liked a pie, once in a while. Mr Gillett (pictured at 18.5st during his weight loss) was dubbed 'The Human Doughnut' by the media because of his incredible size . 'I didn't like what I see in the mirror but when I saw food I just want to eat it. And eat, eat, eat. But I am no longer that person. I feel brilliant. 'I'm down at the gym at 5am and I exercise five days a week. Its changed my life - I am raring to go. 'Sometimes . people think I've had gastric surgery, but I'm so proud I've done it . all myself. The challenges I've faced have made me stronger.' Mr Gillett added: ‘The support I have received from the general public has been incredible too. ‘So many people have been staggered by how much weight I have lost. ‘It’s not uncommon for people to . recognise me in Cardiff from “Supersize vs. Superskinny” and be shocked . when they realise I have lost 29 stone. Mr Gillett believes he turned to food for comfort as a result of being abused as a child - he says that if he had not started comfort eating, he would probably have becoming addicted to drink or drugs . ‘The . best thing about losing weight is that I can hopefully inspire others . and make them realise that it’s possible to lose weight with the right . support.’ Claire Warren, LighterLife counsellor for Bridgend said: ‘Rob has worked so hard to lose weight and he is a real inspiration. ‘We have worked together for more than 16 months and I have been so impressed with his commitment to the LighterLife programme. ‘He has seen this whole experience as a real opportunity for change, and has been a huge support to all the other men in his group sessions. ‘The best thing for me is seeing Rob turn into a confident and assertive young man, who is taking enjoyment in life. ‘Rob really is finally having the chance to live the teenage years that he missed out on and build a better, healthier future for himself.’","Rob Gillett had a BMI of 104 and his waist measured 6ft 6ins .

"Jailed: Thomas Donelan, 20, from Levenshulme, Manchester was jailed for two years for the possession and supply of the Class A drug to Serena Harding, 16 . A trio of young men who supplied ecstasy to a school girl who later died were sentenced today. Twenty-year-old Thomas Donelan, who supplied the class A drug to Serena Harding, 16, was jailed while two others received suspended sentences in the incident. Miss Harding, the daughter of a drugs counsellor, suffered a fatal heart attack when she took the rave drug last August. The teenager from Warrington, Cheshire, had travelled to . Manchester to see close friend Michael Millington and his pals Donelan and Dean Williams. Miss . Harding had taken the class A drug to impress Millington, 19, a . medicinal chemistry undergraduate at Liverpool University, who boasted . of his heavy drug use, Manchester Crown Court heard. Prosecutor Lisa Boocock said: 'Serena indicated that she was willing to try it. She said she had never . tried it and indicated that she was looking forward taking it.' The court heard that Miss . Harding and Millington were joined by Williams, 18, before they went to . Donelan's house to buy MDMA, a pure form of ecstasy. Miss Harding later collapsed at Reddish Vale country park and was found under a bench by a passer by who called an ambulance. Millington . had gone to get the teen some water, had told Williams to go home and . then joined Serena in the ambulance which took her to hospital where she . later died. Miss Harding's devastated parents, Kenny and Diana Harding said today: 'Every day we ask ourselves ""how can this be"". Everything to live for: Miss Harding's devastated parents said Serena was so loving and sometimes wise beyond her almost 17 years . 'Serena filled all our hearts; she was . so loving and caring and was sometimes wise beyond her almost 17 years. The tears we cry everyday are futile because she will never come home . again.

Miss Harding had suffered from the . long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the . digestive system and rarely went to parties or drank alcohol. Tragically, the teenager had almost stayed at home because she had a job interview the next day and wanted to prepare for it. He parents said: 'Serena just wanted to be like . everybody else her age. We never thought for one moment that she would . try any drugs because of her medical condition and she was always . adamant that she wouldn't. 'We believe Serena got out of her depth and . gave in to peer pressure.' They added: 'You need ID for cigarettes and . alcohol. Drug dealers don't ask for ID. They don't care how old you are.

'All three of you must now understand that these drugs are not harmless - they are pernicious. As a result of your involvement with ecstasy a young girl died.'

"This astonishing collection of photographs was discovered in a rusty metal box by Peter Berry Ottaway, 71, in the home of his late grandfather, Hubert Ottaway, who was a sapper (or combat engineer) in the Territorial Army between 1914 and 1919. He captured the rare images while he was stationed in northern France. He worked with the Light Engineers Railway Companies who were tasked with supplying communication lines towards Belguim and upgrading trenches. Hubert's pictures provide a unique glimpse into life on the Western Front in the final 18 months of the Great War. He captured the aftermath of British offensives, including the Battle of Arras, and took photos of the devastation and desolation of villages which were razed in the path of armies from both sides during the conflict. Peter, who lives in Hereford, spent four years trying to get the images developed. After painstaking work, 40 of the 50 pictures were salvaged along with Hubert’s diary. Destruction: The previously unseen images paint a unique portrait of life on the Western Front in the final months of the Great War, portraying the damage that was inflicted on buildings in the north of France, near to the border with Belgium . Ruins: The photographs, which were taken by Territorial Army sapper Hubert Berry Ottaway, showed how villages were left devastated by shelling with churches and houses being being left in ruins by both the British and the German forces . Desolation: A staircase which was once encased inside in a building is left standing after the surrounding walls were destroyed during fighting in the Flanders region of northern France. This area saw huge amounts of fighting and was the first battlefield experienced by British troops when they travelled across to mainland Europe . Remembering the fallen: Ottoway also took photos of memorials which were constructed in the aftermath of offensives or incursions. Here, Canadian troops are remembered underneath a crucifix engraved into the ground with the letters RIP written above . Incursion: The ruins of a building in the city of Arras, the location of one Britain's most important offences in 1917. When the battle officially ended on 16 May, British Empire troops had made significant advances but had been unable to achieve a breakthrough . Escaping the carnage: Pictures show thousands of villagers whose homes had been destroyed along the Western Front carrying their possessions on their backs. They left the region searching for a different place to stay while the heavy fighting continued . Many of the images were taken in the aftermath of the Battle of Arras in 1917. It was was a British offensive where British, Canadian, New Zealand, Newfoundland, and Australian troops attacked German defences near the French city of Arras on the Western Front . Boulders: A picture of artillery equipment used surrounded by rubble in the aftermath Battle of Arras. Mr Ottaway was a was as a 'Sapper' (combat engineer) in the Territorial Army and had 14 military years of experience behind him. He was tasked with trench design and the establishment of communications and supply routes, he also had to transport ammo, food and bodies . Portrait: An image of four soldiers from the Royal Engineers Light Railway Companies taken in 1918. Unlike most Army units, troops in these groups placed a great reliance on the leadership and skills of the Non-Commissioned Officers . Off the tracks: Two soldiers from the Royal Engineers Light Railway Company pose next to a derailed train near the city of Arras . Foreign troops: Some of pictures include extremely rare shots of members of the Chinese Labour Corp who were recruited by Britain to help with the war effort. Around 150,000 Chinese men and boys, some as young as 14, were recruited from the provinces and shipped to the front line from 1915 to provide a labour force for the British Army . Model: Mr Ottway's probable camera was a Kodak no 2 Brownie. The first model produced in 1900 was made out of a cardboard box with a simple meniscus lens that took 2¼-inch square pictures on 117 rollfilm. The photos were then developed by Peter Ottway, Hubert's great-grandson, who spent five years putting together the collection at his home in Much Dewchurch, Hereford . Road into France: A typical tree-lined, cobbled road in Flanders which was the first sight to greet British troops as they made their way across the Channel to join in the war effort. Many had never left the United Kingdom and thousands would not return . Links: A group of soldiers stand in front of a van in Flanders. Many of the servicemen who Mr Ottway spent his time with were employed to set up lines of communication and upgrade trenches across France and Belgium . Heads up: A solider pokes his head from about a train on a railway in northern France. Mr Ottaway spent his time in Flanders, Belgium and Arras in France travelling along the railways until he returned to Britain in 1919 . Under attack: The city of Arras is located in Northern France on the banks of Scarpe river. Boves (or underground tunnels) below the city were used throughout World War I to hide residents during attacks . Sending in the cavalry: It has been estimated that many millions of horses were employed by both sides in the conflict and between six and eight million died  throughout the duration of the Great War .","Black and white negatives were found by Peter Berry Ottaway, 71, in the attic of his late grandfather's home .

"The Obama administration will work to ensure that gay and lesbian Americans are eligible to take leave from their jobs to care for a same-sex spouse, regardless of whether they live in a state that recognizes gay marriage, the White House said Friday. President Barack Obama is directing the Labor Department to start drafting rules making clear that the Family and Medical Leave Act applies to same-sex couples, allowing gay and lesbian employees to take unpaid leave to care for a sick spouse regardless of where they live. Currently, . legally married couples are eligible for those benefits if they reside . in a state in which same-sex marriage is legal. The Obama administration will work to ensure that gay and lesbian Americans are eligible to take leave from their jobs to care for a same-sex spouse, regardless of whether they live in a state that recognizes gay marriage . Obama is directing the . Department of Labor to propose a rule extending the FMLA rights even to . states where gay unions are not legal. The . move comes three years after the Obama administration stopped defending . the Defense of Marriage Act, which lets states refuse to recognize gay . marriages performed in other states. The . rule is being issued as Attorney General Eric Holder announces the . results of a review of U.S. laws in the wake of the landmark 2013 . Supreme Court Windsor decision that held that the survivor of a same-sex . couple could claim the federal estate tax exemption for surviving . spouses. The decision forced . the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages in states where . it is legal and has paved the way for the Obama administration to take . steps to expand the legal rights of gay couples. The Family and Medical Leave Act allows employees to take unpaid, job-protected leave for family and medical purposes. Holder . is due to issue a review on Friday of how the more than 1,000 different . federal rights and obligations linked to a marriage or a spouse are . affected by the Windsor decision. Obama . on Tuesday said he would sign an executive order barring federal . contractors from discriminating against employees based on their sexual . orientation, but he also told gay rights activists they need to keep up . the pressure on Congress to pass a broader law. In . February, Holder announced widespread changes within the Justice . Department to benefit same-sex married couples, such as recognizing a . legal right for them not to testify against each other in civil and . criminal cases. The White House is promoting the move as . part of Obama's push to expand protections for gays and lesbians by . allowing same-sex couples to take advantage of the same federal benefits . available to married heterosexual couples. The decision forced the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages in states where it is legal and has paved the way for the Obama administration to take steps to expand the legal rights of gay couples . To that end, the Justice Department also plans to announce it has completed a review that Obama ordered to assess what legal benefits can be extended to gay couples. Already, Obama has moved to ensure gay couples have equal access to health insurance, immigration privileges and tax benefits, the White House said. But the White House said there are a few benefits that current law prohibits the federal government from granting to same-sex couples. Hoping to end that limitation, the Obama administration is calling on Congress to pass legislation removing those prohibitions. Democratic members of Congress already have introduced bills expanding protections for gays and lesbians related to Social Security and veterans' benefits, the White House said.","Current law only allows couples living in a state that recognizes same-sex marriage to be eligible for benefits .

"Michele Bardsley filmed lights floating above her home in the West Mildands which she believes are a UFO . A mother has told of her shock after she spotted mysterious lights in the sky above her home. Market trader Michele Bardsley, 35, filmed strange red and white orbs floating over her street in Solihull, West Midlands. The video she made shows a formation of three or four lights, rising and falling together in the night sky. The mother-of-three says she filmed the phenomenon for at least 40 minutes - only breaking off for to put on her slippers when her feet got cold. She said: 'I was painting upstairs then went to the back door for a cig. I looked up and there were these shapes, like red orbs, in the sky. 'They didn't look like stars or planes or helicopters, they were just hanging there. I thought I'd had a few too many rum and cokes. 'I got my phone and zoomed in on them. I was there for about 20 minutes, my feet were freezing but I couldn't come away. 'Eventually I had to come back inside for my slippers and fags, then I went back out and filmed another 20 minutes. 'I must have looked mad out there for so long just filming the sky but it was so strange I did not want to go inside.' After spending nearly an hour in the garden she finally ended her video and went back inside to her family. She added: 'I want people to see it because I want to know what it was. We put it on the big TV screen and you can see all kinds of things happening, lights shooting off, appearing and disappearing. Scroll down for video . The video shows a formation of lights apparently hovering in the sky beyond Miss Bardsley's garden fence . 'People . must think I'm mad but I know what I saw. I am not saying it is aliens, . but they are definitely UFOs and I don't know what they were.' Ms Bardsley's sighting earlier this year is just the latest in a series of apparent close encounters in the area. In 2012 an unnamed police officer claimed he witnessed a UFO speeding across the sky near Birmingham airport while off-duty. And in 2010, two fighter jets were filmed whizzing over the M5 in the West Midlands, apparently in pursuit of a UFO.","Michele Bardsley spotted lights above home after going out for a cigarette .

"Rail fares are on course to soar by a quarter over the next four years unless funding rules are torn up, Labour will warn today. Official figures released this morning are expected to show that rail fares will rise by up to 5.6 per cent next year. The Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) said this would take the total increase to 24.7 per cent since the last election. Rail fares are on course to soar by a quarter over the next four years and by up to 5.6 per cent next year alone . And Shadow Transport Secretary Mary Creagh will warn that fares will rise by a further 24 per cent by 2018 unless existing rules are changed. Although annual rail fare increases are implemented in January they are based on Retail Price Index figures from the previous July. Under current rules, regulated train fares will rise by RPI plus 1 per cent. But rail firms are also allowed to ‘flex’ fares on some routes by an additional two per cent. Miss Creagh called for reform of the ‘broken market’, including capping fare rises on every route and simplifying fare structures. In a speech in London today she will say: ‘Our rail fares are among the highest in Europe. Rail passengers rightly feel ripped off when they are uncertain if they paid the lowest fare. ‘Labour will create a legal right to the cheapest ticket for your journey, ending the confusion passengers experience. We will introduce a strict cap on rail fares, removing the “flex” arrangement that allows train companies to raise fares more on some routes.’ In his 2013 Autumn Statement, Chancellor George Osborne (pictured) announced that he was limiting the January 2014 regulated-fare rise to RPI . But Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin accused her of hypocrisy, pointing out that Labour presided over years of inflation-busting fare rises. He warned that her plan to abolish the ‘flex’ provisions would cost the taxpayer more than £130million over the next Parliament. Mr McLoughlin said: ‘We fully recognise there’s more to do to bring down the cost of rail travel in Britain. But we need to do it responsibly and we can’t spend money we don’t have. ‘This Government is working hard to turn things around and help families with the cost of travel. 'This year we were able to cap fare rises at the rate of inflation – only possible because we’ve cut inefficient spending elsewhere.’ In his 2013 Autumn Statement, Chancellor George Osborne announced that he was limiting the January 2014 regulated-fare rise to RPI while reducing the ‘flex’ rule from 5 per cent to 2 per cent. This kept the average increase in regulated fares to 3.1 per cent this year. Mr Osborne will now face pressure to make a similar announcement in his 2014 Autumn Statement. The CBT said that while fares had gone up by more than 24 per cent since 2010, wages had only risen 6.9 per cent in that period. CBT campaigner Martin Abrams said: ‘With people’s wages stagnating and in some cases falling, the expense of taking the train to work has become a huge part of living costs.’ He added: ‘If the Government doesn’t put an end to above- inflation fare increases quickly, ordinary commuters will be priced off the train and could be forced into agonising decisions such as moving house or quitting their jobs.’","Rail fares are on course to soar by about a quarter over the next four years .

"Facebook Data Science examined Facebook accounts of people in relationships from around the world in a bid to understand relationship trends. They found that internationally the average age gap between heterosexual partners is 2.4 years. Facebook Data Science collected information from Facebook accounts around the world to get a sense of the average age gaps in relationships . Facebook figures: The age gap between partners in female-male, female-female and male-male relationships . The age difference between partners is significantly higher in same-sex relationships and highest among homosexual male couples, where the average age difference peaked at more than nine years. In 67 per cent of heterosexual relationships the man is older than the woman, in 20 per cent of relationships the woman is older than the man, and in the remaining 13 per cent the couple is the same age (when the person’s age is rounded to the nearest year). And it seems the older we get, the bigger the age gap. Older people were more likely to have a partner whose age differed significantly from their own than younger couples. Age gaps between couples was lowest in Australia, where the average difference was 1.82 years. And the age gap was highest in Egypt where the average age difference was 5.09 years. Most heterosexual couples in the world have a 2.4 year age gap, with the man as the older partner. The study found that on average, couples in same-sex relationships have a much larger age gap . Countries with lower rankings on the Global Gender Gap index are shown on the left-hand side of the graph. Countries with a large age gap between partners are in the top half of the graph . Facebook Data Science also compared the age difference among heterosexual couples to the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Gender Gap, which ranks countries based on the gender gaps in economics, politics, education and health. On average the countries that had lower scores on the WEF’s index (those with large gender gaps on social and political issues) also have large age gaps in relationships . However, some Asian countries that scored poorly on the Global Gender Gap rating scheme also had smaller age differences in relationships. Couples in the nations of South Korea and Japan for example, which rank fairly low on the Global Gender Gap index, have the same approximate age gap as couples in the gender progressive Scandinavian states of Sweden, Norway and Finland, and much smaller age differences than couples in the more equitable nations of Colombia and Ecuador. Facebook Data Science attribute this to the fact these Asian nations are quite affluent and have high educational expectations, so couples are more likely to meet at university, where most people are of similar ages. The researchers examined couples whose average age was between 20 and 49. The data was collected in October 2013 and released last month as part of Facebook Data Science's Valentine’s Day Love Series.

"Home Secretary  Theresa May defended the decision to terminate the eBorders contract with US firm Raytheon Systems - despite being ordered to pay hundreds of millions of pounds in damages . Taxpayers were last night landed with a £500million bill for the ‘catastrophic’ IT project intended to protect our borders. An arbitration tribunal ruled the way the Home Office had terminated the contract for the shambolic eBorders scheme was unlawful. Defence firm Raytheon will now pocket £223million of public money, including £50million in damages. The settlement is in addition to the £260million the Government had spent by the time Raytheon was fired in July 2010 with the journey-logging system in disarray. Legal fees are expected to push the final bill to half a billion pounds. The contract debacle sparked new questions about the performance of Lin Homer, who was paid £200,000 a year to run the UK Border Agency from 2005 to 2011. She was in charge of her officials’ disastrous management of the eBorders project, and presided over a string of other blunders. But, despite fierce criticism from MPs over her record, Miss Homer has been promoted to the post of chief executive of the HMRC. Her time in charge of UKBA will now be the subject of up to four different inquiries, including a new hearing by the home affairs select committee of the Commons. Keith Vaz, the commitee’s Labour chairman, said last night: ‘This is a catastrophic result. ‘It is now clear that the UKBA didn’t know what they wanted from the eBorders programme. ‘We will want to hear further from Lin Homer, the then head of the UKBA, as to why she sanctioned such a defective agreement.’ The project was initiated by Labour but was poorly managed by officials from the start, and hit by a series of delays. It was eventually axed in July 2010 by Home Secretary Theresa May when, acting on advice from officials, it was deemed impossible to salvage. However, the process that the now defunct UK Border Agency used when reaching a decision to scrap the agreement was flawed according to the Arbitration Tribunal, which settles global contract disputes. Labour's Home Affairs Select Committee chair Keith Vaz said the tribunal's decision was 'catastrophic' for the Government . The Treasury is expected to step in to pick up much of the bill to minimise the ‘impact on frontline services’. In a letter, Mrs May said: ‘The Government stands by the decision to end the eBorders contract with Raytheon. All other alternatives available to the Government would have led to greater costs than the result of this tribunal ruling.’ Despite its own role in the shambles, Labour last night criticised the Government’s handling of the contracts. The party’s Home Office spokesman David Hanson said: ‘This is a crushing verdict. As a result of this stalled process, we are still far away from counting people in and out of the UK.’","Government unlawfully scrapped eBorders contract with Raytheon Systems .

"Nearly 9million Americans rely on sleeping to get a good night's rest, according to groundbreaking new research. The findings, which are the first in-depth examination of how many people require drugs to fall asleep, show that white, female, older and educated Americans are more likely to use the pills. In addition to the 8.6million people using prescription pharmaceuticals for sleep, millions are more are believed to rely on other options such as over-the-counter medicines or herbal remedies. Pills: Four per cent of Americans now use prescription medication to help them sleep . The study was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who interviewed 17,000 adults in the U.S. from 2005 to 2010. Overall, four per cent of them said they had taken a prescription sleeping pill or sedative in the previous month. Insomnia seems to be increasing - use rose from 3.3 per cent in 2003-2006 to 4.3 per cent in 2007-2010, according to a CDC researcher. This could be due to a number of factors, including obesity, the increasing prevalence of late-night electronic distractions such as social media, and financial worries linked to the recession. Adults are supposed to get seven to nine hours sleep each night, but at least a third of adults get less that that. Doctors recommend fixing a bedtime routine, exercising daily and avoiding caffeine at night in order to boost sleep levels. Inadequate sleep is believed to cause or worsen diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, obesity and depression. Common: Older women are most likely to rely on sleeping pills, according to a study (picture posed by model) The CDC study into sleeping pill use found that five per cent of women take the drugs, compared to three per cent of men. Use tends to increase among older people - seven per cent of over-80s take sleeping pills, but just two per cent of under-40s do so. The prevalence of sleeping medication seems to spike past the age of 50, which experts suggest is because of the combined stresses of family and work which tend to peak around then. Then as they reach old age, they are subject to aches and pains which make it harder to get a good night's sleep. Sleeping pill use is more concentrated among white, with nearly five per cent being prescribed the medication, compared to 2.5 per cent of blacks and two per cent of Hispanics. Wealthier and more-educated people are more likely to take sleeping pills, partly because they have better access to health insurance and medical treatment in general. Sleep aids are controversial in some circles because they can make patients drowsy for hours after they wake up. The Food and Drug Administration has ordered Ambien to be delivered in smaller doses to avoid the risk to users driving the next day.","4% of all Americans take sleeping pills, according to new study .

'He was charged later that day with two counts of assault in Birmingham City Centre in the early hours.' A spokesman for the British Amateur Boxing Association said: 'We are aware of impending legal proceedings concerning a member of the GB Boxing Podium squad and are in the process of conducting an inquiry into this as part of our athlete disciplinary procedure.' The Welsh Amateur Boxing Association declined to comment. Evans' grandfather also Fred Evans, 78, described the boxer as a 'very quiet but a nice lad' Evans joined the Great Britain squad in 2009. He reached the finals at the London 2012 games but lost 17-9 to Serik Sapiyev, from Kazakhstan. The 23-year-old said that he boxed despite being urged to stay out of the ring after doctors warned that his hands were too badly damaged. He became Wales' first boxer to win Olympic Silver. Dedicating the medal to his sister and mother he said: 'They would be over the moon for me and this medal is for them. 'I feel mixed emotions when I go into the ring.

The Duchess hadn’t planned to step back into action so soon, with her first official engagement not scheduled until September 12. But earlier this week sources indicated that she was considering joining Prince William to officially start a marathon on Anglesey, where the couple have lived for two years.

"Up to 80 Russian troops were killed in a skirmish in Ukraine last month despite Vladimir Putin's claims that Russia is not fighting there, according to documents released by an opposition politician. Members of an elite Russian paratroop force spoke of the brutal battle near Luhansk, a city in eastern Ukraine, in telephone transcripts leaked to the politician and newspaper publisher Lev Shlosberg. One paratrooper says: 'We're f***ing walking along looking for these f***ing Ukrainians. Vladimir Putin claims that his troops are not fighting in Ukraine but a leaked phone conversation between two Russian paratroopers suggests a skirmish into the country took place last month . 'We get out into the open and are seen, kapow! 'We dashed out onto the road, there was a field, sunflowers, and a checkpoint. They started to bomb it — bam bam bam — and they destroyed it,' the New York post reports. The paratrooper, who was wounded in the attack, claimed that 80 men were killed in the battle and that only ten made it out alive. He was telling the traumatic story to a fellow soldier in a phone call from a hospital where he was being treated. When his comrade asks him if he was aware that he was marching off to battle before the skirmish, he says that he had already told his wife he was 'off to war'. In the leaked telephone transcripts a paratrooper from the 76th Guards Air Assault Division tells his comrade that 80 soldiers were killed in the skirmish in Ukraine (file picture) But he added: 'They don't tell us anything. They say we are off on an exercise.' The conversation was said to have taken place between members of the elite 76th Guards Air Assault Division, which is based in the city of Pskov. Ukrainian officials reported a skirmish with the 76th Guards in mid-August and the country's Defense Ministry said on its website that its troops destroyed three of the unit's tanks and seized two troop carriers. Russia has denied that the battle took place. But despite the denials, last month President Vladimir Putin bestowed one of Russia's highest awards, the Order of Suvorov, on the division. He cited 76th Guards Air Assault Division's 'successful completion of military missions' and 'courage and heroism' - words that would suggest Russian troops have seen military action.","Russian President has insisted that his troops are not fighting in Ukraine .

"With a stern face that never cracked into a smile unless he was looking at his ruthless young boss, North Korea's top army chief has been purged from office in another demonstration of Kim Jong-un's merciless rule. Just 24 hours after it was reported that Kim had ordered the machine-gun execution of his former singer lover, Hyon Song-wol and 12 other entertainers, it was claimed today that hawkish army chief Kim Kyok-sik, 75, had been removed from his post, his future unknown. North Korean watchers in the hated South Korea said the sacking appeared to be an attempt by Kim, whose age is estimated to be about 30, to bring unruly and ageing military leaders to heel. General Kim Kyok Sik, right, stands with former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. Although close to Jong Un, he has been removed from his post . But his ruthlessness appears to be paying off in his own country - according to researchers at Seoul University, the dictator now has a higher approval rating then both U.S President Barack Obama and UK Prime Minister David Cameron. Seoul-based North Korean analyst Daniel Pinkston, said yesterday that Kim had learned that he had to manage his dictatorship carefully if he wanted to stay in power. 'He is replacing officers appointed by his father, Kim Jong-il, with younger men who he hopes will now shore up his political power base.' Kim Kyok-sik does not go without leaving an impressive record of aggression behind - he is credited with masterminding the torpedo sinking of the South Korean Navy ship, Cheonan, and the shelling of the south's Yeonpyeong Island, both incidents occurring in 2010. Analysts said there was little doubt that Kim had been removed after studying a report in a North Korean newspaper, the official Rodong Sinmun daily. A source in the South Korean government said: 'We're closely watching development in the North, believing that Kim Kyok-sik has been replaced by Ri Yong-gil, the Army's General Staff chief of operations.' Execution: Kim Jong-Un, pictured with his wife Ri Sol-ju (left), also had Hyon Song-wol and 12 other entertainers killed . The official said the North Korean paper had mentioned Ri Yong-gil behind senior regime figures Choe Ryong-hae and Jang Song-taek in a report about Kim watching a soccer match alongside selected soldiers. It mentioned Ri before Jang Jong-nam, the minister of the People's Armed Forces, but significantly there was no mention at all of Kim Kyok-sik, who was always photographed at Kim's side. In addition, Ri was seen with a four-star insignia rather than the three stars he displayed earlier, denoting his less senior post. 'Ri seems to have been promoted to chief of the Army's General Staff, because the chief of operations is never mentioned ahead of the Armed Forces minister,' said the source, quoted in Seoul's authoritative Chosn Ilbo newspaper, which revealed the alleged execution of Kim's former lover. Popular: Kim Jong-un, seen applauding during the final of the Torch Cup soccer tournament in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency, has higher approval ratings than U.S President Barack Obama . According to the paper, Kim Kyok-sik's dismissal might have been discussed at a meeting of the Workers Party's Central Military Commission - chaired by none other than Kim Jong-un - last weekend. North Korean media reported that the meeting discussed 'organisational matters' and noted that the leader made an 'important decision.' The leader's ruthlessness has become apparent once again, because he held Kim Kyok-sik in high esteem - yet still felt the need to remove him. Analysts said it was possible that Kim Jong-un hopes the removal of the general might improve relations with South Korea and China - despite Beijing already being an ally. In spite of his ruthlessness, Kim is still supported by the majority of his people, according to research by the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University. Although not strictly accurate as they polled 133 North Korean defectors, researchers found that 61.7 per cent of those asked thought that the dictator had the backing of the majority of his country. According to the Telegraph, the result not only makes him  more popular than his predecessor and late father, but also U.S President barack Obama who has a 41 per cent approval rating and UK Prime Minister David Cameron who is languishing on 38 per cent.","North Korean leader yesterday reported to have had ex girlfriend executed .

"Sarah Palin has come out in defense of her daughter Bristol who allegedly punched a man in the face during a family brawl. The former Vice President candidate hailed her child as a 'straight shooter' in a Facebook which appears to be her first veiled reference to the fight two weekends ago. The 23-year-old is said to have repeatedly hit the owner of a home in Anchorage, Alaska, during an outburst in which her brother Track broke four ribs and her father Todd was left with a bloody nose. First response: This Facebook post appears to be Sarah Palin's first veiled reaction to the family brawl . Straight shooter: Palin shared pictures of her daughter firing a rifle and linked to an article by Bristol . It came after Willow Palin's ex-boyfriend allegedly engage in some unspecified 'questionable behaviour'. Writing on Thursday, Sarah Palin said: 'I love my Bristol! My straight-shooter is one of the strongest young women you'll ever meet. 'I have to say this as a proud mama: right up there with their work ethic and heart for those less fortunate, my kids' defense of family makes my heart soar! 'As you can imagine, they and my extended family have experienced so many things (liberal media-driven) that may have crushed others without a strong foundation of faith, and I'm thankful for our friends' prayer shield that surrounds them, allowing faith to remain their anchor. 'Thank you, prayer warriors! I love you!' The post was accompanied by pictures of Bristol firing a rifle, other family photos. She also linked to an article by Bristol condemning reports that suggest Todd and Sarah Palin are getting divorced. Bristol's post, topped with a picture of her father kissing her mother, blasted the reports as 'garbage'. The comments are the first from the family following widespread media attention to the fight on September 6. On Monday, Sarah Palin emerged for the first time following the melee as she was photographed sweaty and make-up free running errands around Anchorage, Alaska. No make-up Monday: Former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin was pictured running errands in Anchorage, Alaska on Monday . Trouble at home? Palin appeared to have just worked out when she was photographed, wearing casual dress and without her wedding right . Palin looked like she had other things on her mind as she stepped out in the casual attire and with damp hair . Bristol Palin (pictured right) and little sister Piper (left) hit Costco in Anchorage, Alaska on Monday to stock up on groceries including bulk purchases of toilet paper, bottled water, yogurt, whipped cream and apple sauce. The Palin family were recently caught up in a reported disturbance at a house party in Anchorage . The fight which allegedly broke out at a house party most of the Palin family was attending came as daughter Willow's ex-boyfriend Connor Cleary tried to get in a Hummer limousine after engaging in some unspecified 'questionable behavior'. RealClearPolitics spoke with a source close to the Palin family, who wanted to provide their version of the events in question. The source said oldest son Track, 25, soon found himself struggling against four men who had 'piled on him'. That was when father Todd Palin - who was celebrating his 50th birthday that night, although it was not his party- became involved. Partygoer Eric Thompson told Good Morning America: 'I heard Sarah Palin scream out, 'You know who we are, don't you?'' Palin was captured make-up free as she ran errands in her first appearance since the family brawl . Palin is pictured for the first time since the incident, which involved 'roughly 20 people' at a house party . But the source told the website Palin was shouting: 'Don't you know who he is? He's a vet!' Her son Track served with the U.S. Army in the Iraq War. According to the source, Track left the fight nursing four cracked ribs, while his father suffered a bloody nose. The former vice presidential candidate has yet to publicly comment on the brawl. On Monday, she left a shopping mall dressed casually, and without wearing her wedding ring. Exes: The fight allegedly broke out when Willow Palin's ex-boyfriend Connor Cleary (pictured) tried to get in a Hummer limousine after engaging in 'questionable behavior' Her daughters Bristol, 23, and 13-year-old Piper were also spotted out and about on Monday in Anchorage, stocking up on food supplies at a CostCo. The two sisters looked serious as they pushed a cart into the parking lot, filled to the brim with bulk purchases of toilet paper, bottled water, apple sauce, yogurt and whipped cream. Several local sources reported on the incident, initially scooped by Alaska political blogger Amanda Coyne. She wrote: 'Word is that Bristol has a particularly strong right hook, which she employed repeatedly.' But the source said that Bristol is left-handed. One report suggested host Korey Klingenmeyer was allegedly punched in the face seven times by Bristol when he politely asked her to leave the party. Another report claimed that Willow and Bristol apparently tried to go after the mother of Willow's ex-boyfriend. The fight involved 'roughly 20 people' and alcohol is believed to have been a factor in the incident, which took place around 11pm on Saturday night, The Anchorage Police Department said. 'Anchorage police responded to a report of a verbal and physical altercation taking place between multiple subjects outside of a residence,' police spokesperson Jennifer Castro told Alaska Dispatch News. 'A preliminary investigation by police revealed that a party had been taking place at a nearby residence and a fight had broken out between multiple subjects outside of the residence. 'At the time of the incident, none of the involved parties wanted to press charges and no arrests were made. 'Alcohol was believed to have been a factor in the incident. Some of the Palin family members were in attendance at the party.' Although none of the parties wanted to press charges at the time of the incident, police confirmed that the case is still an active investigation and is being reviewed by APD and the Municipal Prosecutors Office. It had been reported that the drunken brawl started when the Palin pack allegedly had a run-in with Connor Cleary, an ex-boyfriend of Willow, 20 (pictured to the left of her mother, in a blue dress). The Palins are pictured in 2007 . Sarah Palin has claimed that she owes the United States a 'global apology' for the 2008 Republican presidential ticket's loss to President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. During an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Mrs Palin, who ran for vice-president on John McCain's ticket, spoke about Obama's long-term strategy for defeating ISIS, which he laid out in a speech on Wednesday night. 'As I watched the speech last night, Sean, the thought going through my mind is, I owe America a global apology,' she said. 'Because John McCain, through all of this, John McCain should be our president.' She added: 'It's not just a vision that's so obvious. It's an articulated mission that they're on, and that is the caliphate. That is a takeover of the region. And guess what? We're next on the hit list.' The former Alaskan governor compared ISIS to Hitler and questioned how seriously Obama is taking the threat. She said: 'So when Barack Obama, like the rest of us, hear these bad guys, these terrorists, promising that they will raise the flag of Allah over our White House, for the life of me I don't know why he does not take this serious, the threat. Because yes, it's more than a vision. 'They're telling - just like Hitler did all those years ago, when a war could've been avoided, because Hitler, too, did not hide his intentions. Well, ISIS, these guys aren't hiding their intentions either.'","The former VP candidate has spoken for first time since family fight .

"IT was the second most highly-anticipated birth of the year. But Britain will have to wait for its first baby panda after it emerged that Tian Tian has lost her much longed-for cub. After weeks of high hopes for an historic captivity-bred newborn, Edinburgh Zoo yesterday announced that the animal – also known as Sweetie – had lost the baby late in the pregnancy. Tian Tian, Britain's only female giant panda, is believed to have lost her cub . Experts noted signs in August that the artifical insemination in April had been successful and a panda cub had been expected for last month . Professor Chris West, chief executive . of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said: ‘Everyone is saddened . by this turn of events after so many weeks of waiting.’ Despite the disappointment, the zoo has vowed to try again with a breeding programme and said it is ‘confident’ of success. Professor . West added: ‘The majority of research centres and zoos with giant . pandas around the world have not successfully bred until their third or . fourth year and what we have achieved considering we have had giant . pandas for less than two years is immense. ‘New . hormone research is beginning to indicate that lost pregnancies are . more common in giant pandas than first thought, though at the moment no . one knows why.’ The panda's carers at Edinburgh Zoo had been kept guessing whether Tian Tian was pregnant after she was artificially inseminated in April . Tian Tian was artificially inseminated using semen from Yang Guang (pictured) and another panda . Britain’s only female giant panda arrived from China in 2011 in a £6million loan along with a male, Yang Guang. From the off, it was hoped the pair would be the first giant pandas to breed in Britain during their ten-year stay. Pandas find it difficult to conceive because females become fertile just once a year for 36 hours between mid-April and May. Attempts at getting a pair to mate, meanwhile, can often prove fruitless. Even where they are successful, fertilized eggs remain suspended within the panda until an unknown trigger causes it to implant. It is then difficult to determine whether they are pregnant because they do not develop a 'baby bump'. The bears also commonly have phantom pregnancies - Tian Tian had one last year. Tian Tian then kept everyone guessing over a possible pregnancy when she was artificially inseminated in April. A public already gripped by the Duchess of Cambridge’s pregnancy was given regular updates on the ten-year-old. In . August, the zoo delivered the news that Tian Tian could just be a . fortnight away from giving birth – and twins were a possibility. Hormone . and protein tests and the production of breast milk ‘seemed to suggest’ she was expecting and the zoo went into panda cub overdrive – putting . two incubators on standby, beaming CCTV footage of the panda enclosure . into staff homes and flying in a panda birth expert from China. But . over the last few days she has returned to non-pregnancy eating and . behavioural patterns, leading experts to believe she had lost the baby. Officials are not sure exactly what went wrong but believe she . ‘re-absorbed’ the tiny foetus, which would have been smaller than half a . block of butter, back into her body. Iain . Valentine, director of the zoo’s panda project, said: ‘Why does this . happen? We don’t truly understand, but what we do know is this is a . species which lives on the edge of a balance between nutritional uptake . and reproducing. ‘If things . aren’t quite right this can be a reason why they absorb the young and . cancel the pregnancy. We are determined to learn from this.’ Yang Guang (left), the male panda, looks through the fence of his enclosure at Tian Tian as they make their first appearance in Edinburgh on December 12, 2011 . August 24, 2003: Tian Tian born and reared at Ya'an reserve in Chengdu, China. Yang Guang born 10 days earlier.

"Altering a gene in mice has made them live 20 per cent longer - the human equivalent of living to 95-years-old, according to scientists. Scientists lowered the expression of the gene mTOR, which is involved in balancing energy and metabolism. While the mice lived 20 per cent longer, the effect was not uniform, says journal Cell Reports, with different organs and tissues affected in different ways. Researchers from America¿s National Institutes of Health said the study could be used in new therapies for age-related diseases that target specific organs, such as Alzheimer¿s . For example, they retained better memory and balance as they aged, but their bones deteriorated more quickly. Researchers from the U.S. National Institutes of Health say the study could be used in new therapies for age-related diseases that target specific organs, such as Alzheimer’s. Scientists lowered the expression of the gene mTOR, which is involved in balancing energy and metabolism . Dr Toren Finkel said: 'While the high extension in lifespan is noteworthy, this study reinforces an important facet of ageing; it is not uniform. 'Rather, similar to circadian rhythms, an animal might have several organ-specific aging clocks that generally work together to govern the aging of the whole organism.' He said that further studies were needed to identify exactly how ageing in these different tissues is connected at the molecular level. The mice were engineered to produce 25 per cent of the normal amount of mTOR, which researchers say is the minimum required for survival. They were smaller than average but otherwise normal. Their median lifespan was 28 months for males and 31.5 months for females, compared to 22.9 months and 26.5 months for normal males and females, respectively. The mTOR mice also had a longer maximum lifespan; seven of the eight longest-lived mice in this study were mTOR mice. This lifespan increase is one of the largest observed in mice so far. The study found that while the GM mice aged better overall, they showed only selective improvement in specific organs. They outperformed normal mice of equivalent age in maze and balance tests, indicating better retention of memory and coordination, and also retained more muscle strength and posture. But they had a greater loss in bone volume as they aged, and they were more susceptible to infections at old age, suggesting a loss of immune function.","Scientists lowered the expression of the gene mTOR, which is involved in balancing energy and metabolism in the body .

"Islamist leader Osama bin Laden was blind in one eye, according to his successor at the head of terrorist network al-Qaeda. Ayman al-Zawahiri made the claim in an hour-long account of the life of bin Laden, who was killed in a U.S. Navy Seal raid on his compound in Abbotabad, Pakistan, last year. In a video entitled Days With The Imam, uploaded to an radical Islamist website, al-Zawahiri also reveals that bin Laden was a one-time member of the Muslim Brotherhood. Terror mastermind: Osama bin Laden was blind in one eye, according to a video account of his life recorded by Ayman al-Zawahiri, his successor at the head of al-Qaeda . Zawahiri revealed 'for those who do not know' that Saudi-born bin Laden was left blind in his right eye after an accident during his youth. He also revealed that the terrorist mastermind was expelled from the Saudi branch of the Muslim Brotherhood for insisting on waging jihad - holy war - against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. It is claimed that bin Laden traveled . to the Pakistani city of Peshawar, near the border with Afghanistan, to . deliver cash to the Taliban, but then defied the Brotherhood's orders to . join the armed struggle. Jihadist: Zawahiri made the claim in a video posted online, part of a series about bin Laden . The connection to the Brotherhood is especially controversial since their ascent to power in Egypt following that country's revolution against the U.S.-backed military establishment that had run the country for decades. Zawahiri’s latest video posted on a jihadist forum appeared to be around two months old as he offered greetings to Muslims for the start of the fasting month of Ramadan which ended on August 20, reported Al Arabiya News. Earlier this month Zawahiri's brother gave an interview to news network CNN in which he outlined his personal 'peace plan' he said could lead to a rapprochement between Islamists and the West. Speaking on the eve of the anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, Mohamed al-Zawahiri said he and his brother are ideologically inseparable. 'Our people like death, the same way others like life,' he told reporter Nic Robertson. 'But we do not want to get into this endless cycle of violence. We like for the others and us to live peacefully.' Later he says, 'The portrayal of my brother's ideologies and mine: that it’s blood thirsty, barbaric, or terrorist, is not true at all.' Hideout: Pakistani authorities finally tore down the Abbottabad compound where bin Laden was slain in February this year . Bin Laden was killed on May 2, 2011 by U.S. commandos in a daring night raid in Abbottabad that left the Pakistani military angry it had not been consulted. While much of the world cheered the death, Pakistan fumed over what it called a violation of its sovereignty. The compound where bin Laden was hiding out was finally demolished in February.",Ayman al-Zawahiri also reveals Bin Laden was a one-time member of the Muslim Brotherhood .

Her mother Debbie asked Camilla about the baby's name. Mrs Lister said: 'She said they had no clue whatsoever. She wasn't giving anything away. I thought she might tell me something, but no.' And Isla's grandmother, Judy Willis, said Charles told her: 'Grannies are getting younger, you know.' Camilla later enjoyed a lunch of 'celebration fish and chips' in Bridlington, described the meal as 'the best thing I have eaten in an awfully long time'. She ate the takeaway from the box it came in - but declined an offer of batter 'scraps' on her meal and opted instead for a healthy slice of lemon. However, while she might have enjoyed the experience, she was unwilling to reward the proprietor with a sneak peek at the name of the Royal baby.

"The global warming ‘pause’ has now lasted for almost 17 years and shows no sign of ending – despite the unexplained failure of climate scientists’ computer models to predict it. The Mail on Sunday has also learnt that because 2013 has been relatively cool, it is very likely that by the end of this year, world average temperatures will have crashed below the ‘90 per cent probability’ range projected by the models. These also provide the main basis for the sweeping forecasts of a perilous, hotter world in a new report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The graph above covers the period June 1997 to July 2013. It was drawn using the official Met Office ‘HadCRUT4’ monthly data for world average temperatures, and shows the lack of a warming trend. It updates the chart The Mail on Sunday published a year ago, which first made the pause headline news and forced the IPCC to discuss it. America's official source of information on polar ice caps got its figure for a dramatic recovery in 2013 Arctic sea ice out by a million square kilometres – then quietly corrected its mistake without mentioning it. On September 4, the NASA-funded National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC), based at the University of Colorado, stated on its website that in August 2013 the Arctic ice cover recovered by a record 2.38 million sq km – 919,000 sq miles – from its 2012 low. News of this figure was widely reported – including in this newspaper on September 8. But on September 10, the NSIDC quietly changed it to 1.38 million sq km (533,000 sq miles) – and replaced the original document so the old figure no longer shows up on a main Google search. It can now only  be found on an old ‘cached’ page. Prompted by an inquiry from ‘green’ blogger Bob Ward, the NSIDC’s spokeswoman Natasha Vizcarra said the mistake was a ‘typographical error’, telling him: ‘There are no plans to make a statement on the change because it was not an error in the data.’ While 2013 remains the sixth lowest Arctic sea ice year since 1979, forthcoming research suggests the long-term melting trend is partly cyclical, and may have begun a reversal. A footnote in the new report also confirms there has been no statistically significant increase since 1997. Last night independent climate scientist Nic Lewis – an accredited IPCC reviewer and co-author of peer-reviewed papers – pointed out that taking start years of 2001, 2002 or 2003 would suggest a cooling trend of 0.02-0.05C per decade, though this would not be statistically significant. At a press conference to launch the report in Stockholm, the IPCC refused to say how long the pause would have to go on before casting doubt on the models, suggesting trends were only meaningful if they lasted 30 years. But some of the report’s authors are less confident. Piers Forster, Leeds University’s Professor of Physical Climate Change, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘If it does get beyond 20 years, that would get very interesting. 'We would have to revisit the models. As it goes on, it would get more and more peculiar.’ He added: ‘We are right on the edge of the probability distribution now. We have to accept that if we are going to come up with projections, they have to be correct.’ Even this marks a big change from earlier statements by eminent climate scientists. In 2009, Professor Phil Jones, head of the East Anglia University Climatic Research Unit, said in a leaked ‘Climategate’ email: ‘Bottom line: the no upward trend has to continue for a total of 15 years before we get worried.’ However, not only does the report deny the importance of the pause, it makes a firm, short-term forecast that it is about to end – claiming that the period 2016-2035 will, on average, be 0.3-0.7C hotter than 1986-2005. That, said Prof Judith Curry, head of climate science at the Georgia Institute of Technology, is a high-risk strategy: ‘The IPCC has thrown down the gauntlet.’ Should the pause continue, she said, ‘they are toast’. She was critical about the report’s statement that confidence humans had caused most of the warming of the 20th Century had increased from 90 per cent in the last IPCC report in 2007 to 95 per cent. ‘How they can justify this is beyond me.’ Other ‘lukewarmer’ experts – scientists who do not ‘deny’ the world has warmed, partly in response to humans, but do not expect imminent catastrophe – were equally scathing. Prof Richard Lindzen, the Alfred P Sloan Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the IPCC had ‘truly sunk to a level of hilarious incoherence. They are proclaiming increased confidence in their models as the discrepancies between their models and observations increase.’ He added: ‘It is quite amazing to see the contortions the IPCC has to go through in order to keep the international climate agenda going.’ Bjorn Lomborg, director of the Copenhagen Consensus Center, said that since 1980, climate models had on average overstated the extent of warming by between 79 and 159 per cent. ‘This does not mean that there is not some global warming, but it likely means that temperature rises will be lower than originally expected. That fact makes alarmist scenarios ever more implausible.’ He added: ‘The EU will pay $250 billion [£166 billion] for its current climate policies each and every year until the end of the century. For almost $20 trillion, temperatures will be reduced by a negligible 0.05C.’ In Stockholm, IPCC leaders described the models as ‘more and more remarkable’, insisting that the pause has no significance. But inquiries by this newspaper have . established the report’s final version, issued on Friday after four days . and nights of intense negotiation between scientists and government . officials from 130 countries, produced a radical shift away from the . confidential ‘final draft’ of June. Insistent:IPCC leaders say their models are increasingly reliable. Pictured here, chairman Rajendra Pachauri . This had admitted: ‘Models do not generally reproduce the observed reduction in surface warming trend… There is medium confidence that this difference between models and observations is to a substantial degree caused by unpredictable  climate variability.’ Another possible factor was ‘too strong a response to increasing greenhouse gas’. In the final version, this became: ‘The long-term climate model simulations show a trend in global-mean surface temperature from 1951 to 2012 that agrees with the observed trend… There are, however, differences between simulated and observed trends over periods as short as ten to 15 years.’ The final version also tried to minimise this coded acknowledgement of the pause by saying periods as short as 15 years were ‘very sensitive to the beginning and end dates’. It said no conclusion should be drawn from the lack of warming since 1998 because this was one of the hottest years on record, while the models were ‘not expected to reproduce the timing of internal variability’. Yet the pause has lasted since January 1997, not 1998, and 1997 was not a hot year. The world invested almost a billion dollars a day to limit global warming last year, according to a recent study .","The Mail on Sunday first revealed global temperature pause a year ago .

"Stare at this black and white wheel long enough and you may see a colour appear out of nowhere. But incredibly, different people see different colours - and some may not see anything at all. Many people say they see green, others see yellow and a few see red, but exactly why this is the case has baffled scientists for decades. Scroll down for video . Stare at this illusion and you may see arcs of subtle colour, called Fechner colours, appear from nowhere . Make a spinner by drawing a circles, at least 4 inches in diameter, on cardboard. Cut the circles, making it as round as you can and poke a hole in the centre with a toothpick. Insert the toothpick into the hole. The toothpick should stick out about half an inch. Break or cut the toothpick in half. Twist the toothpick to spin the spinner. Next, download and print out one of the Benham graphics from here. You . can stick these graphics on your spinner and then use the toothpick on a . flat surface to spin the wheel and create your own illusion. The wheel is called Benham's top and it creates an illusion of colour when black and white patterns rapidly change, as reported by Casey Chan on Sploid. It is named after the Essex-born toymaker Charles Benham, who, in 1895, created a top painted with the pattern shown. When the wheel is spun, arcs of subtle colour, called Fechner colours, are visible at different areas on the surface. One theory about why people see different colours is that the receptors in the human eye respond at different rates to red, green, and blue. Benham's top is currently being researched for use as a diagnostic tool for diseases of the eye . The higher the speed, the more obvious the colour effect and reversing the wheel can also change the shade. One theory about why people see different colours is that the receptors in the human eye respond at different rates to red, green, and blue. The retina of the eye is composed of two types of receptors sensitive to light: cones and rods. Cones are important for colour vision and for seeing in bright light. There are three types of cones, each of which is most sensitive to a particular wavelength of light. ‘It is possible that the colours seen in spinning Benham disks are the result of changes that occur in the retina and other parts of the visual system,’ according to Washington University. ‘For example, the spinning disks may activate neighbouring areas of the retina differently. In other words, the black and white areas of the disk stimulate different parts of the retina.’ This response may cause a type of changes within the nervous system that creates colours, scientists believe. Another theory is that different cones stay activated for different amounts of time. This means, when the wheel is spun, the white areas activate all three types of cones, and then the black deactivates them. The sequence may cause an imbalance because the different types of cones take different times to respond, resulting in the brain producing different colours. While these theories do not explain the illusion completely, Benham's top is currently being researched for use as a diagnostic tool for diseases of the eye.","Illusion named Benham's top after Essex-born toymaker Charles Benham .

"A ban on assault weapons has been struck from the U.S. Senate's gun control bill, leaving out a major portion of gun control legislation that's due to be revealed next month. Sen Dianne Feinstein, the sponsor of the ban, announced the decision by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid today. The gun control bill will be debated by the Senate next month. Instead, Feinstein said she will be able to offer her ban on the military-style firearms as an amendment. Speaking out: Dianne Feinstein, the sponsor of the assault weapons ban, announced the decision to drop that portion of the bill . Gun rights issue: The assault weapons ban was the most controversial of the major proposals to restrict guns that have been advanced by President Obama and Senate Democrats . She is all but certain to need 60 votes from the 100-member Senate to prevail, but faces solid Republican opposition and likely defections from some moderate Democrats. 'I very much regret it,' Feinstein, a Democrat from California, told reporters of Reid's decision. 'I tried my best.' Killer: Adam Lanza used an assault rifle when he murdered 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14 . Asked about the decision, Reid said he . wanted to bring a gun bill to the full Senate that would have enough . support to overcome any GOP attempts to prevent debate from even . starting. He said that 'using the most optimistic numbers,' there were less than 40 votes for Feinstein's ban. That is far less than the 60 votes . needed to begin considering legislation, and an indication that Reid . feared that including the assault weapons ban in the main guns bill . would risk getting the votes needed to begin debate. 'I'm not going to try to put something on the floor that won't succeed. I want something that will succeed. 'I think the worst of all worlds would be to bring to something to the floor and it dies there,' Reid said. Feinstein, an author of the 1994 assault weapons ban that expired after a decade, said that fellow Democrat Reid, informed her of the decision yesterday. There are 53 Democrats in the Senate, plus two independents who usually vote with them. An assault-type weapon was used by Adam Lanza in the December massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, that revived gun control as a top issue in Washington. It was also used in the 'Dark Knight' shooting spree in Aurora, Colorado, and the deadly Christmas Eve shooting of firefighters responding to a blaze in upstate New York. Pledge: Banning assault weapons was among the proposals Obama made in January in response to the Sandy Hook killings . Procedure: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the gun control bill will face two votes after it goes up for debate next month . Banning those firearms was among the proposals President Obama made in January in response to those slayings. The assault weapons ban was the most . controversial of the major proposals to restrict guns that have been . advanced by Obama and Senate Democrats. Applications for gun permits have jumped in Newtown, Connecticut, since a school massacre there revived the national debate on gun control and led to worries about new restrictions. Newtown in recent years has issued about 130 gun permits annually. Police say the town received 79 permit applications in the three months since the December 14 massacre, more than double the normal pace. Robert Berkins, records manager for Newtown police, says many applicants have expressed concerns that their gun rights will be taken away. Firearms sales have surged around the country, driven by Washington's new focus on gun control. 20 first-graders and six adults were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School when Adam Lanza forced his way in and began opening fire in the hallway and in two classrooms. Because . of that, it had been expected that the assault weapons measure would be . left out of the initial package the Senate considers, with Democrats . hoping the Senate could therefore amass the strongest possible vote for . the overall legislation. Having . a separate vote on assault weapons might free moderate Democratic . senators facing re-election next year in Republican-leaning states to . vote against the assault weapons measure, but then support the remaining . overall package of gun curbs. Gun control supporters consider a . strong Senate vote important because the Republican-run House has shown . little enthusiasm for most of Obama's proposals. Feinstein said Reid told her there will be two votes. One would be on her assault weapons ban, which also includes a ban on ammunition magazines that carry more than 10 rounds of ammunition. The second would just be on prohibiting the high-capacity magazine clips. Many Democrats think the ban on large-capacity magazines has a better chance of getting 60 votes than the assault weapons ban. The Senate Judiciary Committee has approved four gun control measures this month, including Feinstein's barring assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. The others would expand required federal background checks for firearms buyers, increase federal penalties for illegal gun trafficking and boost school safety money.","Sen Dianne Feinstein, the sponsor of the ban, announced the decision by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid today .

And when four-year-old Isabella Williams walked up to their son Jack at a play center, they knew. 'We both knew that this was our family because Isabella was such a sweet little girl, just like Savannah,' Larry told Yahoo Parenting. The couple had spent a day scouring the city's parks, streets and cafes before deciding to take Jack for a break. 'I felt as though something was guiding us in that direction.' As soon as they saw Isabella, they went over to meet her mom Sarah, a single mother-of-five. Tragic: The couple, who have an older son called Jack, devised the plan to channel their grief into love .

The Carrolls had originally planned to raise $10,000 through the website Fundly and a campaign titled Savannah's Stolen Moment Campaign. Within weeks, donors helped them reach $96,000. They hope it will help the Williams family to afford a special trip or experience then ease the financial weight of parenthood. 'When Savvy was alive, we made a point to create spontaneous memories with her — a surprise cookie, a trip to the playground — and we'd refer to these experiences as ""Stolen Moments"",' Carroll said.

'All I wanted to do was show my wife there was a reason to go on, that there was joy in the world and, even in the most brutal moments, the world is still a beautiful place with amazing people,' Carroll told Today, as he recounted his thoughts the first night after Savannah's death. He then wrote on their website: 'I'm feeling very powerless right now.

"In the early hours of Thursday morning, a stunned Barkhad Abdi woke to the news he had been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Barkhad, a 28-year-old Somalian refugee, has won critical acclaim for his very first acting role, playing a Somali pirate in the movie Captain Phillips in which he stars opposite Hollywood A-lister Tom Hanks. His success is all the most astonishing considering he was arrested and charged for drugs possession just over a year ago - and has been sentenced to jail time twice, MailOnline can today reveal. Barkhad was born in . Mogadishu and moved to Minneapolis in Minnesota when he was 14 - and was working as a . limousine driver and also part-time at his brother's cellphone store . before he won the career-making role in Paul Greengrass's movie. Scroll down for video . Mugshot: Oscar nominee Barkhad Abdi was arrested on August 18, 2012, and charged with possession of marijuana and possession of Khat . Me & Mr Hanks: Oscar winner Tom Hanks played Captain Richard Phillips in the movie inspired by the 2009 Maersk Alabama hijacking, during which merchant mariner Captain Phillips was taken hostage by pirates in the Indian Ocean led by Abduwali Muse. The pair pose at the Golden Globes on Sunday night . But, as MailOnline has learned, Barkhad . has also been charged with a number of offenses ranging from card fraud . to giving a police officer a fraudulent name. On August 18, 2012, Barkhad was arrested by Black Hawk County Sheriff's County Office in Iowa, along with four others after cops were called to a disturbance on MM 60 near Gilberstville. A police report from the time states: 'On arrival, two subjects were holding another subject down on the ground after he had allegedly ingested a plant leave material called 'Khat' and drank a partial bottle of liquid Tylenol. 'The combination of the two caused the subject to lose control of his faculties and attempt to jump out of a moving vehicle. 'Deputies during their investigation found suspected Marijuana in the vehicle as well as a plastic baggie containing the suspected 'Khat'. Under his full name Barkhad Abdinasir Abdi, the actor and his friends were all charged with Possession of Marijuana and Possession of Khat and transported to the Black Hawk County Jail. Cops were assisted at the scene by fire departments, Waterloo Police K-9 Unit and the Tri-County Drug Task Force. The charge was later dismissed by Iowa Court. It was not the first time Barkhad had been in trouble with the law. On February 2, 2004, he was sentenced to 90 days in jail and given one year of probation for giving a police officer a false name of another person, and buying liquor aged under 21. He was also fined $1000. It is unclear how much time he actually served in prison - believed to be Clay County Jail in Minnesota. The following year, on June 1, 2005, Barkhad was charged with financial transaction card fraud and sentenced to 200 days in jail and two years probation, alongside being given a $500 fine. It is also unclear how much time he served behind bars, also at Clay County Jail. Living it up: Barkhad Abdi, 28, gets behind the wheel of a Ferrari in Hollywood . It is all a far cry to where Barkhad now finds himself: hobnobbing with Hollywood's A list as awards season has started with a vengeance. He beat off stiff competition to win the . role of real-life Somali pirate Abduwali . Muse, who led the 2009 Maersk Alabama hijacking, an incident during . which merchant mariner Captain Richard Phillips was taken hostage by . pirates in the Indian Ocean. Having won his role at an open casting call and barely realising his performance would be a hit, Barkhad even went back to working at his brother Guled Abdi's . T-Mobile shop in the 24 Mall in Minneapolis before the movie came out. He now plans to move to Los Angeles to further his career next month and has taken on an acting agent. On Sunday, Barkhad was nominated for best supporting actor at the Golden Globes - losing out to fellow Oscar hopeful Jared Leto for Dallas Buyer's Club, but was the subject of jokes from hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. Tina joked that 'The Black List' is 'who’s invited to my room tonight - I’m talking to you, Somali pirates. ‘I am the captain now!', using his signature line from the movie. Amy added: 'Before earning a Golden Globe nomination for his first ever acting role in Captain Phillips, Barkhad Abdi was working as a limousine driver in Minnesota. There's such a beautiful life lesson here, everyone: Sleep with your limo driver tonight. Before he gets famous.'

Still stunned, Barkhad spoke of his excitement at being nominated for an Oscar, telling the Wall Street Journal at the Critics' Choice Awards in Santa Monica, California, on Thursday night: 'It was shocking, honestly - I was jumping up and down.' The first-time actor is now up against Hollywood regulars Bradley Cooper, Michael Fassbender, Jared Leto, and Jonah Hill at the Academy Awards on March 2. And he said: 'My life’s been changing since this movie came out, and it’s just for the better. And it’s getting better day by day. Today’s the best you got.' He told Entertainment Weekly: 'I wasn’t sure of myself. I wasn’t a complete actor. I was just auditioning with no previous experience. Paul Greengrass gets all the credit, honestly. He’s the one that believed in me and pushed me and, any time that I messed up, he was the one that would find a way to make me understand it so I could be that character.

"It reads almost like a long-lost script of an Indiana Jones movie. But a Dutch archaeologist has claimed to have cracked the secret to a trove of Nazi gold - through a sheet of music he claims is a 'coded treasure map'. Leon Giesen, 51, has performed three digs for the loot near Mittenwald, on the Austrian border but has so far come up with nothing. X marks the score: Leon Giesen, 51, has performed three unsuccessful digs for the loot in the hills near Mittenwald (pictured), on the Austrian border, but has vowed to continue, convinced a sheet of music holds the key . He has based his searches on a single . score of recently uncovered music called 'March Impromptu' and penned by . classical composer Gottfried Federlein, who died in 1952. He believes that a lyric in the music . that reads 'Wo Matthias die Saiten Streichelt,' or 'where Matthew . plucks strings,' in fact refers to Mittenwald and one-time resident . Matthias Klotz, the town's fabled violin maker. Final orders: Adolf Hitler is said to have ordered his private secretary, Martin Bormann (right), to bury a hoard of ill-gotten bullion somewhere in the Bavarian hills during the last days of the Third Reich . Golden boy: Bormann (right) was then instructed to imbed a series of letters, figures and runes on the sheet music that would, when deciphered, lend the coordinates of the treasure . He . also believes the music contains a diagram of 'train tracks' that once . ran through Mittenwald in the 1940s, and that the score's final . sentence, 'Enden der Tanz,' which means 'end the dance' suggests the . gold is at the railway's buffer stops. It is well-known that the Nazis hid much of the gold, silver and jewels plundered during their conquests. The regime executed a policy of looting the assets of its victims to finance the war, collecting the looted assets in top-secret central depositories. Much of it included valuables confiscated from prisoners arriving at concentration camps before it was melted down into bullion. But as the war drew to a close, they desperately tried to 'make it disappear' instead of letting it fall into allied hands. Some has been found in caves or vaults (pictured) but much of it still remains unaccounted for. Some of it is even believed to have been laundered into European banks in 1945. According . to Spiegel Online, Adolf Hitler ordered his private secretary, Martin . Bormann, to bury a hoard of ill-gotten bullion somewhere in the Bavarian . hills during the last days of the Third Reich. Bormann was then instructed to imbed a . series of letters, figures and runes on the sheet music that would, . when deciphered, lend the coordinates of the treasure. The score was then supposed to be couriered to Munich. But it never arrived. Some 50 years later, Dutch journalist . Karl Hammer Kaatee came across the document and went on to perform a . series of abortive digs. But finally, with no gold in sight, he decided . to make the supposed map public. Giesen has found pockets of 'anomalous' metals, but is yet to find anything of real value. He is convinced, however, that his hunt will not be in vain and is trying to raise the funds for another dig. 'It's like a treasure map that can't be deciphered,' Jürgen Proske, a German historian, told Speigel. 'It could be a treasure chest. But it could just be a manhole cover.'","Leon Giesen, 51, believes Nazis buried gold near Mittenwald, in Austria .

"Chelsea take on Tottenham at Wembley Stadium on Sunday as the two sides go head-to-head for the Capital One Cup trophy. The Blues fell to a surprise 5-3 defeat against Spurs on New Year's Day as Tottenham striker Harry Kane helped his side earn all three points at White Hart Lane. Jose Mourinho's side will be hoping to exact revenge against Tottenham after losing to their London rivals in the League Cup final in 2008. Here, Sportsmail compares the two predicted line-ups for Sunday's clash. Chelsea face Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final on Sunday at Wembley Stadium . Jose Mourinho's side take on Mauricio Pochettino's Spurs side in the first domestic cup final of the season . Diego Costa and Harry Kane will be hoping to fire their respective sides to Capital One Cup glory . Thibaut Courtois 8.5 . Hugo Lloris 9 . Belgian shotstopper Courtois has done well since finally donning gloves for Chelsea after a loan spell at Atletico Madrid which saw him become Europe's hottest property. However, a few recent mistakes have seen him rotated with Blues stalwart Petr Cech. In Lloris, Spurs have the finished article. The Frenchman is one of the most sought-after keepers on the continent and vies with David de Gea for the title of the Premier League's finest No 1. Chelsea's Thibaut Courtois and Tottenham's Hugo Lloris are among the best keepers in the Premier League . Branislav Ivanovic 8 . Kyle Walker 7 . To be the fiercest competitor in this Chelsea team takes some doing, but Ivanovic is just that. His never-say-die attitude is only matched by his uncanny ability to pop up with crucial goals. Once one of the premier talents in English football, Walker must work on his defending if he is to become the real deal. However, his attacking from full back remains a real threat and a pinpoint cross from him could decide the final. Branislav Ivanovic is an important member of Jose Mourinho's side while Kyle Walker is back to full fitness . Gary Cahill 7 . Eric Dier 7 . England centre half Cahill has come in for flak this season, shipping quite a few goals through errors - notably against Spurs on New Year's Day. He remains a solid presence on his day but it's touch and go whether him or Kurt Zouma will get the nod. Youngster Dier has seen off the challenges of Vladimir Chiriches and Younes Kaboul to become Tottenham's first-choice centre half. The threat of Diego Costa, however, will be the ultimate test. Gary Cahill's form has dipped this season while Eric Dier has wormed his way into Spurs' first team . John Terry 9 . Jan Vertonghen 8 . Chelsea's evergreen skipper has continued his impeccable form under Jose Mourinho. Still the best centre half in the Premier League, if he has is hands on the trophy come Sunday you suspect he'll have more to do with it than anyone. Vertonghen has been more inconsistent than his first season at the Lane, but remains Tottenham's defensive rock on his good days. John Terry will be hoping to lift the cup, while Jan Vertonghen is out to win his first trophy at Spurs . Cesar Azpilicueta 8 . Danny Rose 7 . Englishman Rose has drawn criticism for his defensive work despite his attacking presence and ability to grab a goal, while Azpilicueta is the polar opposite. The converted right back has been one of Jose Mourinho's most consistent performers. Cesar Azpilicueta and Danny Rose are both expected to start at left back for their respective sides . Ramires 7.5 . Nabil Bentaleb 7 . Nemanja Matic's suspension is terrible news for Chelsea, the big Serb being the cornerstone of Mourinho's side. While a vastly different player, the experience and pace of Ramires is handy to call on. Bentaleb is just one of a host of Spurs youngsters to come into the side and efficiently make a first team spot his own. Ramires will fill in for the suspended Nemanja Matic, while Nabil Bentaleb is expected to get the nod . Cesc Fabregas 8.5 . Mousa Dembele 8 . Arsenal fans were beside themselves when their former favourite son returned to the capital in blue, and Fabregas' role as Chelsea's creative master have shown why, even if recent performances have waned. Dembele is one of several Pochettino success stories, a hugely adept technical and physical presence in the Spurs midfield. Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas will go head-to-head against Tottenham's Mousa Dembele . Willian 8 . Andros Townsend 7 . Tireless Willian has been one of Chelsea's leading lights over the past couple of months, surely to the chagrin of new signing Juan Cuadrado. Fans often want more end product from the Brazilian, but he's one of the first names on Mourinho's teamsheet. Townsend has overcome a poor 12 months after emerging as one of England's brightest hopes, but questions still remain over his consistency and ability in big games. Willian is expected to start ahead of Juan Cuadrado, while Andros Townsend could pose a threat on the wing . Oscar 8 . Christian Eriksen 8.5 . Eriksen has been one of the players of the season, his vision, creativity and eye for goal constantly digging Spurs out of a hole with partner in crime Harry Kane. Brazilian Oscar struggles slightly with consistency in this Chelsea side, but on his day will be man of the match. His all action displays in the No 10 role belie his tender years and scream 'Mourinho player'. Oscar and Christian Eriksen are two of the best playmakers in the Premier League . Eden Hazard 9.5 . Erik Lamela 7 . Hazard is one of the finest players in the world and in full flow the best to watch in the Premier League, with most of Chelsea’s attacking play being driven by him. Lamela has improved under Pochettino but still looks a far cry from what Tottenham expected for £30million . Eden Hazard and Erik Lamela have the potential to win the match for their side by producing a piece of magic . Diego Costa 8.5 . Harry Kane 8.5 . Two of the stars of the season, local boy come good Kane has lit up the scoring charts and put Chelsea to the sword on New Year’s Day. In Costa, however, the Blues have a behemoth, capable of terrorising defences with a frightening mix of tenacity, physicality and scoring prowess. Costa and Kane have scored goals for fun during the course of the season . CHELSEA 90.5/110 . TOTTENHAM 84/110 .","Chelsea face Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final on Sunday .

"An advertising agency has hit upon a unique way of catching the attention of people living in ad-saturated Tokyo - use women's thighs as a living billboard. Consumers in the Japanese megalopolis are notoriously hard to reach because of the sheer abundance of billboards, neon signs and huge TV screens pumping out commercials, so the WIT agency decided to put ads on a place men are happy to pay attention to. 'It's an absolutely perfect place to put an advertisement as it's what guys are eager to look at and girls are OK to expose,' said Hidenori Atsumi, the CEO of WIT. Scroll down for video . Thigh finance: Girls in Tokyo are renting out their thighs as advertising space . The CEO of the ad agency says women are comfortable with exposing their thighs and men like staring at them . And it's proving popular - so far more than 3,000 women have signed up to the scheme, which uses temporary tattoos of products or company logos. One of them is Miho Matsumoto, who says she is comfortable with the unusual marketing method. She said: 'I wouldn't do this of they put it on my belly or other places I'm embarassed to expose but if it's on my chubby thighs then what's the problem? ITV reports that in order to be a walking billboard, participants must be 18-years-old and are required to have at least 20 friends on social media networks. A pair of attractive Japanese women walk around Tokyo with the ads on their thighs . Leg man: The unorthodox marketing scheme is the brainchild of Hidenori Atsumi, a public relations consultant . Products are emblazoned on the women using temporary tattoos . The girls can wear what they like, but WIT suggests that participants wear short skirts and high socks in order to draw attention to the ad. They can earn up to £65 per day. American rock band Green Day and the Seth MacFarlane film 'Ted' have already been seen thigh-high in the Japanese capital, and many more companies are believed to be interested. Selling ad space is nothing new. In 2005, American Karolyne Smith was paid £6500 by GoldenPalace.com, an internet casino renowned for outrageous advertising, to permanently tattoo its website address on her forehead. She said that she did it to raise funds for her son's private school tuition. The girls can wear what they like, but are encouraged to don short skirts and high socks in order to draw attention to the ad. They can earn up to £65 per day .
